 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 NDTV fixes price band at Rs 63-70
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Roy: Breaking the market story																								Mumbai, April 13: NDTV today launched the roadshow for its initial public offering. The price band has been fixed at Rs 63-70 per share.																								Its a bit of a nostalgic moment. Exactly a year ago, we launched this channel and we were starting from scratch, NDTV chairman Pranoy Roy said.																								Analysts said the price band is slightly on the higher side. However, the issue is expected to sail through as the markets are bullish.																								Moreover, shares of the television companies have firmed up on the bourses in the last few months. TV Today shares stand at Rs 140.60 against an issue price of Rs 95, while TV 18 is quoting at Rs 234.55 and Zee TV at Rs 144.45 for a face value of Re 1.																								NDTV is considering several options to grow its business. It is exploring the possibility of new channels and fee-based services to tap emerging business opportunities in the news broadcasting sector.																								NDTV produces some entertainment programmes but the major focus would continue to be news broadcasting, Roy said.																								The foray into the primary market to raise Rs 109 crore will allow some of the venture capital investors to exit. GS Television Holdings, GS Media Holdings, GS Communications Holdings, Saffron Fund, J P Morgan Fleming and SBI Capital Markets will sell their stake through the IPO.																								We are planning this IPO because we are confident that we are long-term players, Roy said.																								The gap between Aaj Tak and NDTVs Hindi news channel has narrowed substantially, he said. Citing Tam figures that track the popularity of television channels, Roy said NDTV 24x7 (English news channel) reaches an audience of 19.5 million, while NDTV India (Hindi news channel) 29.1 million.																								Roy declined to specify future projections in line with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations regarding companies going public. 																								Asked about plans for joining payment channel alliance, Roy said, We expect a growth in subscription services and will explore prospects in this sector.																								Currently the entire revenues of media entity, running 24x7 and NDTV India channels, were from advertising, he added.																								We are going to take big steps in the future, he said, adding that the growth is much higher this year.																								NDTV also provides programming content for entertainment channels like Zee and Star TV, and may look at more such deals in the coming months. We believe that the viewer wants an indepth analysis of news, Roy said. 																								We have always been a pioneer and have changed the look of news television in the country, he added.																								NDTV recorded a total revenue of Rs 103.02 crore and a profit of Rs 20.66 crore in financial year 2003, according to consolidated financial statements. In April-December, NDTV recorded a revenue of Rs 45.95 crore and a loss of Rs 47.53 crore.																								Roy cited industry surveys showing NDTV catching up with Aaj Tak. While Aaj Tak has 98 items among the top 200 news programmes, NDTV has reached 64 from nil, he said.

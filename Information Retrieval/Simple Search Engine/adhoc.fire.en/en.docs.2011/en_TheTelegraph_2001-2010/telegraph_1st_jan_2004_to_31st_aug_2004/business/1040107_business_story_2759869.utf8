																								London, Jan 6 (PTI): The UK-based Barclays Bank has reached an agreement with finance trade union UNIFI on outsourcing of jobs to India and compensating the affected employees. 																								Under the groundbreaking deal, 2,000 of free career retraining for up to 1,000 employees whose jobs are sent offshore will be provided. Those whose jobs are sent offshore will be entitled to six months off work with full pay. The bank is spending 250,000 pounds a year on a five-man human resources redeployment team to organise voluntary redundancies, its spokesman said today. 																								The bank is striving to avoid compulsory job cuts by offering voluntary severance to staff working within 90 kms of an operation being off-shored. 																								Barclays also said it could move 250 more jobs to Mumbai and Chennai in addition to the 250 that it relocated last year.

 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 HHI plans Rs 36cr public issue 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 3: Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) plans to hit the market with an initial public offer worth Rs 36 crore next month to fund the acquisition of three hotels.																								The company is buying three-star properties in Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad. The investment in each hotel would be about Rs 30 crore. The deal for the 176-room hotel in Bangalore has already been finalised but the company refused to divulge the name.																								We plan to finance the total investment of Rs 90 crore through a mix of debt and equity in the ratio of 3:2. We have already made the financial arrangement with the banks and plan to go for the public issue by next month, said D. K. Jaiswal, chairman and managing director, HHI group of hotels. 																								At present, the group has two properties  a five-star property in Calcutta and a four-star property in Varanasi. According to Jaiswal, cost of operations in a five-star property is much more than a three-star property. Moreover, it is possible to get returns on investment in three-star properties within a period of four to five years.																								The company is also building a five-star hotel on Varga beach in south Goa and the total investment in this greenfield project will be Rs 100 crore. But that is not included in the amount of the initial public offer and the finance for that project has already been arranged, Jaiswal said. 																								HHI is further investing around Rs 12 crore in the makeover of the property in Calcutta. It includes increasing banquet facilities, upgrading the swimming pool, refurbishing four floors, constructing the first-ever lounge bar of the city and setting up a coffee shop with an interactive kitchen. The whole turnaround project is expected to be completed by December.																								In the last three to four years, business in Calcutta has grown and this has spurred demand for hotel rooms, Jaiswal said. Moreover, the demand for banquets has also seen an uptake with increasing number of marriage parties now being held in hotels, he added. 																								Of the total revenue of Rs 30 crore earned by the hotel, around Rs 10 crore is contributed by banquets. This has led the group to increase the total area under the banquet facility to 12,000 sq.ft from 3,500 sq.ft. 																								The hotel now has 186 rooms with an occupancy rate of 69 per cent and an average room rate of Rs 2,800-3,000. The company also plans to start a Regency HHI Institute of Hotel Management and a catering technology institute with affiliation from an Australian University.

 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Indian Oil to pump up overseas sales
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, June 13: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has set an export target of Rs 10,000 crore. The figure, to be worked at over two years, is higher than Rs 1,500 crore in 2002-03. Figures for 2003-04 have not been released.																								In volume terms, the company has set its sights on ramping up overseas sales by two-and-a-half times from last financial years level of 1.79 million tonnes.																								We are targeting export of surplus petroleum products to the tune of four million tonnes by March, and over five million tonnes next fiscal, company sources said.																								The state-owned refiner and the largest producer of petroleum products is in talks with several oil trading companies in the neighbouring countries, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.																								IOC jacked up export of petroleum products to Sri Lanka to 1.5 million tonnes in 2003-04, while making forays into Maldives, Bangladesh and Mauritius.																								Last year, it entered into a one-year contract for exporting 30,000 tonnes of diesel and 10,000 tonnes of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) every month to Sri Lanka. 																								The company has struck a deal with Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to export additional 2,40,000 tonnes of diesel and aviation fuel to the island nation in the first half of the current fiscal.																								An agreement has also been signed to sell 2.2 lakh tonnes of petro products to Bangladesh Petroleum this year. 																								IOC has decided to raise its Nepal sales to more than one million tonnes in the current financial year. Maldives and Mauritius could also start buying from it soon. In Thailand, it is eyeing a small or mid-sized marketing firm to be used as an entry vehicle. 																								A senior IOC executive said the export-driven growth strategy is the result of a realisation that an anticipated oil glut at home could drag down the growth of all companies in the short and medium terms.

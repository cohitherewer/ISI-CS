 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Joint charter in will wrangle
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Calcutta, Aug. 16: Its the word of one will against another. The Birlas are ready to present this week a will purportedly penned by M. P. Birla and his wife Priyamvada.																								They will seek to have the 1982 joint will probated (authenticated) through a petition in Calcutta High Court. Though not registered, the document is clear that MP Birla group assets would go to charity, sources said. 																								The family has decided to ignore Priyamvadas will, which, Lodha claims, was drafted in 1999 and names him as the sole successor of MP Birla group properties. Supporting documents and witnesses will be furnished to back the joint will, said a source close to Birla Park. 																								The Birlas are contesting the claim of Lodha, who has filed one petition in high court to have the will probated, and another to get the caveats by Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad and Yashovardhan, quashed. The four Birlas want Lodha halted in his attempts to win legal sanctity for the will. 																								On August 25, Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta will hear Lodhas plea to have the Birla quartets caveats thrown out.																								Precisely who from the Birla clan will file the petition and when is not known, though . G. Khaitan, the solicitor for the family, will move in a day or two as preparations are over. The Birlas themselves would not confirm plans to lodge a suit over the joint will.																								A city-based legal expert said the move would add a new dimension to the inheritance controversy. The two probate petitions  one for Priyamvadas will and the other for the joint document  will be heard simultaneously. The court will examine whether Priyamvadas will retained the spirit of the joint draft, he added. 																								Though the Birla family is closely guarding the contents of the joint will and the arguments it will use to authenticate it, there are indications that questions will be raised over Priyamvadas mental health. 																								My sister was not keeping well since she had a kidney transplant in 1981. She was under heavy medication and even her movements were restricted, said Kashinath Tapadia, Priyamvadas brother and a Calcutta-based businessman who is rallying behind the Birlas in the court battle.																								He insisted he is not interested in the properties his sister controlled until she passed it on to R. S. Lodha in her purported will. My sister and brother-in-law had always maintained that their assets would go to charity. I have joined the Birlas in trying to fulfil their last wish.																								Last Thursday, the Birlas, along with their friends, filed in Calcutta High Court a suit for the appointment of a receiver who would look after the assets of the MP Birla group while legal skirmishes in the inheritance battle continue. 																								K. K. Birla, G. P. Birla, Kashinath Tapadia and Pradip Kumar Khaitan are party to the petition, which is primarily aimed at keeping R. S. Lodha from interfering with the assets that have been left to him in Priyamvadas purported will.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 SAIL feels the heat on coal imports 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rungta: Tough times																								Calcutta, June 17: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) will have to shell out Rs 1,200 crore more to import coal this year. International coal majors, including BHP Billiton and Anglo Coal of Australia, have jacked up prices by over 20 per cent.																								However, despite a rise in input costs, SAIL is unlikely to raise prices in the short term.																								The pricing mechanism does not depend on the input cost analysis because it is now completely market-driven, SAIL director (commercial) S. K. Rungta said at a meeting with steel consumers in the city. The meeting was organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.																								Hence, it is difficult to say that the steel prices will increase simply because the input costs are rising, he said.																								SAIL imports about 65 per cent of its total coking coal requirement. The company had to fork out over Rs 2,500 crore last year to import 7.5 million tonnes of coking coal. It had also bought around 3.5 million tonnes from Coal India. The companys total coal bill added up to Rs 4,400 crore, a SAIL spokesperson said.																								This year SAIL needs around 9 million tonnes of imported coal while around 4 million tonnes will be bought from domestic companies.																								Coking coal prices have been rising over the past few months because of the demand-supply mismatch. Moreover, China  a major coking coal exporting country  has almost stopped selling abroad.																								SAIL has already suffered a 12 per cent production loss in the first two months. Rungta hopes that with the coal crisis over, it will make up for the loss in the next three quarters.

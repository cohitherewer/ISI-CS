 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Push to enlarge tax-free income 
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURYNew Delhi, July 2: The Congress-led government is under pressure from its own party members to raise the floor level for income tax to Rs 1,00,000 from a current Rs 50,000 to satisfy the urban middle class, which in the last elections switched over to supporting the new ruling alliance.																								But then hardly any finance minister is ever willing to let millions of potential taxpayers slip out of his database and P. Chidambaram is unlikely to be an exception, despite the boldness he otherwise displays in fiscal management.																								The government is consequently toying with three options: a mix of raising the floor limit and raising the standard deduction  a tax-free allowance given to salaried taxpayers; raising the tax-free income limit alone and last just raising the standard deduction.																								The second option, which is most likely to be followed, could see the standard deduction which stands at a current level of Rs 30,000 for those earning up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20,000 for those earning more, going up by a third. 																								The tax-free income limit could go up by about 20 per cent. 																								The Congressmens plea is that raising the floor limit will reduce paperwork and amount to very little in terms of monetary giveaways. Most salaried people in any case invest in specified saving bonds to ensure that their first one lakh income is free of taxes. By making this easier, the government will actually be encouraging higher spending levels by middle-class taxpayers.																								We do want to make life easier for the common man and we will be asking our government to consider measures like this, said Satyavrat Chaturvedi, Congress spokesperson. 																								The Left too has long been clamouring for an increase in the tax-free income limit and should be happy that at least on e of its demands is being conceded. Top sources said the decision on this element in the budget was taken to try give a populist face to the reforms programme.																								Economists and the revenue department had actually been demanding something similar but not exactly the same. They wanted to do away with standard deduction altogether while raising the income tax limit, something that the Kelkar committee on tax rationalisation set up by the BJP-led government wanted to do. But obviously this did not suit the government.																								Similarly, the Kelkar committees recommendations that housing tax sops should be curtailed is being ignored because this is considered impolitic besides going against the governments desire to encourage a housing boom. Housing sops which allow mortgage interest up to Rs 1.5 lakh to be deductible for tax purposes will consequently be retained.																								In order to tailor the budget to be more supportive of senior citizens, the government is also likely to announce an interest income protection scheme which would allow them to maintain their current standard of living inspite of falling interest rates and rising inflation. 																								This is likely to be done through an inflation-linked interest income scheme to be unveiled with the budget.

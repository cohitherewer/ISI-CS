The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Core funding rules put in place
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Awaiting a facelift 																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: In its guidelines on private-public partnership in infrastructure projects, the government today stipulated that private partners will have to stump up 80 per cent of the money in such ventures.																								These projects can be in various sectors  railways, roads, seaports, airports and power.																								It also stipulates that firms, which take up the construction, maintenance or operation of these projects, should have at least 40 per cent private equity, a move which bars most state-run infrastructure firms from bidding as implementing contractors for the projects.																								Top finance ministry officials said, The total central government money earmarked for such projects stands at a measly Rs 1,500 crore and we know most state government finances are in a bad shape. So, naturally we have to depend on private sector firms to spend most of the money  whether through equity contribution or loans.																								The maximum share of funding that the government has consequently reserved for itself, state governments and central and state agencies is thus 20 per cent.																								But infrastructure funding needs stand at a far higher figure. Officials estimate that the current level of infrastructure investment has to increase from Rs 55,000 crore to about Rs 1,50,000 crore annually.																								Many fear that the private sector could balk at the prospect of putting up 80 per cent of the costs even if it calls the shots. Ultimately, the central government may be forced to increase outlays for such projects.																								It is interesting that these guidelines have come even as the group of ministers is to meet on privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, which are to be modernised and expanded by private bidders who will own up to 74 per cent in these two airports.																								The projects to be covered under this new public-private partnership guidelines will include projects in the areas of water supply, sewerage and solid-waste disposal in urban areas and international convention centres.																								Officials, however, made it clear that these fast-track projects will still be vetted or endorsed by the ministries concerned and that the implementing agency must be selected through a transparent and open competitive process with viability gap support being one of the bid parameter.																								The viability gap funding may take various forms, including but not limited to capital grant, subordinated loans, operation and maintenance support grant or interest subsidy.																								A mix of capital and revenue support may also be considered, officials said. The funding will be disbursed according to agreed milestones as detailed in funding agreements. Project proposals may be posed  either by a central ministry or a state government or urban  local body, which owns the assets that are to be developed,  or a private party.

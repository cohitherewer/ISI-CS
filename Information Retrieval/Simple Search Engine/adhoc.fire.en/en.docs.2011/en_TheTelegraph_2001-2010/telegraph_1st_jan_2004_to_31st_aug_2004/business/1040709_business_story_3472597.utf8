 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Higher plan spending to fuel growth
 S P S PANNU			New Delhi, July 8: Finance minister P. Chidambarams budget aims at pushing up the economic growth rate with a 20 per cent increase in plan expenditure to Rs 1,45,590 crore, up from the revised estimate of Rs 1,21,507 crore in the Vajpayee governments budget for 2003-04.																								Despite a 25 per cent increase in projected tax collections, the fiscal deficit is budgeted at Rs 1,37,407 crore, which is Rs 5,304 crore more than the revised estimate of Rs 1,32,103 crore for 2003-04. 																								Chidambaram has drawn consolation from the fact that the deficit as a proportion of GDP is expected to be lower at 4.4 per cent in 2004-05 compared with the revised estimate of 4.8 per cent in 2003-04. Senior finance ministry officials said this reflected the strong macroeconomic fundamentals.																								Another positive feature is that non-plan expenses are slated to fall to Rs 3,32,239 crore this fiscal which is 6 per cent lower than the revised estimate of Rs 3,52,478 crore in 2003-04. However, it remains to be seen whether non-productive spending remains at this level.																								On the flip side, the Centres borrowings are expected to go up to Rs 1,37,407 crore this year compared with the revised estimate of Rs 1,32,103 crore a year ago.																								Interest payment liabilities have been budgeted at Rs 1,29,500 crore, higher than the revised estimate of Rs 1,24,555 crore during 2003-04 and constitute as much as 23 per cent of the total expenditure. Defence and subsidies will account for another 14 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. In short, these non-development activities will absorb as much as 45 per cent of the total resources of the government.																								In absolute terms, the subsidy bill is set to come down marginally to Rs 43,516 crore this fiscal as the Centre has decided to reduce the outlay for cooking gas and kerosene by close to Rs 1,000 crore. The oil companies are likely to bear this burden. The allocation for food and fertiliser subsidy, however, has been raised.																								Tax revenues have been budgeted at Rs 2,33,906 crore in this year, about 25 per cent higher than the revised estimate of Rs 1,87,539 crore a year ago.																								Interest payments will amount to Rs 7,907 crore compared with Rs 7,548 crore a year ago. Despite measures to ensure fiscal prudence, the government will have to borrow Rs 1,37,407 crore this fiscal, virtually to pay interests on its previous loans. The total borrowing and other liabilities of the centre are expected to be 4.0 per cent higher at Rs 1,37,407 crore, compared to Rs 1,32,103 crore in 2003-04.

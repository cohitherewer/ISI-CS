 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Qualcomm roots for spectrum hike 
 M RAJENDRAN				 	 Fair connection																								New Delhi, June 27: Qualcomm, the US-based pioneer of the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology for mobile phones, is lobbying the telecom regulator to allocate additional spectrum so that operators like Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom can spruce up their services.																								The subscribers of these operators have been complaining about bad voice quality and call drops. 																								The telecom operators had attributed this problem to the lack of spectrum and had approached the telecom regulator seeking additional spectrum.																								A team of senior executives consisting of technical experts, including Charles E. Wheatley, the co-developer of CDMA technology, met the officials of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to highlight the need to provide additional spectrum to these operators.																								The current allocation of spectrum is inadequate to serve the demand for voice services. The regulator should allocate adequate spectrum so that operators can provide a reasonable grade of service, Qualcomm senior vice-president (technology) Charles E. Wheatley told The Telegraph.																								The Qualcomm executives impressed upon the Trai members that this will help the market to determine which technology is better. They also stressed the need to ensure equal distribution of spectrum to operators using CDMA and global system for mobile communications (GSM) technologies.																								I feel that to end the discrimination, both the technologies should get equal amount of spectrum and any existing disparity should be removed. This will help the operators grow their networks and meet public demand for affordable and high-quality voice and date services, said Wheatley.																								Based on the size and population of this country and the demand forecast of 100 million subscribers by 2005, large operators with nationwide footprint should have a minimum of 10+10 megahertz of spectrum, he added.																								The Qualcomm executive also highlighted to Trai the associated benefits that will flow from the release of additional spectrum to the operators. The growth of data services will spur economic expansion, create opportunities of growth in manufacturing of telecommunications equipment and growth in telecom service area both in high-tech and support services.																								China has become one of the leading manufacturers of telecom equipment in recent years due to the growing demand in that country for handsets and infrastructure, said Wheatley.																								Wheatley has also suggested to Trai that in order to dissuade spectrum hoarding, the regulator can set an appropriate spectrum cap. Any allocation of spectrum beyond the cap should be based on a pre-defined set of rules.																								However, he said, Allocation of large blocks of spectrum is necessary since it gives the operator an increased flexibility to better meet the needs of its subscribers. It would also encourage the operators to seek ways to become more efficient.																								On the importance of technology neutrality, an issue that rocked US and European countries, Wheatley has suggested that the regulator must maintain policies and incentives that are agnostic in terms of the technology used to provide service.

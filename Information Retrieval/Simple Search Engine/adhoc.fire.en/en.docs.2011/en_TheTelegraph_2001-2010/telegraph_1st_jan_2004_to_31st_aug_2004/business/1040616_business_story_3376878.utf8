 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Roadmap drawn up for subsidy rejig
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURYNew Delhi, June 15: The Congress-led government, which today announced a hike in cooking gas prices, will re-target other subsidies in order to reduce the fiscal deficit.																								The government will also present a long-term plan to reduce subsidies, which currently account for Rs 50,000 crore every year, in its attempt to reduce revenue deficit to zero within five years. The report will be placed in Parliament in the second half of the budget session, which reconvenes after August 15.																								At the same time, the government will be giving a big push to farm sector investments. It will also give a fillip to foreign investment in Indian companies. 																								Food and fertiliser subsidies will be re-targeted while ensuring that farmers do not end up paying more for inputs or earn less by selling grains to government agencies.																								The government wants to shift grain silos to food-scarce areas and cut down excess stock holdings in north India. This move alone is expected to save the government about Rs 5,000 crore from the Rs 24,000-crore food subsidy bill. Fine-tuning of the contentious fertiliser subsidy is expected to save another Rs 2,000 crore. 																								New schemes are also likely to bring grains to the poor, even as the middle class will be charged economic rates. All this may not form part of the budget but rather the long-term subsidy re-targeting plan to be presented in Parliament.																								Procurement policies will also be changed so that foodgrain is bought from neglected states in the east and south. 																								Kerosene prices, which have not been touched so far, may be adjusted at a later date if oil prices tend to remain sharply upwards. 																								The government also wants to pump-prime farm sector growth through huge dollops of public investment in agriculture even as it encourages private funding in the sector and improves credit delivery. 																								Investments will be used to bring in new technology into farming, improving irrigation facilities and increasing credit offtake. 																								Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank are likely to be tapped for cheap loans to develop irrigation and farm infrastructure such as cold store chains.																								The cooperative banking sector will be overhauled and past bad loans will be written off in order to give a fresh thrust to farm credit. The government will try to double the flow of credit to farms within three years, with special schemes for small and marginal farmers. High-cost farm loans will be retired against fresh low-cost ones. 																								The government estimates that less than 40 per cent of all farmers have been able to access the cheap credit facility offered by Kisan credit cards and will work to enlarge the coverage to the remaining 60 per cent. 																								It also wants to take steps to encourage investment both from domestic and foreign investors. A separate investment commission is in the offing but it is unlikely to be part of the Planning Commission.

 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Steel subsidies likely to stay
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, March 29: Steel subsidies are likely to stay for a few more years even as the government is preparing a policy note to put a safety net for the domestic sector.																								According to steel ministry sources, the government feels that the prevailing subsidies cannot be withdrawn overnight leaving the industry in the lurch.																								In the forthcoming Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation (OECD) meet, India is going to demand that subsidies should be there till the domestic consumption is below world average, a source said.																								Differences have emerged between developed nations and others with the latter insisting that there should be no prohibition on the capacity of a steel-making unit, sources added.																								In India and China, many steel units have manufacturing capacities below the norms set by the World Trade Organisation. But they hold important positions in the steel market due to a scarcity of large steel plants.																								Sources said the subsidy regime should be seen as a basic parameter for the small units to be able to go for a consolidation and achieve scale of economies.																								Currently, Indias per capita consumption of steel is 30 kgs, while that of the US and Japan is over 400 kgs.																								According to the steel ministrys perception, Indias per capita consumption of steel should grow at least by 10 per cent over the next few financial years.																								Sources said if that happens, consolidation in the domestic industry is bound to come with the WTO-stipulated capacity being achieved by most of the units.																								To turn the subsidy issue in its favour, India is trying to team up with Brazil and China, which have also been facing the same problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 BSE chief executive puts in his papers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vaish: Calling it a day																								Mumbai, June 14: Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) executive director and chief executive officer Manoj Vaish, the man who steered the bourse through difficult and tumultuous times, has resigned.																								Vaish submitted his resignation to pursue his professional interests, a BSE statement said today.																								The governing board of the exchange has accepted the resignation. However, Vaish will remain with the BSE till the end of September.																								Vaish, prior to his appointment as CEO, had held significant posts in the exchange as director, training and research, director corporate development and deputy executive director. He is the first CEO of the exchange.																								Before joining BSE, he had worked with ANZ Grindlays Bank and Deutsche Bank.																								It was during his tenure that the over 100-year old exchange saw a transition of power from broker members to professional managers who now hold its reins. During his tenure, BSE managed to hold its own against its main rival National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the cash segment. His major drawback has been BSEs failure to make an impact in the derivatives segment where NSE continues to be the undisputed market leader.																								His tenure saw a trend where many companies delisted from regional exchanges, but continued to retain their listing on BSE and NSE. His credit also lies in setting up trading hubs in Calcutta and New Delhi, extending the BSE footprint to centres where existing regional exchanges were weak.																								In the last three years, the exchange came out reasonably unscathed under his leadership as several instances of market abuse dented the image of exchanges.

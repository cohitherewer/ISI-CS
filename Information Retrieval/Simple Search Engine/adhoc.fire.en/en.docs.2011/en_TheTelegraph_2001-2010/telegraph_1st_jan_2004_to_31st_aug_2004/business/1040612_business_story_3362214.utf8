 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Move to bring down Cenvat to 14%, widen service tax
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, June 11: A high-level meeting of secretaries is considering lowering the central value-added tax (Cenvat) rate from the current level of 16 per cent to 14 per cent on manufactured goods. It will also chalk out and indicate in this budget a timeframe of three to five years within which the rate will be reduced to 10 per cent, in line with Asean competitors.																								The logic behind reducing the average tax level on manufactured goods stems from the empirical evidence that successive lowering of taxes on manufactured goods since the economy started to liberalise in 1991 have led to an economic boom and this has meant more tax collections.																								A note prepared on this issue (D. No Ec.Ad/1/13/2004-TFP dated June 4, 2004) after a discussion between the finance ministry and Udyog Bhawan says, The growth rate of toiletries, white goods and automobiles, following a reduction in excise rates, has been so large that there has been a greater-than-normal growth in tax revenues in spite of the reduction in tax rates. This characteristic of demand in the Indian economy needs to be used to propel the economy forward.																								While tax on manufactured goods, which contribute just 17.1 per cent of the GDP and pay up roughly 60 per cent of all indirect taxes, may come down, the service sector, which accounts for 50 per cent of the GDP and pays just 3.2 per cent of central taxes, will now have to pay more.																								This is likely to be through a massive expansion of the categories of service tax. The government, in fact, plans to bring all services under the Cenvat scheme, rather than continue with a separate structure of non-vatable service taxes on a few select services that cause economic distortions.																								At the same time, the government will indicate a time frame to move towards a nation-wide VAT rate as the total incidence of tax on manufactured goods on an average now works out to nearly 30 per cent, after adding a 12.5 per cent average sales tax. 																								If the excise duty is reduced to achieve Asean levels of indirect taxes, reduction of prices of manufactured goods from 130 per cent to say 120 per cent could trigger a demand boom, which could propel the economy into the big league, the note said.																								The government believes that lowering the cost of manufactured goods will also mean India will turn more competitive in the world arena. This, in turn, will help India Inc face competition from imports in the domestic market on a more equal footing. 																								Besides, this could transform India into an efficient world supplier of industrial products to the global market-place.																								About 80 per cent of world trade is in manufactured goods and India needs to tap into this in a bigger way if it wants to increase its share of global trade from the current 0.8 per cent.																								Senior officials believe that because India is trying to join various free trade and preferential trade pacts, it becomes imperative that manufactured goods are taxed at rates similar to that of neighbouring Asean nations.																								It is desirable to announce a target of reaching Asean levels of composite VAT in the same manner as the announcement of reaching Asean levels of customs duty as otherwise imports will out-price domestic goods. Asean countries have for long been enjoying a composite vatable domestic duty as well as customs duty of 10-12 per cent, they said.

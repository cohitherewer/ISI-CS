The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Shining campaign
																								Even as prices rule high in the market, steel-makers are planning a joint television and outdoor campaign to sell steel around the theme the magic of steel.																								The campaign, the brainchild of Ogilvy amp; Mather and top steel firm publicists, will see up to three television commercials which will sell the magic of steel and point out how it is superior to competing materials like plastics. 																								The entire campaign tab of Rs 5 crore will be borne by the steel majors  Tata Steel, SAIL, Ispat, Essar and Jindals.																								There have been generic campaigns in the past to promote steel, notably by Tata Steel and SAIL. Tata Steels ad line was: We also make steel, while SAIL had a plug that read: There is a little bit of SAIL in everybodys life.

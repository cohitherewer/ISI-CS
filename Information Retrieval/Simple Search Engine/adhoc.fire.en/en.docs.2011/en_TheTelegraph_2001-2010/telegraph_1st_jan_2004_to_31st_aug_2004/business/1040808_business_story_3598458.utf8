																								Bangalore, Aug. 7 (PTI): German carmaker DaimlerChrysler will outsource from India infotech services and auto components valued at over $100 million this year, a top company official said today.																								Daimler plants in Europe source infotech services and auto components directly from suppliers in India and nearly 80 per cent is done from here in Bangalore, DaimlerChrysler India CEO and managing director Hans-Michael Huber told reporters here at the launch of the new Mercedes Benz C class range.																								He said about one-third of the $100 million outsourcing by the global plants of Daimler, which produces Benz cars, is software services, with the rest being auto parts.																								Last year, the firm outsourced IT and components valued at $85 million from India.																								At present, Huber said, most of the auto kits in Daimlers vehicles had components produced in Europe, adding, this situation can change in the next five to six years with the company looking at sourcing components from China, India, east Europe and Latin America.																								Huber said about eight to 10 infotech firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, were providing services to Daimler, besides exports from about 20 suppliers of parts and components.																								DaimlerChrysler India, he said, was aiming to sell 2,005 vehicles in the country by 2005, with a revenue and sales growth of 15 per cent annually.																								Huber said the firm aims to sell 1,800 cars this year to achieve a revenue of Rs 500 crore.																								Fifteen per cent growth is comfortable in a high-value low volume business, he said.

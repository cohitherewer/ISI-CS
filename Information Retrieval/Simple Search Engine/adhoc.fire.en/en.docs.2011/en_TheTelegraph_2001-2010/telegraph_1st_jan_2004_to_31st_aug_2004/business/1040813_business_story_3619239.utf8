 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Reliance pumps in Rajasthan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 12: The Rajasthan government has allowed Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) to set up petro-retail outlets in the state through the companys authorised retail dealer, Reliance Petro Marketing. 																								The state government had earlier moved to cancel the permit letter of any petrol pump operated by RIL and its retail dealer.																								An order issued on August 11 to all district collectors and civil supply officers said the move follows a clarification from the Centre on authorisation to private oil companies from the Centre to set up retail outlets.																								The director of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas said the government accepted the authorisation letter issued under clause 3D of the Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel Order, 1998 to Reliance Petroleum Ltd, which has since been merged with RIL.																								RIL has appointed Reliance Petro Marketing Ltd as its retail dealer to set up petrol pumps. The ministry has no objection to the licence for petrol pumps given to Reliance Petro Marketing, the order said.																								Consequently, on receiving an application for a permit to build retail outlets and after the necessary scrutiny under the provision of Rajasthan Petroleum Product (License amp; Control) Order, 1990, the licence can be given under these rules, the order said.																								The June 28 fiat said any action initiated to cancel the permit letter of any petrol pump operated by RIL or their authorised retail dealer should be revoked.																								The state government had earlier issued a notice to the petrochemical giant denying licences to its subsidiary for marketing petro products like petrol and diesel in that state. 																								Reliance had 10 such petrol pumps and it wanted to set up 40 additional outlets.																								It said under the motor spirit control order, only a company that has been licensed to sell fuel will carry out the business.																								Reliance has unveiled plans to build 5,840 petroleum retail outlets over the next 3-5 years throughout the country, the largest rollout undertaken by an enterprise. 																								They plan to set up 300-400 retail fuel outlets every quarter, starting from the second-quarter of this financial year.

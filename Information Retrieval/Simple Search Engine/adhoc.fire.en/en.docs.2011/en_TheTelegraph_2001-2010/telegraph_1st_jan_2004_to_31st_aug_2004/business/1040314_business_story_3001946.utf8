 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 PC prices may drop to Rs 10000
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 13: Computer prices could drop to Rs 10,000 due to sliding duties and the proposed ITA agreement.																								The Manufacturers Association of Information Technology (Mait)  the apex body for the hardware industry  feels prices will drop by almost 50 per cent. Prices of notebooks, servers, inkjet and laser printers will also spiral downwards.																								Mait has revised its figures for PC sales. We see a 30 per cent growth over last years figures with the sale of 30 lakh units this year. Next year, around 45 lakh units will be sold, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of Mait. 																								The rise in PC sales will also result in a spill-over growth in other sectors like consumables, printers and peripherals.																								Mehta adds that despite the growth, the numbers are still small compared with international PC penetration. Globally 30 out every 1000 people have a computer. In India, the number has gone up from nine in a 1000 last year to 11 this year.

 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Easier loans for textiles on cards
 VIVEK NAIR 																								Mumbai, March 7: Banks are willing to grant loans to the textile industry due to the emerging opportunities in the post-quota regime.																								Industry analysts said while accessing a loan for expansion of operations is relatively less arduous, the cost of credit is also coming down. 																								The premia paid by textile loan seekers in terms of the spread over the prime lending rate (PLR) has come down due to a lower interest rate regime.																								Bank of India CMD M. Venugopalan said, Earlier, there used to be a spread of around 3 percentage points over the PLR for proposals from this industry. It is now at 1 per cent. Bank of India is currently examining a few expansion-related proposals to avail of the opportunity arising after the multi-fibre agreement is phased out.																								Corporation Bank chairman and managing director K. Cherian Varghese also aver that banks are witnessing a demand for funds from the textile industry to fulfil their modernisation and expansion plans.																								The sector, bogged by recessionary conditions, had occupied a prominent position in the non-performing loans of banks and financial institutions.																								The textile sector was considered a sunset industry. However, now there is a substantial improvement in perception. It is now being called the sunrise industry and fresh loans are easily available, said a senior Indian Cotton Mills Federation official.																								Financial institutions have also begun to restructure loans in some cases, further signalling an attitudinal change, he added. 																								Textile companies too have begun preparations for January 2005, when the quota regime ends. Majors like Raymond Limited have already announced a Rs 200-crore expansion programme that will include setting up of two new manufacturing units for apparel and denimwear, apart from expanding its existing denim manufacturing facility.

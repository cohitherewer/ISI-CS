 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Good rains, easy finance fuel two-wheeler sales
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Top gear 																								New Delhi, April 11: Low interest rates, zero per cent financing offers and exports are among the factors fuelling sales and profitability of two-wheeler firms affected by an increasing competition in the domestic market, says a study report.																								The report, prepared by Icra, a leading rating firm which has a tie-up with the US-based Moodys, said a good monsoon and winter rains should fuel larger rural demand. Good rains lead to bumper crops and put more money in the hands of farmers, fuelling demand for products ranging from shampoo to motorcycles.																								The farm sector is monsoon-dependent as only one-third of the countrys arable land is irrigated and employs more than two-thirds of Indias billion-plus population accounting for about a quarter of total output.																								Better monsoons and favourable demographics would continue to drive growth in two-wheeler sales in short to medium term, led by motorcycle sales, said the study.																								Growth was achieved on the strength of a 12 per cent increase in motorcycle sales and a marginal increase in scooter sales, it said, adding that moped sales during the period fell 12.9 per cent.																								The study says, Intensified competition in the domestic market has affected the financial performance of some two-wheeler players. Players like TVS reported a fall in profits by as much as 15 per cent, while Kinetic reported a 4 per cent fall.																								An emphasis on exports would help the firms boost profitability as well as diversify the revenue stream, according to the study.																								In April-December of the last fiscal year to March 2004, domestic two-wheeler sales rose 8.6 per cent year-on-year.																								Motorcycle sales in 2002-03 stood at 38.3 lakh units, while demand in April-December grew 13.4 per cent to 32.2 lakh units.																								An entry-level segment, comprising low-price bikes, makes up about 35 per cent of industry sales and a mid-price or an executive segment contributes 55 per cent.																								Hero Honda had wrested the top position in the entry-level bike segment from rival Bajaj Auto Ltd after the launch of its low-price CD-Dawn model in April, 2003 and sold nearly 50,000 of these models a month.																								Bajaj dominates the premium segment with its Pulsar models.																								In the scooter segment, sales during the third quarter (October-December) of the past year to March 2004 were driven by gearless four-stroke scooters. Also, the negative growth in scooter sales has been arrested during this period, following the launch of a number of models, the report said.

 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 TVS eV at the auto expo in New Delhi. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: If you are hunting for some green vehicle at Auto Expo 2004  and one is not talking about colour  then the Italian auto maker Piaggio and domestic major TVS could offer you some comfort.																								TVS has on offer a battery-operated three wheeler which, you can be excused, if you thought it was a car  for that is how it looks. It is very much in the concept stage and, therefore, carries no price tag. It has a charging time of eight hours and can go up to 100 km per charge. 																								The market is not yet ready for this three-wheeler; we will launch it when it is. Essentially an autorickshaw, but its additional seat along with the drivers seat and the provision of glass panel doors covering the sides, gives it not only the look and feel but the utilities and comfort of a car as well, a senior company official said. 																								The body of this car, which is being referred as electric vehicle (eV), is of an impact-resistant and lightweight construction using low-cost composites and plastic material. The peak power of the vehicle is of 10 W.																								Meanwhile, TVS is in talks with the army and various state governments to sell its 150cc Fiero F2 motorcycle. We are in talks with both the central and state governments for selling the Fiero F2 bike, said R. Chandramauli, vice-president.

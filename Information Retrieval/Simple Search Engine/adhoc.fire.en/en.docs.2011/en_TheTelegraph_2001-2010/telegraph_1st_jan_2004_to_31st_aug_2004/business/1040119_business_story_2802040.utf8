 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Y. K. Modi: Upbeat																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: India Inc is keen that economic reforms should proceed apace, no matter which government comes to power after the elections.																								The people of India are not ready to lead a poor quality of life, says new Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) president Y. K. Modi.																								In his interview with The Telegraph since he took over charge at the premier industry forum, Modi said Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitzs view that after this years 7 per cent growth, India could suddenly dive to a low-growth phase if the monsoon fails, was a little too alarmist.																								The agriculture sector growth depends on the monsoon which cannot be predicted, said Modi. But both the manufacturing and services sectors will witness a year-on-year growth.																								Expressing confidence on Indias competitiveness, he said, We are still lacking in productivity. In addition, there is a need for employment generation.																								Talking about free trade agreements with Asean, Thailand and Sri Lanka, Modi said, In the west, almost 50 per cent trade is done with immediate neighbours. 																								Speaking on the contentious Indo-Pak bilateral ties, Modi said: Ficci will make all possible endeavours to strengthen Indo-Pak bilateral trade ties not only with a business perspective but also with the aim to position ourselves more positively in the global scenario.

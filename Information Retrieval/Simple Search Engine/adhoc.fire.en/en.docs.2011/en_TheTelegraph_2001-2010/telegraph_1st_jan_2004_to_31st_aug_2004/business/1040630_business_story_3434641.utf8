 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 New Intel platform for high-end users
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, June 29: Intel Corporation today announced the launch of Xeon processor-based platforms and a host of other products and technologies belonging to this processor family.																								The new processor offers about 30 per cent higher performance, memory and graphic capabilities for workstations compared with the existing processors used in the enterprise market.																								The new Intel technology will benefit high-end users, including financial and scientific data modelling, digital film-making and design automation, said Srikanth Patil, Intels south Asia director.																								The new chipset also helps reduce power consumption and the total cost of ownership substantially. The advanced processor, built on Intels 90-nanometer manufacturing process, supports our hyper-threading technology and a new chipset, E7525. It is optimised for workstation platforms, Patil said.																								The new platform comes with DDR2 memory, PCI Express, a faster 800 MHz system bus and an extended memory technology for improved graphics performance and power management. Operating at high speeds of up to 3.60 GHz, the processor integrates demand bus switching with enhanced Speedstep technology to adjust power and reduce the demand for energy. The extended 64-bit memory facilitates greater application flexibility.																								Patil said Intel proposes to launch server-based Xeon processor and other technologies to suit servers in the next 60 days.																								The chip giant controls about 85 per cent of the server market. In the dual-processor server segment, Intel enjoys a majority share. The server platforms will be based on two advanced chipsets  Intel E7520 and Intel 7320, he added.

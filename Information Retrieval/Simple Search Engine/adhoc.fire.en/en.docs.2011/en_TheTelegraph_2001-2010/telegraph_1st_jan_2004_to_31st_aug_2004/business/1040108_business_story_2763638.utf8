 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Kalam tosses up growth recipe
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kalam in New Delhi on Wednesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam today urged industry associations to encourage entrepreneurship in order to achieve a 10 per cent GDP growth.																								We have to graduate to 10 per cent gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Only then will the number of people living below poverty line reduce to zero from 260 million now, Kalam said at Ficcis 76th annual general meeting here.																								Reiterating his integrated action plan for developed India by 2020, he said the syllabus at the school level needed a change to create entrepreneurs. After that, he said industry bodies must nurture and encourage entrepreneurship.																								Pointing out that any form of connectivity between a developed and a developing country is competitiveness, he said that Indian industry will have to become competitive globally by achieving cost effectiveness, brand performance and just-in-time delivery.																								Whoever is competitive will be the winner. The law of development states that whoever is competitive will win whether developing or developed, he added.																								Outlining the programme for urban amenities in rural areas (PURA), Kalam said it has to be run in a business-like fashion and the industry will have to play a key role in implementing it. Can Ficci play a role to create a PURA enterprise and entrepreneur with the required business and managerial skill? he asked.																								Stating that there are about 700 million people who live in 600,000 villages of our country of whom 260 million people live below poverty line, Kalam said, The development of a nation depends on pushing these people. Is it GDP or human growth index, which will decide as a tool how much has our country grown, asked the President.																								Stressing the need for higher education to be backed by employment opportunities, he said a multi-pronged strategy is needed to make education more attractive and simultaneously create employment potential.																								India generates over 3 million graduates each year. However, lack of employment generation system is leading to instability in the social structure.																								Suggesting remedial measures to the above, Kalam said: An educational system should highlight the importance of entrepreneurship and prepare the students to get oriented towards setting up of the small-scale industrial enterprises and any ventures in our rural areas. This will provide them creativity, freedom and ability to generate wealth.																								According to him, the banking system should also provide venture capital from village level to prospective entrepreneurs for undertaking new enterprises.

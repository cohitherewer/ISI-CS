		 Monday, February 23, 2004  Q amp;A				 Property poser
																																																																																													What issues should I consider before buying a property? Which bank offers the best rate and could I borrow 100 per cent of the value of the property?																																																																													Bini Dutta, Calcutta
																																																																																													You should have the documents scrutinised by a lawyer who specialises in property deals. The devil is always in the fine print, and your measurements might not agree with those indicated in the documents. Demand clarification for all such discrepancies. If you are looking to buy a flat, mind the maintenance cost that youd have to pay as a resident. Most banks offer competitive rates on home loans now  but processing charges vary widely. You can get a floating rate home loan at 7.25 per cent, and a fixed rate one at 7.5 per cent, for up to 20 years. You can borrow up to 80 per cent of the value of the property plus the registration cost. Youll have to shell out the rest  which is about 20 per cent of the price of the property.																																					Gift garb																																																																																															I have a taxable income of Rs 1 lakh. Can I submit form 15H to avoid tax deduction at source (TDS)? Will making a cash gift to my wife help?																																																																													P. K. Mallik, Ranchi
																																																																																													I earn Rs 1.5 lakh from pension and fixed deposits. Is it compulsory to file income tax return?																																																																													B. Chowdhury, Calcutta
																																																																																													You can submit form 15H only if your annual earning is less than Rs 50,000. If you earn more than Rs 50,000 a year, you should file income tax return, even if you dont have to pay tax. Making a cash gift to your wife wouldnt help in reducing tax liability because her income from the gift would be combined with yours.																																					This way or that																																																																																															I had indicated to my employer at the beginning of the financial year that I would be investing a certain sum in public provident fund. Could I invest the same amount in National Savings Certificate instead and claim tax rebate under section 88?																																																																													T. R. Anand, Calcutta
																																																																																													Yes, you could. Theres no reason why you shouldnt be able to invest the same amount in National Savings Certificate instead of public provident fund and save taxes. In fact, it is advisable to invest in NSC because the interest on it is deemed as reinvestment, and could claim tax rebate on the interest next year.

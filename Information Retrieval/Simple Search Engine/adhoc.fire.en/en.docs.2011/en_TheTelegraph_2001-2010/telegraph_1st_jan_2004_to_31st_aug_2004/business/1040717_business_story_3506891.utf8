The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Many surprises in store
 AMIT CHAKRABORTYCalcutta, July 16: The will of Priyamvada Birla, which is at the centre of a raging controversy that has engulfed the Birla empire, specifically excludes family members and relatives from inheriting any portion of the assets of the MP Birla group. 																								Although the Lodhas are still maintaining a stoic silence on the issue, sources close to them said the will has specifically made it clear that after Rajendra Lodha, the assets of the MP Birla group will pass on to his son Harshvardhan.																								Contrary to rumours that M. P. Birla had clearly and unequivocally decided to leave his entire estate for charity, the Lodha camp has claimed that no will by late M. P. Birla regarding the succession of his assets existed. 																								This directly contradicts a Birla family statement issued yesterday that said the late M. P. Birla had clearly and unequivocally decided to leave his entire estate for charity. 																								Priyamvadas will specifically mentioned that business and trusts should be run independently as things were being done now, implying that profits from business would go to the successors and charities would continue to serve the beneficiaries.																								The Birla family could not be contacted to respond to the Lodha camps claim. However, it is learnt that all the Birlas  BK, KK, GP, SK and CK  were present last Monday when Rajendra Lodha read out the will at Birla Park, the residence of the Birlas. Only Kumar Mangalam and Siddhartha Birla were absent. Nandini Nopany, K. K. Birlas daughter, was also present. 																								A senior Birla family member said the will was read out so hurriedly that the listeners failed to follow and understand many parts of it.

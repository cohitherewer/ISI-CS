 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 SBI Life topper in group insurance
																								New Delhi, March 2 (PTI): SBI Life outsmarted other private sector peers in group insurance by covering 4,73,526 lives or about 14 per cent of the total 35,39,648 lives covered by all insurers and stood next to the public sector monolith Life Insurance Corporation of India till December 2003.																								Of the 35,39,648 lives covered under group insurance, Life Insurances coverage was 23,70,922 lives, comprising 67 per cent of the total coverage in April-December, according to data available with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).																								The remaining 33 per cent market share under the group insurance scheme went to 12 new generation players.																								Among the new players, SBI Lifes coverage was about 14 per cent. Industry sources said it was due to the vast network of the State Bank of India (SBI) and its associate banks across the country.																								It is a fact that we cannot match the network of SBI and what we are trying to do is to expand the bancassurance mode by incorporating more non-government organisations, an official of a private sector life insurance company said.																								Industry sources said SBI Life could enlighten the rural and co-operative banks and that was one of the reasons why it could grab a substantial stake in group insurance scheme.

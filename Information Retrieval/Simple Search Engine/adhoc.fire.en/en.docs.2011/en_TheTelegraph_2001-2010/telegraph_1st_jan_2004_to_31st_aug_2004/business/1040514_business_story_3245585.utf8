 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Lyons Range rescue: Left to new govt
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, May 13: In the rubble of the NDA lie hopes of a Druidic potion for the comatose Lyons Range. Signs that the Left will have a big say in the policies of a possible Congress government have fired optimism that efforts to peddle Bengal as an investment hotspot in the east will get a major impetus.																								And, along with it, rises the expectation that the floundering Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) will find a government more responsive to its cries for help.																								Since a bourse represents the growth and development of the economy, the state government will initiate major steps to hasten CSEs recovery, brokers say.																								If the state acts as an enabler and members participate actively, CSE will regain its lost glory. More innovative products and a clean management can also play a pivotal role in that direction, said Ajit Khandelwal of BNK Securities Private Limited.

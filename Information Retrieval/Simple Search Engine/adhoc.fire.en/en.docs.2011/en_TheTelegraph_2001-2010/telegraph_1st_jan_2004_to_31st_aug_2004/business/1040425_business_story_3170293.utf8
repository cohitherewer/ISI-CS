 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Indal sales surge 18% to Rs 1614 cr
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 24: Indian Aluminium Company, an Aditya Birla Group firm, has posted an 18 per cent rise in sales at Rs 1,614 crore in 2003-04. Net profit rose 11 per cent to Rs 132.20 crore. Exports topped Rs 100 crore for each of the four quarters despite the hardening of the rupee. 																								The Aditya Birla group after acquiring a controlling stake from Canadian aluminium maker Alcan has subsequently mopped up over 90 per cent stake in the company.																								Indal attributed the good performance to the record output of alumina, metal and sheet and higher sales volumes in sheet and alumina with significant rise in exports and superior product mix. Better capacity utilisation and efficient cost management have led to the rise in volume and value terms for alumina and sheet products.																								The year 2003-04, the company said, marks the successful completion of the first phase of policy inititatives since Indal became a part of the Aditya Birla Group. It forms part of a long term strategy to improve the competitive positioning.

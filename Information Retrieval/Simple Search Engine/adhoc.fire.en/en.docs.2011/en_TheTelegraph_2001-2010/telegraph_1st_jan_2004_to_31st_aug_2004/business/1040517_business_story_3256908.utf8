 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Tata Mutual looks for gold in stock pit
 SATISH JOHN The moolah count 																								Mumbai, May 16: Even as share prices crash on equity markets and investors scoot, some people smell an opportunity to do good business.																								One of them is Ved Prakash Chaturvedi, CEO of Tata Mutual Fund. He will launch Tata Equity PE, an equity fund, on Monday. It is a fund that will forage the market for shares with low price earnings. We are stepping out to raise funds, to send a clear message that this is the time to invest, said Chaturvedi.																								The Tata Equity P/E fund is being launched at a time when shareholder wealth on the Bombay Stock Exchange eroded by a whopping Rs 1,02,109 crore on Friday.																								The investors response is questionable as panic has numbed many, with the possibility of a rapid turnaround in market sentiment appearing remote in the short term. In the long term, equities will outperform all other investment instruments, Chaturvedi said.																								The scheme seeks to identify under-valued companies and under normal circumstances, at least 70 per cent of the net assets would be invested in shares having a trailing P/E ratio (price/earnings ratio) less than that of the BSE sensex at the time of investment.																								For example, the trailing P/E ratio of the sensex on December 15, 2003 is 17:17 (it is much lower at present after the Friday mayhem). The trailing P/E ratio of Wipro Ltd, for instance on that day, was 47.44, while that of ONGC was 9.29. Thus, on that trading day, while this fund could invest in ONGC (if the investment is justified by other evaluation parameters), it cannot do so in Wipro Ltd on the P/E basis. However, investments in companies is still possible, but would be restricted by an overall upper limit of 30 per cent of net assets on the total equity investment in all such companies in debt/money market instruments. 																								Trailing P/E ratio is a valuation ratio in which the last-traded price of a scrip is divided by the reported actual earnings per share of the company for its immediately previous completed financial year. The earnings per share, in turn, are computed by dividing the companys profit after tax by the number of its outstanding equity.																								Sometimes, the P/E ratio is also referred to as the P/E multiple because it could be an indication of the amount investors would be willing to pay per rupee of earnings. A company with a high P/E ratio may have to eventually live up to the high expectations of investors by substantially increasing its earnings, failing which the stock would drop. 																								Analysts generally compare the P/E ratios of companies in the same industry, or to the market in general, or against the companys own historical P/E.																								After the recent meltdown, the scheme may have a wider choice. Chaturvedi says global investment practices reveal that an investment methodology based on P/E ratios have a better chance of succeeding in the longer term. The fund will be targeting 50,000 investors as it is largely skewed towards retail investors. The initial offer will end on June 15, by which time a lot of issues regarding the market are expected to be cleared.

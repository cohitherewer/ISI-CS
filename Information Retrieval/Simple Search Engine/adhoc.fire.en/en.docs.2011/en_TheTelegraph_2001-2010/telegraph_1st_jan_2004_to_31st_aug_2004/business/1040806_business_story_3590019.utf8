 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Reliance Infocomm calls Pakistan
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 Using the neighbours phone																								Calcutta, Aug. 5: Reliance Infocomm has taken a call on Pakistan, a country it feels is teeming with telecom opportunities.																								The company has sent a number of executives to evaluate the prospects there, sources said. Unconfirmed reports suggest the Ambanis have bid for telecom licences offered by Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) recently.																								This is PTAs first tender for private and foreign investment in telecom after the Pakistan government deregulated the sector in July last year.																								Pakistans tele-density is still low. Its GDP is growing at the rate of 5 per cent, while inflation is contained at 3 per cent.																								Sources said if the countrys economic development is any indicator, the telecom sector should witness a boom in the near future, provided proper technology and investment trickle in.																								Interestingly, PTA is more interested in the CDMA (code division multiple access) technology for the expansion of basic telephones as well as mobile connections. Pakistan has a CDMA subscriber base of 1,25,000 while its GSM users are over three million.																								Reliance, one of the largest telecom operators in South Asia, could emerge a key player in Pakistans telecom privatisation process.																								Sources said the company has applied for fixed-telecom licences in all 14 circles of Pakistan. These services will be based on the wireless-in-localloop technology. There were 72 applicants in the first phase of bidding. 																								Sources say the telecom sector in Pakistan is expected to draw investments over $1 billion in a year-and-a-half.																								Reliance has positioned itself as a front-runner in the race for telecom licences because of its proximity, infrastructure and financing ability, they said.																								Reliance is, however, the first Indian company planning to shovel big money in the industry of the neighbouring nation. According to conservative estimate, the initial investments would be more than Rs 2,500 crore.																								Sources said Reliance is keen on both the long distance international and WiLL licence. There have been as many as 23 applications for the long distance licence, while 72 are for WiLL services. Capitel Communication, a Chinese company, is also planning to invest more than $1 billion if it gets both the ILD and WiLL licences.

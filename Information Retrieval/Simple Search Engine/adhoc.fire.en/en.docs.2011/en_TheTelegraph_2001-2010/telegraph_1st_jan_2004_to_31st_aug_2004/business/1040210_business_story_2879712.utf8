 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Vodafone may bid for AT amp;T Wireless
																								London, Feb. 9 (Reuters): Britains Vodafone Plc, the worlds biggest mobile phone company, indicated on Monday that it was weighing a possible bid for AT amp;T Wireless, the third-biggest US wireless firm, which is up for auction. 																								Vodafone Group Plc announces that it continues to monitor developments in the US market and is exploring whether a potential transaction with AT amp;T Wireless is in the interests of its shareholders, Vodafone said in a brief statement. 																								There has been speculation for weeks that Vodafone may join the $30-billion auction for AT amp;T Wireless. 																								AT amp;T Wireless, which is 16-per cent owned by Japans NTT DoCoMo, has already received an informal, all-cash take-over offer from Cingular, the number two wireless group controlled by SBC Communications Inc and BellSouth Corp, a source close to the talks said last month.

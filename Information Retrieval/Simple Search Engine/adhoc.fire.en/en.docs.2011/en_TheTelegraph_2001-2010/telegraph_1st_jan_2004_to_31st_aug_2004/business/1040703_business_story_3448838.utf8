 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 AAI staff protest privatisation move
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 2: The employees of Airports Authority of India (AAI), including officers, today protested against privatisation of airports without disrupting flight schedules.																								The government should consider our alternative plan for modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, which earn a large share of AAI revenue, employees union convenor M. K. Ghoshal said.																								The protest was staged against the recent decision of the group of ministers (GoM) to sell or privatise the two airports.																								The meetings at the two airports were addressed by leaders of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Citu and AITUC.																								A group of ministers, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, had earlier this week approved a proposal to privatise the two airports with a foreign direct investment of 49 per cent.																								However, addressing the gathering today, CPM leader Dipankar Mukherjee said, Neither will privatisation take place, nor will the government fall.

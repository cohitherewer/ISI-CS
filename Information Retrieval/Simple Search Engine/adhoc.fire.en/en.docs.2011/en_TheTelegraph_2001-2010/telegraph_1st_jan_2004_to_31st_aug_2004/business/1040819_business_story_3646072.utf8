 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Punch out of panch, Coke to raise prices
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Cold comfort																								New Delhi, Aug 18: Coca-Cola is raising its prices.																								Two years after it went to town with its panch rupaiya price point, the cola giant has decided to raise the price of its 200 ml bottle to Rs 6.																								The price of the 300 ml bottle is slated to go up to Rs 7 from Rs 6. 																								We are going to increase prices by Rs 1 for the glass bottles in select markets, Coca- Cola India CEO and president Sanjiv Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of a marketing summit organised here today by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								The prices will be raised in a few regions initially but Gupta did not say which these would be.																								The move will not affect the PET bottle, whose price was slashed sometime back by 10-12 per cent.																								Arch-rival Pepsi is also believed to be working on plans to raise prices, especially in the metros and other big cities. 																								The price rise comes in the wake of a robust 20 per cent increase in sales volumes of the soft drink industry.																								Cola companies had been seeking abolition of special excise duty, which wasnt conceded in the budget. At present, there is a 16 per cent excise duty and 14 per cent sales tax on cola products, which makes a low pricing point unsustainable in the long run. 																								Gupta said prices would continue to be maintained at the old levels in several markets. The rural market continues to be a strong growth engine for Coca-Cola in the glass bottle segment. The growth engine for Coca-Cola in the urban markets are primarily the PET bottles, said Gupta. 																								Coca-Colas bottling partners are establishing new plants in northern India and Andhra Pradesh for its juice-based drink Maaza, said Gupta. 																								The Coke chief that the concentrated soft drink (CSD) brand Sunfill was not doing too well, but said this was because the category as a whole was not growing as such. quot;With soft drink prices going up, sales in this category will pick up again, he added. He said there were no plans to withdraw Sunfill from the market.

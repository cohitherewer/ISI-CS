 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 6: The railways have announced a major pilot project for computerised parcel booking and bill management linking Howrah and Delhi and emphasised on extensive use of information technology to attract freight traffic that has moved away to the road sector.																								The road-railway traffic ratio has dipped from 20:80 in 1950 to 70:30 in 2003-04.																								While presenting his maiden railway budget in the Lok Sabha, Laloo Prasad Yadav stressed the importance of e-procurement, passenger reservation system (PRS), freight operations information system, electronic payment gateway, coaching operations information system and management of parcel traffic.																								A pilot project to set up an electronic payment gateway has been proposed under which customers will be informed of freight payable at the destination station and electronic transfer of funds to the railways account will be undertaken. This is aimed at ensuring speedy and secure transfer of funds apart from eliminating cumbersome and time-consuming paperwork.																								The railways will soon start electronic procurement. Yadav said, The introduction of this system will bring transparency and improve efficiency by way of reduced procurement time cycle and expeditious payment to suppliers.																								In order to improve the management of parcel traffic, which generates Rs 500 crore annually, the railways will launch a Rs 2-crore pilot project in the major parcel traffic corridor of New Delhi-Howrah and Guwahati.																								This will result in better planning, expeditious clearance and claims. Computersied parcel way bills and accurate calculation of charges will also be possible from the system, said Yadav.																								The railway minister also proposed to cover commercial aspects of freight business by computerising the working of about 300 goods sheds and sidings. The railway receipts will be computerised which will benefit merchants and industry in a big way as individual wagon tracking and electronic payments will become possible.																								The railway minister also promised that computerisation of registration of claim offices will be completed during the current financial year.																								In order to maintain effective material management to improve the material availability and turnover ratio, a material management information system for on-line information of materials will be set up in all zonal railways.																								Yadav also reiterated that the computerisation of passenger services will be enhanced. At present, PRS is available in 1100 locations in the country and another 74 will be added during the year. 																								To improve passenger traffic operations, Yadav said the coaching stock management module (covering passenger coaches and parcel vans) of coaching operation information system (COIS) will be implemented this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Fast forward on pipeline
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 27: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is gearing up to complete the Rs 1,200-crore Paradip-Haldia oil pipeline and offshore single-point mooring project ahead of the December 2006 deadline. The pipeline will enable the company to save Rs 500 crore per year in transportation costs and will boost the profitability of both the Haldia and Barauni refineries.																								Senior IOC officials told The Telegraph that global tenders have been floated for the pipes and setting up of the single-point-mooring (SPM) off the Paradip coast as two separate projects. 																								Work at the ground level will start as soon as the monsoon is over which will give sufficient time for the company bagging the contract to manufacture the pipes. The company expects to complete the project a couple of months ahead of schedule, a senior officer said.																								Indian companies such as Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tisco are in the race but will have to compete with foreign companies to get the contract. In fact, the contract for the Haldia-Barauni pipeline laid earlier had been bagged by a Chinese company that had put in the latest bid.																								The company had imported the pipes from China. Wildly fluctuating steel prices, however, have given some cause for worry. 																								The contract for the SPM and the submarine pipeline to the onshore tankage will be separate as it requires specialised expertise. In effect, the infrastructure for importing crude is being put in place before the Paradip refinery itself.																								The 350-km pipeline will be laid underground and will also utilise the latest horizontal-directional drilling technique to go beneath as many as 17 riverbeds and other water bodies. Laying the pipeline under the river is considered safer from the point of view of natural calamities such as heavy floods as well as terrorist attacks.																								The revenues of the Haldia port are expected to take a hard knock as the port will be deprived of the crude oil traffic. At present, the crude comes on board larger ships which are anchored out at sea and the oil is loaded on to smaller ships for bringing the cargo up the shallow waters of the Hooghly river. These lighterage operations are very costly for IOC and have impacted the profitability of the Haldia refinery.

 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 CESC powers ahead 
																								Calcutta, July 30 (PTI): CESC Limited has posted a 146.67 per cent increase in its first-quarter net profit at Rs 37 crore from Rs 15 crore in the year-ago period.																								The profit improvement has been achieved notwithstanding a drop in sales revenue to Rs 636 crore from Rs 640 crore last year due to lower tariff awarded by the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC) to the company, a spokesman said.																								A sharp improvement in profit resulted from several major cost-reduction and efficiency initiatives, including a 6.5 per cent increase in generation, 6 per cent reduction in high-cost imported power, 14 per cent decline in personnel outlay and 17 per cent fall in interest expenses, he said.																								Transmission and distribution (T amp;D) loss quarter-on-quarter was down from over 18 per cent to below 17 per cent, the spokesman said, adding that at its peak, CESCs T amp;D loss was 23 per cent.																								He said net sales during the quarter was accounted for based on the average tariff determined by the WBERC for 2004-05. 																								However, billing based on such an order was yet to commence and the results were subject to change once actual billings were made.

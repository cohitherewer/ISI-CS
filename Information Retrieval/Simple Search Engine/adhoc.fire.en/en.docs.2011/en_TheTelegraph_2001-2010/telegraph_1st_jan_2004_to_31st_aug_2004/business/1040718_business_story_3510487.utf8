 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, July 17: NIIT Technologies, the demerged software unit of NIIT Limited, plans to offer integrated services in both software and BPO segments.																								The company will tap under-penetrated niche market segments to develop its software business.																								We will follow a sliver-focussed model. We choose an area of operation, build our competencies in a niche segment and grow the business. We are now in consolidation mode and plan to grow in the US and gain a leadership position in Europe, CEO Arvind Thakur said.																								The $105 million company has sharpened its focus on the four verticals it operates in  financial services, transportation, retailing and manufacturing.																								We have avoided the crowded banking services in the financial segment and will focus on insurance. We have acquired a company in the US to develop our expertise in this area, said Thakur. 																								In transportation, our focus will be airlines, while in manufacturing, we will focus on SAP implementation.																								The finance vertical contributes 28 per cent of the revenue, while transportation has a 19 per cent share. Retail contributes 10 per cent while 15 to 17 per cent comes from manufacturing. The company operates in the BPO segment through its subsidiary NIIT SmartServe. The company serves clients in the same segments in which it provides software services.

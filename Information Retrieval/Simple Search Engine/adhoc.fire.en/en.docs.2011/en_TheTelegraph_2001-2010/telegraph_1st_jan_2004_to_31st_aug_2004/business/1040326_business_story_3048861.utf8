 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Room for better bank-client relationship
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 25: Banks operating in the country, both domestic as well as foreign, lack customer orientation, according to a study conducted by Siebel Systems and IBM Corp.																								Almost 87 per cent of the banks surveyed made no attempt to cross-sell or push-sell banking products during the course of customer interaction. Thus, the banks missed out on opportunities to increase incremental revenues.																								Almost 43 per cent of the banks failed to respond to customers email inquiries. 																								The independent market study commissioned by Siebel Systems and IBM Corp on the lead management and sales effectiveness of the top 100 retail banks in Asia-Pacific and Japan, reveals that no Indian bank (foreign or domestic) made a proactive attempt to follow up with the customer after the initial telephone or email interaction.																								Indian banks fared better than their Asian counterparts in attempting to identify and profile the customer. However, they fared poorly when it came to understanding the customers needs.																								Siebel Systems is a leading provider of customer relationship management applications. Dan Bognar, director of customer strategy, Asia-Pacific and Japan, said, While the last phase of industry growth was largely driven by mergers and acquisitions, the next growth opportunity for retail banks will come from achieving customer differentiation.																								Retail banks can no longer afford to passively wait for customers to walk into their branches. Nor can they afford to treat all customers the same, or in a manner which comprises their experience, he added.

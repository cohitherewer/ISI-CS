 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Hydro power projects in NE face the heat
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: A group of 25 non-governmental organisations in the Northeast is preparing for a battle to avoid discrimination, exploitation and neglect of local people and environment from the proposed hydro-power projects.																								The group of NGOs, led by PRO Hydro Power, an NGO devoted to hydro-power development, has set up a coordination committee to monitor that human face is retained while constructing massive hydroelectric projects in the Northeast.																								A large number of projects have been taken up in the central sector for execution in the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Plan periods.																								These include the biggest 11,000-mw Upper Siang project in Arunachal Pradesh and three projects in the Subansiri basin. Active construction of the 2,000-mw Lower Subansiri project has already started. Other projects are in various stages of development.																								The NGOs will set up watch groups of prominent local citizens in each project. These groups will periodically report about any human rights violations by the project authorities, environment, and employment to local people and proper compensation to the families whose land is acquired for setting up projects.																								S. R. Bhardwaj, president, Pro Hydro Power and convenor of the coordination committee of the NGOs, said, The experience of hydro-power projects set up in the country so far should help in mitigating the sufferings of the local people, promote the environment and avoid hostility of the local people towards the hydro-power projects.																								We are also discussing with well known environmentalist Medha Patekar to lead the movement, said Bhardwaj.																								The Northeast has about 50,000 mw of untapped hydro-power potential, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. The bulk of this potential is still to be tapped. While feasibility studies on a number of projects are going on, actual construction in most of these projects is still to start.																								Bhardwaj said the action plan would be finalised based on each project to keep constant pressure on the management to implement these projects keeping in view human values.																								We should learn from the recent crisis situation in hydro-power projects and priority should be given to the run-of-the-river projects to avoid massive storage of water and projects with large dams should be given the last priority, said Bhardwaj.																								Only about 1 per cent of the total hydro-power potential of the Northeast has so far been tapped. The massive programme initiated by the government will provide job opportunities that will help the Northeast in meeting the aspirations of the local youth.																								Power from projects in the region will be evacuated to rest of the country through the ambitious transmission network planned by PowerGrid.																								Efforts are being made by the hydro-power development companies like NHPC to provide jobs to the locals. There is a tremendous demand for more and the local people are agitated that the jobs are being given only to people outside the region.																								The NGOs want this trend to be checked.

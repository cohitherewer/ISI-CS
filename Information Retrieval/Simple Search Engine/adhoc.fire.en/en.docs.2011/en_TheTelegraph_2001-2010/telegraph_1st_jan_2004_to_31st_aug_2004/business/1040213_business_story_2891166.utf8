 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Paper on company law rejig in offing 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: A slimmer, simpler, executive-friendly Companies Act is on the anvil. The department of company affairs (DCA) will come out with a concept paper for this new avatar of the Companies Act in about two months time. 																								The idea is to simplify the company law, incorporating many provisions of the present law, amendments suggested to it by various bodies as also the recommendations of the second report by the Naresh Chandra Committee, DCA secretary M. M. K. Sardana said here today.																								The objective is to ensure that a large number of actions is done through the rule-making powers without infringing upon the sovereignty and without asking for too much delegated powers, said Sardana. He said the new legislation would also make the Companies Act more flexible, apart from making it concise.																								The simplified version will include many of the provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2003, which was sent back to the DCA for re-drafting after there was opposition to it from several quarters. A slimmer version will definitely mean eliminating provisions that have become obsolete, he added. 																								We will bring out a concept paper to simplify the Companies Act and make it more comprehensible to senior company executives at first reading itself. The present law is cumbersome and often incomprehensible to many people, he said.

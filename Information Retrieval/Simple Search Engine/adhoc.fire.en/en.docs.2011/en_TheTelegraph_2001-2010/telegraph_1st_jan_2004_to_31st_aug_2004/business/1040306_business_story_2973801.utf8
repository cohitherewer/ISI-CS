 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, March 5: An apex meeting of the promoters of the Indian Steel Alliance held in Mumbai today saw the cabal of top steel makers sharply divided on a host of issues ranging from a clash of interests of flat steel makers and bigger players who make both longs and flats to the selection of a secretary-general of the alliance.																								Sources said three young steel makers  Essar, Jindals and Ispat  have for some time been banding against Tata Steel, who they feel has been playing a dominant role in the alliance. 																								The three are angry because they have had to take the deepest cuts when all steel majors were ordered to hold the price line. They were also the ones who lost the most due to the scrapping of export duty paybacks. They resent this, said a participant in todays meeting.																								All steel companies were forced by the government earlier this week to agree to a gross ex-factory price of Rs 25,000 a tonne on which they were to give a further discount of Rs 2,000 on account of an excise duty cut. This forced the three steel makers to cut prices by a total of Rs 4,000 a tonne, while the Tatas and Steel Authority of India (SAIL) had to merely pass on the duty cut to consumers. 																								A battle surfaced over the appointment of a secretary-general for the alliance, a person who would be responsible for lobbying the government and political parties on behalf of the industry. 																								Former steel secretary Moosa Razas name was proposed by several steel makers. However, other heavyweight players in the sector opposed Razas induction tooth and nail.																								Raza had been on the board of Jindal Steels after retirement and, hence, his loyalties were considered suspect by many other steel makers.																								The divide within was deepened by the biggest steel-maker, SAIL, deciding to send just a senior manager to the meeting which saw J. J. Irani in the chair and Prashant Ruia, Vinod Mittal and Sajan Jindal attending. 																								Promoters had expected either SAIL chairman V. S. Jain or at least one of his directors to turn up and their absence was not only noticed, but privately commented on.																								The alliance, stung by the successful lobbying war waged by steel users which forced the government to get the group to agree to the price slash, today wanted to launch a counter-lobbying effort with a multimedia campaign which would ostensibly focus on promoting steel and try to weave in the theme of why steel prices are as high as they are.																								But even before the lobbying campaign ended, the three flat steel makers banded together to oppose an ad film which had been planned, claiming it concentrated too much on long products. SAIL and Tata have a long steel product portfolio. 																								Ultimately Iranis grey hair won the day and everybody agreed to the ad film which is slated to cost Rs 5 crore, but not before several hiccups.																								The promoters of the alliance have also been carrying out a lobbying war against each other over iron ore exports.

The committee, headed by G. Padmanabhan, RBIs chief general manager (internal debt management department), however, said banks must also have adequate internal risk management and control systems and robust operational framework to run trading positions across various interest rate derivatives.																								Presently, while primary dealers are allowed to trade in the interest rate derivatives that was introduced by the central bank in 1999, banks can use them to hedge exposures.

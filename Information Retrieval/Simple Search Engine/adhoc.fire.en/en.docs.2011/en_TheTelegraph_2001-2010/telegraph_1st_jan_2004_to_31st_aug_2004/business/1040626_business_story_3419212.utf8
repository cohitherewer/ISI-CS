 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Seeds of hope for trade deal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Supachai in New Delhi on Friday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, June 25: The World Trade Organisation (WTO) today maintained that the contentious farm trade talks will have to take into account the sensitivities of Indian agriculture.																								The deal has to take into account the sensitivities of Indian agriculture and this is something that the ministers of member countries are aware of, said WTO director general Supachai Pantichpakdi after his meeting with Union commerce minister Kamal Nath in the capital.																								Indian officials feel that the G-20 paper on agriculture, finalised on the sidelines of the recently held Unctad meeting at Sao Paulo, is the starting point to break the deadlock, which stalled to protect the livelihood concerns of its 650 million farmers since the collapse of the Cancun ministerial round.																								Indicating signs of a definite framework by July-end, Pantichpakdi said that differences on the contentious issues were narrowing between both developing and developed countries.																								The signs we are getting are that although countries could not agree on convergence in positions, they are negotiating providing different options for others to consider. So they are still trying to be flexible in their position and this gives me hope, he added.																								On the G-20 stand that movement on all three pillars of agriculture negotiations should be in tandem, Supachai said, I think this is the principle which all participating members countries do accept.																								The balance between the three pillars is what we are working on. Specificity must be spelled out in all three areas. This is seriously accepted and this is what we are working on in Geneva, he added.

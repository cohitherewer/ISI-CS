 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Aon Corporation report stuns industry captains
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 13: India Inc recoiled with surprise when asked to comment on a report by Aon, the worlds second largest insurance broker, which had characterised the country as one one of the most dangerous places in the world for terror attacks.																								It is difficult to comment on the risk perceptions since each study or report uses a different matrix to assess a situation. We would like to study the report in detail before commenting on its findings, said Nasscom president Kiran Karnik. 																								The Aon report had said that companies that had moved jobs to India had totally disregarded the high terror threat in the country.																								A spokesman for IBM India said, As a policy we do not comment on speculation of any kind. Even though it is a report, it amounts to speculation. 																								Recently, Bharti Tele-Ventures, Indias largest mobile phone operator, outsourced its complete information technology related activities to IBM India in a $720 million deal, making it the largest deal for the US-based IT major in South East Asia.																								Insurers were even more aghast. It is very unfortunate to hear this. There has been no major terrorist attacks in the last two years, except the one in Andhra Pradesh where we paid a claim, said P. B. Ramanujam, managing director of General Insurance Corporation (GIC).																								Some sporadic incidences in one or two parts of the country does not mean that India is a high-risk sector. Multinational companies have the habit of passing such comments against developing countries, he added.																								H. S. Wadhwa, chairman cum managing director of National Insurance Company, said: I strongly disagree with their views. India is a developing country with situations only improving by the day. Our relations with our closest Asian neighbour, Pakistan, is also now amicable.																								He said: The business processing outfits (BPOs) are staggered across the country and are also very adequately insured against terrorism. From recent instances, it is very clear that US and West Asia are far more high-risk zones than India.																								Sam Ghosh, chief executive officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, a private insurer, said:  I dont accept this. India has terrorism pool which has a sufficient corpus of Rs 350 crore. The fact that there is already a surplus emerging in the pool only goes out to show how large the claim experience is. India certainly has good business potential.																								A senior consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers said: The report has to be examined closely to understand how the perception has been reached. It also has to be vetted by an independent party and an association of insurance companies has to support its finding before we can give it any credence. In absence of it, the report will not have any impact on the companies that are operating or plan to enter India for business. 																								Mahesh Uppal, independent consultant on information technology and BPO, said: The terrorist threat has been overplayed. The places where BPO operations are located are not places targeted by terrorists. BPOs and their owners are not natural targets for terrorists. These are of not in general interest of terrorists. 																								Another top analyst with Gartner said: We would like to read the report. The same canard was spread when the US auto giants started outsourcing parts from various parts of the world, including India. There is no doubt that a risk of terror attacks is present in India. But everywhere it is not of the same magnitude.

 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Canon picks six areas to push sales
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Aug. 4: Canon India has redefined its product-based sales strategy.																								The company plans to focus on six main areas, namely office automation, IT, photo, consumer durables, audio-video (AV) and e-business, and has organised its sales group accordingly.																								We started the process in April and have rolled out the process last month, director and GM Alok Bharadwaj said.																								Canon aims to expand its reach with a specialised approach. Earlier, the company was structured based on products like copiers, fax, cameras or projectors. With convergence in technology, it has become very difficult to categorise products like digicams and projectors. The merger in technology has led to customer application conversion, which in turn has resulted in channel convergence, said Bharadwaj.																								Products have been placed under different channels to help its dealers have a one-point access for its products.																								Copiers and fax fall under the office automation, printers and scanners under the IT and home theatre projectors under the AV channels. Camcorders are classified under the consumer durables and cameras and digicams under the photo segments.																								Canon has 100 dealers for office automation and IT each, 20 for AV and consumer durables and 200 for digicams.																								We also plan to sell low-end products like cartridges and other consumables through the internet. We are finalising the e-commerce site and expect to launch it in September, said Bharadwaj. The website will also be an information and marketing outlet for our other products.																								The facility will initially be offered in Calcutta, Delhi and Bangalore. The company also plans to enter into sales tie-ups with major e-business portals to tap the net-savvy buyer.

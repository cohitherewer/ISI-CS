 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 US crude prices flare up
 High alert 																								London, Aug. 2 (Reuters): US oil prices struck a new record peak on Monday, climbing close to $44 a barrel after the country raised its security alert to high for a possible al Qaeda attack on a top financial institution. Dealers said the increased security threat was boosting the market, which is already worried by possible sabotage strikes on oil infrastructure in West Asia at a time when producers are pumping close to full tilt to supply a soaring oil demand.																								US light crude hit a peak at $43.92 a barrel, marking a gain of 12 cents over Fridays settlement and the highest level reached since oil futures were launched on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983.																								US crude was down 18 cents at $43.62 a barrel.																								Washington said on Sunday that intelligence signalled a possible al Qaeda attack and declared a high-level threat alert on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the New York Stock Exchange and other financial institutions such as Citigroup and Prudential Financial. The threat alert is bringing more confusion and uncertainty into the market, said John Brady at ABN AMRO in New York.																								The head of oil giant BP plc forecast at the weekend that oil prices were unlikely to decline any time soon.																								What with the insecurity of supply, the price seems to be holding up quite high, BP chief executive John Browne told BBC Television on Sunday. One day it will come down, but not in the very short term Im afraid.																								Tony Nunan, manager at Mitsubishi Corps international petroleum business in Tokyo, said any strike may ultimately bring prices down, as happened after the September 11, 2001 plane attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. US crude prices briefly spiked a couple of dollars close to $30 a barrel following those attacks but came crashing down to the low $20s soon after along with markets. 																								After 9/11, people were afraid and stopped travelling. They stopped consuming because of the uncertainty. If the target is in a consuming nation, you would expect an attack to affect the market to the downside, said Nunan.

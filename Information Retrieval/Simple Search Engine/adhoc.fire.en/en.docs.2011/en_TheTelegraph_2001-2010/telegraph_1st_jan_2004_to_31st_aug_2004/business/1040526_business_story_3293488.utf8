The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Engineering-goods exports beat target
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 EEPC chief R. Shah in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, May 25: Exports of engineering products exceeded $10 billion in 2003-04 against a target of $8.5 billion, despite a steep hike in prices of steel and pig iron. Net foreign exchange earnings stood at 70 per cent, according to Rakesh Shah, the recently elected chairman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council.																								The council has set a target of $11.5 billion in the current year.																								Alleging an artificial scarcity created by the main producers in connivance with traders to increase steel prices, in certain cases by as much as 100 per cent, Shah said the government should ensure the main input supply to engineering exporters, especially small and medium units, at ex-plant prices.																								Small and medium enterprises (SME), accounting for 50 per cent of the countrys engineering products exports, deserved the governments assistance in obtaining their input from plants rather than source their requirement from traders at much higher prices, Shah said.																								Former council chairman P. K. Shah said a detailed report on malpractice by steel plants in increasing prices has already been sent to the government. We will follow up the matter with the new government, he said.																								The council has also put up a list of demands to the government which include introduction of an alternative to duty entitlement pass book (DPEB) scheme, which would have to be scrapped under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) compliance regime. Shah said the profit from exports should be exempted from income tax or some alternative scheme so that the exporting units could use the surplus funds for modernisation, technology upgradation and expansion of their operations.																								Shah said the council would soon visit the Union commerce and finance ministers to discuss cheaper export finance. He said domestic finance had become cheaper at around 6 to 7 per cent, while exporters still paid 8 to 9 per cent.																								Shah also said Indiamart, a warehouse and display centre for selected engineering products in Chicago, would become operational in six months. The US market accounts for about 20 per cent engineering goods exports from India.																								The chairman also announced a series of overseas expositions to be held in the current year to promote exports. These include buyer-seller meets in Almaty, Jakarta, Ukrain, Uzbekistan, Uganda, Tanzania, Vietnam and South Africa. Shah said the council would also send delegations to Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Kuwait, Jordan, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan and participate in an exhibition on sub-contracting in Hanover and an Indo-Gulf business meet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Gail looks for telecom booster
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 21: Gail (India) Ltd is in talks with Tata Teleservices and Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL) for expanding its telecom business in the countrys southern region.																								Top company officials said the discussion is on an advanced stage and Gail is likely to finalise a deal shortly with either of the Tata companies to set up its telecom hub. Gail, being an infrastructure company, provides only bandwidth to other telecom service providers. 																								The officials have also pointed out that the company is set to invest over Rs 75 crore to add the southern region, particularly Bangalore and Chennai, to its existing network.																								Gails telecom division, GailTel, wants access to bandwidth in the southern region to supply its existing customers.																								It is in talks with the two Tata firms regarding swapping of excess bandwidth. It means Gail will pick up Tata Teleservices or VSNLs excess bandwidth in the south in lieu of its own excess bandwidth in the north.																								Gail does not have any existing optic-fibre network in the south, which puts it in a difficult position. Most of the telecom facility providers want a countrywide bandwidth access. VSNL, for instance, already accounts for around 70 per cent of our total orders in the north, while Tata Teleservices takes about 5 per cent. On the same plank, we would like to have bandwidth from one of these two companies in the south, an official said.																								GailTel was constituted in 2000 and currently owns a 8000-km optic-fibre network connecting 73 cities, including Delhi and Mumbai. The officials revealed that the company has already invested about Rs 250 crore in laying the optic-fibre network along its gas pipeline.																								Gail has also decided to make an additional investment of Rs 300 crore over a period of three to four years to increase its network by another 10,000 km, thus connecting the length and breadth of the country.																								This additional 10,000-km optic-fibre network will be laid along the national gas grid and the work is currently on. 																								GailTels designed bandwidth capacity is currently 160 giga bytes per second (gbps) and the installed capacity is 10 gbps. We have activated only 2.5 gbps, of which about 1,200 mbps of bandwidth has been sold out, the officials said. 																								Calcutta Gas Corp																								PTI adds: Gail has completed technical and financial due diligence of Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation for management participation in the Bengal government undertaking. Sources in Calcutta Gas said that Gail had engaged Projects Development India Ltd for technical due diligence and Ernst amp; Young for financial due diligence.																								The state government has formed a core team comprising managing director of Calcutta Gas, director of industries, and a WBIDC director to look into the issue of management participation by Gail in the PSU.

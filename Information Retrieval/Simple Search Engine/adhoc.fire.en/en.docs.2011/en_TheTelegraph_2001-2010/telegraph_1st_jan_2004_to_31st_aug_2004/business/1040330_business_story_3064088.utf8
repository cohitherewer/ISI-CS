 							 - CERC tariff norms signal rate cut for bulk purchases OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Good tidings 																								New Delhi, March 29: Power utilities are likely to see tariff for bulk purchases fall 15 to 20 per cent with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) today announcing new tariff norms for a period of five years from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2009.																								If utilities pay less for the power they buy from electricity generators, theres a possibility that power tariff at the retail end may also come down. Clear indications of this will come only when the state power regulators fix the retail electricity tariffs. 																								One thing is clear: the CERCs new norms will mean that retail power rates will at least not rise.																								There is now no question of a hike in power tariff for consumers, said CERC chairman A. K. Basu. The normative technical norms have been made stiffer. We have fixed a 14 per cent return on equity on all power projects against 16 per cent, a debt-equity ratio of 30:70 and the development surcharge of 5 per cent has been scrapped, he said. 																								CERC has also made it mandatory that all future projects in generation, transmission and distribution would be structured through a tariff-based competitive bidding process. 																								The new rates will be effective from April 1. Keeping in view the need to set multi-year tariff norms for regulatory certainty, the commission has prescribed the terms and conditions for a five-year period till March 31, 2009, as against the existing regulations that cover a three-year period. CERCs new regulations announced today are expected to benefit the power sector in several ways.																								The act prescribes that the state electricity regulators shall be guided by the principles and methodologies prescribed by CERC. This will lead to greater harmonisation, uniformity and certainty in electricity regulation across the states.																								The terms and conditions of tariff finalised by CERC are likely to result in some reduction in bulk electricity tariffs since the norms for servicing capital investment have been fine tuned with the current financial scenario and the benchmarks of efficiency have been raised. They will enable the state regulators, who determine the retail electricity tariff, to pass on the benefit to the ultimate consumer.																								According to the new policy, all future projects and new investment in generation, transmission and distribution both by public sector utilities like National Thermal Power Corporation and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation as well as independent power producers (IPPs) should be structured through a tariff-based transparent competitive bidding process. This is important since all the benefits of increased economic efficiency in this method will be passed on to the customers.																								This will also obviate the need for detailed regulation based on the existing cost plus approach which leads to inefficiencies and lack of initiative for better performance. Guidelines for competitive bidding should be announced by the government as early as possible.

 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Lever records flat growth in net 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 17: Hindustan Lever has reported a flat sales and net profit growth in the calendar year 2003, with net sales at Rs 10,138.35 crore against Rs 9,954.85 crore in 2002. Its net profit stood at Rs 1,771.79 crore compared with Rs 1,769.74 crore in the previous year.																								The board has proposed a final dividend of Rs 3 per share, making a total of Rs 5.50 per share for 2003.																								The results came as no surprise to analysts, but the share price dropped Rs 6.65 to Rs 192.80, one of the few index heavyweights to lose value on the bourses today. 																								Hindustan Lever chairman M. S. Banga said, Our strategy of focussing on our 30 power brands has put us firmly on the path of sustainable growth. In home and personal care (HPC), power brand growth has doubled from 3.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent in 2003, while in food, power brands have grown 9 per cent after declining in 2002.																								Hindustan Lever sales grew marginally despite price cuts. The FMCG major attributed it entirely to volume-led growth. All our power brands have grown well, Banga said.																								Citing an example, Banga said a 15 per cent reduction in toothpaste prices in certain categories has boosted the segment by almost 12 per cent. It has deepened the rural reach, he added.																								Six power brands have clocked a sales turnover of over $100 million.																								The HPC product portfolio grew 4.6 per cent in 2003, powered by an impressive 14.8 per cent sales growth in personal products. 																								The FMCG major expects villages to power its sales in the coming months. Banga said, We expect the economic climate to remain good. Even rural India had a good monsoon and kharif season and we also expect the rabi to be better. All this augurs well for the rural demand. Almost half its sales are accounted for by the rural markets.																								The prospects of higher disposable income, aided by good economic growth augers well and we are determined to relentlessly pursue growth in the face of competitive challenges, Banga said.																								We welcome competition. There is enough room for everybody in the market, he added.																								Banga said the company would take all necessary steps to protect and develop its market position. 																								The company has revamped its sales organisation for deeper penetration of rural markets. After stabilisation in the second half of 2003, the new system has already begun to deliver higher growth.																								He said Hindustan Lever Network, the direct selling initiative of the company, has grown over three times to have over 2.5 lakh consultants. They serve 1,400 towns and cities backed by 42 offices in the country. 																								On project Shakti, he said after the successful pilot in Andhra Pradesh, it has been initiated in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh and would be slowly extended to other parts in 2004.

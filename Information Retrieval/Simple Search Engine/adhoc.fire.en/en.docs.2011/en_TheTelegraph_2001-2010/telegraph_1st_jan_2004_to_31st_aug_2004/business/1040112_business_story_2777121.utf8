 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Jan. 11: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will hand over to private operators its small and marginal oilfields suffering losses because of high overheads.																								Chairman Subir Raha said the company has given 16 on-shore blocks to private operators. An equal number of off-shore blocks will be awarded through tender soon. It has 93 marginal blocks. Raha said the fields would be given in phases, on a service-contract basis. This means the ownership will remain with the corporation.																								It will be a business deal under which private operators, who will be chosen on the basis of their ability to operate an oilfield, can make the ventures viable by keeping lower overheads and liabilities, he said.																								Private operators will get a bonus for incremental output, in addition to the fixed service charge provided under the agreement, he added. There will be a penalty too, if an operator fails to meet the output target. There should be something in the agreement so that both owner and operators meet commitments, he added. 																								ONGC has over 93 category one small and marginal fields, which would be farmed out gradually. These are the kind of fields where the hydrocarbon presence is established. Lanka hunt																								ONGC is in talks with Sri Lanka Petroleum for combined exploration activities in the island. It already has a few blocks near the country. A high-level company delegation was in Sri Lanka for discussions. Raha said the Lankan company is keen on the alliance.

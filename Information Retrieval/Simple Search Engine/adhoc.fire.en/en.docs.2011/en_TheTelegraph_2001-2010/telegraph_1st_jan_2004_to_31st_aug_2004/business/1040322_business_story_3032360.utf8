 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 SBI Caps for Bengal power recast
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, March 21: Bengal is considering hiring SBI Capital Markets to help restructure its power sector. 																								We are aware that SBI Caps has been doing a lot of work in the area of power. We may take their help in this task, a senior official in the power department said.																								The state government has decided to divide West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) into two divisions that will independently handle transmission and distribution functions as part of a larger recast plan. 																								The roadmap has been drawn up by a committee headed by Subimal Sen. The government had set up the panel following the introduction of the Electricity Act 2003, which demands drastic changes to be brought in for the efficient supply of power to the consumers.																								We have heard that the Bengal government has undertaken restructuring of its electricity board. We are keen to work with them, said Indrajit Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Caps, adding that power is emerging as a major source of business.																								The merchant banker is closely working with Assam State Electricity Board in its reforms initiative. It is also helping Maharashtra, Goa, Daman and Diu in the same area.																								SBI Caps is also assisting the electricity boards in Karnataka and Chhattisgarh to raise Rs 1,500 crore each from the market. The funds are meant to revamp their boards.																								All state electricity boards are burdened with high cost debts with interest rates as high as 16-17 per cent. We are helping them in syndication of loans so that they can retire high-cost debts with low-cost borrowings, Gupta said. 																								Under the roadmap outlined by the Subimal Sen committee, the distribution firm to be formed by splitting WBSEB will have five strategic business units (SBUs). Each will be headed by a chief executive officer, who will report to the main distribution company. 																								Of the five SBUs, one will look only after the hydro-electric projects of the state. The other four SBUs will look after the five distribution profit centres of WBSEB.																								This is an extremely critical task and we have to take the advice of some expert on these issues, said that power department official.																								The Bengal government has initiated measures to reform the power sector. It has already introduced laws to curb theft of power so as to reduce the transmission and distribution losses substantially.

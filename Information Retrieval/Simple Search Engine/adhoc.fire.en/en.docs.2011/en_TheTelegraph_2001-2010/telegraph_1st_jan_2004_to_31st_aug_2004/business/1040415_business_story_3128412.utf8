 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From left) Cisco Systems president Rangu Salgame, Bharti Infotel president Badri Agarwal and CEO Rajiv K. Sharma in New Delhi on Wednesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, April 14: Companies will soon have the flexibility to increase or decrease bandwidth speeds based on their immediate needs  and the request will be processed within a matter of minutes.																								Bharti Infotel today joined hands with Cisco to offer its enterprise and corporate customers the bandwidth flexibility  a feature that will reduce costs by 30-50 per cent for companies with offices spread over several locations.																								Small to medium enterprises and banks  which need high bandwidth speeds only for a short duration (especially during year-end closing when they need to zap a large volume of data from their branches across the country)  will be the biggest beneficiaries of this facility.																								Bharti Infotel has deployed the internet protocol (IP)-based multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) backbone network solution. This will enable the company to increase or decrease customers bandwidth speed ranging from 512 kilobits per second to 2 megabits per second or 10 mbps within a matter of minutes.																								Cisco is a pioneer and global leader in MPLS-based technology and networking solutions. MPLS is a hybrid networking technology that combines high-speed performance with security, scalability and reliability. It also helps in the provisioning of several revenue generating services like bandwidth on demand, managed services and intelligent routing of voice, data and other mission critical traffic.																								Bharti Infotel, which has a 50 per cent market share in data and broadband market, with MPLS aims to consolidate its leadership position. With a dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) based high capacity fibre backbone laid over 25,000 km area, i2i cable-landing facilities for international bandwidth and now an MPLS backbone, Bharti Infotel can offer a unique value proposition to its customers.																								Badri Agarwal, president, Bharti Infotel Ltd, said, With reduced cost of ownership for companies and enterprises, we expect more and more of our existing and new customers to connect their offices, vendors, partners and customers through the MPLS backbone, thereby increasing the overall market size for data services in India.																								Rangu Salgame, president, Cisco Systems (India and SAARC), said, This end-to-end solution will deliver significant operational and capital cost savings to Bharti Infotel.																								Rajiv K. Sharma, CEO, Bharti Infotel Ltd said, The most important aspect is our ability to offer bandwidth on demand which empowers the enterprise customer to provision incremental bandwidth required for a specific period of time for applications like videoconferencing.

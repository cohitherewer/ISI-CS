 OUR BUREAUJuly 8: The budget proposes to replace the long-term capital gains tax on share transactions with a turnover tax that will be levied on the buyer at the rate of 0.15 per cent of the value of the deal.																								A transaction involving securities valued at, say, Rs 1,00,000 will now bear a small tax of Rs 150. The tax will be levied on the buyer, finance minister P. Chidambaram said in the budget speech.																								The turnover tax dominated the minds of market players and occupied centrestage on the stock exchanges, overshadowing for the moment the finance ministers drastic re-engineering of select capital market incentives.Confusion prevailed on the markets on the impact of the tax. Such were the jitters that the operators overlooked several reform-friendly measures in the budget and drove the sensex down. 																								It is a dicey proposal, said Deena Mehta, a BSE broker. Traders fear that the turnover tax will kill day trading, which forms the bulk of transaction.																								The government termed the measure a part of the rationalisation of the tax system. Revenue secretary Vineeta Rai said the tax would be made applicable on shares, debts and securities, among others. 																								Last years calculation showed the tax on total turnover was around Rs 7,500 crore and said the collections could be between Rs 4,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore in the remaining months of this fiscal.																								Senior finance ministry officials said during the post-budget news conference that the transaction tax replacing the long-term capital gains tax would make it mandatory for everybody who trades in the stock market or the security market to pay the tax. The budget also reduced the rate on short-term capital gains to 10 per cent.																								The finance minister got support from Life Insurance Corporation of India chairman S.B. Mathur, who said the abolition of the long-term capital gains tax will more than compensate for the turnover tax.																								Chidambaram also proposed measures to widen the tax base and to plug revenue leakage. I do not wish to take the time of the House detailing each measure, he said, causing a lot of anxiety to market players.																								He proposed to put an end to bonus-stripping and dividend-stripping in units by making a suitable amendment to Section 94 of the act in an effort to ensure that investors do not avoid paying tax on income from investments in mutual funds.																								I propose to make a change in the tax on dividends distributed by mutual funds. Equity-oriented mutual funds will continue to be exempt from tax. Debt-oriented mutual funds are now required to withhold 12.5 per cent of the income distributed to unit holders, the finance minister said.																								Individuals and HUF unit holders will continue to enjoy the benefit of this rate. However, in the case of corporate unit holders, I propose a rate of 20 per cent. I am sure corporates will understand, because I am doing no more than partially closing a window of arbitrage opportunity, he said.

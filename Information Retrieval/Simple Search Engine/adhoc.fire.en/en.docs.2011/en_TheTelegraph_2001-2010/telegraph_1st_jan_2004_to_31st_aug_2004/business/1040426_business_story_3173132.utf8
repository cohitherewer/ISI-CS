The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Panasonic tunes into home theatres
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, April 25: Panasonic plans to enter the home-theatre entertainment segment through its exclusive distribution and service arrangement with Godrej amp; Boyce.																								The home theatre segment is still at a nascent stage in India, said Sunil Patil, deputy manager, marketing, prima division, Godrej. Pricing is a major hurdle in the growth of this niche segment product, he added.																								The Panasonic home-theatre product costs Rs 1.5 lakh. The 50 per cent duty component doubles the price of the product, added Patil. Though expensive, there is a potential market with companies, hotels and airlines using home theatres in a big way.																								We are in the process of developing a marketing strategy for the product. One option is to use the retail network across the country to showcase the product along with other home appliances, said Patil.																								There are also plans to adopt a direct marketing approach for companies. We are also holding roadshows in major metros and plan to cover smaller cities in the next one year to educate the consumer on the benefits of the product, he added.																								With zero duty expected to come in with the World Trade Organisation regime, the home theatre market will see explosive growth and prices will be reduced to almost half.																								Yoshitaka Inzuka, assistant manager of Japan-based Matsushita Electric Industrial Co, said India currently contributed to 5 per cent of the total global sales of Panasonic digital products. This is, however, expected to double in three years. Panasonic spends $600 million annually on research and development of its projector business. Panasonic also launched four wireless projectors.																								We have a 10 per cent market share in India and saw a growth of 40 per cent last year. This is against the market growth of 30 per cent, said Patil.

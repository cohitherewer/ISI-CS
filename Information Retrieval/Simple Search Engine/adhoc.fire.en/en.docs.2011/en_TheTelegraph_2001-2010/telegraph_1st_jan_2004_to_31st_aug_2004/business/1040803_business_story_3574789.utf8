 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 Mitsubishi makes a Galant move
MICHELLE KREBS In Shining Armour Detroit, Aug. 2: The last time Mitsubishi Motors introduced a new Galant family sedan to Americans, the automaker was ailing.It was 1998, the companys Japanese parent was spurting red ink, and sales had dropped in the United States. Mitsubishis assembly plant in Illinois, where the Galant was built, had not reached full production capacity a decade after it opened.A new management had taken over the marketing operation in California, and it had hired a new advertising agency, Deutsch, which introduced an attention-grabbing Wake Up and Drive campaign with commercials for the 1999 Galant. For a time, things seemed to be looking up.Now, six years later, there is another new Galant. Again, the company is deeply troubled, suffering ills both familiar and new.The Japanese parent is still bleeding, having reported a $1.9 billion loss for 2003. Despite being Mitsubishis largest shareholder, DaimlerChrysler issued a no-confidence vote by refusing to provide more money for its troubled long-time partner.And Mitsubishi has been rocked by scandals for nearly a decade: in Japan, there were payoffs to gangsters and cover-ups of defects; in the United States, there were falsified sales reports and a huge sexual-harassment settlement involving the Illinois plant. Lax lending practices, which helped to lift sales for a while, have come back to haunt the company; analysts say $1 billion in loans may have to be written off.With sales again plunging in Japan and the United States, and production being cut in Illinois, Mitsubishi is counting heavily on the Galant, a car that has always been competitive but one that has never had a compelling, clear-cut image.As chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors North America, Finbarr J. Neill is in the hot seat. Asked in a telephone interview to sell a prospective buyer on the Galant, he emphasised the new cars increased size, brisk acceleration and responsive handling.Indeed, Mitsubishi has been trying to establish the Galant as a sportier, more stylish alternative to the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, the nations best-selling cars. For people looking for a fun-to-drive sedan, it is there, said Neill, who won respect in his previous job, as architect of a turnaround at Hyundai Motor America.

 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Gulf states blame speculators 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Gulf countries have blamed market speculators for soaring international crude prices. Kuwait foreign minister and Gulf council chairman Sheikh Mohammed Al Sabbah said here today that these speculators were operating outside the Gulf countries and raking in huge gains by creating fears of shortages. 																								He emphasised the fact that the Opec members had stepped up crude output and were now operating at near full capacity. He said that Opec was not in favour of maintaining crude prices at the current level as it would ultimately lead to a depression in the world economy which would hurt everyone. 																								He underlined the importance of stable crude prices and the Opec cartels stated objective of maintaining crude prices within the $ 25-28 per barrel band.																								Crude prices have soared by $ 10 per barrel since June due to the continuing instability in Iraq and the tax problems confronting the leading Russian company Yukos. Since Russia is one of the leading exporters of crude, any problem in that country tends to trigger fears of lesser crude arriving in the market. 																								The demand for crude, on the other hand, has been surging especially in China, a fast growing economy, and the US which has to build up inventory for the winter months. 																								Speculators have always played a significant role in jacking up oil prices as any instability in the market enables them to play on the psychology of shortages to make a fast buck. 																								India has been hit particularly hard as it imports as much as 70 per cent of its crude requirement. Given the current level of high prices, with Brent crude hovering over $ 43 per barrel, Indias import bill is expected to jump to $30 billion during the current financial year compared with the $18.2 billion in the last financial year.																								The countrys oil import bill between April-July this year has already shown a 62 per cent increase over the same period of the previous year.

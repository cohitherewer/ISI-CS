 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Govt plans to raise equity in Hexacom
																								New Delhi, Jan. 11 (PTI): The government is likely to take a decision on increasing the stake of state-owned Telecom Consultants India Ltd (TCIL) in joint venture Hexacom, a cellular operator in Rajasthan, by buying part of the equity owned by Canadas Telesystem International Wireless (TIW).																								The other JV partner, Shyam Telecom, has already decided to exercise its option of taking proportionately the equity of 27.5 per cent owned by TIW, which is exiting from the venture.																								In case the government and Shyam Telecom buy out TIW, it would be a rude shock for Sunil Mittal-owned Bharti Group, which has offered Rs 102 crore to TIW perceiving the venture as a good vehicle for its entry into Rajasthan.																								When contacted, DoT secretary Vinod Vaish said that a decision in this regard would be taken soon after considering all the pros and cons.

 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 ONGC plans to integrate explorations on east coast
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, May 4: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) plans to integrate all deep-water drilling on the eastern coast with the Sagar Samriddhi project, launched in November last year.																								A senior ONGC official said the integration will benefit the company immensely in terms of payment outgo for chartered drilling ships, which are very expensive.																								ONGC is optimistic of finding reserves of oil and oil equivalent on the eastern coast going by the data it has acquired in the past couple of years.																								The eastern region may develop as the future oil and gas bowl of India with the potential for supplying seven billion tonnes of oil and oil equivalent (BTOE). Hence, the company has doubled its activities in the area, the official said.																								The potential in the east has increased the investment target on exploration activities by over 50 per cent in the Tenth Plan period, he added.																								Earlier, ONGC had decided to spend around Rs 2,000 crore on exploration activities, but we think the company will cross the Rs 3,000-crore mark by the end of the Tenth Plan period, he said.																								Apart from the Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery basins, the company is optimistic on the prospects of Mahanadi offshore where it has stakes in four deep-water and three shallow-water blocks.																								The company, which has completed a 2D seismic study in at least four out of eight Mahanadi blocks, is expected to commence drilling operations early next year.																								The countrys largest profit-making company has budgeted for 47 deep-water exploratory wells on the east and west coasts.																								The director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) has estimated a reserve of 11 BTOE in the countrys deep-water basins. 																								The ONGC executive said the company has established reserves of nearly six BTOE onshore and in shallow waters in over 45 years of exploration in India. 																								Of these initial in-place reserves, only two BTOE is recoverable. Nearly, 0.9 BTOE has already been produced, and as of now, ONGC holds 1:1 BTOE proven recoverable reserves in the domestic assets, he said. However, the company has set a strategic goal of doubling the reserves from six BTOE to 12 BTOE by 2020.

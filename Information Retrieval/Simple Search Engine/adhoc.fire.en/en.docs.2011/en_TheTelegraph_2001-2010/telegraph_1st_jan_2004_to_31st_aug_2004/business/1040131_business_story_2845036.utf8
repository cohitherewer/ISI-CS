 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Expenses to eat into rail earnings
 							 - Freight traffic projected to increase by 20 million tonnes OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 30: The interim railway budget expects the gross earnings of the railways to shoot up by Rs 1,877 crore over the previous year. However, this is expected to be more than wiped out by the Rs 1,990-crore leap in the ordinary working expenses projected for the year.																								The increased earnings for 2004-05, which are projected to touch the Rs 44, 482-crore mark, are expected to come from a 20 million tonne increase in freight traffic and a 3.2 per cent increase in the number of rail passengers. 																								With total working expenses estimated at Rs 41,250 crore the net traffic receipts will be reduced to Rs 3,232 crore. 																								Miscellaneous receipts worth Rs 993 crore will help take the estimate for net revenue to Rs 4, 225 crore.																								An additional Rs 300 crore outgo due to higher pension payments constitutes yet another drain on the budget.																								Interestingly, this has sought to be balanced out by reducing the outlay for the more useful depreciation reserve fund of the railways by Rs 367 crore from Rs 2,267 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 1,900 crore.																								The net dividend payable to general revenues in the interim budget is Rs 3,605 crore, which is Rs 338 crore higher than the dividend that has to be paid for 2003-04.																								Railway Board chairman R. K. Singh told reporters that these projections were realistic and based on the fact that freight traffic target for 2003-04 had been enhanced to 550 million tonnes which was 30 million tonnes higher than the 519 million tonnes of freight loaded during 2002-03.																								He said the initiatives taken by the railways in reducing freight rates for goods such as petroleum products, cement and coal had seen a quantum leap in freight traffic which had already exceeded 407 million tonnes till December 2003. Since this was higher than the projected target for this period, the overall target for 2003-04 which had earlier been fixed at 540 million tonnes has now been raised to 550 million tonnes. 																								Passenger traffic during the year had grown by a steady 2.8 per cent during the current fiscal and this growth trend was expected to continue in the next year as well with the introduction of more and better train services, he added.																								He said the new trains announced in the budget would be introduced gradually as the new coaches would have to be made available by manufacturing units. This normally takes two to three months, he added.																								Asked whether with the laying of more and more oil pipelines in the country the high-revenue traffic would be further eroded, he said while this was a concern the estimates had taken this increasing shift into account.																								We are getting enough other traffic. So, the estimates for freight growth are realistic, he said.

 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Call to oust Lodha as Mangalam Timber auditor
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 B. K. Birla: Wait and watch																								Calcutta, July 23: A move is afoot to remove Lodha amp; Co as the auditor of BK Birla group firm Mangalam Timber.																								The company today informed the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) that it has received a special notice from one of its shareholders who intends to move a resolution against the reappointment of the auditor at the forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM).																								Mangalam Timber, an Orissa-based company which is now before the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), wrote to the bourse that the shareholders proposal had been received under Sections 190 and 225 (1) of the Companies Act, 1956.																								The member has suggested moving a resolution at the ensuing AGM, proposing not to appoint Lodha amp; Co as the auditor, the notice sent to CSE said.																								The move comes amid reports that companies across the Birla clan are looking at ways to have Lodha amp; Co removed as their statutory auditor.																								No member of the Birla family was available for comment on the issue, but sources say Mangalam Timber would have to take up the resolution. The firm cannot go beyond what has been written in the Companies Act, 1956, they added.																								A copy of the special notice received from the shareholder, along with other documents, will be given to all members at the forthcoming AGM, sources said. 																								Corporate watchers are of the opinion that it is the shareholders who would take the final call on the auditors removal, with little scope for promoters to do anything other than building up a consensus.

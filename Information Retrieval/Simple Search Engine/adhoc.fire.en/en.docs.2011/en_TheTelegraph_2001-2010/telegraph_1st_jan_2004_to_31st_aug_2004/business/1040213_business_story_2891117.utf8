 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Twin-track approach to tariff reduction
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: The BIMST-EC agreement signed by India, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Nepal this week provides for a twin-track approach to reduce tariffs on goods which do not figure on the negative list.																								According to an official statement issued today, The agreement will come into force on June 30, 2004, by which time the member countries undertake to complete their internal procedures required for this purpose.																								Products listed on the fast track by a member country of its own accord will have their respective most-favoured-nation tariff rates gradually reduced or eliminated in accordance with specified rates to be mutually agreed by the member countries.																								India, Sri Lanka and Thailand have been listed in the first group which will have to reduce tariffs on the fast track between July 2006 and June 2009. 																								Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal comprise the second group which will have a more liberal deadline of June 2011 for the same category.																								The normal track will include goods for which the tariff cuts will be phased out more slowly. 																								For the first group the time-frame has been fixed between July 2007 and June 2012. The second group will get until June 2017 to reduce tariffs for these goods.																								The member countries have agreed to negotiate expeditiously in order to establish BIMST-EC free-trade area and lower barriers substantially all trade in goods, progressive liberalisation of trade in services and establishing an open and competitive investment regime that facilitates investments within the BIMST-EC area.

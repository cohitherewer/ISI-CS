 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 New dredging policy set afloat
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: The ministry for shipping and surface transport today unveiled a revised three-year dredging policy under which the Dredging Corporation of India would take care of operations at the Calcutta port till March 31, 2007.																								Under the terms of the new policy, all other major ports shall invite bids for dredging and Dredging Corporation shall have the right of first refusal, if its rate is within 10 per cent of the lowest technically qualified offer. The policy will be applicable to both maintenance and capital dredging works. 																								Dredging contracts already entered into by major ports with Dredging Corporation shall remain in force till the validity of the contract, after which the new guidelines shall be applicable.																								To ensure a level playing field, DG (Shipping) has already modified its guidelines of November 2002 to allow the first right of refusal to Indian shipping companies vis--vis foreign dredging companies (under sections 406 and 407 of the Merchant Shipping Act) only if the bid of Indian companies is within 10 per cent of the lowest offer. 																								DG (Shipping) would also be requested to frame suitable guidelines to ensure that permission to charter foreign dredging vessels to minor ports/private ports in India is given only if competitive bidding process has been followed for awarding the contract and the Indian shipping companies have been given the full opportunity to participate in the tender process.																								The annual maintenance dredging requirement of major ports in India is around 65 million cubic metres. In addition, there are capital dredging requirements of the major ports.																								According to the present policy guidelines issued by the ministry of shipping in 2001 and 2002, major ports are allowed to give contracts to Dredging Corporation on nomination basis or they could give contracts to Indian or foreign companies on the basis of competitive bidding process. These policy guidelines are valid till March 31.																								The ministry has been considering for sometime a review of the existing dredging policy. 																								A meeting was held with all the major dredging companies (both Indian and foreign) as well as representatives of major ports in the ministry of shipping on August 29. 																								After listening to the views of dredging companies and major ports, the ministry had invited further comments of all stakeholders within two months.

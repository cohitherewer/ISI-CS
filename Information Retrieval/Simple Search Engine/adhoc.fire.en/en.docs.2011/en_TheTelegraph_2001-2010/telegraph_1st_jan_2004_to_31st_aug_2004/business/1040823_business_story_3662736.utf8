 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Kerala logs on to e-literacy
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Tech Drive																								Malappuram, Aug. 22: A pioneering state government scheme to educate one person from every family in the district with computer skills has turned into a money- spinner.																								The Akshaya programme at Malappuram is now serving as a model for other districts and the Kerala government is planning to complete the implementation process across the state by the end of the current fiscal.																								Established and run by entrepreneurs, Akshaya e-centres are self-sustaining units  which house a server and 10 computers  set up at an investment of Rs 3.5 lakh.																								The e-literacy programme alone provides the baseline revenue, said Aruna Sundararajan, secretary in the states information technology department, adding that services which include webcams, scanners, printers and fax machines boost revenues. 																								The entrepreneurs have been able to recoup almost half their investment within a few months of being operational, which began in May 2004, she said.																								The business model is ingenious and has been engineered in an interesting partnership between the panchayat and local entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur sets up and operates the computer centre, while the panchayat pays them Rs 120 for each resident made computer literate.																								Akshaya centres are run on popular short-range wireless networking technology known as Wi-Fi, which is used in airports, hotels and coffee shops to access the Web without wires.																								The wireless technology network is being supported by the Delhi-based Tulip IT Services Ltd. The Wi-Fi initiative would bring significant socio-economic changes in the state as it would result in effective e-governance, Tulip IT Services managing director Lt. Co. H. S. Bedi said.

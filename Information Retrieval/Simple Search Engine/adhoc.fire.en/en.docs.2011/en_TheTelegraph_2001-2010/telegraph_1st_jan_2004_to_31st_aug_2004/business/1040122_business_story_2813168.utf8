 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Fitch upgrades forex rating
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 21: Fitch Ratings today upgraded Indias long-term foreign currency rating to BB+ from BB and affirmed the long-term local currency rating at BB.																								While the outlook on ratings is stable, the international rating agency expressed concern over the poor fiscal performance, which it said continues to constrain ratings.																								Fitch said the upgrade reflects Indias strengthening balance of payments position and rapidly improving external balance sheet. It added that over the past few years, Indias balance of payments has strengthened considerably owing to booming services exports, primarily in the IT and IT-related sectors and healthy remittances.																								This, combined with buoyant foreign portfolio capital inflows and a steady influx of non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits, has led to a sharp increase in official foreign currency reserves which have nearly doubled since December 2001 to over $100 billion, it said.																								According to Fitch, while recent capital inflows may partially reflect low global interest rates, software exports should continue to support the current account of the balance of payments over the medium term. Indias vulnerability to external shocks and balance of payments constraint on growth has eased significantly, it added.																								It, however, said the poor state of public finances remain a major constraint. The risks of a financing crisis over the medium term are mitigated by most of the government dent being held domestically, denominated in rupee and bearing long maturities, it added.																								Fitch, however, warned that the country cannot rely on a favourable macro picture for too long and needs decisively to cut fiscal deficits to stabilise its debt burden.																								The failure to take advantage of a favourable macro-economic condition to commence fiscal consolidation, with the government recently opting to announce further tax cuts, is unfortunate. 																								Passage of the fiscal responsibility and budgetary management law last year represents a welcome commitment, but it remains to be seen whether this would be backed up by genuine political resolve, Fitch said.																								With interest payments accounting for over 30 per cent of general government revenue, far higher than any investment grade-rated sovereign, continued fiscal deterioration could weigh more heavily on Indias ratings over time, it warned.																								Fitch reiterated that the broader pace of structural reform remains disappointingly slow, including labour market reform, privatisation and most importantly tax reform.

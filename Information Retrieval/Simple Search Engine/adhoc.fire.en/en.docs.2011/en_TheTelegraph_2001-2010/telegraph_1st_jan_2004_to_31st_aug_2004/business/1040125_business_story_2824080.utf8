The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 FIs, banks set to energise power sector
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Jan. 24: Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), ICICI Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) are warming up to fund the power sector again. 																								They want to invest in generation, transmission and distribution projects and have already approached private power companies and state electricity boards.																								Senior officials of ICICI Bank said there are many proposals from the power sector too. The Electricity Act, 2003 has opened up opportunities for investment in this sector, they added.																								All three are keen to invest in the West Bengal State Electricity Boards transmission and distribution projects.																								Senior WBSEB officials confirm that the banks and FI have approached it.																								Banks and financial institutions had lost interest in this sector when multinational companies like PowerGen, Cogentrix and National Power exited the power sector citing lack of clarity in the governments policy.																								Moreover, investments in the power sector suffered a major setback following the payment crisis of Dabhol Power Company. 																								The Electricity Act 2003 promised to challenge all that, said a senior SBI official.																								However, the banks and financial institutions are pressing for a higher debt-equity ratio.																								The governments policy guidelines on power sectgor allow a 4:1 debt-equity ratio for private independent power producers (IPPs). While lending to these projects, most financial institutions insist on a debt-equity ratio of 70:30.																								The power sector is gradually becoming an attractive investment option with Tata Power Company and Reliance-promoted BSES emerging as major players in the power sector. The Essar group has also evinced interest in power trading.																								According to the power ministry, to add 1,00,000 MW of power capacity and associated transmission and distribution infrastructure by 2012 nearly Rs 8,00,000 crore would be needed in the next decade.																								However, non-availability of escrow capacity with most state utilities has been holding up the financial closure of most private sector projects.																								In view of the current policy discouraging counter guarantees and pending fructification of reform measures, the ministry has taken steps to set up an alternate payment security mechanism for investors as an interim resource mobilisation strategy.																								The mechanism has been evolved in consultation with IDBI, ICICI Bank, SBI Caps on the basis of a memorandum of agreement to be signed with states wherein the states agree on a milestone-based package of reforms like restructuring of state electricity boards, improvement in plant load factor, energy audit.

 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 L amp;T net profit at Rs 286 crore
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 4: Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L amp;T) has recorded a net profit of Rs 286.16 crore during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 on a sales of Rs 3,525.04 crore. 																								In the same period of 2002-03, the company had reported a net profit of Rs 265.63 crore and sales of Rs 3,175.45 crore.																								The engineering major clarified that the results for the reporting quarter do not include the financials of the demerged cement business. The previous years financials included the cement business and hence the two figures are not comparable. 																								The cement business of the company (excluding the ready-mix concrete) was transferred to UltraTech CemCo Ltd. Consequently, the financials of the demerged business for the last financial year were incorporated in UltraTech.																								During the last financial year, the company reported a gross sales and service income of Rs 9,870 crore. In the previous fiscal, gross sales and service income stood at Rs 9,807 crore. 																								Net profit for the year was at Rs 532.75 crore, while in the previous fiscal the figure was Rs 433.10 crore.																								Commenting on the performance of its various divisions, L amp;T said the engineering and construction business generated Rs 3,124.44 crore (Rs 2,274.73 crore) in the January-March quarter of 2003-04. For the full year, the company earned revenues worth Rs 8,252 crore.																								The order backlog in this segment was at Rs 16,961 crore as on March 31, 2004, which is 24 per cent higher than the previous year, the company added.																								The electrical and electronics segment reported gross revenues of Rs 290 crore in the fourth quarter and Rs 958 crore in the last financial year. 																								At its board meeting today, the directors recommended a dividend of Rs 16 per share.																								The company today ruled out trading of close to 15 per cent equity shares held by L amp;T employees trust on the bourses even if there is an appreciation in value. The employees would be guaranteed a 5 per cent return on their investment, it added.																								The buyout of Grasim stake in L amp;T would be financed through external commercial borrowings of Rs 200 crore and interest-free loans from L amp;T up to Rs 275 crore, said A. M. Naik, chairman and managing director. The 5 per cent return on the investments of employees will be made through the dividend proceeds after paying out the instalments for the loan, he said. When the loan is repaid after about 10-12 years, the returns to employees could be enhanced, he added.

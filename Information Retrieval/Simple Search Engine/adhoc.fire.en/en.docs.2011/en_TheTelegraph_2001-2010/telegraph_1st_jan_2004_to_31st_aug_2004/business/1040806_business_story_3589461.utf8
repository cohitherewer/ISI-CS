 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Ranbaxy hurt, prepares salvage balm
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: Ranbaxy has gone into a crisis management mode after a directive from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that three of its generic HIV (human immuno deficiency virus) may not be biologically equivalent to the original patented products.																								Putting the blame on the contract research organisation that had carried out the bio-equivalent studies, Ranbaxy has now decided to go for a new CRO who will carry out the bio-equivalent studies.																								Ramesh L. Adige, vice-president corporate affairs told The Telegraph, We cannot disclose the name of the new laboratory which will do the tests right now, but it will be finalised soon.																								Ranbaxy said that it would take a few months for the new results to be submitted to the WHO. CROs are accredited labs that are appointed by the pharmaceutical companies for the relevant outsourcing purposes.																								However, Ranbaxy does not rule out the possibility of not involving an outside laboratory altogether. The laboratory tests can be done in-house as well, said Adige.																								He said WHOs communication clearly mentions that the drugs were being dropped because the lab, which had carried out the bio-equivalence test, did not meet international specifications on data-handling.																								An audit was carried out recently by the WHO on an independent contract research organisation in India that conducts bio-equivalence studies for many international pharmaceuticals companies.																								During the audit, certain anomalies were observed in data handling and non-compliance with good clinical and laboratory practices relating to the bio-equivalence studies carried out by this CRO on three of Ranbaxys HIV/AIDS medicines or anti-retrovirals (ARVs).																								The anti-retrovirals are a triple fixed-dose combination pill containing lamivudine, stavudine and navirapine in two different strengths, and a lamivudine plus zidovudine tablets.																								A similar action was taken about two months back on Indian pharmaceutical company, Cipla, for two of its generic AIDs drugs. Both Cipla and Ranbaxy had been supplying cheap generic AIDS drugs to poor countries.																								However, while these pharmaceutical companies have received applause from several quarters, they have faced apprehensions raised by several experts on whether the cheap generic alternatives are of the same standards as the original.

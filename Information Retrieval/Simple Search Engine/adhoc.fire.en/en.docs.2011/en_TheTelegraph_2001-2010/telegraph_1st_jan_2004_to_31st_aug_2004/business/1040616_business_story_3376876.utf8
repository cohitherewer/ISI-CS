 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Tax cut hopes spur sensex clawback
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 15: Share prices today snapped a three-session loss with a gain of 69 points following reports that the government may bring down taxes on capital gains.																								Reflecting the upbeat mood of investors, the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange index rallied to an intra-day high of 4824.03 after opening weak at 4696.51. The sensex, however, closed at 4814.85 compared with yesterdays 4746.01, a net rise of 68.84 points or 1.45 per cent. It had fallen by about 218 points in the last three sessions.																								Brokers said it is still too early to say whether the equity market is heading north once again. Sources said many investors would still prefer to wait till the Union budget due on July 8. Minor setbacks in the market cannot be ruled out in the interim, they added.																								The volume of business is expected to be on the lower side as foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who made net purchases of over $120 million in the first half of June, wait for definite clues to emerge on the direction of economic policy in the budget.																								The rise in sensex was led by technology, auto and steel stocks. Market analysts said buying at lower levels in these shares saw Tata Steel gaining Rs 14.95 to close at Rs 287.85.

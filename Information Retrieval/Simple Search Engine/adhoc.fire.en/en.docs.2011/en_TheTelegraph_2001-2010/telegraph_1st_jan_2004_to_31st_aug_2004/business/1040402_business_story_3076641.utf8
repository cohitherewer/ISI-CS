 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Google to offer free e-mail service
																								Mountain View (US), April 1 (AP): Search engine Google Inc will launch a free, web-based e-mail service to compete against popular services from rivals Yahoo! Inc and Microsoft Corp. Googles service, called gmail, will include a built-in search function that will let people search every e-mail theyve ever sent or received.																								According to company executives, users will be able to type in keywords to sort e-mails or find old missives. And it will come with 1 gigabyte of free storage  more than 100 times what some popular rivals offer and enough to hold 500,000 pages of e-mail.																								But to finance the service, Google will display advertising links tied to the topics discussed within the e-mails. For instance, an e-mail inquiring about an upcoming concert might include an ad from a ticket agency. For now, Google is only opening up the service to invited users, but expects to make it accessible to everyone within a few weeks, Google co-founder Larry Page said on Wednesday.

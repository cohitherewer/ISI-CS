 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Chatterjee: Times running out																								Calcutta, June 24: Purnendu Chatterjee  the principal promoter of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL)  has missed the June 15 deadline set by IDBI to bring in Rs 143 crore. 																								The delay has irked IDBI, which has the largest exposure in HPL. Senior IDBI officials told The Telegraph from Mumbai, Time is running out fast. We will give the TCG chief another 15-30 days to bring in the required funds. If he fails, we may recall our loan to HPL.																								The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) had invested Rs 2,000 crore in the Rs 5,170-crore petrochemicals company, which has debts of Rs 4,200 crore.																								The officials pointed out that prospective partners like Indian Oil and Gail were only waiting for Chatterjee to come through on his promise before deciding to step in. Gail, which is keen to invest in HPL, has categorically told us that TCG should first bring in funds, IDBI officials said. Indian Oil, too, is open to the idea of picking up a stake.																								IDBI had asked Chatterjee to bring in fresh funds by June 15 so that HPLs loan rejig package, cleared by the corporate debt restructuring cell on January 22, could be implemented. 																								Chatterjee came to our office recently and promised us that the fresh funds would arrive soon. But we have not received anything so far, the officials said.																								The Bengal government had announced on June 14 that Chatterjee would bring in Rs 143 crore by June 15, and another Rs 57 crore later.																								IDBI said the lenders had agreed to restructure the interest rate and prolong the repayment schedule. Chatterjee had promised to pick up more equity as part of the recast package, the officials added.																								The debt restructuring package envisages an equity infusion of Rs 468 crore. Of the entire sum, Chatterjee is required to bring in Rs 268 crore as fresh capital. The HPL management had announced that Chatterjee would underwrite the unsubscribed portion of an initial public offer that was planned after the elections. 																								At present, HPLs equity base is Rs 1,153 crore, of which the Bengal government contributed Rs 540 crore, Chatterjee Rs 433 crore and the Tatas Rs 180 crore.

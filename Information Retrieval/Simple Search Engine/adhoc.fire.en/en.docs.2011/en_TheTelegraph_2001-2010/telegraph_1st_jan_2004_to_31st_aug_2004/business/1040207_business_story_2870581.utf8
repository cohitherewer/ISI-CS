 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Upgrade tells on stocks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 6: Bank stocks shot up today after Moodys Investors Services upgraded long-term foreign currency deposit ratings to stable from negative, even as BSE sensex jumped 66 points to end at 5786.35.																								While most have hit new highs in the recent past, they came off these levels as bears tightened their grip on the market.																								Moodys revision saw State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda (BoB), Bank of India (BoI), and Punjab National Bank (PNB) showing a considerable improvement over their previous closes. 																								While SBI shares shot up by Rs 14.10 to Rs 596.30, BoB rose by Rs 15.75 to Rs 236.25, BoI by Rs 2.50 to Rs 64.85 and PNB by Rs 6.35 to Rs 259.15. Private sector banks like ICICI Bank also joined the party to end with a gain of Rs 14.05 at Rs 322.65.																								Moodys upgrade has come at a time when some of these banks are planning to raise overseas funds. PNB is planning to raise a syndicated loan of over $200 million for textile restructuring. According to analysts, the rating revision may fetch funds for the bank at attractive rates.																								Last month, Moodys raised the countrys long-term foreign currency rating to investment grade Baa3 due to a reduction in external vulnerability, rising foreign investment and vibrant economic growth. 																								The third-quarter results of most of the banks have been good due to a growth in retail advances and core operations. 																								The rise in bank shares was one of the factors that allowed major indices finishing in positive territory. The 30-share BSE index ended with a gain of 66 points due to short-covering and fresh purchases by foreign funds. Recent figures show that foreign institutional investors have made net investments of over Rs 469 crore in the first two sessions.

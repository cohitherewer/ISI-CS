 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Price hike dilemma for carmakers
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Will they jack it up?																								New Delhi, March 24: Domestic automakers  who have been being affected by the surging prices of basic industrial materials such as steel  are caught in a dilemma: should they absorb the costs or pass them on to the consumer?																								With prices showing little signs of abating, automakers say it is already impacting their costs.																								Domestic steel prices have nearly doubled over the last year, tracking a global trend and rising raw material costs. The rising price of steel, used as an input to manufacture automotive cast-iron products and components, has pushed up overall prices by around 2 per cent, automakers said. 																								But the biggest worry is that any attempt to raise car prices in a cut-throat market could badly crimp sales. During the April-February period, the first 11 months of the fiscal, sales rose 31 per cent to 620,725 units after last years flat sales curve.																								Our different departments  which includes materials, imports, finance and marketing  are working to assess how much can be absorbed and how can be passed on to consumers, said a top official at Hyundai India.																								However, analysts said most automakers are waiting for market leader Maruti Udyog to raise prices of its popular cars. 																								Maruti has refused to blink so far and has, in fact, cut prices of three of its models  Omni, Baleno and Versa. We are very careful in increasing our prices as we realise the entire industry is watching and waiting for us to take the initiative to raise prices, said Maruti sources. But we also realise a part (of the costs) has to be absorbed and a part will be passed on to the consumer. 																								Maruti raised prices about three months ago, which was very nominal and ranged between Rs 500-2,000.																								Even if Maruti decides to increase prices, analysts said it would be in the same band. This would put pressure on other automakers , said an industry analyst.																								The continuous rise in steel cost is pushing up prices across sectors and if this spiral continued, it could hit the entire industry in six to eight months, said Ravi Kant, Tata Motors executive director for commercial vehicles.																								Tata Motors, which also manufactures the popular Indica cars, is trying to offset the impact of the higher costs by negotiating prices with steel firms and by cutting costs.																								Earlier in February, the government cut import tariffs on steel products by 5 percentage points in a bid to halt rising prices, but officials said this would have only a marginal impact. The tariff cut follow similar concessions given out in January and February, as the BJP-led coalition government moved to boost consumer sentiment with price cuts ahead of the general elections scheduled in April.																								The Indian economy, Asias third-largest, is forecast to grow a robust 8.1 per cent in the current fiscal to March 2004 with the automobile sector being one of the major beneficiaries of this growth.

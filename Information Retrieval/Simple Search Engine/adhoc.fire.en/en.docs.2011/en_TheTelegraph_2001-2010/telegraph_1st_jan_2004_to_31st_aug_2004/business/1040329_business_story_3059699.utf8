 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 28: Emami Limited, the cosmetics division of the Rs 600-crore Emami Group, plans to enter the Pakistan market through a joint venture with a local pharma company. The Calcutta-based company is in talks with three pharma majors in the neighbouring country and expects to finalise the agreement by this month.																								Prashant Goenka, director (international marketing), said: We will launch the Emami and Himani brands in Pakistan by June. A separate company will be floated under the JV agreement. The Pakistani company will market our products through their distribution network.																								The cosmetics market in Pakistan is estimated at Rs 1,000 crore and is comparable with the Indian market in terms of needs and usage. Emami also expects to commence manufacturing in Bangladesh by the end of this year to avoid paying export duties. It will invest around Rs 10 crore in the operations.

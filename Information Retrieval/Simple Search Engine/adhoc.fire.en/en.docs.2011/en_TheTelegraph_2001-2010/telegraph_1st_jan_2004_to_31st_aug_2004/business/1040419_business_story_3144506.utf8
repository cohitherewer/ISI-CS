The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Data bank for life insurers next year 
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, April 18: In a bid to compile comprehensive data on death and disability rates, the Actuarial Society of India (ASI) will form a mortality and morbidity investigation bureau by next year.																								A project report has been prepared and sent to all life insurers and the insurance regulator, ASI president Liyaquat Khan told The Telegraph. The bureau will be an autonomous body within the ASI and is likely to be in place by the middle of next year.																								In all major countries, there is a professionally-run centralised agency which collates data on mortality (death) and morbidity (sickness and disability) rates. The work is carried out by actuaries, Khan said.																								All 13 life insurance companies in the country and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) have already chipped in Rs 5 lakh each as initial funding. Our estimates suggest we require at least Rs 5 crore. We already have Rs 70 lakh, the regulator and the insurers will chip in with the rest as and when the need emerges, he said.																								All life insurers need mortality and morbidity tables, based on which the premium is fixed and liabilities can be assessed. These tables are extensively used for pricing contracts and evaluating liabilities for life insurance and pension businesses.																								Each life insurer will provide individual data to the society. While the individual data bank will be kept secret, ASI will compile the data and carry out investigations before coming up with final rates for both mortality and morbidity. 																								This would be then uniformly implemented by all insurance companies. 																								Data supply has to be either mandated by law or enforced by a regulator. But the process of investigation should be distanced from the insurers, else they may have vested interests, said Khan.

 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 New govt to clear air on BPO tax rules
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 21: The finance ministry is likely to come up with a comprehensive rule for levying taxes on business process outsourcing (BPO) units once the new Congress-led coalition government assumes office.																								Nasscom has given a representation to us. The Central Board of Direct Taxes may soon come up with a clarification before the new government presents the budget, revenue secretary Vineeta Rai told reporters at the sidelines of a tax conference organised by Assocham.																								Several software services firms, including Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services, had been served tax notices for subsidiaries which they claim should be enjoying tax holidays. Tax claims against Wipro are around Rs 26 crore.																								In January, the government had issued a circular, which sought to provide tax exemptions to BPOs in certain situations. 																								Software services firms began hiving off profitable units into separate units after completion of 10 or 11 years of operations to cut down taxes. Current tax laws only allow greenfield infotech companies to enjoy a 10-year tax holiday, and this is being seen as a way to dodge taxes.																								Income tax officials assessing these infotech companies have interpreted the law in a different way from these firms... it is now sub-judice and for the tribunal to decide, government officials said.																								They said the government does not intend to tax software services firms and would look into the policy to see if at all any change is required, once the courts are through this issue.																								Nasscom, however, wanted further clarifications on whether or not non-core activities of BPO companies should be taxed as earnings from these firms are expected to jump around 65 per cent to $3 billion this year.																								Rai also said revenue collection for 2003-04 has surpassed the budgetary estimate for the first time since the past four years.

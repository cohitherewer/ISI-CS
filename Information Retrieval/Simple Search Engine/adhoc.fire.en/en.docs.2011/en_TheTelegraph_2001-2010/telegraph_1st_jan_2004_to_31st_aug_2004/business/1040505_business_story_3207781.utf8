																								New Delhi, May 4 (PTI): German tyre company Continental is likely to pick up around 30 per cent stake in Metro Tyres Ltd with which it currently has a technology transfer and tyre and tube sourcing arrangement.

We feel our commitment with Metro is strategic and long-term due to which we are looking at picking up equity in the company. For this, we have initiated the process and I feel it will be completed by this year-end, Essiger said.

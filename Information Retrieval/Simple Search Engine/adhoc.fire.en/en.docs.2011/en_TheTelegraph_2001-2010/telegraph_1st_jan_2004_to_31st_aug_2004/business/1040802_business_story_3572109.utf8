 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Sanmar to cut insurance JV stake
																								Chennai, Aug. 1 (PTI): The Chennai-based Sanmar group has approved the sale of a 23 per cent stake in its life insurance joint venture, AMP-Sanmar Life Insurance, to Australian partner, AMP.																								The partners have approved the sale of a 23 per cent to AMP, AMP-Sanmar chief operating officer B. Natraj said.																								Currently, Sanmar holds a 74 per cent in the joint venture. 																								He said the decision follows the budget proposal to hike foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.																								The final sale of stake will be made only after Parliament approves the 49 per cent FDI limit in insurance, Natraj said.																								Asked if Sanmar has fixed any premium on the 23 per cent stake, Natraj said he was not in a position to comment further. It is up to the partners to comment, he said.																								AMP-Sanmar, which is among the handful of private life insurance companies operating in the country, reported a premium income of Rs 31.1 crore for the year ended March 31, 2004, up 378 per cent from previous years Rs 6.5 crore.

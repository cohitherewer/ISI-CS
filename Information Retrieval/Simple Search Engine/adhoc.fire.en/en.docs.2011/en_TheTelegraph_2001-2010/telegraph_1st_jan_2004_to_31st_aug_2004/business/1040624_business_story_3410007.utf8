 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 23: The processed food industry is seeking a plateful of benefits in the forthcoming budget, including the continuation of excise exemption, a 4 per cent VAT rate on food products and a uniform 8 per cent excise on food products.																								The processed food industry is pressing for the continuation of the exemption of excise duty on milk and milk products, fruits and vegetable products and edible oils that already exists for the growth of the industry.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Partha S. Mukherjee, director, corporate and legal affairs of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Products, said, The exemptions to fruits and vegetable-based products as also milk and milk-based products, which were given a few years back, should be continued for the stability of the industry.																								Mukherjee, who is also the president of the Confederation of Indian Food Trade and Industry (CIFTI), said the other pressing demand of the sector is that all processed food should have an excise duty of 8 per cent.																								CIFTI secretary Parna Dasgupta said, Nutritional and health foods, including malt-based foods, confectionery, ready to cook/serve products, processed meat and poultry products, currently attracting a tax of 16 per cent, should be brought down to a maximum of 8 per cent.																								An official of Pepsi, which sells the Tropicana brand of juices, said that market studies show that the fruit juice and fruit-based drinks in the country are poised for a 35-40 per cent growth, which will be largely possible because of no excise duty on fruit-based drinks.																								CIFTI officials said since the exemption of excise duty on fruit and vegetable-based products in 2001, tomato ketchup market has grown by 6 per cent, fruit drinks market by 15 per cent and fruit juice market by 25 per cent.																								CIFTI has also taken the matter on sales tax with different state governments. A series of meetings were organised with VAT authorities requesting for a uniform 4 per cent VAT rate on all food products.																								The representation made by the industry for reduction in excise duty rates from 16 per cent to 8 per cent will result in revenue loss in the initial years of reduction, admits CIFTI.																								However, it argues that the loss will get more than compensated within a period of three years, as the increasing marginal productivity of revenue will set in and by an increased off-take, if prices can be kept lower for processed foods.

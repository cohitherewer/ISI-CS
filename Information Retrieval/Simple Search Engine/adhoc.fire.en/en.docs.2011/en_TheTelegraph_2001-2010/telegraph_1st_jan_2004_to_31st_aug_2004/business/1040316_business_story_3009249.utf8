 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Better house-keeping helps Bengal cut deficit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dasgupta: Tough custodian																								Calcutta, March 15: Effective resource mobilisation, controlled non-plan expenditure and a cut in unnecessary spending through better internal efficiency have helped the Bengal government to drastically reduce its budgetary deficit from Rs 793 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 92 crore this fiscal. The government hopes to trim it further to Rs 85 crore in 2004-05. 																								The state has been able to control its expenditure on salary and pensions too, according to the vote-on-account presented by finance minister Asim Dasgupta today. 																								The growth rate of expenditure on salaries now stands at 5.4 per cent, while that of pensions is at 10 per cent. The government aims to limit the growth of expenditure on salaries to 5 per cent in 2004-05.																								Bengal has also reduced the expenditure on direct subsidy from the budgetary estimate of Rs 350 crore to Rs 307 crore.																								Moreover, the state government has saved Rs 488 crore by reducing the overall non-plan revenue expenditure from the budgetary estimate of Rs 25,126 crore to Rs 24,638 crore. 																								The Left Front government has also generated resources by higher tax collection from motor vehicles (Rs 101 crore), land revenue (Rs 355.28 crore), stamp duty (Rs 109.4 crore) and electricity duty (Rs 265.21 crore).																								Dasgupta said, Amidst financial crisis, all efforts on the basis of the alternative policy have been made to increase plan expenditure for enhancing employment and also mitigate the financial crisis by reducing budgetary deficit.																								He added that without introducing any new tax or increasing the rates of existing taxes and assuming any increase in the quantum of central plan assistance, the total expenditure in the next year has been raised to Rs 38,518 crore. 																								The plan expenditure for 2004-05 has been increased by 37 per cent to Rs 4,184 crore from 3,065 crore. The overall growth in the non-plan expenditure has been limited to 4.3 per cent.																								The vote-on-account envisages an increase in tax revenue by 18.4 per cent from Rs 8,825 crore this year to Rs 10,449 crore next year and non-tax revenue by 30.4 per cent from Rs 1,080 crore this year to Rs 1,403 crore next year. 																								This year, the growth in the states own revenue (tax and non-tax) has been 25.2 per cent compared with 8.3 per cent in the previous year.

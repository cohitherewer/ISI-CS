 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 H-P zooms in on the living room
																								San Francisco, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Hewlett-Packard Co will unveil a range of products, including its version of the iPod digital music player that raises the stakes in a war between PC and electronics makers for a spot in increasingly digitised living rooms.																								H-P, the largest computer printer maker and the number two computer maker, will roll out a 42-inch high-definition plasma television, a DVD home-theatre projector, new Photosmart printers and an entertainment notebook PC at a news conference hosted by chief executive Carly Fiorina in Miami.																								This years unveiling is Palo Alto, California-based H-Ps third consumer electronics showcase since it launched the Big Bang three years ago, and it reflects PC makers efforts to move into new markets as the overall PC industry matures.																								H-P is certainly a major contender in this race to get into the living room, said Mike McGuire, an analyst at Gartner G2.

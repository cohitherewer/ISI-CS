 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Jolt to Bharti merger plans
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: Bharti Televentures Ltds plans to embark on acquisitions and mergers have hit a roadblock. The company has decided to put the proposal on backburner till the middle of this year. 																								The move has been stymied because of the communications ministrys failure to get cabinet approval for the proposal to raise the cap on foreign direct investment in the telecom sector from 49 per cent to 74 per cent.																								Earlier, Bharti had planned to start snapping up smaller rivals from March to consolidate its position in the mobile phone market. The company is in the final stages of preparing the roadmap for its mergers and acquisitions. 																								Trai has already submitted its recommendations to the government on intra-circle mergers. 																								However, BTVL sources said it would not be prudent to undertake the acquisitions without the requisite resources to fund it.																								We are disappointed with the slow progress in clearing the FDI proposal. But we are still hopeful that the communications ministry and the cabinet will give it a second thought, said a senior executive in Bharti Tele-Ventures.																								We have enough resources and can also raise it from the market. But it will take time and the process of acquisition will have to wait for sometime, at least till after the election, the official said.																								Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of the Bharti Group, was gung-ho about BTVLs plans and had earlier said that the company would announce its acquisition plans from March.																								BTVLs maiden attempt for acquisition after migrating to unified access service licence received a blow when it failed to buy out the 27.5 per cent stake in Hexacom, the leading mobile operator in Rajasthan.

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 5:3 swap pill for Glaxo, Burroughs 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Great mix 																								Mumbai, March 10: The Indian subsidiaries of Glaxo and Burroughs Wellcome are all set for a legal merger.																								The boards of GlaxoSmithKline India and Burroughs Wellcome India will meet on March 17 to discuss the merger of the two companies. Deloitte Haskins and Ernst amp; Young will decide on the swap ratio and the merger is expected to be completed by September, sources said.																								While analysts are projecting a swap ratio of five shares of Glaxo for every three shares of Burroughs, the legal merger will see the formation of a Rs 1,390-crore pharma major, based on the results for the year ended December 31.																								The global operations of the two companies were merged earlier. Though the Indian subsidiaries saw an operational merger in early 2002, the legal process faced a roadblock as workers at Burroughs Mulund unit in Mumbai resisted the move due to wage disparities between the two companies.																								The Burroughs union approached the labour court to settle the 40 per cent wage difference with Glaxo.																								However, by the middle of 2003, possibilities of a legal merger of Burroughs and Glaxo in India looked stronger. In September, Burroughs informed the stock exchanges that it was on course to complete a voluntary retirement scheme for its staff at the Mulund unit.																								The company had accepted applications from 509 employees, with separation costs amounting to Rs 64 crore.																								The successful completion of the retirement scheme sent a strong signal that a legal merger was finally in the offing. Since then, it has only been a question of time, said an analyst.																								He added that the merged entitys portfolio will comprise vitamins and drugs in the respiratory, vaccine, dermatology and cardio-vascular segments. It would also include recognised brands like Septran and Calpol apart from anti-pyretic, topical anti-infectives and cold preparations.																								In 1995, Glaxo took over Wellcome Plc for 9 billion, creating the worlds largest drug company. Glaxo, subsequently took over Smithkline Beecham Pharma. However, in this case, the legal merger process was completed in India with a swap ratio of one share of Glaxo India for every two shares of Smithkline Beecham Pharma India.																								The merger announcement led to the Burroughs share spurting on the BSE today. Opening at Rs 799, the share shot to an intra-day high of Rs 874 and closed at Rs 856.95.Aventis files lawsuit																								Aventis SA, Frances biggest drug maker, and partner Albany Molecular Research filed patent infringement lawsuits against five companies seeking to sell generic versions of Aventiss Allegra allergy pill, an agency report from Paris said.																								Aventis and Albany sued Dr Reddys Laboratories, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Impax Laboratories of the US and Israels Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

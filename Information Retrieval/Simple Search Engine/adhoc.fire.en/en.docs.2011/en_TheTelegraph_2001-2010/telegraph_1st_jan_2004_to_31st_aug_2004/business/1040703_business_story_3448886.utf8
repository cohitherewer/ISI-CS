 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Move to diffuse bank ownership
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 2: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today suggested that the ultimate ownership and control of private sector banks should be well diversified and the percentage of foreign direct investment by a single entity or a group of related entities should not exceed 10 per cent.																								Releasing a draft of the comprehensive policy framework for ownership and governance in private sector banks, the central bank said private or foreign banks with a presence in India would be allowed to hold shares in other private banks only up to 5 per cent of its paid-up capital.																								The banks would be required to outline a time-bound plan for reduction in such investments to the permissible limit or 5 per cent, the draft said.																								The capital requirement of existing private sector banks should be on a par with the requirement for new entrants  which is Rs 200 crore initially  with a commitment to increase it to Rs 300 crore within three years.																								In order to meet this requirement, banks in the private sector should have a net worth of Rs 300 crore at all times. If it declines below Rs 300 crore, a time-bound programme for augmenting it should be submitted.																								On the shareholding norms, the Reserve Bank said the objective would be to ensure that no single entity or a group controls, directly or indirectly, more than 10 per cent of the paid-up capital. Any higher level of acquisition should be made with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank, and in accordance with the norms.																								The draft issued by the central bank said no corporate entity or individual should control over 10 per cent if the ownership is vested largely with companies. 																								In case of financial service firms, the objective would be to ensure that it is a widely-held entity, is publicly listed and is a well-established regulated company with a good standing in the financial community.

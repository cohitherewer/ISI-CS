 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Move to amend tax act irks auditors
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: Chartered accountants are seeing red over a provision in the Finance Bill 2004 that could send them to jail for a period of up to three years if the taxman can merely prove that they had a malafide intent while advising their clients on how to lower their tax burden.																								The big beef is over a new section  227 A  that the government proposes to incorporate in the Income Tax Act.																								For the first time, the burden of proof is being diluted: the taxman has to merely prove intention to evade taxes rather than evasion itself.																								The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is up in arms and wants the provision knocked off the statute.																								ICAI chairman Sunil Goyal and H. . Motiwala, chairman of the institutes fiscal laws committee, recently met finance minister P. Chidambaram to submit a post-budget memorandum which, among other things, said the new section 277A would create genuine hardship for professionals (read chartered accountants).																								The relevant sections reads: If any person wilfully and with intent to enable any other person to evade any tax or interest or penalty chargeable and imposable under this act, makes or causes to be made any entry or statement which is false and which the first person either knows to be false or does not believe to be true, in any books of account or other document relevant to or useful in any proceedings against the first person or the second person, under this act, the first person shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months but which may extend to three years and with fine.																								An explanation appended to this section reads: It shall be sufficient in any charge under this section to allege a general intent to enable the second person to evade any tax, penalty or interest which has been or would have been evaded by such a second person.																								Clearly, the section puts all tax advisers at risk.																								The government has projected a 24.6 per cent increase in its budget estimates for gross tax revenues this fiscal at Rs 3,17,733 crore (over the revised estimates of Rs 2,54,923 crore in 2003-04) and is preparing to unleash a drive to unearth tax dodgers.																								The institute maintains that while it fully supports any mechanism to punish tax evaders and any person who supports tax evasion, it feels that the dilution of the burden of proof to prove mere intention is likely to hurt tax professionals.																								There is already Section 278 in the existing act, which allows prosecution if the income tax department can prove tax evasion. But to extend it to general intent can lead to harassment of tax professionals, Motiwala told The Telegraph.																								He says an assessing officer can allege that a particular expense has been wrongfully shown as a revenue expense to claim tax deduction, whereas it actually is a capital expense. This can then be construed as an intention to evade tax, leading to prosecution.																								Experts, however, say this is precisely what happens when tax professionals exploit a legal loophole to enable their clients to lower the tax burden.																								The new provision will pose problems not only for chartered accountants, but also other professionals, including advocates and directors of companies, Goyal said.																								A senior ICAI spokesperson said, Unscrupulous tax evaders, when caught, may find it convenient to shift the blame on to somebody else, including professionals. The proposed provision will have serious ramifications.																								In its memorandum, ICAI has also suggested that to reduce the burden of the income-tax department, routine work like processing of returns and issue of intimation under section 143(1) could be outsourced to save time. The IT officials could then focus on quality assessment and investigation. For this purpose, ICAI has offered the services of its members who are located in every nook and corner of the country.

 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Gail roots for two Haldia board berths
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan 27: Gail (India) Ltd expects two of its representatives to join the board of directors of Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) and a 16-18 per cent stake for the Rs 332 crore that it has decided to invest in the company.																								Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee told The Telegraph that the gas giant would certainly have a say in HPL management and, given the size of its investment, would seek two posts on the board of directors.																								He said although he had been informally told about the banks and financial institutions clearing the debt restructuring package for HPL, the formal communication had still not come through.																								Gail pipped Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to the post for getting a stake in HPL. The gas major has managed to clinch the deal despite the bigger package offered by IOC since it did not insist on management control of the company in return for infusing funds. IOC, on the other hand, was firm on taking over management control.																								Banerjee also said Gail had asked the petroleum ministry to get another Rs 550 crore reimbursed to it from IOC, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation as they had had been paying less than the import parity price for the LPG supplied to them by Gail.																								He said that although Gail had received import parity price for LPG supplied during April and May in the current fiscal, the price had then been frozen at the November prices of the last fiscal for the remaining months.																								Gail produces around 1.2 million tonnes of LPG, which is marketed by IOC, BPCL and HPCL. The dilemma has arisen as cooking gas is sold at a subsidised price and the government lacks funds for reimbursing the full amount of the subsidy to the national oil companies. The only alternative to hiking the price of LPG is considered politically imprudent. 																								As a result, the national oil companies have to bear the additional burden. The stand of the marketing companies is that since they do not get the market price for the gas, they cannot pay this higher price to Gail either.																								On the issue of the Gail IPO, Banerjee said the disinvestment ministry would be handling the matter and the approval for the red herring prospectus from Sebi was expected to come through today.

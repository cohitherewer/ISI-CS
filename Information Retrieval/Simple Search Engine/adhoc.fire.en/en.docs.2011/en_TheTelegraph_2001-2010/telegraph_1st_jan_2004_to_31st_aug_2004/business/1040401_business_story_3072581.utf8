 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 31: India received a shot in the arm for its outsourcing business even as the US backlash against outsourcing from the country continues.																								India topped the Offshore Location Attractiveness Index by global management consulting firm AT Kearney, beating China to second place by a wide margin.																								India has not only been ranked first for cost advantages, but also for the depth and breadth of offshoring experience and people skills.																								India has extended a significant lead through its continuing cost advantages and its increasing market maturity. It has attracted the lions share of offshore migration activity to date without any impact on cost levels, said Stefan Spohr, AT Kearney vice-president and study co-author.																								While trailing India in language skills and experience, China ranks second, thanks to a similar combination of low-cost, high-volume skills. Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines also rank in the top 10, confirming the strength of Asian economies in the offshore competition.																								Although China trails India in BPO experience and qualifications, its cost advantages and large educated labour pool helped move it to second place. Chinas low wages will make it an increasingly formidable competitor. Chinas East Asian language skills, especially Japanese, are likely to give it an advantage over India.																								Offshoring today is about much more than labour arbitrage. Companies considering where to locate must weigh a complex balance of factors having to do with the availability and quality of the workforce and the business environment. There is no one size fits all, said Andrea Bierce, a vice-president in AT Kearneys financial institutions practice in New York and a co-leader of the study.																								Countries to which white-collar jobs are being offshored offer a range of attractions besides low-cost labour, creating a complex decision-making process for companies selecting offshore locations, according to the study.																								The AT Kearney Offshore Location Attractiveness Index analysed the top 25 offshoring destinations against 39 measurements in three major categories: cost, people skills and availability, and business environment.																								While Indias wages are comparable to other low-cost Asian locations, favourable tax rates and increasingly competitive infrastructure costs help India maintain its overall cost advantage.																								Indias established lead in IT and business process outsourcing, together with the quality of its IT training and management schools and English language skills, enables India to capture the top spot in the people skills and availability category.																								However, both China and India score poorly for political and economic risk and weak infrastructure. China scores particularly poorly in areas of intellectual property piracy and bureaucratic red tape. Most importantly, China clearly needs to improve the English language skills of its workforce if it wishes to challenge India.																								According to the report, Malaysia and the Philippines are emerging Asian contenders. Malaysia reached the number three spot in this years index.

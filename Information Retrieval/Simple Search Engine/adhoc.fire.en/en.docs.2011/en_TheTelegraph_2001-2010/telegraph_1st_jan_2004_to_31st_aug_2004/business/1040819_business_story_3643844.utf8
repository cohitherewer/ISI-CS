 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Google slashes offer size to half
				 	 News of Google Incs delayed initial public offering is displayed on a news zipper near the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York on Wednesday. (Reuters)																								New York, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Google Inc slashed the size of its closely watched initial public offering nearly in half to less than $2 billion on Wednesday, splashing cold water on what has been touted as the hottest internet IPO in years.																								The revision came as Google, the worlds most popular search engine, disclosed in an amended filing that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for additional information about the publication of a Playboy magazine article featuring an interview with Googles co-founders.																								The IPO could now raise as much as $1.9 billion, down from expectations it would raise $3.5 billion if the shares priced at the top of the estimated range of $108 to $135 per share. The shares are now only estimated to price between $85 and $95 each. Trading could begin as early as Thursday.																								Googles unusual auction-based IPO has attracted sceptics since it was announced in April, and the IPO is bumping up against a jittery market. Roughly 60 per cent of this months IPOs have priced below their estimated range, according to Thomson Financial.																								But market conditions are not purely to blame. Many investors said Googles initial price range was overly optimistic and were wary of investing in the deal.																								In addition, Google has disclosed since April that its general counsel received a notice that the SEC staff intends to recommend the commission pursue civil penalties against him; that the Playboy interview has drawn regulatory scrutiny; and the SEC has started an informal inquiry into Googles offer to buy back 23.2 million shares it may have issued illegally.																								Google reiterated on Wednesday that it does not believe its involvement in the Playboy article violated securities rules.																								They better get their act together, otherwise they will face a lot of investor scrutiny above and beyond what they probably deserve, said Christopher Baggini, who manages three funds with total assets of about $900 million at Gartmore Global Investments, adding that even $85 to $95 per share was not necessarily low enough.																								Shareholders more than halved the number of shares they plan to sell in the IPO to 5.5 million from about 11.6 million. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and CEO Eric Schmidt cut by half the number of shares they will offer.																								Google still plans to sell about 14.1 million shares.																								The Mountain View, California-based company disclosed the changes on its Web site, http://www.ipo.google. com. Google spokeswoman Cindy McCaffrey confirmed the website contents, but declined further comment.																								The SEC could not immediately be reached for comment.																								The changes cut the potential maximum valuation of the company to $25.8 billion from $36.6 billion, based on securities filings.																								The last thing you want when markets are fragile is a high-profile IPO running into difficulty, said Michael Browne, a fund manager at Sofaer Global Fund in London. Sentiment-wise, its not good.																								The company said it asked the SEC to declare its registration effective on Wednesday. Google expects to close the auction when the statement is declared effective.																								Google is using a modified version of a Dutch auction to sell its shares.

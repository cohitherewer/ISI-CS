 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 1: India Inc wants tax sops to turn green.																								In a survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 87 per cent of the CEOs surveyed say they should be given fiscal incentives (benefits in customs and taxation, preferential treatment) for demonstrating environmental compliance.																								Customs duty waiver on pollution control equipment, sales tax exemption, soft loans to install pollution control measures and higher depreciation allowance under the Income Tax Act from present level of 100 per cent to 150 per cent are some of the demands from the industry.																								Wastewater and air pollution is one of the main concerns of the industry. These were identified as the biggest sources of pollution, followed by solid waste, hazardous waste and noise pollution.																								The respondents to the survey included industries like chemicals, cement, textiles, pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and metals amongst others, which face major pollution related problems.																								The survey indicates that nearly 71 per cent of the responding industries have wastewater treatment facility and 66 per cent also have air pollution monitoring and control techniques in place. All respondents emphasised that they were taking measures towards environment management in their units and had installed environmental technologies, says the survey.																								However, nearly 72 per cent respondents still feel that more measures need to be taken up for wastewater treatment. It has the worst implications for environmental pollution across industries. Technology is needed in the area of recycle and reuse, hazardous and solid waste management, the study says.																								The survey breaks the popular notion that the Indian industry implements clean technologies and practices to enhance their acceptability in the export market, says Ficci. Respondents to the survey feel that the need to adopt environment friendly practices, processes and products is felt because it leads to huge resource conservation and cost savings, positive impacts for employees and the outside community.																								The size of the pollution control business is pegged at over $10 billion and is estimated to be growing at 10-12 per cent annually.																								The biggest deterrent for implementing environment technology is the high cost.

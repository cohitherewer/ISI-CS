 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Varishtha plan gets Rs 372cr prop
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, July 15: The government is expected to grant Rs 372 crore as subsidy to state-owned Life Insurance Corporation for the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana Scheme, which gives a 9 per cent return, a finance ministry official said.																								The grant is part of the governments commitment to the life insurer to bridge additional costs, as the interest rate payable is about 200 basis points higher than the return on investments.																								We are examining LICs request to release Rs 372 crore to meet the interest subsidy the government provides for the scheme, he said. The finance ministry will finalise it after looking at the insurers audited financial report.																								The scheme was introduced in last years annual budget by the BJP-led government as a special sop for the countrys 7.6 lakh senior citizens amid sliding interest rates on deposits.																								In 2003-04, the government had provided a grant of Rs 150 crore for the scheme, which had generated deposits worth Rs 7,000 crore from four lakh investors.																								The objective of this scheme was to ensure minimum returns of Rs 250 per month and maximum income of Rs 2,000.																								In his budget for 2004-05, finance minister P. Chidambaram replaced this scheme with a new savings plan for the aged, which would offer the same rate. The returns will be taxable.																								The government would continue to service existing policy holders and the cost would be met through supplementary demand of grants. There is no budgetary provision, he said.																								There is also a move to provide the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana subscribers an early exit option as it would help the government reduce its interest rate subsidy, the official said.																								The government offers an 8 per cent interest rate on administered plans for individuals and small savings, including post office deposits.																								However, the higher interest payment outflow translates into widening fiscal deficit and keeps borrowing costs high, which limits government spending on infrastructure  a pre-requisite to boost economic growth.

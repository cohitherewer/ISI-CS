(AFP) 																								Boca Raton, Feb. 7 (Reuters): World financial leaders, meeting in a Florida resort for talks on the global economy, face the tough job of agreeing on the wording to stop the US dollars drop from spinning out of control. 																								While comforted by the sharp recovery of the global economy over the past six months, many of the finance chiefs and central bankers from the Group of Seven club of wealthy nations are anxious about the potential currency fallout from huge US trade and budget deficits. 																								European G7 members, whose exporters have been stung in recent months by the euros surge to record highs against the dollar, said on Friday they wanted the group to agree to caution markets against further extreme currency swings. 																								Japan also called for more stable exchange rates while reserving the right to intervene in markets to cap the yen. 																								Couching a joint statement this time is proving tricky, with the United States happy with the boost a weaker dollar gives its own exporters  especially in an election year  and apparently unfazed by the pain it may cause elsewhere. 																								G7 sources said the communiques wording was still up in the air late on Friday and would not be finalised easily. Ministers said central bankers would be closely involved in that process. 																								US treasury secretary John Snow spent much of Friday in bilateral meetings with his G7 counterparts, aiming to defang their most potent criticism of the Bush administrations economic stewardship by saying action was under way to tame huge US budget and trade deficits. 																								In separate meetings with British, Canadian, French, German and Italian finance ministers, Snow admitted a whopping $521 billion projected US budget deficit in 2005 was too large but was on the way to being halved by 2009. 																								European and Japanese officials have warned that the US deficits  financed by borrowing from abroad  are a hazard to global economic stability and have used them to counter US insistence they do more to speed up growth. The tack, a treasury official said, was to argue that while the US deficit was large, it was understandable, given recession, a stock market collapse, two wars and corporate scandals  its understandable but we still want to bring it down.

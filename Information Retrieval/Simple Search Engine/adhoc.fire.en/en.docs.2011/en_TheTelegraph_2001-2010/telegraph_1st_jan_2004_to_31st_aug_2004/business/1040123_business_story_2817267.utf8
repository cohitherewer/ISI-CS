 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 CAs to help file online tax returns
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) will introduce a plan to enable chartered accountants and other tax professionals to act as e-intermediaries for filing of income tax returns and application of permanent account number (PAN).																								The e-intermediary scheme will be operational by the middle of March, CBDT member (investigation) B. Swaroop said. The finance ministry has given its clearance in principal. Through the proposed scheme a taxpayer can apply for PAN through a CA or other tax professionals like tax advocates or tax consultants to obtain it online.																								Similarly, the taxpayer can furnish all the details pertaining to income tax return, to a CA/tax professional who would enter the data on standard software which would be freely available and forward it to the departments servers electronically.																								The modus operandi for the verification of the data would be the digital signature of the e-intermediary to enable electronic authentication of the data. This programme is launched in response to requests by the CBDT to assist it in a user-friendly tax administration. The IT department will gradually focus on its core competency, leaving the other areas to other professionals, or simply put, by outsourcing, said Swaroop.

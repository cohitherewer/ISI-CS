 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Succour for investors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 18: The Reserve Bank of India today lowered the margins that banks have to maintain for financing against shares, initial public offerings or issue of guarantees to 40 per cent from 50 per cent. The move is expected to bring more liquidity in the hands of the investors.																								According to analysts, the move was spurred by Mondays colossal loss on the stock markets. However, the central bank said in a statement issued today, that this decision was taken on the recommendations made by the task force constituted for monitoring the developments in the financial markets.																								It has been decided to restore, with immediate effect, the status quo on margins that banks have to maintain for financing against shares/IPOs/issue of guarantees. The margins will now be 40 per cent against the earlier 50 per cent. Furthermore, the minimum cash margin of 25 per cent (within the margin of 50 per cent) stands reduced to 20 per cent.																								Earlier this year the margins against shares were increased from 40 per cent to 50 per cent when the market was experiencing a bull-run and the BSE sensex had breached the 6000-mark. In fact, the RBI had increased the margins only a day after the sensex had surpassed the magic mark.																								The move was then welcomed by capital market analysts who interpreted it as a measure aimed at insulating banks against the risks arising from lending against shares.																								Justifying its move, the central bank had said that though it has not come across any troublesome signals regarding banks exposure to capital markets, it would be prudent to avoid any pitfalls arising from a falling market.																								In May 2001, the RBI had prescribed norms, which required banks to increase margins on loans against shares to a uniform 40 per cent.

 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Lodha poser on mutual wills
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 30: The Birla-Lodha spat over the MP Birla group assets is intensifying by the day with claims and counter-claims flying thick and fast.																								First, the Birla family had said the will, in the possession of Rajendra Singh Lodha, could not be the last testament of Priyamvada Birla. Now Lodha, through his lawyers, shot back and raised questions on the two documents submitted to the court by the Birlas which they claim are the joint and mutual wills of Priyamvada and M. P. Birla.																								Satyabrata Mukherjee produced the will of M. P. Birla, while P. K. Roy produced the will of Priyamada Birla during the days hearing before Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta in Calcutta High Court.																								But Anindya Mitra and B. K. Bachawat  representing Lodha  questioned whether the documents were the first impressions of what has been claimed as joint and mutual wills. 																								Justice Sengupta, who heard the applications filed by the Birla family regarding filing of notarised copies of the 1982 mutual wills and inclusion of Basant Kumar Birla and Yasovardhan Birla as the executors of the two wills, also observed this and enquired whether the wills were original. The court will give its orders on the two applications on Wednesday, when Lodhas discharge of caveat petition comes up for hearing.																								Mukherjee and Roy argued that the documents bore original signatures and were with Kashi Nath Tapuriah, brother of Priyamvada Birla. Tapuriah was named as one of the executors of the 1982 wills. 																								Mitra and Bachawat also argued that the Birla familys filing of probate application was defective as it was not accompanied by the original wills. 																								We have given notarised photocopy, which can be compared with the original, argued both Mukherjee and Roy. They also added that they were concerned with the safety of the documents and so sought the courts permission simultaneously by moving an application in this regard. Justice Sengupta, however, reminded Mukherjee and Roy that they could not have cast aspersions on the department. 																								In yet another development, Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee released a petition, filed by Laxmi Bai Newar and Radha Bai Mohta in connection with restricting Lodha from executing the probate of Priyamvada Birlas, on personal grounds.

 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Rains spark stock dance
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 5: A wet spell in much of the countrys parched zone left markets awash in optimism and fuelled an 83.71-point jump in the BSE sensex.																								Investors encouraged by plentiful rains in the western and northern regions returned to bourses after the first sign in days of improved growth prospects.																								The sensex opened at 5178.61 and scaled an intra-day peak of 5257.32 before ending at 5252.78, up 1.62 per cent over Wednesdays 5169.07. The close marks a 12-week high. 																								The all-round buying was also driven by reports that boiling global crude prices had started cooling, having fallen to $42.62 on Wednesday from a peak of $44.34, dealers said.																								That 27 of the 30 shares in the sensex ended gainers showed just strong the sentiment was. Reliance, Hindustan Lever, Bhel, Dr Reddys, Hero Honda, ITC, State Bank, Tisco, Tata Motors, Hindalco, ONGC and Wipro were among the days performers.																								Steel shares also sparkled, helped by the recent round of price hikes. Lever was sought after by operators who expect rains to boost demand for its products. FIIs also kept buying, zooming in on blue-chips.

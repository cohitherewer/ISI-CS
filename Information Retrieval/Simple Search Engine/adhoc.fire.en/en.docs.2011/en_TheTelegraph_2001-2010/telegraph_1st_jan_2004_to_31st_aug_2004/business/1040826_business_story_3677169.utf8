 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Australian major plans alumina unit 
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: Australias BHP Billiton plans to set up a one-million-tonne aluminium project in Orissa. It is one of the richest mines and metals companies in that country.																								The company has already approached the Orissa government with a proposal.																								BHP Billiton plans to set up the project in phases, said Priyobrata Patnaik, chairman and managing director of Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Orissa (Ipicol).																								The company will be involved in mining, refining and smelting activities, he added.																								Although the investment figure could not be ascertained, Patnaik said it is one of the largest proposals in the state in recent times.																								BHP Billiton has also asked for mining lease for bauxites, a raw material for alumina. The refinery will be set up close to the bauxite mines, while the smelter may be set up in the Hirakud area where Indian Aluminium has a large plant.																								Orissa, which has the countrys largest bauxite reserves, has decided not to award a mining lease to a company unless it adds value to the ore. Sterlite Industries is also setting up an aluminium plant in Orissa. 																								BHP Billiton will export a bulk of the products produced at the proposed Orissa plant to Europe. BHP has a strong market in Europe.																								The Australian company, known for its iron ore and coal mines, plans to enter the aluminium sector in a big way through greenfield projects and acquisitions.																								The company has aluminium production capacities of one million tonnes at its five plants. It is planning to double the capacity in the next couple of years. The current alumina production is over four million tonnes and bauxite production capacity is 9.5 million tonnes.																								The Indian plant is being planned along the same lines.																								The five plans are Alumar and Valesul in Brazil, Hillside Aluminium and Bayside in South Africa and Mozal in Mozambique.

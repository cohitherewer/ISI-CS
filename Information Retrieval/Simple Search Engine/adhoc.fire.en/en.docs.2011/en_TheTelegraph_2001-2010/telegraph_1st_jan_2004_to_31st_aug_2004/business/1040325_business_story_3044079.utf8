 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Export jitters for infotech majors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 24: The rising rupee has sparked fears that margins of domestic IT companies could take a hit.																								More than 70 per cent of the IT sectors revenue comes from exports. Analysts say every percentage rise in the rupees value slices average margins of the technology sector by half a per cent over a longer term.																								In this calendar year, the Indian currency has gained around 2 per cent against the dollar, in addition to an appreciation of over 5 per cent in the previous year.																								Meanwhile, the rupee continued its surge against the greenback on the forex markets today as it ended at a 44-month closing high due to strong inflows from foreign institutional investors. The absence of intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) added to the gains.																								The currency finished at 44.75 per dollar, up from its previous close of Rs 44.87 in a spurt of around 13 paise.																								Anxiety over the impact of the rising rupee hit most of the technology shares on the bourses. While Infosys Technologies declined by more than 2 per cent or Rs 112.80 to Rs 5,044.70, Wipro came down by Rs 10.80 to Rs 1,384.50, MphasiS BFL by Rs 23.15 to Rs 545.05 and Geometric Software by Rs 9.35 to Rs 490.25.																								Apurva Shah, IT analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd, said in the near term, margins of leading IT companies will not be impacted as their dollar exposures have been completely hedged. However, in the medium to long term, we could see some impact, he added.																								The rupee rise has come at a time when the fourth-quarter results will be announced. Observers opine that leading IT companies like Infosys are likely to post numbers that are in line with the guidance given earlier this year.																								In January, Infosys upped its revenue guidance for the fiscal to Rs 4,823-4,835 crore, while the net profit was revised to Rs 1,232.64 crore. The full-year earning per share, expected at Rs 186.2, translated into a growth of 30 per cent in both revenues and net profit.

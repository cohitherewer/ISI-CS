The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Canara net at Rs 134 cr
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, May 12: Canara Bank has reported a 31.3 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 134 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2004 against Rs 102 crore posted in the previous fiscal. The bank attributed the growth in bottomline to an enhanced interest income, profit from treasury operations and foreign-business turnover.																								The bank declared a total dividend of 50 per cent for 2003-04. With an interim dividend of 25 per cent and a final dividend of 25 per cent in compliance with the latest RBI guidelines on dividend declaration, we have increased the dividend payout by 15 per cent over the last fiscal (2002-03), said R. V. Shastri, chairman and managing director.																								The banks earnings per share improved to Rs 32.63 from Rs 20.56 last March. The book value increased to Rs 125 from Rs 98 last year.																								In compliance with the prudential norms, the bank has also made a provision of Rs 1,239 crore for non-performing assets (NPA) against Rs 476 crore in 2002-03. 																								According to the Reserve Bank guidelines, we have also made a floating provision of Rs 800 crore for future NPA, which is over and above the prudential provision requirements, Shastri said.																								The bank, one of the major lenders (Rs 400 crore) to the Dabhol power project in Maharashtra, was optimistic of a positive result at todays meeting in London. The meeting would work out a financial package to revive the project. Like other investors, we are positive about the outcome of these discussions. It is only a matter of time, he said.																								With the 90-day limit for classifying the NPA coming into force, the bank has made a floating provision to take care of the contingent liabilities arising out of the dispute between the lenders and the Dabhol stakeholders.																								As projected, the banks total business (deposits and advances) aggregated Rs 1,40,000 crore in the last fiscal against Rs 1,12,600 crore a year ago, an increase of 19.03 per cent. Our total deposits have jumped to Rs 86,400 crore compared with Rs 72,100 crore last year, posting an year-on-year growth of 19.77 per cent. Advances increased by 17.71 per cent to Rs 47,700 crore from Rs 40,500 crore a year earlier, Shastri said.																								Interest income increased to Rs 7,000 crore, including income of Rs 3,800 crore from advances, over previous fiscals Rs 3,600 crore.

 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Korean strike jolts Hyundai
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: A strike at South Koreas largest automobile plant run by Hyundai Motors has hit its Indian unit, Hyundai Motor India, with sales falling 14.58 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal.																								The strike disrupted supply of critical components, which has resulted in lower production.																								Hyundai India, which competes with Maruti Udyog and Tata Motors in the high-volume small car segment, reported cumulative sales of 25,532 units in the quarter, down from 29,891 units in the year-ago period.																								Compared against a backdrop of an overall 21.51 per cent growth in sales of passenger vehicles, this would be considered a set-back for the Korean firm. Hyundai India had reported a 53 per cent jump in sales to 1.71 lakh units in the previous year ended March.																								Analysts said the automaker is unlikely to achieve its target as sales could ebb in the absence of discounts and the recent imposition of a 2 per cent cess that makes buying cars more expensive.																								A customer does not have much patience after making a purchase decision. One can always shift to other brands rather than join a long waiting list, an analyst said.																								A Hyundai India spokesperson, however, said the sales target for the year to March 2005 would be met by making up for the shortfall in the three quarters ahead. The waiting-period of our models, currently between two to three weeks, would come down to a week as production goes full steam from mid-August, said the spokesperson.

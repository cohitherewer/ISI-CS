Birla told reporters that the issue is subjudice and before the court.																								Interestingly, the Birlas have not placed their cards yet. The coming days will decide whether a family member or a professional will fill the vacancy on the board.

Century Textiles officials told shareholders that the vacancy will be filled up, but not in todays meeting. A senior official said the board will take a view on this shortly.																								The meeting was held at the Birla Matushri hall adjacent to Bombay Hospital, which is controlled by an MP Birla trust.																								At the meeting, S. K. Birla read out the re-drafted resolution to shareholders for approval due to the demise of Priyamvada.

Dalals re-appointment as directors was passed unanimously.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Revamp mode																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: As a high-powered Left-Congress panel tried to address the Lefts opposition to a range of policies, including privatisation of airports, an inter-ministerial group today asked merchant bankers  ABN Amro  to shortlist bidders within the next eight days for privatising Delhi and Mumbai airports. 																								The move is seen as a sign of confidence within the government that the fracas with the Left over the airport privatisation issue will be resolved in its favour at the end of the hard bargaining over this issue and the relaxation of foreign investment limits in telecom and insurance.																								Although air traffic control and policing will remain within the governments purview, the Left feels the kind of access a foreign power will enjoy if a transnational loyal to it controls most facilities at a major Indian airport will be enormous.																								The government wants some 74 per cent equity in Delhi and Mumbai airports to be sold to private entrepreneurs, including up to 10 per cent to airlines and 49 per cent to foreign stakeholders. 																								Not only the Left but many commentators have taken this to mean that the government is willing to let its two gateway airports be controlled by foreign players despite the fact that most of the European nations do not allow more than 24 per cent foreign investment in major airports.																								The 10 per cent stake being allowed to domestic airlines in these two airports is also being seen as a conflict of interest as only two private airlines are likely to try and buy this stake and not the two larger state-run airlines. In most airports abroad it is only the national airline that is allowed to pick up a stake.																								Bidders shortlisted by the merchant banker will be considered by an empowered group of ministers, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, before the Parliament session resumes.																								Bidders for the airport revamp include DLF-Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad combine, Reliance, Hyderabad -based GMR group in collaboration with Fraport AG and India Development Fund, Bharti in collaboration with Singapores Changi Airport, Videocon, and Essar.

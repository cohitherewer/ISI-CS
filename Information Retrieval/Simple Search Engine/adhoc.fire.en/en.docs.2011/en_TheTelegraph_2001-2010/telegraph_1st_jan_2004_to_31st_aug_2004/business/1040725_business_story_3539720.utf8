 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Customers flock to branches
 OUR BUREAU																								July 24: Worried customers of GTB today flocked to various branches of the bank in cities across the country to enquire about their deposits. 																								Mumbai police said customers had queued up at ATMs but there were no reports of any untoward incident.																								In Surat, angry customers ransacked the Salabatpura branch. All ATMs had stopped functioning which angered depositors.																								In Ahmedabad, a large number of depositors queued outside the banks branches at CG Road, Bodakdev and Maninagar.																								In Baroda, people gathered outside the Alkapuri branch. 																								In Hyderabad, although the RBI circular landed after the banking hours today, most of the fifty ATMs went dry two hours earlier. The branches also pulled down their shutters early. 																								However, GTBs corporate office was buzzing with phone calls and visitors as the news spread. Most affected were the software engineers who perhaps face a dry and funless weekend.																								I am shocked. I dont know what to do. I do not have another account. Now I will have to borrow, says 24-year-old Soumya, who works for Infosys Hyderabad development centre.																								Techies who had planned a weekend tour this evening are in a spot. 																								Your money is 100 per cent safe. It will earn interest during the period. Only you cannot draw more than the RBI prescribed amount for next three months, quot; a GTB official told another caller this evening . This is the 130th call I am attending, he said. Officials assured there was no shortage of cash at all the branches of GTB. 																								Yes, it will hit the operations of the corporate customers with the salary day being a few days ahead, quot; they said.																								Officials of Infosys and Dr Reddys said they did not anticipate any cash problems for salary payments. Thankfully the issue has cropped up now. We had time to ensure that our employees get their salaries through other routes, quot; an Infosys spokesperson said.

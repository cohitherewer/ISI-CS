 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Equity rejig to hasten Dabhol resumption
																								Mumbai, April 10 (PTI): Minority foreign stakeholders of the $3-billion Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said today the consolidation of foreign equity in the 2184-MW project would move it closer towards restarting. 																								Our position continues to be that a consolidation of foreign equity moves Dabhol closer to resumption. These actions are part of a comprehensive effort to reach a responsible settlement with various stakeholders, a GE spokesperson said in a statement here today. 																								GE, Bechtel and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic) have worked together to purchase most of Enrons equity in DPC and to resolve Enrons political risk insurance policy claim with Opic, he said.																								The statement comes in the wake of US bankruptcy court rejecting Reliance Energy Ltds (REL) higher bid to purchase Enrons stake in the troubled project two days ago.																								The US court ruled in favour of GE and Bechtel which had made a lower bid than REL as it did not have the backing of the state government and the domestic lenders.																								Meanwhile, domestic lenders led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, when contacted, said: The matter is too sensitive at this juncture and we would not like to comment. 																								Maharashtra energy secretary Jayant Kawale said: The state has taken all steps towards early revival of the project and the new development would not affect the process. 																								He said the state government had not appeared before the US bankruptcy court which rejected RELs bid.																								Earlier this week, the public-sector gas major Gail had signed a development agreement with Tata-BP consortium to jointly bid for the Dabhol power project.

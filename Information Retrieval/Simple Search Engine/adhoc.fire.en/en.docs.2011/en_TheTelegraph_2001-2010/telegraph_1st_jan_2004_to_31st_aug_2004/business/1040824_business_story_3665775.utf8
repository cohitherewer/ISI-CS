The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Crystal clear policy on bank merger
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 23: With the stage set for consolidation of the banking sector, the UPA government has asked the Indian Banks Association (IBA) to work out a policy for a transparent merger and acquisition (M amp;A) process.																								Banking industry sources said the IBA has already formed a committee to work out the legal and regulatory framework for consolidation. The committee has been formed last week, said a senior IBA official.																								The industry feels that the mandate given to the IBA by the government is a step towards consolidation of the domestic banking sector. In the long run, there will be two to three foreign, some regional and two to three national banks, industry sources said.																								The banking industry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) feel that the consolidation process will kick off in a major way from the end of 2005.																								The recent questions raised on the merger of Global Trust Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce have also forced the government to think about proper policy guidelines for M amp;A, sources added.																								An IBA official said, We will take advice from the international banking experts on M amp;A. A timeframe cannot be given at this point. We will try to table the report as fast as possible.																								The RBI governor had also recently said the country is ready for the next big phase of banking reforms and had voiced his concerns about the lacunae in the legal and regulatory framework for consolidation. He had also suggested a broad policy framework for the purpose.																								There is considerable speculation of the government increasing the percentage of foreign direct investment in these banks to 74 per cent. If that happens, one is likely to see hectic M amp;A activity for two reasons. The public sector banks are undervalued and a good banker can unleash the potential in them. Secondly, it is difficult for foreign banks to get licences to operate in India and hence, may use the takeover route to enter the domestic market.																								State Bank officials, however, said it might not be an easy job to merge public sector banks. It will take some years for this to happen. Each bank has a different culture and mergers might not be that easy. I would say the issue should be debated by each bank once the technology platform has been upgraded and the excess staff redeployed, they said.																								Bank of Baroda officials said increasing competition would compel banks to look at M amp;A in the years to come. The writing is on the wall. Circumstances will compel you to consolidate or perish. It will gain momentum from the next fiscal, they added.																								Meanwhile, to provide succour to the customers of Global Trust Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce today said lending rates would eventually come down in line with the PSU bank. Lending rate of GTB was higher than the market average. In order to retain and rope in more customers, we will bring it down to our rate level, OBC official said.

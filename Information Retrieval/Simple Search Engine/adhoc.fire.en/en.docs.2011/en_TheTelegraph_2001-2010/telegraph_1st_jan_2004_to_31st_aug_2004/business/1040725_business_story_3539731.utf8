 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 24: Tata Metaliks, an associate firm of Tata Steel, is keen to participate in the coke project being promoted by the parent company at Haldia.																								While speaking to reporters here today after the companys annual general meeting, chairman T. Mukherjee said the company has already discussed the matter with Tata Steel.																								Tata Steel is considering the proposal.																								The coke project, which will have an initial capacity of 8 lakh tonnes per annum, will cost about Rs 300 crore. Besides Tata Steel, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has a stake in the project. 																								According to Mukherjee, a decision on Tata Metaliks participation will be taken after a meeting of the shareholders Tata Steel and WBIDC.																								Incidentally, Mukherjee is the deputy managing director of Tata Steel.																								Tata Metaliks is also expanding its capacities of pig iron production from 1.6 lakh tonnes to 3 lakh tonnes. 																								The brownfield project will be completed by January next year.																								The company also has plans to diversify into steel making and castings. 																								Since Tata Steel itself is into steel making, it is not sure whether Tata Metaliks will be allowed to venture into this field.

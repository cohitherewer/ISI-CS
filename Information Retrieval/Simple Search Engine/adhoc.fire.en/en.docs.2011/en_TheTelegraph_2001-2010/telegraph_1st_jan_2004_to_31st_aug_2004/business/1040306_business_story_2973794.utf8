The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Govt sniffs sure-win in money game 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Shourie: As good as it gets																								New Delhi, March 5: The government today said it hopes to mop up at least Rs 13,100 crore from the sale of equity in six state-owned companies that hit the market in the past few weeks.																								Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said the mega ONGC issue was oversubscribed within the first hour of the start of the bookbuilding process. The oil giant has put 14.25 crore shares on sale  which amounts to 10 per cent of its equity. By now, bids for $4.85 billion (over Rs 22,000 crore) have come in, the minister said. 																								In these six weeks, we will have raised 3.5 times of what was raised in three years between 2000 and 2003 and a quarter more than has been raised in the equity market in India since 1998-99, said Shourie.																								Asked if the legendary investor Warren Buffet had put his money in the ONGC issue, Shourie said: I do not know. But if an astute investor like him is putting his money in ONGC, it is a vote for India.																								The ONGC issue  billed as the largest-ever public offering by a company  is expected to bring Rs 10,000 crore into the government treasury. 																								The government has budgeted to raise Rs 14,500 crore from the sale of equity in six companies, including Gail, IPCL, IBP, Dredging Corporation of India. 																								Stating that a milestone has been achieved in the divestment process in India today, Shourie said, Maruti and the six public issues will redefine Indias approach to the capital market. 																								Stating that there were specific lessons to be learnt from the success of the IPOs, Shourie said, The finance minister has suggested that we do a retrospective study of the lessons that we have learnt.																								He said that apart from such a study to be carried out by the disinvestment ministry, finance minister Jaswant Singh has said that a parallel study will be initiated by the ministry of finance. 																								The six public offerings will in all likelihood help the government to cross its revised disinvestment target of Rs 14,500 crore set for the current financial year and ahead of the general elections in April-May. Dredging Corp price																								The government today fixed the offer price for the Dredging Corporation issue at Rs 400. The offer closed yesterday and the process of actual allotment to investors started today. The government will receive more than Rs 221 crore from this issue.																								The DCIL shares have been oversubscribed 18 times, said Shourie. 																								Retail investors would be offered a 5 per cent discount over institutional bidders, which works out to a discounted price of Rs 380 per share.																								Against a price band of Rs 385-400 per share stipulated by the government, the final offer price has been settled at the upper end of the band  Rs 400 per share. 																								As much as 50 per cent of the issue would be allocated to retail investors and non-institutional investors, while the balance would be offered to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).																								Post-offer, the governments holding would come down to 78 per cent from the present 98 per cent. Kotak Mahindra Capital Company and Enam Financial Consultants were lead managers to the 100 per cent book-built issue.

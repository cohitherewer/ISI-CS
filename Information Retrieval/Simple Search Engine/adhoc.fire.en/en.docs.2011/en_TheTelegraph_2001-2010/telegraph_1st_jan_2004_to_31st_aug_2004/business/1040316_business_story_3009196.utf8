 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Bengal plan for closed tea gardens
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 15: The Bengal government would support the workers of closed tea gardens if they run the gardens on a co-operative basis.																								This was announced by state finance minister Asim Dasgupta while presenting the vote-on-account for the four-month period today.																								The state government has taken a policy decision in the interest of opening the closed gardens  that the tea produced by such gardens would be distributed through ration shops. If the workers are prepared, the tea gardens would be run through workers co-operatives, said Dasgupta.																								Of late, along with the tea industry of the entire country, the industry in Bengal has also been passing through a severe crisis. Out of the total 277 tea gardens in north Bengal, 22 have remained closed and in nearly 21 workers have been specifically affected.

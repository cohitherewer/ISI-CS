 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Package for small units in the works
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 24: The government is working on a special package for the small-scale and agro-rural industries.																								Small-scale industries minster Mahavir Prasad today said he would soon meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia to give a final shape to the package. 																								Senior officials of the ministry said the special package proposed to raise the investment limit for SSI units to Rs 3-5 crore from the existing limit of Rs 1 crore, align the interest rates for the SSI sector with those available to the farm sector and increase the flow of credit.																								The ministry is also working on a rehabilitation project for sick units which are facing closure. 																								Officials said the package is necessary as employment generation in this sector is an important component of the United Progressive Alliance governments manifesto, the common minimum programme. The SSI reforms agenda will be discussed at a ministerial conference beginning here tomorrow which will be inaugurated by Prasad. 																								Ministry officials said the reform proposals will also include bringing in progressive changes in the working pattern of the khadi industry. The other industries, which the ministry is planning to modernise, include handloom, powerloom, readymade garments, rubber, cashew, handicrafts, food processing, leather, woollen, silk and cottage industries.

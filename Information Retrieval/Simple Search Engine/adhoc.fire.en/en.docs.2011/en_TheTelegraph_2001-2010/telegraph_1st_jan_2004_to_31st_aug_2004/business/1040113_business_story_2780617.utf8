The foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) approved a proposal by Satish Raheja to acquire shares in Indus Hotels, an EIH associate, from his brother Rajan Raheja for Rs 39.25 crore.

Indus Hotels owns four Trident properties in Udaipur, Jaipur, Agra and Cochin.																								IndusInd Media also received FIPBs approval to convert its preference shares into equity and issue fresh shares to foreign investors. The proposal of the Mauritius-registered company is expected to bring in foreign exchange to the tune of Rs 63 crore. It has offices in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.																								The other clearances include a Yahoo proposal for increasing its foreign equity from 99.33 per cent to 100 per cent and a Moodys proposal to enhance foreign equity from 23.44 per cent to 31 per cent. The Yahoo unit in India, based in Bangalore, is involved in software design and development besides engineering services.

Sources said, Sara Lee would source casuals and shoes from Indian units for the export market as well as the domestic market here.

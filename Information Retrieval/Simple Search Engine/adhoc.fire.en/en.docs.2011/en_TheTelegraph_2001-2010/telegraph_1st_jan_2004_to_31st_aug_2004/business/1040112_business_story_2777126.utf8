 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Share sale to fund Hero Motors unit
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Jan. 11: Moped maker Hero Motors plans to raise Rs 125-150 crore through private placement of around 15-20 per cent equity to fund its new 4,50,000-unit-a-year motoscooter producing plant. 																								Hero Motors, owned by the Munjal family which controls Hero Honda Motors as well, will use technology from Italys Aprilia to make these motoscooters  hybrids of scooters and motorbikes  in the 75-125 cc range.																								The issue price for the private placement would be between Rs 40 and Rs 50 and the firm is holding discussions with several foreign investors, including IFC Washington, UK-based CDC Capital Partners and Citibank Private Equity Fund. 																								ICICI Securities, the investment banking arm of the countrys largest private bank, ICICI Bank, is the lead manager to the issue. The deal will be finalised by the end of the current fiscal, sources said, adding the firm is not ready to divest more than 20 per cent of its equity.																								Hero, now being spun off from another group, Majestic Auto, has tied up with Aprilia, Europes second-biggest maker of scooters and motorcycle, for the buyback of part of the production and supply of technology.																								The first of these motoscooters will be launched in October.																								The Italian firm will also buy back around 20-30 per cent of output for sale in Europe and other Asian markets which would help lower its production cost and improve competitiveness. 																								Hero is also aiming for a 10 per cent share of the domestic scooter market on the back of these models and is expecting to post annual sales of Rs 322 crore, including exports, from these products.

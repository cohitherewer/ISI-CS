 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Europe slaps 331m penalty on Microsoft
				 	 Mario Monti in Brussels on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Brussels, March 24: Microsoft was fined a record 331 million by the European Commission today  a financial flea bite for the computer giant but a big political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates. 																								The cash penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle Microsofts sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firms Media Player program. 																								The company was accused of breaching EU competition rules by bundling its own software and other services with its Windows system. That made it difficult for other software makers to compete  particularly as Microsoft withheld the technical codes, which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers. 																								Microsoft said the information was its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy. The strategy has worked well  more than 90 per cent of PCs world-wide run on Microsoft software. 																								Todays ruling in Brussels followed a four-year investigation led by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who said, It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position. 																								But the real battle has only just begun: Microsoft is appealing against the fine to the European Court of Justice and a final verdict could take five years. 																								Meanwhile, Microsoft will be seeking suspension of the Commissions order to start selling within 90 days a version of Windows without Media Player and to make available within 120 days the information other companies need to produce compatible rival server products. 																								Gates is furious that the EU is interfering at all when Microsoft is already subject to anti-trust laws in America. But Monti said the companys commercial methods affect millions of European customers and must comply with European Union laws. 																								The Commission, he argued, has a duty to offer monopoly protection to Microsofts commercial rivals  and its retail customers  in Europe. 																								With a bank balance of 40 billion, Microsoft will not be troubled by the size of the fine, even if it is the biggest ever sought by the Commission against any company. But the knock-on effect of changing the way Microsoft markets its products in Europe could be huge. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

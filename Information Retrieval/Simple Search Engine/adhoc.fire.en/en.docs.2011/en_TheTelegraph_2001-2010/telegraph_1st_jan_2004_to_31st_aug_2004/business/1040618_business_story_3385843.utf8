 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Bank heads sow seeds of farm stimulants
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 17: A farm package, including measures to double credit to the sector in three years, is expected in the budget to be presented next month.																								Finance ministry officials held a series of meetings today with Reserve Bank governor Y. V. Reddy, Nabard chairperson Ranjana Kumar, Indian Banks Association chairman V. Leeladhar to see how this could be done.																								Official sources said the meeting devoted itself to methods of boosting rural credit. Since the new government has promised a slew of measures for the farmers in its common minimum programme, certain steps are expected in the budget, officials said.																								According to figures released by the Reserve Bank, priority sector credit, a bulk of which goes to farmers, was up 25 per cent to Rs 2,10,000 crore last fiscal.																								The Nabard chief also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to appraise him about the progress made by the nodal agency in delivering agriculture credit and suggest measures to augment it.																								The meeting with RBI, Nabard and IBA officials comes a day after finance minister P. Chidambaram called on agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, who wanted the budget to boost rural loans and promote farm research.																								As the money managers scratched their heads on ways to shovel funds into the countryside, civil aviation minister Praful Patel asked the finance minister to reduce excise duty on aviation fuel in the budget.																								Airlines have been complaining about the continued spurt in prices of aviation turbine fuel. It remains a major area of concern. It should be reduced so that fares come down, Patel said. He said Chidambaram had agreed to consider the plea.

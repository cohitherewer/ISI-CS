 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 23: The Union small-scale ministry has submitted a petition to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to ask other ministries to buy more small-scale industry products.																								This purchase policy is an endeavour to give an impetus to the sector and achieve the 12 per cent growth rate envisaged by the Planning Commission in the Tenth Five Year Plan. 																								We have received positive response from 12 ministries, including defence, railways, rural development, science and technology and human resource, said Tapan Sikdar, minister of state for small-scale industry and department of Northeast region. He was addressing a seminar on the small-scale industry organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) today.																								Last year, the ministry of defence made purchases worth Rs 16,000 crore from the industry and we hope that this trend will continue in future, Sikdar said.																								The government has assigned a Rs 10,000-crore kitty for this sector. It has increased the limit of collateral loans and softened the interest rate by 2 per cent. Other incentives include introducing marketing activities and organising training and development programmes. These measures are aimed at reviving a sector having around 1,50,000 sick units.																								On plans for Bengal, Sikdar said, Three clusters, namely Baruipur, Kalyani and Talbanda-Boda, have been identified for a common facilitating centre.

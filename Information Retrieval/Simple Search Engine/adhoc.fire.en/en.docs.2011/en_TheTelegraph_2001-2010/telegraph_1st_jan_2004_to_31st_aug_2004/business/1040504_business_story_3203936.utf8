 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director O. N. Singh (right) with executive director K. K. Rai in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, May 3: Allahabad Bank plans to float a fresh Rs 100-crore public issue this fiscal to increase its tier-I capital from 6 per cent to 8 per cent of the total.The issue will have a premium. We may come up with the issue in the third quarter after the half yearly results are out, chairman and managing director O. N. Singh said.																								The banks share price is currently hovering around Rs 36. 																								It had come out with a Rs 100-crore initial public offer in October 2002, which was a runaway success. Following the second float, the governments holding will come down to 51 per cent from 71 per cent.																								The banks net profit has jumped 179.16 per cent to Rs 463.38 crore in 2003-04 compared with Rs 165.99 crore in the previous year. Operating profit has increased 69.97 per cent to Rs 876.25 crore against Rs 515.83 crore in the previous year.																								The bank has trimmed its bad loans to 2.37 per cent from 7.08 per cent in the previous year. The bank is now in a position to declare a dividend, for which Rs 78.22 crore has been set aside.																								In 2001-02, the bank had a capital adequacy of 10.62 per cent. We have written to the Reserve Bank seeking permission to declare dividend to our shareholders, said Singh. At present, the capital adequacy of the bank is 12.52 per cent.																								According to the RBIs revised guidelines, only banks that have a capital adequacy of 11 per cent for three consecutive years and bad loans (NPAs) less than 3 per cent of their assets can declare dividends without prior central bank approval. 																								Allahabad Bank, which was considered sick a few years back, has achieved a 3 per cent investment fluctuation reserve. Most banks in the country are yet to achieve this parameter.

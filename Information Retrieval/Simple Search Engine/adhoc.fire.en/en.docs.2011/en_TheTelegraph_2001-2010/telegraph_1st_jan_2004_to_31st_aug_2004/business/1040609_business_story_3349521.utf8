 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Duty plea for coastal ships
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, June 8: The shipping ministry has moved a proposal to waive the duty on spares procured by shipping companies for the repair of vessels plying on the coastal route. 																								The waiver is expected to provide both an incentive for coastal shipping and a level-playing field as ships repaired abroad do not have to pay such a duty. 																								Sources say the proposal was discussed recently at a meeting chaired by surface transport minister T. R. Baalu. The matter has been discussed between the shipping ministry and finance ministry officials, and is now likely to be taken up by the minister.																								Baalu is reported to have asked the shipping ministry officials to thrash out all issues and draw up a comprehensive proposal to promote coastal shipping.																								His ministry is keen to boost coastal shipping as it is considered more economical than road or rail transport, which are already stretched. In advanced countries, the share of cargo moved through coastal shipping is as high as 35 per cent compared with 7 per cent in India. 																								The other problem faced by coastal vessels highlighted at the meeting was that they have to pay a duty on bunker fuel even though it is provided by domestic companies within the country. Shipping firms claim that fuel costs account for as much as 41 per cent of the total expenditure for coastal vessels and a lowering of its cost would come as a major incentive.																								The handling charges for coastal ships is another area that came up for discussion. Sources said representatives of shipping companies complained that the tariff authority for major ports had revised handling and vessel-related charges unilaterally and linked rates on coastal liners to international ships. They also informed the minister of denominating the charges in rupees, instead of dollars, as is the case at present.																								The need for developing more minor parts is also considered essential if the share of coastal cargo has to be increased. The minister is reported to have asked for more details on the minor ports which can be developed. 																								Sources said the minister shot down shipping secretary D. T. Josephs proposal to impose a 5 paise per kg cess on coastal cargo, a move that would have created a development corpus.

 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Coal India stares at Rs 500cr cash drain every year
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Feb. 15: Coal India Limited will have to cough up Rs 500 crore every year for the 15 per cent interim relief that Union coal and mines minister Mamata Banerjee promised its six lakh employees until a wage settlement formalising the give-away is reached. Sources said Banerjee has asked the management to speed up the payment of the money.																								While employees have welcomed the announcement, sources said there will be an adverse impact on the overall cash flow of the company which may jeopardise some investment programmes.																								The announcement has come so suddenly that Coal India subsidiaries, especially those which are in the red, will find it difficult to comply with. There will be a pressure on the cash flow situation at least in the short term, a senior Coal India executive said.																								The management also fears several unforeseen expenditure on projects which might remain on hold till the financial restructuring of its loss-making subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields (ECL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL) and Central Coalfields (CCL) were completed.																								The combined erosion in networths of ECL, BCCL and CCL amount to over Rs 5000 crore as on March 2002. The figure has gone up substantially (about Rs 1000 crore) in the last financial year as well. Under such circumstances, our priority was to reduce losses in these subsidiaries through technology upgradation as well as manpower reduction, he said. 																								The revival strategies may hamper the immediate payment of interim relief and meeting other social obligations, he added.																								Incidentally, the coal minister has already laid the foundation stone for a 100-bed super multi-speciality hospital in Calcutta which will eat into Coal Indias coffers by over Rs 100 crore.																								The minister has also announced that Coal India will help renovating Swami Vivekanandas house as well as Purulia Ramkrishna Mission. This apart, donations will be given to some clubs which will be announced later, she said.																								The minister announced Rs 10,000 crore worth of revival plans for the loss-making coal companies, including Eastern Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal.																								In the Tenth Plan, the company had projected an investment of Rs 1,460 crore for Eastern Coalfields and Rs 1,300 crore for Bharat Coking Coal. 																								The minister has, however, announced investments of Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 4,000 crore for Eastern Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal, respectively.																								The Coal India executive added that the source of the surplus fund was not clear.

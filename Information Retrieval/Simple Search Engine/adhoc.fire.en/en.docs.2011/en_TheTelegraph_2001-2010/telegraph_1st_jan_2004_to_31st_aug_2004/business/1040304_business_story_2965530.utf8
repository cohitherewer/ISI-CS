The government has also reserved a 10 per cent of the public offer each for employees/wholetime directors and shareholders of ONGC and MRPL. The price band declared today is understood to be higher than the Rs 650-680 band recommended by advisers.																								The ONGC offer is the largest of the six being floated by the government this fiscal. The issue opens on March 5 and closes on March 13.																								The government will offer 11.40 crore shares to qualified institutional bidders, non-institutional investors and retail investors through the book-built issue.																								The government has also decided to treat applications worth Rs 50,000 or less as retail bids and, therefore, eligible for a 5 per cent discount.

DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak Mahindra Capital and J M Morgan Stanley have been appointed lead managers to the book-built issue.

Meanwhile, the disinvestment ministry has decided that only large investors will be allowed to use the participatory notes (PN) route for the ONGC issue.

The market regulator has already allowed lead managers and book runners to issue participatory notes to attract foreign investment but the official communication is expected by tomorrow.

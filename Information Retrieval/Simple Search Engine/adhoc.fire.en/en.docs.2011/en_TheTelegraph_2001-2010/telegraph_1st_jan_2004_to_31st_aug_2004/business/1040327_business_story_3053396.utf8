 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Rs 3000-cr Purnendu refinery at Haldia in the pipeline
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 Chatterjee: On a new missionCalcutta, March 26: The Chatterjee Group (TCG) of Purnendu Chatterjee is planning a refinery at Haldia in a joint venture with partners who have not been picked yet.																								At an initial cost of Rs 3000 crore, the six-million tonne project is billed as the largest slice of investment that could come to Bengal after Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL).																								A director who sits on the TCG board said the group has been allotted 350 acres of the 1000 acres it sought to set up the refinery, which will produce petrol, diesel, LPG and naphtha  a key input for HPL.																								Haldia Development Authority (HDA) has already given us 350 acres for the project, while another 150 acres is expected to be handed soon, the TCG official said. 																								Sources within the group say an advance of over Rs 25 crore has already been paid for the 500-acre allotment.																								To be called Haldia Refinery Ltd (HRL), the project is being planned by Chatterjee at a time when cash problems at Haldia Petrochemicals, of which he is a promoter, are far from over. 																								HDA chairman Lakhsman Seth said Chatterjee requested him for land to build the project, in alliance with a global oil giant who was still being persuaded to join. The identity of the company in talks is not known. Nor is it known if the Bengal government will come on board.																								In telephone conversations with him, Chatterjee sounds upbeat about the refinery, which will benefit HPL hugely through assured naphtha supplies, Seth said. 																								TCGs requests for land coincide with HPLs intention to ramp up capacity ahead of an expected break-even. Seth said the proposed refinery project shows that TCGs keenness to invest in Bengal had not waned. 																								The group has a presence in a variety of areas, including petrochemicals, software and information technology and biotechnology. It has poured Rs 540 crore into HPL, Rs 100 crore into TCG Software, Rs 50 crore into Chembiotech and Rs 50 crore into Bengal Intelligent Park.																								Sources say a refinery of the scale envisaged by TCG will have many spin-offs, but the most important of those will be the naphtha comfort for Haldia Petrochem.

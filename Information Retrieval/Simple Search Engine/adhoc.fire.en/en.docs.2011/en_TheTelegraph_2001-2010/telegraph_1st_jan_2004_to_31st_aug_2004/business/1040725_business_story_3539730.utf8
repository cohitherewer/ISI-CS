 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 FM plays consensus tune
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 24: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today expressed the need to evolve a consensus on the tax regime over the next seven months.																								Now that the Kelkar panel report is out, I urge you (industry) to set up groups and study the report. We have seven months for the next budget. We can arrive at a consensus. If we build up a sensible tax regime, it will be a major success story of 2005, Chidambaram said at a post-budget discussion organised by Assocham.																								The Kelkar committee on fiscal management has largely sought to revamp income tax slabs and rationalise savings incentives, while retaining tax sops for housing and senior citizens. It has also proposed a nationwide value-added tax (VAT) on all goods and services.																								The report has recommended tax exemption on income up to Rs 1 lakh, a 20 per cent tax on income between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 4 lakh and 30 per cent on income beyond Rs 4 lakh.																								The Rakesh Mohan Committee proposed that small savings rates should not move by more than 1 percentage point either way in a year.																								The committee also suggested that Kisan Vikas Patra and National Savings Certificates (series VII) should be scrapped but favoured the continuation of the public provident fund (PPF). 																								The minister said, Agriculture is crying for our attention. If it does well, then it will have manifold ramifications.																								Reiterating the need to make agriculture sector investment oriented, Chidambaram sought greater spending to ensure large investments in the farm sector.																								At present, investment in agriculture is 11.2 per cent of the GDP, Chidambaram said.																								Lashing out at the BJP for shifting its stand on foreign direct investment (FDI), he said, My differences do not arise with people who hold their positions, but from those who change it. The minister was referring to the BJPs opposition to the proposal of removing sectoral caps on insurance, civil aviation and telecommunications.																								I have less difficulty in convincing the Left parties on FDI. I have more difficulty in convincing the BJP, Chidambaram said.																								He also asked industry captains to invite the Left, BJP and regional parties and explain to them the benefits that FDI hike would bring about in industrial and economic growth.																								I am already convinced. You should rather invite these people and make them understand. It would be a more constructive exercise, he said. 																								In this years budget, Chidambaram has proposed to increase the FDI cap from 26 to 49 per cent in insurance, 40 to 49 per cent in civil aviation and 49 to 74 per cent in telecom.																								Chidambaram criticised the NDA for not being aware of the basic functioning of the Planning Commission and accusing him of not elaborating on the additional Rs 10,000 crore fund allocation in the budget.																								It is so elementary. The Planning Commission made the allocation in February-March. I cant change it. Unless the new Planning Commission reprioritises allocation, I have no power to change it, he explained.

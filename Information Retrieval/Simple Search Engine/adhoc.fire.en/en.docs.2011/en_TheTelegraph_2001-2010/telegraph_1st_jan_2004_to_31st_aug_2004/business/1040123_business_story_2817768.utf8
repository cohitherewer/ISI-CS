The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 TCG boss in anxious wait
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 22: Fingers crossed, Purnendu Chatterjee, waited patiently in the ante room on the mezzanine floor of IDBI Towers, the venue of the meeting that would decide HPLs future course. 																								The TCG boss, who flew in from New York, resisted blandishments to speak till a decision was reached. And, that took quite a while before the promoters were called in at around 7.30 this evening.																								Your interest is reasonable, Chatterjee told The Telegraph. In fact, all of us are interested to know about the fate of the project, he added. 																								There were other companies waiting to be heard too. These included Essar Steel and Pennar Steel both of which had sent their officials to present their cases.

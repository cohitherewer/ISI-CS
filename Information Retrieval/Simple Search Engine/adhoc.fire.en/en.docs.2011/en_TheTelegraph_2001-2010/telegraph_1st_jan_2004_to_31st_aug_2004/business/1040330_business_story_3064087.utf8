The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 WBSEB charged up on tariff cut
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, March 29: The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) is working on a plan to bring down tariffs so that consumers get power at competitive rates.																								To begin with, the power board has decided to settle for a lower-than-contemplated increase in tariff in the next fiscal beginning April 1. However, from 2005-06, the power board will start lowering tariffs after implementing certain cost-cutting measures. 																								For 2004-05, the board has proposed a 12.5 per cent hike, which is lower than what was expected, said a senior WBSEB official. 																								Industry had been demanding the removal of cross-subsidy on the tariff payable by them. The board recently met leading chambers of the city to discuss the issue.																								We thought it was important to tell the industry that the board is trying to reduce costs to bring down the cross-subsidy portion. Moreover, we also wanted to inform them about our new purchase policy, a top official of the board said. 																								The board has introduced a new purchase policy that will reduce cartelisation and the role of middlemen drastically. 																								We purchase Rs 200 crore of equipment annually. And if cartelisation and the participation of middlemen is reduced, the board will be able to save quite a good amount. This will have an impact on the tariff for 2005-06, the official added.																								WBSEBs tariff comprises four factors  power purchase from the West Bengal Power Development Corporation, transmission and distribution loss, interest cost and purchase of equipment.																								WBSEB chairman Sanjay Mitra told The Telegraph, We are trying to reduce cost in all areas. We will unfold those measures gradually. We want to provide power to the customers at competitive rates and bring transparency in the boards operations.																								In its new purchase policy, the board has said that state-level concessions like price preferences apply only to bonafide manufacturers/units located within the state. Evidence of unfair trade practice, including overcharging, price fixing or cartelisation, will automatically disqualify the parties. In these cases, the board will be free to procure from any other source.																								Similarly, manufacturers who are unable to offer a specific percentage (not less than 20 per cent) of total tendered quantity should not apply and if the offer is found to be less than the said quantity, the board reserves the right to cancel the tender.

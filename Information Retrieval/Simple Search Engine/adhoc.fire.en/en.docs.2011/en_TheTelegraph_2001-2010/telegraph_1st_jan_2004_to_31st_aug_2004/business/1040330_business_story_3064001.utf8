 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 LG unveils low-priced fridge for rural India
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 29: LG Electronics India Limited, the consumer electronics giant, plans to launch sub-Rs 5,000 category of refrigerators for the rural and semi-urban population.																								We plan to launch 150-160 litre direct-cool refrigerators by July this year. The sub-Rs 5,000 category of direct-cool refrigerators is essentially targeted towards the rural population who cannot afford premium products, said Ajay Bajaj, product group head-refrigerator, LGEIL. 																								However, its closest competitor Samsung has no such plans. While the companys starting range of direct-cool refrigerator is already Rs 7,900 for a 170-litre direct-cool fridge, a Samsung official said, Our strategy is to give maximum value addition in both volume and premium products.																								Well-known domestic majors like Godrej and Videocon are currently selling 170-litre direct-cool refrigerators in the Rs 5,800 price segment.																								LGEIL, which currently manufactures up to 310 litre refrigerators in India, also plans to manufacture 400 litre refrigerators, to be rolled out from their new manufacturing facility in Pune. LGEIL imports the above 350-litre category of refrigerators from its parent company based in Korea.																								Speaking on the issue of rupee appreciation, K. R. Kim, managing director, LGEIL, said, This will hurt approximately 5 per cent of the total revenue that we earn from our exports. 																								LG India has set an export target of $70 million this year, against $40 million in calendar year 2003.																								LG India, which at present contributes 5 per cent to the Korean groups total global sales, hopes to contribute roughly 10 per cent in the next two to three years, said Kim. 																								The company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Korean parent, is eyeing a sales turnover of Rs 7,000 crore this year, a jump of 55.5 per cent from Rs 4,500 crore in 2003.

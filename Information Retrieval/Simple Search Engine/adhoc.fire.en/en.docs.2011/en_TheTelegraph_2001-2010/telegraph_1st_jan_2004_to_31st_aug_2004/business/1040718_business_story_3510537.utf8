 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Move to limit product patent applications
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, July 17: The product patent regime is due to be introduced in India next year but patent law experts are scrambling to restrict it to only basic novel applications.																								The contention of these experts who are taking a cue from the Mashelkar report  is that patent claims that represent minor improvement over existing product/process should not be recognised.																								B. K. Keayla, convenor of the national working group on patent laws, said, The mail box provision on applying for patents is so loose that the office of the controller general of patents in Mumbai has got more than 7000 applications.																								Such a large number of applications are beyond the capacity of the government department to handle, which in any case is short-staffed. 																								Second, there is no rationale for granting patents on small improvements or simple dosage alterations. 																								Patents on even minor improvements or dosage variations, against those for inventions of new molecules will only lead to patents on almost everything, leading to monopolistic situations that will result in higher pricing of products, said Keayla. 																								Interestingly, research-based multinational companies are not exactly averse to indiscriminate patenting. Some companies have gone ahead to file patents even for dosage forms and by doing minor tweakings here and there, which is not welcome, said Anurag Khera, senior manager (corporate affairs) of Eli Lilly. 																								There has to be some invention, as the word suggests, for a patent to be granted. There has to be a total value addition and it has to comply with the TRIPS norms, said Khera.																								Patent experts point out that there are several flexibilities that are available under the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Doha declaration.																								The ministry of commerce and industry should work on the interpretations so that the flexibility clauses can be used to disallow indiscriminate use of patents, said Keayla. 																								The National working group on patent laws, under the chairmanship of Nityanand (ex-director, Central Drug Research Institute), are seeking that the final patents amending bill, which the UPA government will have to introduce, incorporates the necessary provisions to this effect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 ONGC share row likely to end today
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Air clears																								Mumbai, March 30: Problems in the allotment of new ONGC shares to affluent  those seeking to pour in over Rs 50,000  investors are expected to be sorted out before Wednesdays trading starts on stock exchanges.																								Depository authorities working until late this evening were confident that the error of crediting extra shares to this class of investors would be removed.																								MCS, the registrar at the centre of the row, had to swallow its pride by seeking help from Karvy Consultants, its main rival in the business of share processing.																								Officials from Karvy, NSDL, CDSL and the two leading stock exchanges, NSE and BSE, were trying to rectify the problem till late in the evening amid signs the process of correcting records would be through tonight.																								The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), too, indicated that the pay-in for ONGC transactions would be smooth. The market regulator, however, did not say whether the sellers would be compensated or asked to bear the loss. Exchanges have already been asked to reverse deals struck in the stock early on Monday.																								The damage control showed on the stock, which witnessed comparatively far less volatility. It opened at Rs 838.35 on BSE, hit an intra-day high of Rs 846.50 and plumbed a low of Rs 820 before closing at Rs 839.60. The turnover, too, shrunk to Rs 85.87 crore from Mondays Rs 290 crore. Operators are betting that the scrip will return to the top of the volumes-chart tomorrow, if irritants in the allotment process are removed. 																								The rise in trading will come with increased volatility though, as new shares make their way into the market. Some investors would try to cash in and make money by selling, while several institutions are expected to buy the stock if it loses considerable ground. 																								High net-worth investors were on Monday allotted all the shares they bid for, overshooting their quota of 60 per cent of bids. The blame fell on MCS, the registrars to the issue. Market sources reckon that MCS was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job  allotment of 14.25 crore shares was to be done in a short span of time.Power Trading																								The torrid time for registrars continued. The listing of Power Trading Corporation was postponed for the second time today as the share allotment was unfinished. The debut, put off from March 29 to March 31, was delayed further as MCS, the registrars to this issue as well, could not wrap up allotments due to the large issue size.

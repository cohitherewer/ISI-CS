 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 23: The reduction in prices is likely to hit the bottomlines of all steel firms, although the impact on those lacking vertically integrated operations will be higher.																								Steel analysts feel that the burden of todays price cuts will be more pronounced for Essar Steel, Ispat Industries, Jindal Vijaynagar Steel and a few others than well-integrated majors like Tata Steel.																								They, however, expect the negative impact on the bottomlines to be anywhere between 7 and 10 per cent from their present estimates.																								All steel companies will be affected by the price cuts. However, the impact will be more for players who are not integrated, Khandwala Securities senior research analyst Anant Katare averred.																								Katare said the bottomline of Tisco will be cushioned to some extent by its low cost structure and an in-house availability of most of its raw materials, including coking coal. Analysts expect the bottomline of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) to be less affected, even though the company sources most of its coking coal from overseas. Sources said apart from the advantage of having captive iron ore and coal mines, these majors have also improved their product mix with value-added goods and branded products contributing substantially to their toplines.

 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Chinese growth brakes rock shippers
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, June 20: Chinas attempts to cool down its overheated economy have started buffeting Indian shipping firms sailing to the mainland with raw-material consignments. 																								Dry bulk freight rates, a bellwether for rates charged by shippers carrying cargo to the country, have plunged after remaining firm for months. The softening is evident in the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), which is generally used as a measure of the health of the dry bulk market. The BDI, which was at a high of 3,747 on May 13, has dipped to 2,887 on June 11.																								A major factor responsible for the lower dry bulk rates is a fall in demand from China. This is reflected in the BDI, which has been consistently falling since last month, an official from a leading shipping company said.																								At the beginning of this fiscal, a firm trend was evident in dry bulk freight rates with spot earnings per day shooting up to $70,692, sharply up from $30,727 a year ago. This rate was 105 per cent more than its 5-year peak.																								Last fiscal, the BDI had touched 4,288 on March 31, after hitting a high of 5,681 in February. China, whose huge steel demand led to a sharp rise in coal trades, largely contributed to this growth. Port congestion also fuelled the rally. There was also a lack of supply of vessels vis--vis its demand due to the under-investment in the dry bulk sector.																								However, despite the fall, analysts are cautiously optimistic. Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd said with the world economy projected to grow by 3 to 4 per cent in 2004 and the Chinese economy at a slightly lower rate than in 2003, demand for movement of dry bulk commodities is expected to be strong. The company has seen close to 20 per cent of its shipping revenues coming from dry bulk cargo.																								It has, however, cautioned that though the dry bulk market is expected to be at healthy levels, it will not be exceptionally high as seen earlier this year.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Sterling laps up Barista stake
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Hot spot																								Mumbai, April 12: The Sterling group has acquired promoter Turner Morrisons entire 65.45 per cent stake in Barista Coffee Company Ltd.																								The size of the deal is still under wraps. However, the acquisition cost is being pegged at over Rs 50 crore. 																								For the Sterling group and its NRI promoter C. Sivasankaran, the deal will help consolidate a business where they are already present through the Fresh and Honest coffee vending chain.																								Tata Coffee, which holds a 34.31 per cent stake in Barista, informed the bourses of the acquisition here today.																								Barista is one of the fastest growing chains of coffee bars in the country, which has two other leading brands  Qwiky Coffee Pubs and ABCs Caf Coffee Day  competing with it.																								All eyes are keyed on how the two partners  The Tatas and Sterling  deal with each other in the coming days as Tata Coffee, which over the years has steadily increased its stake in Barista, was been seen as a suitor for Turner Morrison.																								However, Sivasankaran has been heard referring to his relationship with his good friend Ratan Tata, the Tata group chief, as most cordial. 																								Sivasankaran had recently sold Dishnet DSL  the internet service provider and chain of cyber cafes  to VSNL, the Tata-owned international telephony major.																								Sivasankaran has perfected the art of buy some, sell some and observers feel that the first-generation entrepreneur has an eye for sunrise industries. He enters such sectors early and quits after running the business for a few years and after having created a sizeable mass. 																								Reports suggest that Sivasankaran has plans to exit Aircel in Tamil Nadu.

 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Fiat, HM falter on sales track
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, April 25: Fiat India and Calcutta-based Hindustan Motors are the only two manufacturers who have reported lower sales in 2003-04, despite a record performance by the car industry as a whole.																								Car sales galloped during the financial year ended March 31, 2004, fuelled by three-decade-low interest rates and an expanding economy which allowed the government to cut production tax by 8 per cent.																								However, Fiats sales declined to 10,428 units from 25,936 units on reports of its Italian parents financial woes.																								Hindustan Motors, having a technical collaboration with Japans loss-making Mitsubishi Motors, saw sales sliding steadily in the last few years.																								The C. K. Birla-owned company, which makes the Ambassador cars, the Lancer sedan, the Trekker and RTV utility vehicles, has reported total sales of 14,889 units in 2003-04, down from 17,833 units in the previous year.																								Hindustan Motors Lancer model, positioned in the executive segment, has sold only 45 units in the whole year. The Ambassador model clocked sales of 14,844 units against 17,787 units a year ago.																								Fiats Sienna sedan, which competes with Hyundais Accent, General Motors Corsa and Maruti Udyogs Esteem in the mid-sized segment, also reported lower sales of 733 units against 2,619 units in the previous year.																								In sharp contrast, sales in the mid-sized segment rose on an average by 30 per cent. Tata Motors, which offers the Indigo sedan in this segment, sold around 27,987 units in 2003-04, up from 6,813 units in the previous year.																								Sales of Hyundais Accent model also rose by nearly 50 per cent to 28,231 units from 19,152 units a year ago.																								Fiat officials, however, said the carmaker has worked on its products and sales should pick up with the launch of the Petra model scheduled early next month.																								The automobile sector has been one of the major beneficiaries of the economic growth, which is forecast to be a scorching 8.1 per cent this fiscal, thanks to a good monsoon.

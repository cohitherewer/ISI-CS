 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Signature campaign																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: Union minister for communications and information technology Dayanidhi Maran has decided to push the use of digital signature in the country to help Netizens file their income tax returns and send confidential documents through e-mail.																								Digital signature is a code that consists of numbers, letters of an alphabet and symbols assigned by a certifying authority for an annual fee.																								When an e-mail is sent, it can be hacked. However, after the mail is attached with a digital signature (the provision is automatically available in the e-mail when a digital signature is secured), it can be opened only by the person to whom it is addressed and who has a digital signature.																								It makes transactions over the internet easy and secure.																								Maran said, Digital signature opens up many avenues for different segments of customers like filing income tax returns, sending confidential documents or ordinary e-mail. Once faith is developed in a system, many other opportunities will emerge to make our day-to-day lives simpler.																								Most of the benefits from IT will, however, accrue only if there is a strong development and deployment of appropriate IT applications. Simultaneously, we need to ensure that e-commerce and e-governance take off in a big way, he added.																								Maran said with Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) also becoming a certifying authority, it will be easy for the subscribers in Delhi and Mumbai to get services like shifting of phones and installation of STD and ISD facilities without visiting the offices as these requests can be sent under a digital signature which will not require physical verification.																								Currently, there are four certifying authorities in India  TCS, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), a Hyderabad-based RBI sponsored institute, Safescrypt (a joint venture of Sify and Verisign, the developers of secure software) and National Informatics Centre (NIC), The licence is given for one year and has to be renewed by the Controller of Certifying Authority.																								However, legal and IT experts feel that in India, digital signature is far from being used in day-to-day activities.																								Cyber law expert Pawan Duggal said, Today, digital signature in India is a digital dream, since it has not touched the masses.

 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Finance panel wants revenue trickle-down
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rangarajan: Ready for a relook																								New Delhi, June 7: The chairman of the Twelfth Finance Commission, C. Rangarajan, today said the key to decentralisation of financial resources is a stronger revenue base of the panchayats or local administrative bodies.																								We need to take a relook into the design of decentralisation  fiscal decentralisation  in terms of resource mobilisation and strengthening the revenue expenditure, the former RBI governor told a seminar held jointly by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy and the World Bank.																								Decentralisation has not led to transfer of functions, functionaries and finances to local bodies. But the service delivery system should not rob the local governments of autonomy and flexibility, Rangarajan added.																								Fiscal decentralisation in terms of resource mobilisation and strengthening the revenue expenditure link remains weak and the success of the future of decentralisation depends to a large extent on strengthening the revenue base of panchayats, he said.																								Rangarajan said there were no studies showing that panchayats were exercising in full the powers given to them to raise revenues.																								The fact that benefit taxes, where there is a direct quid pro quo between the payer and the authority, can be levied more easily, has not been realised, the former Reserve Bank governor said. 																								The commissions report, which was scheduled to be submitted to the government by next month, is now expected around September. Discussions with around 20 states have been completed. Talks with others could be through in the next two to three months. 																								Last week, Rangarajan met finance minister P. Chidambaram to discuss the commissions progress and the financial health of various state governments. 																								The current finance commission is studying the federal systems of different countries, including Canada, Brazil and China, which lay special emphasis on weaker sections of society. Due to differences in the capacities of states to raise resources, the task of the finance commission had become difficult, he said. 																								The financial strength of most of the states is bad due to an imbalance between expenditure and earnings. However, many states have been blaming the Pay Commission for imposing a massive burden which has compounded their fiscal imbalance.

 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Feb. 17: Reliance Infocomm is breaking out of bandwidth shackles with Flag Telecom, its wholly-owned subsidiary, deciding to set up a 15,000-km tera bits submarine cable to connect the Gulf region with links to Egypt, India and Hong Kong. 																								The project, which requires an investment of $300-million (Rs 1,500 crore), will make the company self-reliant in terms of bandwidth. 																								At present, Reliance Infocomm accesses bandwidth through VSNLs landing station in Mumbai.																								However, Reliance will not be the only beneficiary of the network. Other Indian telecom operators who suffer from lack of bandwidth may go for this new network.																								This is the first mega project Flag Telecom has taken up since Reliance Infocomm bought it last year. 																								FALCON , the new network, will have a designed capacity of 1280 giga bits and it will open up a floodgate of bandwidth, sources said.																								VSNLs existing bandwidth capacity is less than 50 giga bits.																								Reliance Infocomm will set up two landing stations, one in Mumbai and the other on the east coast of Chennai, to access the FALCON network. A third landing station may come up in Haldia later, they added.																								Flag will bring in the larger chuck of investment in the project, while Reliance Infocomm will pitch in with a combination of equity and debt.																								The high-capacity resilient loop cable system will provide multiple landings throughout the Gulf region and submarine links that will extend to Egypt in the west and Hong Kong in the east.

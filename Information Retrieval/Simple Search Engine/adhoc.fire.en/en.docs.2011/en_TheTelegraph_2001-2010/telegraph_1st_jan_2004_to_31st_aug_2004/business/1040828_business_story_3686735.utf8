The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Thorns in ONGC branch-out
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Raha: Running a reality check																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: ONGC is worried about the governments emphasis on core competence, an issue that has figured in the brainstorming session on the restructuring of public sector oil majors apart from the merger option.																								ONGC chairman Subir Raha is worried that his plans to go up the value chain into petrochemicals and power generation may suffer because of such thinking. 																								He said ONGC is thinking of becoming an integrated company to mitigate the high risk in oil exploration. According to initial plans drawn up by Rahas team, the company could invest between $5-7 billion in petrochemicals and power generation. 																								Raha told The Telegraph that this investment would not affect our core business of oil exploration. Our plans for oil exploration are quite independent of these new areas of business. Only 1 per cent of ONGCs manpower would be involved in the new projects, he remarked.																								Raha sees a great opportunity in entering these two new businesses as they offer high rates of return.																								Reliance already has a near-monopoly in the petrochemicals market and is now ready to take the plunge into power generation, based on its huge gas find as back-up fuel. Raha is of the view that it would be unfair to let ONGC miss out on this opportunity as it is as capable to take up this business integration.																								Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars statement that the while the financial performance of the national oil companies is good, some of them are not showing the same efficiency in their physical performance has creased many brows. 																								This is clearly a reference to the upstream ONGC and OIL, which have not made any major strikes in recent years. As a result, crude output of the country has been stagnating at 30 million tonnes per annum.																								To be fair to ONGC, the giant find by Reliance owes much of the spadework done initially by ONGC, which was the first company to work on the eastern offshore block and prepare the data to uncover its rich hydrocarbon potential. ONGC had wanted to keep the block on nomination basis but the then director-general of hydrocarbons had decided to throw it open to private companies.																								The reputation of ONGC, which has major finds like Mumbai High to its credit in the past, is now at stake. It is making heavy investments in the frontier deep sea areas but will have to come up with a major find to salvage its reputation. 																								While commendable work has been done in reviving Mumbai High and also in acquiring stakes in foreign companies through ONGC-Videsh, it is the new finds that everyone is waiting to see.

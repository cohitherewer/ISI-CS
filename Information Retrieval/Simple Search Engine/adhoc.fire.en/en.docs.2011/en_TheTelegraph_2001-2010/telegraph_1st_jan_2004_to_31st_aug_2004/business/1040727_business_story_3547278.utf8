 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Banks rapped for priority-sector loan lapses
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 We are the world																								Mumbai, July 26: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today pulled up banks for not meeting the subtarget, set under priority sector lending, for agriculture and weaker sections. It also expressed concern over banks charging a higher interest rate on loans up to Rs 2 lakh.																								In a circular issued today, the RBI asked banks to take appropriate steps to increase the flow of credit to the priority sector, agriculture and weaker sections so that stipulated targets are achieved at the earliest.																								It also directed them to strictly observe its directives on interest rates.																								Domestic scheduled commercial banks have set a target of 40 per cent of net bank credit for the priority sector by, within which, subtargets of 18 per cent and 10 per cent have been set for farm and weaker sections, respectively.																								The RBI, however, observed that most of the banks have not achieved the targets/sub-targets under priority sector lending. Various standing committees of Parliament have also shown concern over the poor performance of banks in achieving targets/subtargets, it added.																								Domestic commercial banks are also required to lend 1 per cent of the previous years aggregate advances under the differential rate of interest scheme.																								The RBI said according it has freed interest rates on commercial bank loans, except the rider that credit up to Rs 2 lakh should not be charged above the prime lending rate (PLR).																								Subsequently, in April 2001, the stipulation of PLR being the floor rate of loans above Rs 2 lakh has been withdrawn and banks are now free to lend at subPLR rates to creditworthy borrowers, if their boards approved.																								However, it has been brought to our notice that some bank branches are demanding higher rates of interest even on loans up to Rs 2 lakh, it said. 																								A suitable circular should be issued to controlling offices and branches, reiterating the instructions relating to interest rates on advances, the RBI said.																								In another circular relating to the report of the Advisory Committee on Flow of Credit to Agriculture and Related Activities from the Banking System, set up under the chairmanship of V. S. Vyas, the RBI accepted some of its recommendations and forwarded it for immediate implementation by banks. 																								The RBI has asked banks to explore tieups with tractor and farm machinery manufacturers.																								The committee observed in its field visits that several commercial bank branches insist on unreasonably high margin money or fixed deposits for sanction of loans, sometimes not commensurate with the quantum of borrowings. Such insistence results in denial of loans even to worthy borrowers who may not have adequate cash/collateral on hand.

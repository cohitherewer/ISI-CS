 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Harmony in rules key to Saarc bourse
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bajpai: Coming togetherNew Delhi, Aug. 28: Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman G. N. Bajpai today said the integration of capital markets of the Saarc region will depend on the ability of the regulators to harmonise listing requirements and ensure that companies comply with the norms.																								In an environment of multiple exchanges, an inter-market communication linkage has to be established so as to get the best quotes on shares. This would necessitate inter-market trading system, Bajpai said while addressing a two-day conference organised by the South Asian Federation of Accountants (Safa).																								The Sebi chief said market forces would determine possible mergers of the stock markets in the Saarc region.																								Bajpai said there are a number of primary requirements for the integration of capital markets in the region that would include free flow of capital without any restriction in capital accounts of the Saarc countries. Another important need is the establishment of efficacious and clearing settlement facilities.																								Bajpai also said the Saarc nations would have to work together to create a common currency and, until that was achieved, provide a facility of full convertibility to the investors of the Saarc region. 																								He said other primary requirements for the integration of capital markets in the Saarc region included the provision of certain fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to investors willing to invest in financial instruments of other member countries and the development of regional credit rating standards to instil confidence among the investing community.																								Safa president B. Fakhri said a memorandum of understanding (MoU) is under way between Sebi and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Pakistan on the co-operation and exchange of information at various levels. Such measures are a move towards the integration of the capital markets of the region, said Fakhri.																								According to Fakhri, the European Union is the most advanced model of economic cooperation among regions. Since the Saarc dream of economic cooperation is at a nascent stage, it cannot follow the European Union model and must strive to retain its uniqueness. Accountants move																								The chartered accountants of the Saarc region are interested in integrating the financial sectors of these regions and are initiating a debate with the relevant think tanks in the region. 																								Fakhri said, Promotion of cross-border trade is definitely something we want between India and Pakistan and between all the countries of the Saarc region. The integration of the financial sector can be a very definitive first step in that direction. 																								So far policies have been decided by political realities. Now the dictates of the economic and business situations should do that, he added.

 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Airport update gathers pace
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Takeoff time 																								New Delhi, Aug. 18: The inter-ministerial group, set up to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports, will meet in the next few days to shortlist the bidders.																								Ten bidders, including Bharti Enterprises, Videocon and Reliance, are bidding to pick up a 74 per cent stake in the joint ventures that will be formed to modernise the two airports. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) will hold a 26 per cent stake in the two ventures.																								The inter-ministerial group meeting will take place in the next few days. The process for technical bids will start after the bidders are shortlisted. The final recommendation will then be sent to the empowered group of ministers (EGOM), said civil aviation minister Praful Patel.																								Bharti Enterprises has tied up with Singapores Changi airport, Videocon has formed a consortium with Methven Corp, while Reliance is going it alone. Others in the fray include Hochtief Airport-Piramal Holding- amp;T, Macquarie Bank-Agarwal Galvanising-Aeroports-de Paris, GMR Infrastructure-Fraport AG, Pan India Paryatan-TAV Investment Construction Corp, GVK Industries-Airports Company South Africa, DLF-Malaysia Airport, and DS Construction-Flughafen Munchen of Munich.																								The inter-ministerial group is evaluating the expressions of interest and will soon take a decision, Patel told reporters on the sidelines of the fifth marketing summit organised here today by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								The final partners for the two joint venture companies will be selected by the year-end.																								The minister said a new policy of allowing domestic air carriers to fly to the Asean countries was imminent.																								At present, private domestic airlines are allowed to operate to the Saarc countries. The civil aviation ministry has already asked the Asean members to accord multiple-designated carrier status to India, which will help airlines like Jet and Sahara to start services to these destinations.																								Patel said after the revamp of the Delhi and Mumbai airports, the focus would turn to the Chennai airport. We are at the moment evaluating various options. Let us see whether we follow the earlier models or adopt a new strategy, he added.																								Asked whether the AAI would continue to own the Safdarjung airport property, the minister said, The land belongs to AAI and will continue to remain with us. We have not received any letter from Ghulam Nabi Azad.

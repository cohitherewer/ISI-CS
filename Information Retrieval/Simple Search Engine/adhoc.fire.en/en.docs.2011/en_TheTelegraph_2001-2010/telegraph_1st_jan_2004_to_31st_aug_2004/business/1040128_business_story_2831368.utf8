 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Giants head for gas roadshow
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: The representatives of global majors Exxon-Mobil, British Gas, Gas De France, British Petroleum, Gazprom of Russia, Petronas of Malaysia, Tokyo Gas and South Koreas Kogas will be winging their way to Mumbai next week to get a first-hand feel of energy-hungry Indias natural gas market.																								Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee said at a press conference here today that he expected Rs 55,000 crore to be invested for developing the natural gas market in India over the next five years.																								While Rs 25,000 crore of this investment was proposed to be allocated for developing a national grid, Rs 30,000 crore was proposed for the regional grids and changes required in technology to run vehicles on natural gas. There was a lot of scope for foreign companies to invest in the gas sector, the Gail chairman said.																								Banerjee said as many 18 countries would be represented at the two-day Asia gas buyers summit, beginning February 2.																								UKs minister of state for energy, Stephen Timms, will be the guest of honour at the conference. He said that as India prepares to move ahead into the clean fuel era, the demand for natural gas is expected to grow from 27 billion cubic metres (BCM) at present to 50 bcm by 2006-07. 																								India and China are expected to emerge as the major consumers of natural gas in future. Natural gas accounts for around 11 per cent of the energy basket of these two Asian giants compared with 25 per cent for the rest of the world.																								The summit is expected to discuss commercial practices and the pricing strategies, which would determine how Indian and Asian markets would grow in future. 																								The conference provides an excellent platform for sharing the experiences of developed, developing and Indian markets on the strategic implications of developing the gas markets in each of the participating countries.

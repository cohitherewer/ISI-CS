 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: National Aluminium Company (Nalco) will invest over Rs 4,000 crore to raise its production capacity from 2.88 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes.

The original capacity of the smelter, which was built in early 1980s in collaboration with Pechiny of France, was 2.3 lakh tonnes.																								The sharp rise in domestic demand for aluminium products has encouraged the expansion plan. 																								The average growth in the aluminium sector is around 7-9 per cent annually. This will automatically shoot up demand both in the short term and long term. 																								Moreover, this years railway budget has great promises for the aluminium sector.																								The sector will see a phenomenal growth when the railway coaches are made in aluminium, a senior Nalco official said.																								Nalco produces 2.88 lakh tonnes of aluminium. The companys alumina refinery can produce 15.75 lakh tonnes per annum, while the power plant has a capacity of 960 mw.																								The capacity of the refinery will be raised by 25 per cent.																								The investment will be mostly funded through internal accruals and some portion will be debt.																								The executive ruled out any investment outside the country, although rumours abound that the company is eyeing a production base through a joint venture in China.																								We are busy consolidating our position in the domestic market, which has a tremendous demand. We are not looking at any foreign project, he said.																								The company also plans to start mining activities in a big way. It plans to source raw materials from the captive base.

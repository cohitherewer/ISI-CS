 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Indian Bank mulls flotation next fiscal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rao in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Jan. 17: Indian Bank may enter the capital market with its initial public offer for increasing its Tier-I capital (core capital) in the next financial year.																								The bank has already firmed up plans to raise its TierII capital by Rs 200-300 crore in the current financial year through placement of subordinated bonds.																								Bank chairman and managing director M. B. . Rao said, We have to increase our capital to keep pace with our growth in assets. In the current fiscal, we will raise the Tier-II capital. We will consider an IPO in the next fiscal if the capital market shows a positive trend. Otherwise, we will increase the Tier-II capital once again.																								The capital adequacy ratio of the bank is 12.85 per cent.																								The bank, which was once saddled with high non-performing assets (NPAs), has been able to bring down its net NPAs to 4.85 per cent as on September 30.																								Rao said the aim is to provide fully for the bank in three years. It will be done mainly through cash recovery rather than only provisioning. We have already sent 2,000 notices to the sticky borrowers under the new Securitisation Act, said Rao.																								The bank has been able to surpass this years target of Rs 200 crore cash recovery of NPA. It expects to make a cash recovery of Rs 250 crore in the current fiscal.																								The bank has decided to invest Rs 200 crore for technology upgradation and a core banking package. The core-banking package will be implemented over a period of two years. We are currently in talks with the vendors who will provide us the core banking package, said Rao.																								Rao today met Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta. The finance minister told us to look into financing the self-help groups. I feel that Bengal has immense opportunities and the bank will certainly look into the investment opportunities in the state, he added.																								Indian Bank has 53 branches in the state and the deposit of these branches stood at Rs 1508.08 crore, while advances were at Rs 557.43 crore as on December 31. The bank has plans to open two more branches in Calcutta.																								The banks overall advances as on December 31 stood at Rs 2,000 crore. About 20 per cent of our growth in advances has come from retail lending, he said.

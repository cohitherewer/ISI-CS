 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Firms go abroad to cut debt costs
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 23: Indian Incs rushing to pare its debt costs. The latest to join the gang is Tata TeleServices (Maharashtra), formerly known as Hughes Ispat, which plans to issue foreign currency convertible bonds aggregating $150 million. The bonds carry the option of being converted into equity shares of the company.																								A score of Indian companies are looking abroad to raise funds by offering bonds that could be later converted into equity at huge premiums to existing market price. 																								Its a win-win situation for Indian companies, say forex analysts. While interest costs for foreign debt is definitely lower than local debt, the icing in the cake is the possibility of the rupee appreciating. Therefore, if the rupee appreciates, the borrowers need to repay fewer dollars in case the debt has not been converted into equity. Further, the loans could be used as a hedging mechanism by exporters. 																								Meanwhile, Ashok Leyland followed the trail set by its rival Tata Motors and mopped up $100 million in the form of FCCBs. The bonds were oversubscribed five times. The other companies who in the recent past have raised funds through this route are Bharti, Zee, Indian Hotels and Reliance Energy.

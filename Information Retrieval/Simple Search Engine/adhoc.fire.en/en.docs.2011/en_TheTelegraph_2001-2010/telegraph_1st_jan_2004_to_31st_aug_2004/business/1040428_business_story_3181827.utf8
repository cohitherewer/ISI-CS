 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Bengal PF record improves
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 27: The Bengal regional office of Employees Provident Fund Organisation has recovered Rs 283 crore in 2003-04 against Rs 130 crore in 2002-03, a realisation of 76 per cent of the total outstanding in the region. Regional provident fund commissioner A. M. Raju said the organisation has brought under its purview 1300 new establishments. He was speaking at a meet organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.																								We have tried hard to talk to sectors like jute and tea who have defaulted heavily on provident fund payments. Last year, 70 arrests were made by us in an attempt to recover dues, he said.																								The regional office has also improved its claim settlement ratio from 36 per cent in August 2003 to 70 per cent in March 2004.																								The organisation has also partnered with Siemens Technology to conduct a re-engineering study and is ready to launch its processes. The pilot project for business process re-engineering and allotment of a national social security number scheme will be completed within the next three months, said Raju.

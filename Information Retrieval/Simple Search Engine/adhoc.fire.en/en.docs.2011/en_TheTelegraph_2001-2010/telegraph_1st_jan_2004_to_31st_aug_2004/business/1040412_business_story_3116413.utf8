 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Hitachi to focus on plasma TVs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 11: Japanese consumer appliances major Hitachi has decided to skip the vast mass market for televisions and concentrate on premium products. It will tap the home-theatre segment with a focus on plasma TVs.																								The increasing demand for high-end products is growing in the country with buyers comprising corporate as well as individuals.																								Korean majors Samsung and LG, who are making roadways into the smaller markets, presently dominate the mass TV market.																								Tarun Jain, regional marketing manager of Hitachi Home Electronics Asia, says: The growing demand is evident from the fact that India is the first country in the Asian region where we have launched the entire range of plasma and LCD TV. We aim to take a 10 to 15 per cent share of the market this year and 20 to 25 per cent next year.																								The domestic plasma TV market was 3,500 units in 2003 and is expected to grow to 8,000 units this year and jump to 25,000 units in 2006.																								Major buyers include airports, hotels, banks and multinationals.																								Globally, the plasma TV market is estimated at 27 lakh units, of which Hitachi has a 24 per cent share. The Asian market is estimated to reach 8 lakh units in 2004.																								Hitachi has priced its products between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 6.95 lakh in India. The products include the complete range of home-theatre items like built-in tuner, speakers and stands.																								The company already sells air-conditioners in India through its subsidiary Hitachi Home amp; Life Solutions (India) Limited and plans to launch refrigerators soon.

 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Riders in HSBCs UTI Bank stake nod
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Housefull 																								Mumbai, June 10: HSBC today said it has wrapped up the deal under which it purchased a 14.62 per cent holding in UTI Bank for a combined sum of $67.6 million.																								The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cleared the December 2003 purchase, but it has not allowed HSBC a representation on the board of UTI Bank. Its voting rights will be limited to 10 per cent under existing rules on equity holding and management control of private banks.																								HSBC shrugged off the constraints, and its India chief executive Niall S. K. Booker said he had kept his options on a stake hike. Thats the present situation. If the rules and regulations change, we will look at opportunities.																								He insisted UTI Bank shares were merely a financial investment. Asked if CDC, the venture capital firm that sold HSBC its stake last year, would sell the rest of its holding, he said, Its up to them and what they wish to do with it. 																								A number of entities, including government institutions, corporate investors and individual shareholders own 85.38 per cent of UTI Banks equity. Asked why he thought the Reserve Bank of India had not allowed HSBC to buy more shares, Booker said: I dont have an answer. 																								There are other curbs that HSBC will have to live with in its relationship with UTI Bank, such as sharing of branch network. It has, however, asked for certain exemptions. 																								For ATM sharing with UTI Bank, we have put in a request, he added.																								HSBC Asia Pacific Holdings (UK) Limited, the group entity that paid $67.6 million, acquired the equity shareholding in UTI Bank from CDC Financial Services (Mauritius) Limited and South Asia Regional Fund.																								Michael Smith, the global CEO, said, UTI Bank is a well-managed local financial institution, and our investment in it will give HSBC greater participation in Indias fast-growing financial sector. We have had a long history in India of over 150 years. With this new investment, we aim to strengthen our presence in this economy.																								With over 250 branches, extension counters and more than 1,200 ATMs, UTI Bank has the second-largest retail banking network among private banks in India. It offers a comprehensive range of corporate banking, retail lending and deposit products and an internet banking service to its one million customers. The bank had deposits of Rs 20,954 crore on March 31, 2004.																								Banking regulations limit foreign investment in private banks to 74 per cent and restrict voting rights to 10 per cent, irrespective of the size of the investment holding.																								By virtue of this law, HSBC, in spite of holding 14.6 per cent, will enjoy voting rights for up to 10 per cent. It will also not enjoy privileges of a representation on the board.																								Sebi, the market regulator, has informed HSBC that theres no need for an open offer, in view of the 10 per cent ceiling on voting rights.

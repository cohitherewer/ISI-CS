The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 KPMG to study local mobile hub
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 	 calling card																								Calcutta, July 11: The manufacturing committee, set up in association with the ministry of IT, has appointed KPMG to prepare a position paper to evaluate the prospects and competitive advantage of manufacturing handsets and accessories in India. 																								The consultant is expected to place its recommendations before the committee in the next 8-10 weeks.																								Meanwhile, the committee members plan to visit China to interact with local manufacturers on July 19. We will convey our observations to both KPMG and the ministry, said Pankaj Mohindroo, national president of Indian Cellular Association and member of the committee.																								The domestic handset industry is estimated at Rs 6,500 crore, but is expected to double by the year-end.																								India, however, has a long way to go catch up with China. Around 140 million handsets are manufactured every year in China by over 30 local manufacturers, said Mohindroo. We will aim to replicate the success there and study the strategy adopted to make a comparative analysis. We will also try to avoid imposing restrictive clauses for the industry.																								The increase in the FDI limit from 42 per cent to 74 per cent for the telecom industry will attract manufacturing investments to India. The proposal to set up a National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council will also help in formulating industry-specific plans.																								It was necessary to increase the subscriber base and expand the market to attract investments, Mohindroo said.

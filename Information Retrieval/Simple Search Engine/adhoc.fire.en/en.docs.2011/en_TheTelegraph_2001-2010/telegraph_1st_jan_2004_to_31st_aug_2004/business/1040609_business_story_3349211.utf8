 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 PNB Housing Fin IPO next year
																								New Delhi, June 8 (PTI): PNB Housing Finance Limited has kept its options open for an initial public offering (IPO) after March 2005 and aims at a 30 per cent growth in net profit in the current fiscal.																								We do not have any plans to go for an IPO for fresh fund infusion in the current fiscal, but we are not ruling out the possibility for 2005-06, managing director V. K. Sood said.																								There is no immediate need to tap the market for fresh capital as our capital adequacy ratio was fairly good at 19.31 per cent, he said.																								PNB Housing Finance is hopeful of raising its net worth from Rs 87.58 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 105 crore by the end of the current fiscal, enabling it to step up lending significantly.																								The increase in net worth would raise the credit exposure limit, which currently stands at 15 per cent of the net worth for individual companies and 25 per cent for the group housing projects.																								We are looking for at least 30 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 22 crore in 2004-05, Sood said.																								The company posted a 30 per cent growth in net profit to Rs 15.5 crore in 2003-04 from Rs 11.92 crore in 2002-03. 																								The total income of the company stood at Rs 90.44 crore in 2003-04 against Rs 80.37 crore in 2002-03. 																								In view of a good growth in net profit, the company has made an additional floating provision of Rs 1 crore to take care of the change in NPA norms, Sood said.																								It achieved a 21 per cent growth in loans outstanding.																								During 2003-04, PNB Housing Finance sanctioned total loans of Rs 350.43 crore against Rs 305.38 crore in 2002-03.																								Last years total sanctioned amount was extended to 6618 dwelling units.																								PNB Housing Finance disbursed Rs 284.71 crore in 2003-04 to 5262 dwelling units against Rs 255.65 crore in 2002-03.

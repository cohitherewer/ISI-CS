 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 More wings for air twins
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Smooth take-off																								New Delhi, July 27: The government today decided to inject fresh capital into the two state-run airlines  Indian Airlines and Air-India  just before they prepare to sign their biggest-ever aircraft purchase deals under which they will acquire 75 planes spread over three to four years. 																								Indian Airlines, the domestic airline major which has an equity of Rs 105 crore, will get an infusion of Rs 325 crore. This will help it leverage a part of the Rs 10,000 crore it needs to buy 43 aircraft as loan from various global lenders.																								Air-India, which has a capital of Rs 153 crore, is likely to see its equity base raised by a combination of increases in government holding as well as infusion from financial institutions. This again is being done to help shore up its ability to take on debt to buy 32 planes. 																								After a 30-minute meeting, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said, Finance minister P. Chidambaram has agreed, in-principle, to the infusion.																								IA wants to buy a mix of Airbus-319s, Airbus-320s and Airbus-321s, which will be delivered between 2004 and 2008 at a cost of over Rs 10,000 crore. Air-India is likely to acquire a fleet that mostly comprises Boeing 747-400s and Airbus 340s, of which 18 will be for the main airline and another 14 for the low-cost Air-India Express.																								The two carriers had not been able to fly more aircraft on global trunk routes despite huge sales demand because they were hamstrung by their fleet size, miniscule by international standards. 																								They also suffer from ageing fleets, which means their cost of operations is far higher than that of rival airlines that boast of far younger fleets with an average age of not more than seven years. While IA-owned aircraft have an average age of 16-18 years, leased aircraft have an average age of about 12 years.

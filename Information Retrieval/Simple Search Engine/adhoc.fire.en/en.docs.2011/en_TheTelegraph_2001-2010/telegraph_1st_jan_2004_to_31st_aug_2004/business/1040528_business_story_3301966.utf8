 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Bourses clueless, to wait for budget
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 27: The stock markets appear clueless on the economic policies of the United Progressive Alliance government, even after todays announcement of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP).																								The undertone would remain negative in the short-term, brokers said. I guess well have to wait for the Union budget to get a clear view of the governments economic policies, said Ramesh Damani, a leading Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) broker.																								Another broker termed the CMP as meaningless platitudes. He was commenting on certain announcements in the CMP regarding strengthening of Air-India and Indian Airlines and making the defence forces the best in the world. It is a good policy statement. The markets will view the announcement positively in the long-run, Sun F amp;C chief investment officer Gul Tekchandani said.																								The markets, distracted by the CMP, will now look towards the monsoon and the Union budget for a direction. According to Gul, the CMP announcements are a continuation of some of the policies of the previous government on issues like sale of shares of public sector banks.																								Halting the reforms process is a big issue for the markets, said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. Overall, the trend is negative, he added.																								The BSE 30-share index has been losing ground steadily after its impressive 161.7-point rise on Monday when markets opened to welcome the surprise choice of P. Chidambaram as the finance minister.																								On Tuesday, the sensex fell 21 points and Wednesday saw the market barometer shedding 20.3 points. Today, it fell another 23 points. However, the markets had closed before the CMP was made public.																								Anxious investors were apprehensive whether the CMP would stall the reforms carried out by the previous government. The point on double taxation in the CMP has caused some nervousness among market players. By registering in Mauritius, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) kept a bulk of their stock market winnings with them as they were protected by a tax treaty between India and Mauritius. The controversy was over some years ago, but the CMP statement could again bring it to a boil.																								FIIs, who have invested a record $7 billion in the recent bull rally, may dither, said market watchers. The markets saw operators squaring up positions on the last session of May Contract of the futures and options segment, adopting a cautious approach ahead of the unveiling of the CMP document.																								The sensex opened moderately lower at 5045.45 and later fluctuated between 5107.60 and 5019.39 points before closing at 5058.55, a net loss of 23.40 points.

 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Bids called for Hind Organics
 SRINJOY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, Feb. 13: The government has invited bids for privatisation of Hindustan Organics Chemicals Ltd, a company which has defaulted on its payments of domestic borrowings aggregating more than Rs 210 crore.																								Once the bids are received on March 8, the process of clearance by the cabinet committee on disinvestment (CCD) will be immediately initiated. The process is expected to be completed by the end of the month, said a top ministry official.																								However, A. S. Didolkar, chairman and managing director of the firm, urged the government to cobble an immediate financial package or provide a government guarantee that would help it raise money to repay its high-cost loans. 																								The company is not in a situation to wait till the divestment process is concluded and, unless the payments are released, investors might resort to legal actions which would have an effect on the divestment process, Didolkar told government officials at a meeting.																								Small investors, mainly PF trustees, gratuity trustees, small grameen banks would resort to legal action as all these accounts would have to be treated as non-performing assets in their book, he explained to the officials. As part of its divestment programme, the government wants to sell 26 per cent of its stake in HOCL.

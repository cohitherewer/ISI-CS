 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Garment park on tannery land
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 23: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) will set up a garment park on the land of National Tannery which the corporation had taken over from the state industrial reconstruction department.																								National Tannery, a government enterprise which is located at Chingrighata off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, is closed for more than 15 years. The factory has an area of 10 acres.																								Confirming the move, WBIDC managing director Gopal Krishna said, We are planning to set up a garment park there. The ground work for setting up the park has already started.																								WBIDC, the nodal agency in Bengal to promote industries, has appointed I-Win (a joint venture between ICICI Bank and WBIDC) to carry out a feasibility study for the project.																								He said I-Win is expected to submit its report to WBIDC by the end of next month.																								We are also carrying out valuation of the existing machineries and plant which have remained unused for the last 15 years. We would sell off the machineries which will not be required, Gopal Krishna said.																								A team comprising members of I-Win and WBIDC will be shortly leaving for Chittagong in Bangladesh to look into the infrastructure of the garment park located there.																								The garment park will have non-polluting units which will mainly do finishing jobs. The cost of the project has not yet been decided.																								However, WBIDC managing director added that space will be provided to investors at a competitive price.																								The corporation is also setting up an apparel park in Howrah which will have units for dyeing, bleaching, weaving and knitting of textiles.																								The two parks are inter-linked. The garment producers will get apparel directly from the apparel park. The investors at apparel park will be able to sell their products easily, Gopal Krishna said.																								The corporation plans to float special purpose vehicles for setting up the foundry park, rubber park and apparel park.																								The state is also setting up a huge food park on 50 acres of land at Sankrail, Howrah. 																								Bengal expects to attract investments to the tune of Rs 200 crore in these sector-specific parks. 																								Even though food-processing is a priority sector for Bengal, there is no dedicated infrastructure for this industry.																								Enquiries from various investors have already started pouring in for units producing ice-cream, flour, biscuits, baked products, yeast processing and cold storage.																								The corporation is also coming up with a service park on a four-acre stretch of land on the EM Bypass.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 10: The government is likely to table the Banking Regulation Act in Parliament this year along with the amended Securities Contract (Regulation) Act of 1956 for a firmer capital market.																								With the dissolution of the 13th Lok Sabha, the Bill to amend the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, has lapsed. Its reintroduction in the 14th Lok Sabha is under consideration, said the second action taken report (ATR) on the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) which investigated the stock market scandal of 2001.																								The report also said the government is likely to introduce other legislations, including Company Law (Amendment) Bill and Government Securities Bill and ensure the remaining recommendations of the JPC are most expeditiously implemented.																								The Securitisation Bill for corporatisation and demutualisation of the stock exchanges is expected to streamline the decision-making-process on the bourses through the appointment of a professional management body as it separates ownership, voting rights and bars the management from trading.																								Currently, there are 23 bourses of which the most closely tracked share barometer is the 30-share sensitive index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the Nifty-50 of the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Of these, only NSE and Over the Trade Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI) have a demutualised structure. 																								The amended Banking Regulation Act framed in 1949 would seek to strengthen the urban co-operative banks.																								The move to amend the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act is in line with the report submitted by M. H. Kania Committee and proposed by the finance ministry in the budget for the year to March 2003.																								The report also said the government has implemented around 36 recommendations of the JPC out of 90, which had submitted its report in December 19, 2002.																								JPC also said the government should table the ATR in Parliament within the next six months and thereafter progress reports should be filed until all the recommendations are implemented.																								The government had last submitted an Action Taken Report last year in May. While the first progress report was presented in December 12, 2003.

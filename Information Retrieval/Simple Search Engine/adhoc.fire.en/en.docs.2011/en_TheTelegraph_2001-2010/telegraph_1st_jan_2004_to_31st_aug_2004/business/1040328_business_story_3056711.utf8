 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 ONGC Videsh to get equity boost
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, March 27: The ministry of petroleum and natural gas is considering a proposal to increase the equity of ONGC Videsh Ltd to Rs 5,000 crore. Currently, the equity capital in ONGC Videsh is a mere Rs 300 crore which can be raised to a maximum level of Rs 500 crore. 																								This has resulted in a highly adverse debt-equity ratio which the ONGC Videsh management wants to correct to bring it in line with other global majors with which it has to do business.																								ONGC Videsh, a subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), holds stakes in giant oilfields in Russia and Sudan. These acquisitions have been made through interest-free loans from ONGC. 																								However, while the company has now come of age with these major acquisitions, its debt-equity ratio is high at around 15:1. This is in sharp contrast to other upstream oil exploration and production companies which have low debt-equity ratios. In fact, ONGC is a debt-free company. If ONGC Videsh has to do business with leading global companies such as Exxon-Mobil, which is its partner in the Sakhalin project, it has to have a healthy balancesheet of its own instead of continuing to live in ONGCs shadow.																								The current thinking is that either the ONGC loans to the company will be converted into equity or fresh funds will be infused by the government. 																								Banks do not normally extend loans for oil exploration as it is a high-risk venture. Most of the oil exploration worldwide is carried out by companies with their own funds and they often follow the consortium approach to reduce risk.																								Banks come forward with loans only after oil has been struck and the oil firms have to undertake the development of the fields.																								ONGC Videsh expects to produce oil and gas worth Rs 10,000 crore by 2007 from its fields in Sudan, Russia and Vietnam. With the output of the Greater Nile oilfield in Sudan anticipated to go up to 15 million tonnes soon, ONGC Videsh is expected to recover its entire investment of around $600 million in the project in the next two years. ONGC Videshs 25 per cent share in the field will go up from 3 million tonnes to 3.75 million tonnes.																								The Sudan government is keen that ONGC Videsh invests in the expansion of the Port Sudan refinery and the construction of a pipeline. These projects will involve an investment of $750 million. However, the government has advised ONGC to rope in joint venture partners for the downstream refinery and oil pipeline project to spread the risk.

 Parents wish to secure the future of their children. Chandralekha Tulal pans the policy options 			You were there when your child took his first faltering step and fulfilled your dreams; and you will be there when he takes his first step towards fulfiling his dreams. But life is unpredictable and you are afraid that if fate strikes a cruel blow, all those dreams could crumble before your helpless eyes. So before your child begins to dream, you should ensure that you have the means to fulfil them. 																								Life insurance companies have cobbled a number of plans designed to secure your childs future. Child policies are basically variants of endowment policies or anticipated endowment policies, popularly known as money-back policies. Unit-linked policies, with all their features, have also been introduced as a variant of child policies and are offered by ICICI Prudential Life and Birla Sun Life. 																								Before you consider such a policy, you should be clear about who the life insured should be: the child or the parent. Most insurers offer you a choice  and you need to weigh the pros and cons before you decide.For the child 																								LIC, Tata AIG Life, Om Kotak Mahindra Life, Max New York Life and Birla Sun Life offer policies where the life insured is the child. In these policies, the parents pay the premium for the premium paying term chosen. At maturity, the sum assured and the bonus amount accumulated on the premiums is paid to the child. In the event of death of the child, the parents receive the sum assured along with the bonus amount accumulated on the premium amounts paid. 																								But there is a niggling question that arises here: doesnt this go against the basic purpose of taking the child policy? Parents take the policy to secure their childs future, not with the intention of benefiting from the childs unfortunate death. 																								And what happens in case the parent dies? In some policies, due to non-payment of premium, the policy is discontinued and only the surrender amount is paid, thus snuffing out all the hopes that the parent had when he took the policy. 																								There are some policies where the future premiums are waived and the policy continues till maturity  at the end of which the sum assured and the accrued bonus is paid to the child. But here again another question arises: are the funds being made available to the child when he needs it the most? In the event of parents death, there is an immediate need for funds to take care of the familys daily expenses. In such a scenario, it would be more appropriate to provide the sum or a part of it when the misfortune occurs rather than defer payment till maturity. Unfortunately, none of the policies provide this option.For the parents																								ICICI Prudential, SBI Life, Allianz Bajaj, HDFC Standard Life, Met life and ING Vysya Life offer policies where the parent is the life insured. If the life insured is the parent, then the sum assured is paid to meet the immediate financial requirements of the family in the unfortunate event of death. Moreover, there are benefits like waiver of premium, acceleration benefit, income benefit and double benefit. 																								Premium waiver is a facility that is offered even on policies taken out in the childs name: the premium is waived and the policy continues to run till maturity. 																								In the case of acceleration benefit, the sum assured along with the accumulated bonus will be paid out to the family of the life insured, but the policy stops. 																								Income benefit is the option where a certain percentage of the sum assured is paid to the family every month or year till the policy matures. Double benefit is where the sum assured is paid on death of the life insured; future premiums are waived and the policy runs till maturity when the sum assured and the accumulated bonus is paid.

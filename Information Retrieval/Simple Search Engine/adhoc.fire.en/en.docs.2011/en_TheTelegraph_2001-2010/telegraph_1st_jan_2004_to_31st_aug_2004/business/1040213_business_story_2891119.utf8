 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Landing charges at airports slashed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: The government today reduced the landing and user charges at airports.																								A government statement said the move was taken to make air travel affordable and to encourage connectivity to smaller places. 																								Landing charges have been reduced by 15 per cent of the current rates for domestic flights subject to the condition that airport charges are paid within the credit period of 15 days. However, if paid late, existing rates will be applicable. 																								Government officials said airside-user charges at five airports declared as international airports, (excluding Bangalore and Goa), would continue at the same rates as those of domestic airports, till March 31 this year.																								This rule would, however, not apply to the airports at Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.																								Far more significantly, the government today announced landing charges will be waived for all aircraft and helicopters with a maximum seating capacity of 80. 																								At the same time, route navigation facility charges of 20 per cent of the applicable rates of weight-cum-distance-formula would be levied on aircraft with maximum all-up-weight of 10,000 kg. For those over 10,000 kg and up to 20,000 kg, 40 per cent charge would be levied.

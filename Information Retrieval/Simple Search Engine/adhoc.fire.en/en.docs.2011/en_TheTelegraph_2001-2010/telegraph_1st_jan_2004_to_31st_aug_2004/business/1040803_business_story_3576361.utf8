 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Biocon plans unit for new cancer drugs
 RAJA GHOSHAL 				 	 Shaw: Booster dose																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: Biocon India Ltd, the Bangalore-based premier biotechnology company, is setting up a manufacturing facility to make bio-molecules targeted primarily at the cancer market.																								The facility will be constructed over the next 12-15 months and will be the largest of its kind in India.																								The production base will be utilised primarily to make biomolecules that are technically called monoclonal antibodies.																								Biocon is planning to enter into collaborations with partners who are looking for an internationally benchmarked facility of the kind that the Bangalore-based firm has designed for itself.																								The biotechnology major has a joint venture company  Biopharmaceuticals  through which it focuses on advanced fermentation technologies, especially mammalian cell culture, which is required for the development of such biomolecules.																								Biocons founder promoter, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, who is the countrys richest businesswoman, had gone for an initial public offering (IPO) for the company last fiscal.																								The flotation, in which shares equivalent to 10 per cent of the post-issue capital were sold, mopped up around Rs 315 crore.																								The manufacturing facility for biomolecules is part of the expansion plans that are being funded from IPO proceeds. Internal accruals are also being used to pay for the initiative. The other plans include a new fermentation and chemical synthesis plant and a purification unit for recombinant human insulin.																								Another ambitious effort is the setting up of a new research facility in Syngene, which is Indias first custom research company, under the Biocon umbrella. It designs and manages pre-clinical research projects for multinational companies engaged in new drug discovery.																								With the cancer (oncology) market in mind, Biocon has selected a novel biomolecule (monoclonal antibody) for further clinical development and large-scale manufacture. It specifically targets skin growth factor receptor in head and neck cancers.																								This biomolecule has undergone successful phase two clinical trials in Canada. In India, advanced trials are soon to commence through the clinical research subsidiary of Biocon-Clinigene.																								Monoclonal antibodies are biomolecules that display specific affinity towards the target antigen or receptor on a tumor cell. What it does is that it initiates a complex set of events that either leads to the regression or the complete remission of the tumor. 																								In 2003-04, Biocons total income nearly doubled from Rs 283 crore to Rs 549 crore.

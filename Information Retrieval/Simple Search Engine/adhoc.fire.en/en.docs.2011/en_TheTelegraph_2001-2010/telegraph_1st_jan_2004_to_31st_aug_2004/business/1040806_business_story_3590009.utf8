 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Firms adrift in Gujarat floods
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Water, water, everywhere																								Mumbai, Aug. 5: Many companies based in flood-affected Gujarat have been forced to shut down their factories.																								River Kim has flooded Bharuch and Surat districts, affecting Grasims cellulosic plant at Kharach. 																								Chief minister Narendra Modi has asked for a Bihar-like package to help Gujarat tide over the natural disaster. 																								Grasim today informed the bourses that it had stopped operations since Wednesday. Operations will resume as soon as water recedes and after the required repair work is completed, the company said. 																								The company, however, reassured its investors that the suspension of operation will not affect the companys overall profitability.																								Incessant rainfall over the last few days in and around Silvassa had inundated pharmaceuticals company Ipca Laboratories new manufacturing unit at Piparia. The plant was commissioned in March. 																								Water has now receded and the damage to the building, plant and machinery, electrical and other fittings, raw materials, packing materials and finished goods is being ascertained, the company said.																								All these assets are fully insured, Ipca added. However, there will be no major disruption in the supply to the domestic market, it said.																								Omnitex Industries has also closed down its works at Silvassa on August 3. 																								Extensive damage has been inflicted on the companys plant and machinery, stocks, election installation, vehicles, furniture. The assets are adequately insured with United Insurance. The insurer has been told that almost a third of the total capacity is not in operation, the company said.																								In Maharashtra, many companies based in Nashik are feeling the impact of flash floods as the Mumbai-Nashik national highway was closed.

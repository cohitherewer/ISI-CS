 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Chambers laud rural initiatives
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 8: The chambers of commerce generally appreciated the union budget and say that it is the best that could be done given the political compulsions and economic demands. Most felt that the priority given to agriculture and rural development would create additional income in the hands of the rural people and expand the market and create demand for the industry. 																								The finance ministers request to the Chambers to come forward and put in their experiences also called for applause.																								The Indian Chamber of Commerce said that the budget is an earnest effort towards economic growth through social development. The Chamber is delighted that the suggestion for fiscal incentives for investment in agro and food processing found a place in the budget. The implementation of VAT would also help establish a uniform tax structure across the country.																								Bhaskar Basu, chairman of the finance committee of Bengal Chamber of Commerce said that the thrust of the budget was to fulfil infrastructure needs with a strong agriculture policy and innovative schemes for the poorer sections. He, however, felt that with the steel industry taking a hit many other industries like shipping and housing would be affected.																								CK Dhanuka, chairman of FicciERC said, The reduction of revenue deficit to 2.5 per cent of the GDP in the current fiscal would release greater resources for public investment and support growth.																								The announcement of the investment commission and national manufacturing competitiveness council has shown the governments commitment to give a push to the industrial sector. The commission will facilitate not only foreign investment but also investments in the industry.																								S. K. Chakraborty, president, Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry says, We appreciate identifying infrastructure, agriculture, irrigation, research and development and basic amenities as priority areas. The efforts to contain fiscal deficit at 4.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent of GDP are also commendable.																								He, however, expressed concern that no initiatives were spelt out for boosting industry and exports. Also, projection of FIs raised from $1 billion to $1.7 billion seemed rather difficult.																								KB Agarwala, president of Merchants Chamber of Commerce has welcomed the budget as growth-oriented and pragmatic. The minister has focussed on accelerated growth of agriculture, agro-processing and rural infrastructure. The exemptions on farming implements and equipment will definitely boost agricultural production and stimulate growth and national income significantly. 																								Pavan Poddar, vice president of Bharat Chamber of Commerce said that the proposal to reduce the limit of capacity expansion from 25 to 10 per cent for the purpose of additional depreciation under Section 32(I) is commendable. The proposal to increase service tax from 8 to 10 per cent, however, appears harsh.

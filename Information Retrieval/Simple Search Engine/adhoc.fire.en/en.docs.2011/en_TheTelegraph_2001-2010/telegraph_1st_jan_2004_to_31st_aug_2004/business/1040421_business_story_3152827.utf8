 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 $11 billion waiting to gush in
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, April 20: India is likely to see FII inflows of over $11 billion in calendar year 2004, some 40 per cent more than the money that came in last year.																								North Block officials said they had revised their projections for FII inflows on the back of several key foreign institutional investors applying to come to India.																								And now we have news that the worlds biggest pension fund  California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers)  which has a fund base of $165 billion has voted yesterday in favour of investing in India, officials said.																								Earlier, officials had expected FII inflows to be about 15-20 per cent better than last years and had expected to see fund interest tapering off as domestic markets began cooling down and global interest rates started hardening.																								Officials said they were aware that Calpers had earlier raised certain issues about the level of transparency on Indian bourses and corporate disclosures. But with systemic changes, Calpers and other conservative funds have also started eyeing India, they added. 																								Net investments by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the equity and debt markets crossed the $27-billion mark last week. FIIs have bought shares worth Rs 4,56,605 crore and sold worth Rs 3,43,784 crore, resulting in a net investment of Rs 1,12,820 crore.																								In calendar year 2004, FIIs have already poured in $4.12 billion (Rs 18,718 crore) in the capital market in just three-and-a-half months, of which $3.76 billion has been invested in equity and a mere $359 million in debt. This is nearly 54 per cent of the total investment of $7.6 billion and half of the total investment made by them in calendar year 2003.																								A large chunk of India Incs best firms are now held by FIIs. At least nine of the 30 companies which make up the BSE 30 index currently have FII stakes above 50 per cent. Foreign investors now also hold nearly 11.5 per cent of the capital base of state-run companies in the country.																								FIIs have also shown a considerable appetite for the new paper being issued by India Inc, with expected market offerings aggregating about Rs 50,000 crore over this calendar year.																								Interest by foreign fund managers stems from the fact that most initial public offerings (IPOs) being sold here have a price-earnings (P-E) ratio of less than 10. This is considered conservative by global standards where P-E ratios of up to 17 are allowed.																								What is also helping fund advisers to entice FIIs in market offerings is the fact that the total new paper being issued accounts for just about 2 per cent of India Incs market capitalisation. Exposure to this kind of money is not considered too risky by foreign funds, especially as they soak up to 7-8 per cent of the total capitalisation in many markets by buying new issues.																								However, most analysts feel the elections, the shape of the government to come and its commitments to broadening and deepening reforms will remain key factors in their continued interest in the market.

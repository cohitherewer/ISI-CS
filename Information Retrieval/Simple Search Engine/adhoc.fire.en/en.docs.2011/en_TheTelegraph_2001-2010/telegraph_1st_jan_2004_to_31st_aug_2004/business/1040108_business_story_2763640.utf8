 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 Top end 																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: Tata Motors, the countrys third-biggest car maker, has increased the ex-showroom prices of its Indica model by an average 1.9 per cent with immediate effect.																								The new prices of the diesel variants DL, DL Euro-II and DLX Euro-III range from Rs 3.19 lakh to Rs 4.02 lakh, a company spokesperson said.																								The revised prices of the petrol models LEi and LXi range from Rs 3.27 lakh to Rs 3.90 lakh, he said.																								The mid-size car, Indigo, and utility-vehicles Sumo and Safari have, however, been spared from the latest price hike, the spokesperson added.																								The price rise had become inevitable due to the continuous rise in input costs through 2002 and 2003 which, could not be absorbed fully any further by the company and have had to be partially passed on to the market, with this increase.

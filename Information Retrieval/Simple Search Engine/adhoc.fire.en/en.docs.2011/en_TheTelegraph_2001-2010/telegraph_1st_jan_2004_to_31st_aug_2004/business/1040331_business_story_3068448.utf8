 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, March 30: Securitisation is steadily gaining popularity with investors, but the premia in yields over AAA corporate debts is slowly reducing. Securitisation is the process of converting cash flows into marketable securities.																								Private sector banks, which are looking at securitisation to unlock capital and help in exposure management, now point out that corporate treasury has begun to evince interest in securitised instruments, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS). 																								Currently, banks, mutual funds and insurance companies are the predominant investors associated with securitisation.																								IDBI Bank today said it has succeeded in tapping the corporate segment. The bank conducted an MBS of Rs 82 crore across seven investors, including banks, insurance firms and corporate houses. 																								Finolex Cables director finance P. B. Parasnis said, The IDBI Bank MBS issue provided us with an excellent opportunity to invest in a high quality paper at an attractive spread over plain vanilla yields.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, IDBI Bank structured finance head V. Srinivasan said it is for the first time that a company has invested in an MBS. Corporate treasury is an important segment that holds a lot of potential, he added.																								Srinivasan said though securitisation has increased in the past few years, illiquidity is still a constraint. This has led to the securitised paper commanding a premium over corporate debt with AAA yields. However, with banks witnessing a growing investor interest for securitised paper, this premia has come down.

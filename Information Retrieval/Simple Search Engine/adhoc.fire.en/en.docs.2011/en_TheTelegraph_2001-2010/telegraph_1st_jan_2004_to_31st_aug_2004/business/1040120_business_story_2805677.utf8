 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Leyland rolls out overseas plan
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland Ltd today said the firm will consider raising new equity to fund its expansion programme, which includes a foray into the Chinese and Pakistani markets.																								R. Seshasayee, managing director, said the auto maker will invest Rs 250 crore over a two-year period to make cabins for trucks and the J-series engine. It will also invest an additional Rs 140 crore to increase its manufacturing capacity to 67,000 units from the current 50,000.																								We have come to a situation where we have to think in terms of enhancing the equity, Seshasayee said adding the funding will also be done through a combination of internal accruals and debt.																								We are hopeful of entering the Chinese and Pakistani markets to market our trucks and buses within 12 to 18 months, which could be in the form of joint ventures or some other alternate arrangements, he said.																								Seshasayee also said the companys profit margins, which have shrunk due to an exponential rise in steel prices, would be offset by higher sales volumes.																								The pressure on margins will continue to be there but we have counter measures to mitigate this, he said. Volumes are high, interest rates are low and the company will strive to attain further operational efficiency which would help increase profits, he added.																								The Chennai-based firm, which is owned by the Hinduja group, today unveiled its Newgen range of trucks and buses at the on-going Auto Expo. These vehicles are powered by the eight-litre J series engine and provides an output of 240 bhp.																								The auto maker, which has tied up with Japanese Hino for the technology of J-series engines, said it would launch these models next year.																								Newgen will spearhead our entry into new markets like West Asia, Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Seshasayee told reporters. The full-width cab developed in-house would meet ECE safety norms for frontal impact and roof crash as also European norms such as front under run protection.																								The company currently exports to Asean countries, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and West Asia, and expects offshore sales to rise to around 3,300 units this fiscal from 2,600 units a year ago.

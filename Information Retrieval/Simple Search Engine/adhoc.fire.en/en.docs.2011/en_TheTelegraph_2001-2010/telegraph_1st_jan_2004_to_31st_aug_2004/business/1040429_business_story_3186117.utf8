 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 ADB tugs at core of India with $2bn loan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Money matters																								New Delhi, April 28: The Asian Development Bank is likely to lend $2 billion for infrastructure projects in India in 2004.																								This marks an increase of a third over last years lending here. The bulk of higher lending at 40 per cent will go towards the ambitious highway projects that India has taken up, while 20 per cent will be directed towards the power sector. 																								ADB in a report also forecast that India will grow at a fast pace of 7.4 per cent for the current fiscal. It, however, also held out a warning on a possible banking sector crisis in India, Pakistan and Taiwan. 																								ADB is likely to tap the domestic debt market to raise funds but details on the timing and amount had not been finalised. ADB raised nearly Rs 500 crore through its first issue of bonds in the domestic market earlier this year.																								The high GDP growth forecast is based on expectations that reforms would continue irrespective of the government that is voted to power. The bank feels that GDP growth would accelerate to 7.6 per cent in the next fiscal. It, however, warned that growth could be slowed down if the fiscal deficit, now at nearly 11 per cent, was not curbed.																								The Manila-based development bank projected farm growth to come down to just 3.0 per cent during 2004-06, after attaining a high of 6.0 per cent during the year-ago period.																								The bank also predicts that Indian industry will grow by 10.2 per cent in 2004-05 and 8.9 per cent in 2005-06, while the service sector will continue growing at 8 per cent this fiscal and clip at the faster rate of 9.0 per cent in the next fiscal. 																								The report, which was released today, said seven years hence, India along with Taiwan and Pakistan may face one (crisis) if authorities are unable to forestall it using pre-emptive financial reforms.																								Non-performing loan ratios are reaching all-time highs in these three economies, even as the reported figures are still thought to underestimate the actual levels, it added. The Indian banking system saw net NPAs going up by 8 per cent last year but mainly on account of stricter provisioning norms.

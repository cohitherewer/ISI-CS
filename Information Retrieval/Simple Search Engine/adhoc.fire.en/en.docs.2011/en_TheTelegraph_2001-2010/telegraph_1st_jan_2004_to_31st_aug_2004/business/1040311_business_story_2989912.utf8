The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Sensex sheds 91 more
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 10: The sensex tumbled by yet another 91.32 points to close at 5759.29 today on the back of selective profit-booking by funds and operators amid worries that the BPO backlash may sting Indian infotech companies. 																								Besides infotech stocks, other sectoral heavyweights like Hindustan Lever (HLL) and Reliance Industries, banks and auto companies also felt the heat, forcing key indices to shed values. 																								HLLs share has been under pressure since the company announced its annual results. The fall in share price was sharper in the past few days after arch rival Procter amp; Gamble announced that it was slashing the price of Tide to take on HLLs Surf Excel in the detergent segment.																								Among the major losers were Reliance Industries, which shed Rs 11.10 to Rs 572.35, and HLL, which lost Rs 5.05 to Rs 149.35, the lowest in eight months. 																								Infosys surrendered Rs 82.30 to Rs 4,888, Bhel lost Rs 20.10 to Rs 608.10, Hero Honda fell by Rs 35.10 to Rs 494.60, HPCL lost Rs 6.95 to Rs 504.50 and ICICI Bank, which is expected to raise funds from the primary markets, lost Rs 12.30 to close at Rs 290.65.																								Funds have been selling automobile stocks and oil stocks for the past few days, said a dealer affiliated to Birla Sun life Securities. However, the market does not believe it is only due to the onrush of public issues in the primary market. 																								The 30-share BSE sensex opened lower at 5833.19 against Tuesdays close of 5850.61 and was in the red for the most part of the day before closing at 5759.29, a sharp fall of 1.56 per cent. The broad-based BSE-100 also dipped by 33.12 points to close at 3052.95 against Tuesdays close of 3086.07.																								State Bank was a major loser and led the downslide of bank shares today. As a result, the Bankex fell 79.99 points or 2.66 per cent to close at 2924.87.																								State Bank fell by Rs 18.05 to 616.25, Bank of Baroda fell by Rs 11 to Rs 230.10, Oriental Bank fell by Rs 14 to Rs 299.90 and Corporation Bank by Rs 8.80 to Rs 253.35.

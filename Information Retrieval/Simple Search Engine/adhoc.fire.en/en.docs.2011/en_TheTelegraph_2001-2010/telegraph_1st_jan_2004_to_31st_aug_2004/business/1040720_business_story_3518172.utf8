 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Sahara fares crash on rail tracks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dutta: Skys the limit																								New Delhi, July 19: Kicking off a fresh fare war in the skies, Saharas new chief Rono Dutta today announced a 30 per cent cut in its discount fares to wean away the top end of railway passengers.																								Dutta, who had earlier vowed to reduce costs by as much as 35 per cent, today cut Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi return journey apex fares to Rs 4,444 and Delhi-Calcutta-Delhi return fares to Rs 5,555.																								A senior Jet Airways executive said the airline would be forced to respond as the market was a small oligopoly and everybody blinks once someone else does something like this. 																								Executives of Indian Airlines said they would wait to see how Jet responds before drawing up any plan. 																								Sahara defended its fare cut claiming it was not aimed at cannibalising the market but rather at expanding it by targeting second-class air-conditioned coach passengers. A Calcutta-Delhi-Calcutta second-class, air-conditioned return train ticket currently costs Rs 4,500 and Dutta said his aim was to compete with this segment.																								We are not satisfied with our market share. We want to be much bigger players than we are today, the Sahara chief said.																								Dutta said globally a 30 per cent cut in fares translates into a 15 per cent increase in passengers carried. Air Sahara normally claims a load factor of 60-65 per cent. Sahara, however, attached strings to the heavily discounted tickets  they have to be bought 30 days ahead of travel and will be offered on just 5 per cent of the seats on each flight.																								Flyers buying the deep discount tickets cannot travel during weekends and have to stay at least one weekend at their destination.																								In the past, there had been price wars among the three domestic airlines during the leaner monsoon months. However, the winter, which is traditionally the peak season, has always seen a reversal of the trend. 																								Airline executives added that the fare cuts were also aimed at stalling any new no-frills airlines from entering the market with cheap tickets. However, the threat from these airlines is not yet taken seriously by the bigger players. Dutta says globally no-frills airlines have not been a success.

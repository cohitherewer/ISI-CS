 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 States asked to step up social spending 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Watchful eye																								Mumbai, May 10: The Reserve Bank has asked states to step up expenditure on development, particularly in the social sector. However, they should not lose sight of the fiscal reform measures already initiated and try improve on them, it added.																								The central bank, in its report on State Finances  A Study of Budgets of 2003-04, said the states should shore up tax and non-tax revenues to enhance budgetary flexibility. States have been urged to augment their tax receipts through better administration, improved tax compliance and rationalisation of the tax structure. 																								While the implementation of value-added-tax at the national level remains a major challenge, the report sees a need for further reforms and re-orientation on levies like stamp duties and registration fees by making them tax payer friendly.																								However, the most crucial observation was on the development expenditure. The report said the committed nature of certain expenditure has forced states to cut back on money spent on development.																								Such fiscal adjustments based on expenditure reduction could have adverse implications on growth. Fiscal empowerment through revenue augmentation in order to facilitate higher development expenditure is crucial, the report said.																								During 2003-04, estimates say social sector expenditure of states is budgeted to increase at a lower rate of 10 per cent over 2002-03. In 2002-03, Bengals social sector spending declined 1.1 per cent from its corresponding level in 2001-02.																								However, since the significant fiscal deterioration in the second half of the 1990s, states have undertaken a number of measures to contain their expenditure growth and to augment their tax receipts, the RBI said. 																								As a result, the ratio of states own tax revenue to GDP has improved from 5.6 per cent in 2001-02 to 5.9 per cent in 2002-03 and was budgeted at 6 per cent in 2003-04.																								The report felt that the adoption of appropriate user charges for the services provided by the states would help them augment their resource base. 																								Most states have initiated measures like setting up electricity regulatory commissions to determine electricity tariff in a rational manner and some have also raised user charges.																								While some initiatives have been taken by the states recently, these have not translated into any significant rise in their non-tax revenue receipts, the report added.																								Seeking more transparency in state budgetary operations, the RBI said it would enhance credibility of the fiscal stance of the states and also help investors to take informed decisions.

 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Gold prices harden 
				 	 Ring of fear																								London, June 22 (Bloomberg): Gold prices climbed in London as traders awaited next weeks meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which may lead to the first of a series of interest rate increases.																								Gold has dropped 8.1 per cent from a 15-year high on April 1, partly on speculation over rate increases, which would boost the dollar and make dollar-denominated gold less attractive as an alternative investment.																								Gold for immediate delivery in London rose 50 cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $394.05 an ounce. The euro was 0.2 per cent lower at $1.2092. The dollar is higher this quarter against 15 of 16 major currencies, including the euro.																								Reports later this week may show the US economy accelerating, underlining the need for higher rates.

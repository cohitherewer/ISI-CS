 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 BankMuscat backs Centurion
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 4: BankMuscat, Centurion Banks largest foreign partner, will invest Rs 30 crore. This is equivalent to a third of the banks rights issue of Rs 91 crore, slated to open later this month.																								Omans largest banking entity has confirmed that it will fully exercise its rights option and subscribe to 75 million shares, which entails a total investment of Rs 30 crore, Centurion Bank said today. The rights issue is to be offered to shareholders at Rs 4 per share (Rs 1 plus a premium of Rs 3 per share) and is expected to open on August 16.																								 As the largest shareholder in Centurion Bank, our decision to fully subscribe to the forthcoming rights issue is in keeping with our long term commitment to India and the confidence we have in the new management of Centurion Bank, BankMuscat chief executive Abdulrazak Ali Issa said.																								The bank has shown excellent progress over the past year and with the Reserve Bank granting it permission to further expand its presence in the country, we are confident it is on a positive growth path and will have much to offer to the discerning Indian retail consumer in the days to come, Ali said. 																								We have recently opened significant lines worth Rs 188 crores ($40 million) to assist Centurion Bank in its inter-bank and trade finance business as a mark of this commitment to the bank, he said.

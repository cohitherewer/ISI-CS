 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Steely resolve to hold prices
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, March 15: The countrys top five steel makers today agreed to space out price hike decisions at quarterly or longer intervals. 																								The top brass of SAIL, Tata Steel, Ispat, Essar and Jindal held three meetings  with steel ministry officials, among themselves and with steel users such as automakers and steel foundries  and took five major decisions.																								The producers agreed to maintain the price line for at least three months and added they may hold it longer, despite the government making it clear that it would not be able to fulfill a quid pro quo promise it had made to restart DEPB duty pay-backs on steel exports. 																								The government has failed to keep that promise as officials fear such a move could make the election commission question its motives. 																								Apart from agreeing to hold the price line till the elections, the producers decided to space out all future price hikes by at least three months. 																								We decided to review prices either at quarterly intervals or perhaps at even longer intervals, the chief executive of a steel firm said. 																								The meetings today were attended by Indian Steel Alliance chairman J. J. Irani, SAIL chief V. S. Jain, Essars Prashant Ruia, Jindal Vijaynagar Steels Sajan Jindal, Tata Steel director P. Mukherjee and Ispats marketing director Vinod Garg.																								Convincing the steel firms to to hold the price line till June was crucial for the BJP-led government due to the growing agitation by steel user foundries in north India due to rising steel prices. The government was apprehensive that without the quid pro quo of a duty pay-back the producers would not agree. 																								Steel foundries in Punjab, which had earlier forced the government to convince Tata Steel, SAIL, Essar, Ispat and the Jindals to either reduce or hold on to their prices, have complained to the Prime Minister that the reduction is a farce and an eye-wash.																								The government managed to get the top honchos to toe its line despite fielding steel secretary Binoo Sen towards the end of the meeting. The steel minister Braja Kishore Tripathy, who has been asked to persuade the steel-makers by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, was busy preparing for the oncoming electoral battle in his home state. 																								An attempt by the three steel-makers  The Jindals, Ispat and Essar  to get the government to ban iron ore exports also fizzled out as the steel-makers could not agree on this themselves.																								The manufacturers also promised steel users they would export only after fulfilling domestic demand. Major steel exporters like Essar and Ispat were naturally unhappy with the decision but agreed to abide by it. 																								All the players in the steel sector  steel plants, foundries and auto-companies  agreed they would not hike prices arbitrarily but would have a joint committee which would study input costs. This agreement was hammered together after a rather stormy meet in the late afternoon.																								This would hold good not only for steel makers but for steel users as well. 																								Right now automakers blame steel plants for car price hikes whereas the reality is that steel makes up only about 6 per cent of the cost of making a vehicle today, said a top SAIL executive. 																								All sides also decided not to go in for a blame game and to refrain from taking their case to the media without consulting each other. 																								The ISA, which had earlier been deeply divided over the appointment of former steel secretary Moosa Raza as secretary general of the apex body on account of the former IAS officer having been on the board of Jindal Steel, today cleared his appointment.

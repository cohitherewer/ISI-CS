The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 UTI talks tough on Haldia dues
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 8: Unit Trust of India (UTI) has taken a tough stand on repayments from Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL), even though the latter received a Calcutta High Court interim stay today against a tribunal decision to appoint a receiver for the company till April 15  the date for the next hearing.																								A UTI director said, HPLs long-term restructuring does not suit our business and regulatory needs. We are a mutual fund and cannot wait till the company debt restructuring (CDR) is over. The money is due and we need to get it back. UTI wants to recover Rs 15.90 crore from the Rs 5,170-crore petrochem company. 																								UTIs stand has come as a major blow to the company which is currently busy implementing the debt restructuring package approved by the CDR cell of the Reserve Bank of India last January.																								The company is saddled with a debt of Rs 4,200 crore and is trying to get out of this mess through financial restructuring, which mainly envisages lowering of interest rate, rescheduling the repayment period and infusing fresh equity.																								HPL analysts feel that this may adversely affect the debt restructuring process of the company. The restructuring will not happen immediately and the lenders are fully aware of it, they said.																								While the legal wrangles are on, HPL has decided to pay an interest of nearly Rs 100 crore to its lenders for January-March 2004.																								We are committed to pay interest to our lenders. In fact, we are approaching each of our 60 lenders for sanctioning the CDR package. We will pay them according to the schedule worked out by the CDR cell. We cannot bypass the CDR package and pay our lenders, said a senior company official.																								On UTIs demand of Rs 15.90 crore, the official said on February 18, UTI has received Rs 3.97 crore which UTI has suppressed before the debt recovery tribunal (DRT).																								UTI had initially moved the tribunal for recovering Rs 15.90 crore from HPL. The tribunal had asked to appoint a receiver to the company. HPL then moved the appellate tribunal against DRTs order. The appellate tribunal upheld DRTs decision which forced the company to move the Calcutta High Court.																								UTI argued that HPL had availed of various credit facilities from the mutual fund on execution of usual banking documents, but did not comply with the terms and conditions of the sanction. The accounts also became highly irregular.

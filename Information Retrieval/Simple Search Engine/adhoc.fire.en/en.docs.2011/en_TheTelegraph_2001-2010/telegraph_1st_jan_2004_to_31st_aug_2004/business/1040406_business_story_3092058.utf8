Calcutta, April 5: Goodricke Group will focus on enhancing its brand in the packet tea segment.																								To withstand the vagaries of the market, we need to build a brand, said managing director K. S. David at the companys annual general meeting today. 																								As against investments of around Rs 3-4 crore every year, a corpus of Rs 25 crore has been earmarked over the next three years for this brand building exercise. At present, the company has a 5 per cent market share in the packet tea segment and hopes to clock a sales volume of six million kgs from packet tea this fiscal. The desired ratio of revenue generation is 30 to 35 per cent from auctions and the remaining from packet tea.																								A complete overhaul of operations is being done to improve efficiency and upgrade the production quality. Other initiatives like strengthening the marketing team, enhancing the distribution channels and redesigning the packaging and prevent duplication will also play an instrumental role in improving Goodrickes brand value.																								The company also plans to boost its revenue from exports and take it to 250 million kgs this year once exports to West Asia resume. Goodricke had exported 168 million kgs in the previous year. Japan also has the potential to emerge as a big market and has shown considerable interest in instant tea. Keeping in view the increased instant tea demand, production capacity has been doubled so that the company can meet demands from this segment. 																								According to David, the proliferation of back room tea packaging firms has eroded the mid-segment market. So in order to survive, a company has to be either at the top end or at the lower end.

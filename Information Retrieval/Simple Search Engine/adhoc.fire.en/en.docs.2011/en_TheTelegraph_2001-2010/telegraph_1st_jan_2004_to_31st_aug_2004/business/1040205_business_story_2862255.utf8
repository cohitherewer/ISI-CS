 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Equity mutual funds breathe easy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 4: The confirmation of the extension of the tax-waiver on dividends paid by equity mutual funds brought relief to the industry that was gearing up for fat payouts before the tax incentive was withdrawn, and yet fearing a large-scale redemption after March 31.																								The mutual fund industry is now breathing easy, and lobbying the government for tax exemption on long-term capital gains on investments in equity schemes. The Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), which had pitched for the exemption last year as well, is optimistic about its chances of convincing the government after todays announcement, and expects Sebi to support its demand.																								We are going to write to the finance ministry within a couple of days seeking tax exemption on long-term capital gains on investments in equity funds, said Amfi chairman A. P. Kurien.																								The industry feels the government should continue to promote the equity market among retail investors, especially as Indian capital markets have emerged as preferred investment destination for funds from all over the world.																								Though retail investors are returning to the market, they are still haunted by scams. The industry feels the government should offer more tax incentives on mutual fund investments to keep retail investors flag flying in the market.																								The best way to promote the market is to continue with the tax-waiver on dividend distribution  which the finance minister announced today  and offer tax-exemption on long-term capital gains. That would be a natural extension of the tax exemption on (select blue-chip) stocks, Kurien said. The finance minister yesterday announced that tax exemption on long-term capital gains on shares would continue for three more years.																								The waiver of tax on dividend paid by equity funds  or those that invest more in shares than bonds  would benefit those people who put their money in dividend plans. At present, the dividend paid out by equity schemes is completely tax-free.																								But schemes that invest more in bonds than in shares have to pay a tax of little over 12 per cent on dividends distributed. The tax is paid out of the schemes net asset value (NAV).																								If the government agrees to offer tax exemption on long-term capital gains on equity funds, people who invest in growth plans would also benefit. Under the growth plan, all gains accrue to the NAV of the scheme, and one could liquidate his gains without having to pay tax.

 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Focus on gas-based power plants
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 28: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is toying with the idea of moving up the value chain by setting up gas-based power plants at some of its new gas fields. The company would then sell electricity to power companies instead of gas as an input.																								Elaborating on this gas-to-wire strategy, ONGC chairman Subir Raha said in the case of some gas fields, it may not be economically viable to lay long pipelines to supply gas to distant consumers. Power plants would be set up at such sites from where electricity would be supplied to the existing grids of power transmission and distribution utilities. 																								The generation of electricity would eliminate the need for laying costly pipelines over long distances and would result in higher profits for ONGC.

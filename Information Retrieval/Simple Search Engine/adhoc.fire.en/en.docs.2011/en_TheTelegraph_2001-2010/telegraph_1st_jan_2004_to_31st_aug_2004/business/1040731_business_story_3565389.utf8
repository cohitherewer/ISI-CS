 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Maruti to give bread-earner 800 a catchy look
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Crowd puller																								New Delhi, July 30: Maruti Udyog Ltd is planning to introduce a new version of its popular small car, Maruti 800, in an effort to ramp up sales.																								The countrys largest car maker, where Japans Suzuki Motor Company holds a 54.2 per cent stake, is also re-working the design of its small utility van, Omni, in line with the automakers strategy to introduce new-look models for better brand recall.																								There would be some cosmetic changes like the front-grill, headlights, rear lights, while there would be increased automation, sources said. 																								The new-look version of its largest-selling model will be catchy and is expected to be popular.																								We are also working on the upgradation of the exhaust system of the models to meet Euro-III emission standards as it is scheduled to be implemented in 2005, they added.																								The automaker is ranked among the top 20 car sellers in the world and is credited with creating the small car market in India. But vehicle sales of Maruti 800 fell 21.82 per cent to 31,874 units in the quarter that ended on June 30, while cumulative sales rose 19 per cent in the period from a year ago.																								The weakness lies in familiarity and people like something new. So it is imperative for us to change the style, Jagdish Khattar, chief of the automaker, was recently quoted as saying.																								Over a period of time, Maruti has cut compact car Altos price to bring it closer to the price of Maruti 800. The 800-cc model would be aggressively marketed in the semi-urban and rural markets, while Alto is being promoted for the urban market, sources said.																								Alto is the companys cheapest compact car, although Maruti 800 and the Omni van are priced lower at about Rs 2.05 lakh. The mini and compact car segment made up around 80 per cent of the countrys car market. Nearly 9,00,000 units were sold in the last financial year.																								However, Maruti is struggling in the mid-size and premium car segment, where Esteem and Baleno are positioned. While the sales of bigger cars are growing at a rapid pace, Maruti has only managed to secure a 12 per cent market share.

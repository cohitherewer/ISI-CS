 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Birla offensive with joint will
 Charity chant in new testament A STAFF REPORTER N.G. Khaitan addressing a press conference  in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Dutta																								Calcutta, Aug. 17: Two wills were pitted against one with the Birlas today unveiling documents that predate what has been claimed as the last testament of Priyamvada Birla. 																								The Birla family filed a petition in Calcutta High Court seeking probate (legal authentication) of two mutual wills of M. P. Birla and his wife Priyamvada. The move is a challenge to the Priyamvada will in which she has left all her properties to Rajendra Singh Lodha.  We filed a petition to have the  wills probated. Mutual and concurrent, they were made on  July 13, 1982, before same sets of witnesses, said N. G.  Khaitan of Khaitan amp; Co, the solicitor firm representing  the Birlas.																								Kashinath Tapuriah, brother of Priyamvada Birla, and Arvind Newar, son of M. P. Birlas sister Laxmi Bai Newar, joined the solicitor as he spoke to reporters. Both sisters of M. P. Birla  Laxmi Bai Newar and Radha Bai Mohta filed an affidavit in court today, saying they had no objection to probating the mutual wills.																								The Birlas have been at war with Lodha since the chartered accountant claimed that Priyamvada bequeathed all assets of the MP Birla group to him. He has filed an application in court to have the will probated. 																								This is not her will. She could not have made this will. Let me tell you, that in legal terms, this amounts to a fraud on her husband, said Khaitan, referring to the Priyamvada will that names Lodha as the sole successor.																								The application for authentication of the two wills was backed by Birlas estimate of the value of MP Birla group assets. 																								Estimating the fair prices of her holdings, we have valued the worth of her personal assets at Rs 2,404 crore. But, if we include other assets, the amount will be around Rs 5,000 crore, Khaitan said.																								Lodhas probate application, by contrast, values the properties at Rs 3.52 crore. If that is the value, we are willing to pay Rs 100 crore. And then, we will use the entire property for the purpose of charity, Khaitan added.																								The Birlas circulated the copies of the wills, which included the names of the executors, to prove that M. P. Birla and Priyamvada wanted their properties to go to charity.																								M. P. Birlas will had four executors  his wife, K. K. Birla, Kashi Nath Tapuriah and Pradip Kumar Khaitan. Priyamvada named three in the joint document  her husband, G. P. Birla and Kashi Nath Tapuriah. Khaitan said executors had filed the petitions to secure legal sanction for their testaments.																								Khaitan amp; Co has already filed a suit seeking to stop Lodha from dealing with Priyamvadas properties. 																								On the basis of the mutual and concurrent wills, I filed a suit in Calcutta High Court. I have taken a stand that R. S. Lodha is neither a rightful nor a lawful executor and that he is meddling with the estate of Priyamvada Birla in a wrongful manner. He should hand over the estate to the executors of the 1982 mutual will, said Khaitan.

 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Power trading pool to cope with spikes
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Towers of support																								Calcutta, Jan. 25: Power Trading Corporation (PTC) plans a pool that will help it deliver in times of a sudden spike in energy demand, a switch from the current system where supplies are tied up after orders are placed.																								A power pool will help us cater to customers during an emergency. If there is a sudden requirement, we will be able to supply from this pool, a senior official of the corporation said. The plan is part of the governments larger initiative for power to all by 2012.																								The corporation has formulated an eight-year business plan in consultation with ICICI Bank. It is a rolling plan that will be reviewed annually by the corporation after considering changes in the sector. 																								According to the plan, the volume of trade is expected to reach 14,000 million units in 2009-10 from about 4,000 million units in 2002-03.																								The annual funding requirement for the expansion drive would be Rs 15 billion by 2010.																								Delhi is the largest buyer of power from PTC, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the total power purchased from the corporation. Haryana and Karnataka follow with 16 per cent and 10 per cent of power purchase, respectively. PTC buys around 31 per cent from Uttaranchal and around 22 per cent from Bengal.																								The corporation has commenced cross-border trade with Bhutan, accounting for around 11 per cent of its power purchase. Currently, surplus power is sourced from the 336 MW Chukha hydro project and the 60 MW Kurichu hydro project in Bhutan.																								PTC officials said the corporation does not suffer from the problem of mounting SEB dues despite extensive dealings with state electricity boards, largely because of the weekly billing and payment system that has been put in place by PTC.

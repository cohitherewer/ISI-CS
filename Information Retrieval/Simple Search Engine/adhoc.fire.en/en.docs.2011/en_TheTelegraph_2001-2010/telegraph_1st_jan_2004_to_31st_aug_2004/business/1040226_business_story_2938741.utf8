 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Patni lists with a bang, drifts later
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 25: Trading in shares of Patni Computers started today with the stock listing at Rs 255 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), and at Rs 270 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), but closed marginally above the issue price.																								It crossed Rs 300 in early morning trade  going up to Rs 305 on the BSE and Rs 301 on the NSE  but was hammered down by heavy selling. Over 1.7 crore shares were traded today on the two bourses put together, and the stock closed at Rs 233.20 on the BSE, and at Rs 234.45 on the NSE.																								The company had issued shares at Rs 230 apiece. Towards the close of the session, it looked as if the stock would fall below the issue price. Though it did not, it came perilously close to it. The stock hit a low of Rs 231.15 on the NSE and Rs 231.50 on the BSE.																								It was a bad day for listing as most top-rung stocks fell sharply today. While sensex  the key index of share prices  fell 116 points (or 2 per cent) from its previous close, the NSE Nifty  an index with a much broader base  declined 1.9 per cent.																								It was clearly a disappointing start for Patni Computers, but we shouldnt try to read too much into this in view of the selling across the board. Lets see how the stock reacts to a broad-based recovery, said a broker.																								The selling in Patni Computers share was attributed to investors switching their funds to other public issues.																								What is also important perhaps is the fact that the institutional investors have already cornered (through allotment) 50 per cent of the companys floating stocks (or those in trade), and clearly do not have appetite for more in a choppy market like now, said an investment banker.

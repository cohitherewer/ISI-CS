 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Markets saw the shuffle coming
 SATISH JOHNMumbai, April 15: The restructuring of Hindustan Levers (HLL) management structure to bring about a sharper focus on key brands is in line with parent Unilevers strategy to boost growth through a two-pronged plan of price rationalisation and harnessing synergies of size and scale to generate competitive advantage.																								And, with the makeover, comes the recognition that Indian managers have emerged as a force to reckon with in the pecking order of Uniliver. Current chairman M. S. Bangas new assignment testifies to this.																								As a helmsman who took charge when Hindustan Lever was grappling with the churn in the Indian FMCG market, he had to contend with downtrading  the phenomenon of cheaper, regional products making a big dent in the sales of established players such as HLL.																								Banga was also the archetypal surgeon: he wielded the scalpel on businesses that were out of sync with HLLs core competencies and swung the focus back on key brands.																								Commenting on Bangas new assignment, Harrish Zaveri, vice-president of equity research at Edelweiss Capital, said, It is reflective of the growing power of Indian managers in the Unilever hierarchy.																								Even analysts who have been critical of Levers performance in the past acknowledge that the developments today are a vote of confidence rather than a vote of no-confidence in what Banga and his team did since May 2000, when he took the baton from Keki Dadiseth.																								Observers tracking the FMCG sector were expecting changes in the Hindustan Lever echelons, more so because it is battling rivals like Procter amp; Gamble and Colgate. Then, there are upstarts like Anchor, Ghadi Detergent, Cavinkare  all of them armed with low-priced products nibbling away at its market-share.																								Any restructuring is a response to the market, said Jagdeep Kapoor of Samsika Marketing Consultants, a consultant advising medium sized FMCG companies on how to craft marketing strategies.																								The markets, however, did not appear to have given the changes too much importance. The Hind Lever stock closed a tad lower  down Rs 1.60  at Rs 150.65.																								The lack of interest in the Hind Lever share coincided with a larger slide on exchanges with the BSE sensex shedding 60.55 points to end the session at 5843.97. The losses were blamed on profit booking by retail investors and FIs in shares that notched up smart gains in Tuesdays market rally. Infosys, Satyam, HPCL, Bhel, L amp;T, Bharti Tele-Venture, Reliance, Tisco and Zee were among those which suffered sharp losses.																								FIIs, who have consistent net buyers over the past several sessions, slowed down their purchases during the session, brokers added. 																								Those tracking Lever on bourses were of the view that the revamp was necessary. With changing market needs, every firm may have to look at a new structure to respond better to changing consumer behaviour and to devise a brand strategy, Samsikas Kapoor said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Enron sells pipeline assets for $ 1.8 bn
				 	 Sweet deal																								Houston, May 22 (Reuters): Texas natural gas tycoon Oscar Wyatt is paying $1.8 billion for Enron Corps prized pipeline assets in a deal announced on Friday that puts him back in the gas business and gives the bankrupt energy giant cash to repay creditors. 																								NuCoastal LLC, a Wyatt-led consortium that includes affiliates of Citigroup, Kelso amp; Co. and ArcLight Capital Partners LLC, will also assume $430 million in outstanding debt belonging to CrossCountry Energy. 																								CrossCountry is the company Enron formed in June 2003 to hold its ownership interests in three natural gas pipeline systems  Transwestern Pipeline Company, Citrus Corp., and Northern Plains Natural Gas Company. 																								The sale gives Wyatts company some of the best-run and most consistently profitable assets Enron has left, and will give the bankrupt energy trader money to repay creditors who lost billions when it fell into bankruptcy in late 2001. 																								These assets are far and away the best that Enron has left. This puts Oscar back in the game, said John Olson, who runs 2003 Houston Energy Partners, an energy hedge fund affiliated with the Sanders Morris Harris investment bank. 																								Wyatt ostensibly retired after selling his Coastal Corp. to El Paso Corp. in 2001, a deal that cost him dearly when El Pasos stock fell 90 per cent in the wake of Enrons accounting scandal and ensuing bankruptcy.Wyatt back again																								The colourful billionaire was unable to stay away from the business arena and has been using his second corporate iteration, NuCoastal, to look for new opportunities over the past two years. 																								The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending approval by the US bankruptcy court in Manhattan that is overseeing Enrons Chapter 11 proceedings. The court will hold an overbid process to allow other potential buyers to submit higher bids. 																								Enrons unsecured creditors committee and board of directors has approved the sale, which must pass muster with state and federal regulators.

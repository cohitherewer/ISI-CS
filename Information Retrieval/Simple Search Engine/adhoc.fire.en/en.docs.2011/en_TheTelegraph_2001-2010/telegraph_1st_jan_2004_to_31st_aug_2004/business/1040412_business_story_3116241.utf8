 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Cap on quake cover in offing
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, April 11: Swiss Re, the Zurich-based reinsurer, has offered technical help to Indian reinsurer General Insurance Corporation (GIC) to examine the possibility of putting a cap on earthquake insurance covers.																								The Tariff Advisory Committee along with GIC and other general insurers have been mulling the idea of capping earthquake insurance covers on the lines of a similar limit on insurance risks stemming from terror attacks.																								The move is probably opportune. Seismologists have been analysing a series of recent tremors in the northern parts of the country and there has been a lot of speculation about whether this is an indication of an imminent disaster. Insurers, who suffered huge liabilities after the Gujarat quake in 2000, are only too aware of the problem. The Swiss Re research department has offered their help on the issue. With Indias exposure being high to earthquakes, it should be profitable to learn from the experience of one of the worlds largest reinsurers, said GIC managing director P. B. Ramanujam.																								While no insurer is willing to reinsure 100 per cent of such huge and unquantifiable risks, it is increasingly becoming an issue of concern for both the insurer and the insured.																								Among other covers, earthquake insurance also forms a part of the tariff line business and, hence, it is virtually impossible for any company to refuse insurance.																								With claim ratios being minimum 100-200 per cent of the premium earned, it is certainly a non-profitable business. However, according to tariff guidelines, an insurer cannot ignore the clients proposal, said a senior official from Oriental Insurance, a public-sector general insurance company.																								While GIC on its behalf has started doing its own bit, officials admit that there seems to be an extensive lack of data.																								The Indian reinsurer is busy collecting exposure profiles of seismic zones in various cities, states and towns. In-depth data is needed to decide valuations. For example, the frequency of earthquake occurrence at a particular location, variations in intensity, spread of risk and loss profile are some of the issues which calls for minute and huge data collection, said Ramanujam.

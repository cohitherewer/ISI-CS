The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Infotech perceives no threat
 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Logging into the new order																								New Delhi, May 13: The twin icons of IT  Chandrababu Naidu and S. M. Krishna  have been toppled within a space of two days but the industry isnt prepared to accept the view that a politician who is too closely associated with the wealth-creating industry runs the risk of falling on his sword.																								Both Naidu and Krishna built large cyber constituencies  aggressively wooing investment from technology-driven multinationals in their states with gift-wrapped incentives. 																								IT mavens felt the software industry had received its share of cosseting  but the reversal in the fortunes of the two IT-enamoured politicians were possibly because they didnt do enough for the other areas. So, it would be wrong to blame the IT industry for their fall from grace.																								The IT sector received the attention it needed both from the Congress and the NDA governments but the other sectors did not get the share of attention that they deserved and the results are evident, said Sudip Banerjee, president, Enterprises Solutions, Wipro Technologies.																								IT companies werent worried about the pace of reforms  or the fallout of the verdict on future blandishments for the sector. If there was a lesson in the poll verdict, it was this: pay more attention to agriculture, health and water than they have received till now, but without giving short shrift to the software industry.																								It (the poll verdict) was not about the personality or individual but the lack of focus on other pressing issues like the four-year drought that sparked farmer suicides and drinking water shortage. Thats what did them in, Banerjee added.																								While accepting that the two leaders were seen as being more pro-IT and showing less interest in other issues, the IT companies felt that the future leaders in the two states and at the Centre would continue to give the necessary support to IT.																								The new leaders and the new governments will have to continue the process since IT is a major foreign exchange generator and is big employment generator that no government can afford to neglect, said Banerjee.																								Nasscom felt that the verdict was an indication that the disparity between the rural and urban regions had widened.																								Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said, The verdict is an indication that the disparity has grown between the rural and urban areas and there is a need for leaders to look at the demand and needs of rural areas. Leaders like Naidu and Krishna have lost due to these reasons and not because of their image as IT leaders.																								Ravi Ramu, group chief financial officer at MphasiS, said: It is a great comfort that there will be a stable government. The certainty about the future of the government is now established. Issues like divestment and other reform processes we believe will continue with a human face. The new government must ensure that the public sector companies get the necessary initiatives to meet completion.																								Nandan Nilekani, CEO, president and managing director of Infosys Technologies Ltd, said, We believe that the primary concern of the government should be jobs-led economic growth, across all sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, retail as well as knowledge driven industries.

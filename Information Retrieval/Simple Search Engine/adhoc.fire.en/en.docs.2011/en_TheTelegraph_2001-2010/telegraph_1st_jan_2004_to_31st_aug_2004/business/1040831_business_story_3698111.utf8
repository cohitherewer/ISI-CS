 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 30: The Reserve Bank (RBI) feels an uncertain monsoon and persistent high and unpredictable oil prices may put a downward pressure on the GDP growth for this fiscal.																								In its credit policy announced in May, the RBI had projected a 6.5-7 per cent real GDP growth, given a sustained industrial performance, normal monsoons and good exports. However, despite an inadequate monsoon and high oil prices, the RBI is confident that evolving strengths during the year may see India through.																								In its annual report for 2003-04, the RBI has observed that GDP growth prospects continue to be bright. A possible acceleration in the growth of world output and enhanced domestic investment activity will help it. However, there are downside risks of an uncertain monsoon as well as high oil prices. 																								These risks impart an element of downward bias to the estimates of GDP growth made at the beginning of the year. But evolving strengths during the year may restore the position and India will continue to be among the top performers globally, the RBI said.																								According to the central bank, the pre-monsoon assessment by the Meteorological Department had forecast a normal monsoon. After an initial hiccup, the monsoon revived in August and the cumulative deficiency declined. Spatial distribution of rainfall has improved.																								Although the progress of rainfall so far has not been as satisfactory as in the corresponding period of 2003, drought fears have receded, the RBI said.																								The central bank added that a fuller assessment of the impact of the monsoon on growth prospects for 2004-05 is difficult at present. However, the medium-term outlook remains favourable. 																								Industrial activity has gathered strength and all constituents, including manufacturing, electricity and mining, have shared in this expansion. However, there has been some slowdown in electricity generation in May and June. 																								The industrial climate reflects a revival of investment demand and building up of capacity, RBI stated. 																								This has been supported by improved corporate profitability, expansion in non-food credit and optimism regarding production and export growth. However, production of consumer goods has slowed down. Growth in the services sector is expected to build upon the momentum achieved in the preceding year and be sustained above trend levels, it noted.																								With the deepening of the industrial recovery and sustained growth of the services sector, the economy is set to build upon the robust performance recorded in 2003-04. Adequate stocks of foodgrains and foreign exchange reserves would provide a sufficient cushion against possible adverse developments, the RBI said.

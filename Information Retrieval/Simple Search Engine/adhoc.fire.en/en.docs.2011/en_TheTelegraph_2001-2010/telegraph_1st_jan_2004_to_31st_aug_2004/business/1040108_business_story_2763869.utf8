 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Reliance snaps up petrochem wing of Nocil
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Mumbai, Jan. 7: Sunbright  Cement Agencies, a business associate of Reliance Industries  (RIL), will take over the petrochemicals and plastics products  division of National Organic Chemical Industries (Nocil).																								Under the financial restructuring proposal approved today, the assets of Nocils petrochemicals division, the business undertaking of the plastic products wing and its liabilities will be transferred from Nocil to Nocil Petrochemicals (NPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunbright will invest in NPL after the spin-off. 																								The assets of the rubber chemicals division (RCD) and a chunk of the liabilities will remain with Nocil. The company told exchanges that the liabilities of secured creditors would be settled according to terms that will be agreed upon by the company, NPL and Sunbright.																								The takeover will provide Reliance a wealth of synergy for its petrochemicals business, consolidating its dominant position in business. 																								Nocils petrochemicals division, currently lying dormant, will gain from Reliance groups technical and manufacturing expertise, a statement by Reliance said.																								The complex, which houses an ethylene cracker, value-added unit and a fibre intermediates wing, can produce 3 lakh tonnes of petrochemicals, besides 80,000 tonnes of polymer. The plastic products division at Akola can churn out 10,000 tonnes of processed products.																								The sale will help Nocil, which has been reeling under a mountain of liabilities and a highly competitive petrochemicals market, breathe a little easier. 																								Earlier, the Shell Group had walked away from a plan to buy a large stake after Nocils liabilities mounted.																								Last year, Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) had asked Nocil to settle its dues of over Rs 100 crore, which it owed on account of naphtha purchases, before the unit was closed down. The petroleum PSU was even offered a slice of the equity, but the offer was refused.																								This year, Nocil had to close down its petrochemicals division and offer VRS to employees. It had planned to sell some of its properties in Mumbai to bring down liabilities, believed to be more than Rs 300 crore.

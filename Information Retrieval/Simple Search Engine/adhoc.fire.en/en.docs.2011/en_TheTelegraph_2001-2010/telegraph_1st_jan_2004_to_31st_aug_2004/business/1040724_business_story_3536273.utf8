 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Wadia: Skys the limit																								Mumbai, July 23: Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Ltd has filed an application with the Centre, seeking permission to enter the aviation business.																								According to chairman Nusli Wadia, the company has appointed an international consultant, who is expected to submit the recommendations in three months. The company will take a decision once the report is filed, he added.																								Speaking to reporters after Bombay Dyeings annual general meeting today, Wadia said the need to enter the aviation sector is fuelled by the fact that a large number of people in the country travelled by air.

Recently, UB entered into a deal with Airbus to buy four aircraft with an option to buy eight more.																								Earlier, Wadia told the shareholders that the company has decided to develop 2.4 million sq ft of land at Spring Mill in Dadar for residential as well as commercial purposes. The construction work is expected to begin by the year-end, he added. Bombay Dyeing has a total of 4.5 million sq ft of saleable land. The company is also revamping some of its retail outlets.

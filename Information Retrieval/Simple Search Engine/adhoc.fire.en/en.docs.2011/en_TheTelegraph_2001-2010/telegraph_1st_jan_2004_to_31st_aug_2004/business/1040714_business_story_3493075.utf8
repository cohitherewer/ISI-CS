 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 13: Credit rating agency Crisil has projected a Rs 20,000-crore shortfall in the Centres revenue collections this year. The projection has been made on the basis of post-budget simulation studies.																								The revenue projections in the budget is highly optimistic and out of line with the historical patterns of tax buoyancy, according to an analysis by Crisil. The anticipated growth rate of 24.64 per cent in tax revenues is an area of concern. The budget plans to garner an additional tax revenue of Rs 62,800 crore, a large part of which is contingent on growth in corporate turnover and profits.																								The turnover tax, which expects to yield Rs 7,500 crore this year, may play a spoilsport. In such a case, there will be a shortfall of Rs 12,000 crore if the growth rate of 40 per cent in corporate tax collections is not achieved.																								The proposed transaction tax of 0.15 per cent will have a negative impact on traders. There should be a differential rate for delivery and non-delivery-based transactions, Crisil chief economist Subir Gokarn said at a post-budget meeting. The proposal came hours before finance minister P. Chidambaram met Sebi officials, brokers and bond-dealers in Delhi.																								Brokers have been apprehensive about shrinking margins on shares and bond trading if the transaction tax is imposed on purchases of all listed securities. The proposed tax would have virtually no impact on foreign institutional investors as they are used to such taxes in other countries, Gokarn said.																								The expectation of gross tax revenues of Rs 3,17,733 crore hinges on hopes that net tax revenue will grow by 24.64 per cent in 2004-05, which depends on how the industry and farm sectors will perform. 																								Even if agriculture does exceptionally well and grows at the trend level of 3 per cent, industry will have to grow close to 9 per cent to deliver the budgeted growth rates and by implication the revenue projections.

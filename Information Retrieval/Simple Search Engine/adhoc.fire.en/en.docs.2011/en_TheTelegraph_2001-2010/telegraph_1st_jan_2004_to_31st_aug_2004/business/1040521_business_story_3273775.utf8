The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Sensex fails to hold on to gains
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 20: After two big-bang trading sessions, the stock markets were range-bound today and the sensex hovered around the psychological 5000-mark. The bellwether index, however, turned weak later in the day.																								Initially, the market was extremely volatile on positive statements made by the Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh and moved in a range of 5073.70 and 4927.62 in the first 15 minutes of trading as investors welcomed his appointment.																								The BSE benchmark 30-share index, which started off on a firm note at 5048.17, later stabilised around the 5000-mark. It, however, came under pressure after midsession and ended at 4932.11 compared with Wednesdays close of 5006.10, a net loss of 73.99 points or 1.48 per cent. 																								The market ran out of steam in the latter part of the session as operators and local funds pressed sales in key blue chip stocks, including PSU counters, despite Singhs promise that economic reforms would continue. However, he had ruled out privatisation of oil PSUs ONGC and Gail, which affected sentiments.																								The US dollar ended sharply dearer against the rupee at Rs 45.31/34 per dollar from Rs 45.22-23.																								The business turnover on BSE fell to Rs 2,183.98 crore from Rs 2,402.73 crore on Wednesday. Reliance shed Rs 9.45 to Rs 447.80 and SBI lost Rs 10.90 to Rs 514.85. 																								In the tech sector, Wipro lost Rs 48.40 to Rs 1,474.80, and Infosys lost Rs 55.95 to Rs 4925.60.

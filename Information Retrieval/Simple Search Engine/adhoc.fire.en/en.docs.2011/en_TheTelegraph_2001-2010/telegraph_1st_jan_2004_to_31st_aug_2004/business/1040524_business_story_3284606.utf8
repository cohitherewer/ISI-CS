 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Futures margins escalate but quotes head south
 SATISH JOHN Upwardly mobile 																								Mumbai, May 23: The margins in the futures segment for certain shares have run up more than the market price in derivatives, reflecting the recent high volatility on the stock markets.																								Even as margins rose sharply above prevailing market prices in some cases, many futures and options quotes, especially the Nifty (index future), are trading at a discount to market price signifying an extreme amount of pessimism, said market analysts.																								This (margins being higher than prevailing market price) is an expression of intense volatility and exposure on the market, a fund manager affiliated to a leading mutual fund said.																								The Nifty ended the week at 1560.20, while Nifty futures were trading at a discount at 1549 to 1527.																								Derivatives hedge risks normally associated with investment portfolios and in some cases enable investors to take a bigger exposure by coughing up a percentage of the quoted price of a share.																								Such high margins are due to the recent high-pitched volatility which saw the sensex shed 842.37 points at one point on May 17. Dealers said the volatility has caused margins to increase exponentially. Market players said the high margins would automatically make scrips less attractive for trading.																								Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), the public sector shipping giant, saw the initial margin for its share at 123 per cent, while investors have to cough up 110 per cent in Syndicate Bank for trading in the futures segment on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).																								Bank of Barodas initial margin is at 78 per cent, IPCL at 88 per cent, Gail at 70 per cent, Oriental Bank of Commerce at 62 per cent, Tata Steel at 63 per cent, Punjab National Bank at 50 per cent and Nifty futures at 29 per cent.																								In the NSE cash segment on Friday, SCI scrip closed at Rs 92.05, while Syndicate Bank shares changed hands at 39.85. Therefore, the margins that investors in the derivatives segment had to cough up for the two scrips are more than the market price.																								When the markets crashed on May 17, SCI surrendered 20 per cent from Rs 86.30 to Rs 69.30 and Syndicate Bank shed 14.41 per cent from Rs 35.05 to Rs 30.																								The derivatives segment on the NSE contributes more than 50 per cent of the traded turnover on Indian bourses, signifying the importance of the segment in the current scenario.																								The open-interest position due to the volatility and perhaps the high margins has decreased substantially on NSE from the fateful Monday. 																								For instance, on Friday, NSE saw trading worth Rs 4,068.03 crore for 21.53 crore shares, while the derivatives segment registered 3.36 lakh contracts worth Rs 9601.32 crore.

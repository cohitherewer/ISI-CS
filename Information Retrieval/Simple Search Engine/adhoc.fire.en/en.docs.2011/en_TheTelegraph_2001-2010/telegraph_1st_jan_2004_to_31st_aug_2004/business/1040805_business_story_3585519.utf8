 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Tea revamp dole plucked out
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Woes in a row																								Calcutta, Aug. 4: Plans to replant tea bushes and upgrade estates are withering in the drought of funds after the Tea Board rooted out subsidies extended for the two purposes. 																								Old bushes need to be replanted to enhance yields and improve quality. A perturbed tea industry has already taken up the matter with commerce minister Kamal Nath. Tea Association of India president Suresh Bansal said: We have taken up the matter with the minister. He has assured me that it will be looked into.																								The Tea Board used to run two schemes  plantation development and quality upgradation/product diversification. It would provide a 25 per cent subsidy to planters for the schemes.																								Recently, the board attached a condition under which tea companies that file returns under Section 33AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961, will not be eligible for subsidies.																								Our members, who approached the tea development department of the Tea Board, were told that they cannot get the subsidies because they have availed of the benefits under Section 33 AB and Tea Development Accounts Schemes  1990 and 2001, Bansal said.																								Due to the restriction, the Tea Board is not entertaining applications for subsidy in cases where loans have been tied up to finance estate upgrade plans.																								Industry officials said money deposited in the Tea Development Account Scheme of 1990 and 2001 has almost been used up.																								Since 1999, most of the tea companies have hardly made any profit to enable them to contribute to the deposit scheme under Section 33AB of the Income Tax Act.																								Bansal said even if the prices and taxable income were to improve considerably in the near future, there will never be large enough funds in the Tea Development Account Schemes  1990 and 2001  to meet the actual subsidy requirements (25 per cent of the project cost) for financing development projects.																								It is clearly stated that that financial assistance (inclusive of loans and subsidies) rendered by the Tea Board roughly takes care of more than 10 per cent of the annual outlay of the industry for development of plantations and factories.																								The tax concession allowed under Section 33 AB should not be treated or categorised as subsidy. Tea firms have long been unable to generate sufficient development funds due to higher tax burden on their income compared with other industries, Bansal added.

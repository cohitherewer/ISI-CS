 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Ad stub-out woes for cigarette makers
 RAJA GHOSHAL 				 	 Up in smoke																								New Delhi, April 27: The multi-crore cigarette industry is going through a haze of worry.																								Tobacco advertising is about to be stubbed out.																								Come May 1, the government will impose a blanket ban on all forms of tobacco advertising.																								The central government has banned all forms of advertisement for cigarettes and other tobacco products and smoking in public places from May 1.																								The enforcement under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (prohibition of advertisement and regulation of trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution) Act, 2003, has been notified by the health and family welfare ministry.																								The act prohibits sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to minors. India is among the few countries in the world that has signed and ratified the international framework convention on tobacco control.																								Cigarette major ITC is guarded in its response to the ban. We will abide by the law as we have always been on the right side of the law, said S. Venkatramani, spokesperson for ITC Limited. ITC executives say it is difficult to ascertain the impact of the ban on advertising as yet.																								The Calcutta-based giant is one of the biggest spenders on cigarette advertising in the print medium. Gold Flake, an ITC brand, has been rated as the number one brand in a recent brand survey by a business newspaper. 																								The total value of tobacco advertising is calculated to be worth more than Rs 400 crore. Industry estimates place advertising from pan masalas at about 65 per cent of total tobacco advertising spend. Cigarette ad spends account for another 33 per cent while beedis for about 2 per cent.																								Advertising agencies seem to have resigned to the government directive. The ban on tobacco advertising has been something for which people were being mentally prepared for some time now, said Shovon Chowdhury, managing director of ad agency Street Lights. 																								Chowdhury, who was earlier with Bates which handles ITCs cigarette ads, said, It is just that one big category of advertising is closing and agencies will have to look for more clients, elsewhere. 																								Since the ban seeks to put a stop on even surrogate ads, the question that looms large is whether brands such as ITCs Wills Lifestyle store will continue. It is not a surrogate form of advertising. It is an actual business, said Venkataramani.																								Venkatramani added that ITC has pulled out of all sports sponsorship in 2001 itself when the Union cabinet had approved the proposed tobacco bill. 																								R. A. Poddar, chief mentor of Godfrey Phillips Limited and till recently CEO of the cigarette maker, sounds bitter. He thinks that even advertising on point of sales may not be the solution as there are restrictions on point of sales as well. Godfrey Phillips may even have to bid adieu to the Red amp; White bravery award that it has been running for some time now, say analysts. 																								It is the cigarettes which will be suffering the most. The gutkas are doing a lot of surrogates in the name of pan masalas for which advertising is being permitted, said Poddar. 																								He feels putting restriction on cigarette advertising will lead to cheap smuggled products coming in. It is the organised cigarette makers who will be the worst hit, he said.

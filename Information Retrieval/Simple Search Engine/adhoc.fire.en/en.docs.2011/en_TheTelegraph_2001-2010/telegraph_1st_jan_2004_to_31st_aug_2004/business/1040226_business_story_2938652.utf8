 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Gail plans to hive off telecom arm
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 25: Gail (India) Ltd plans to hive off Gail Tel  its telecom division  into a separate company. 																								Gail Tel has strong potentials for independent growth due to the rising demand for bandwidth among telecom service providers, a senior Gail executive said. 																								A decision on the hive-off will be taken after the governments divestment programme is complete. For now, we are turning it into a separate business unit, the official said.																								Gail Tel was set up in 2000 and currently owns an 8000-km optic fibre network connecting 73 cities, including Delhi and Mumbai.																								The company has already invested about Rs 250 crore in laying the optic fibre network along its gas pipeline.																								Gail executive director U. D. Choubey said an additional Rs 300 crore will be spent over the next three to four years to increase the network by another 10,000 kms.																								The additional 10,000 km of optic fibre will be laid along the national gas grid, work on which is currently on, Choubey said.																								The company will also spend Rs 75 crore to connect the south, particularly Bangalore and Chennai, with the existing network. 																								Although we dont have any existing optic fibre network in the south, we are in talks with a couple of Tata companies for swapping bandwidth. We shall offer them our surplus bandwidth in the northern and western regions while we access their bandwidth for our clients in the south, he said.																								Gail Tels designed bandwidth capacity is 160 giga bytes per second and the installed capacity is 10 gbps.

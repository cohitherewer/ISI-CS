 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Wider tax base, rate carrot to boost savings
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, May 27: The Congress-led government today said it will reform the tax system to widen the base, introduce value-added tax at the earliest, and bring in differential interest rates to encourage savings and help pensioners.																								The governments tax policy will seek to increase the number of people who pay tax from the current 28 million and introduce a cess on all central taxes to fund higher spending on education.																								The Common Minimum Programme will focus on the rural and social sectors, double rural credit in three years and pursue an interest rate policy that will benefit senior citizens and investors. The government plans to raise public spending in education to at least 6 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) with nearly half of it being spent on primary and secondary sectors in a phased manner.																								The government also plans to introduce a uniform value-added tax (VAT) on sales. 																								The government is committed to the early introduction of VAT after all the necessary technical and administrative homework has been completed, particularly on issues like the integration of service sector taxation and compensation to states, the CMP said.																								The NDA government had tried to bring in VAT last year but was forced to give up the attempt after opposition from within the ruling BJP party and from a handful of states. 																								Senior North Block officials said the proposed cess to pay for basic education was likely to be levied on corporate taxes. The United Progressive Alliance will introduce a cess on all central taxes to finance the commitment to provide quality basic education, the CMP said. 																								Interest rates will give incentives to both investors and savers  especially pensioners and senior citizens, it said. The government has already come out with a discussion paper on inflation-indexed bonds that are likely to be introduced soon.																								The CMP promises major tax reforms, including better compliance and efficient administration along with measures to increase the tax:GDP ratio. 																								Analysts, however, said higher spending would widen the budget deficit as higher taxes may not be sufficient enough to bridge it.																								The CMP said the government would follow a stable taxation policy, which would be conducive to growth, compliance and investment. The policy promised subsidies, employment guarantee programmes and reforms in the agricultural sector.

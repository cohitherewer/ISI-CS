 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Indiabulls price band at Rs 16-19
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 26: Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd will issue an initial public offering of 2.71 crore shares at a price band of Rs 16-19 to raise funds to the tune of Rs 43.5-52 crore.																								The 100 per cent book-built issue will open on September 6 and close on September 10.																								The issue of 2,71,87,519 shares of Rs 2 each constitutes 25 per cent of the fully diluted post-issue paid-up capital of the company, chairman and CEO Sameer Gehlaut said.																								About 50 per cent of the issue will be allocated on a discretionary basis to qualified institutional buyers, 25 per cent on a proportionate basis to non-institutional bidders and the remaining 25 per cent to retail bidders, he said.																								Indiabulls Financial Services is among the few successful internet trading brokerages. It plans to foray into traditional financing through small investor-portfolio takeouts from non-banking finance companies after its initial share sale.																								Indiabulls ranks among the top five retail brokers in the country and is second only to ICICI, according to reports.																								Indiabulls plans to join hands with distribution companies of other financial services to grow its business. 																								Hedge fund Farallon Capital Partners LP, which had bought a 15 per cent stake in Indiabulls for Rs 53 crore recently, will continue to stay invested in the company post-offer. 																								The company is also aggressively advertising in the business TV channels to gain visibility among investors. 																								Other institutional investors such as Transatlantic Corp, Infinity Technologies Trustee Pvt Ltd and LN Mittals India Fund hold close to another 20 per cent of the company.

 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 VST to be free of debt this year
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 6: Tobacco major VST Industries will become a debt-free company in the current financial year and plans to upgrade Charminar Plain, one of its popular brands.																								The company is also planning to merge two of its subsidiaries  Tobacco Diversification Investments Private Limited (TDIL) and VST Distribution, Storage amp; Leasing Company (VSTDSL).																								VSTDSL works as a broker for mutual fund products.																								Over the years, the company has been able to reduce the debt burden and currently, it has a secured loan of Rs 5.98 crore in its books.																								Company officials said they are actively working towards making it debt-free and hope to achieve this in the next few months.																								It redeemed over Rs 6 crore worth of debentures in the last couple of years and plans to do the same this year as well, which will make it totally debt-free, according to the companys annual report.																								Its interest burden has been in the negative for the last couple of years, as the interest received by it was more than that paid.																								The company had paid Rs 1.32 crore interest in the last financial year, but received Rs 2.38 crore on loans and deposits, thereby helping the company earn a net income of Rs 1.05 crore.																								The company is also planning to improve its Charminar Plain brand in the regular plains to increase consumer loyalty and minimise losses to discounted filters.																								In 2003-04, the company positioned two brands in the king-size and premium regular-sized filter segments by launching XL king-size and XL regular-size filter cigarettes.																								Having evoked positive consumer interest in the test markets of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, the brand is being rolled out to selected major towns. In 03-04 the company sold 8297 millions of cigarettes.																								The company is positioning its flagship brand Charms to exploit market-price disruptions and thereby grow volumes in its strongholds.																								The company has decided to merge VSTDSL with TDIL because the latters activities have remained dormant for several years.																								The company has rationalised its manpower at the shop floor, resulting in a reduction of staff strength to 908 on March 31, 2004. An outlay of Rs 12.51 crore has been incurred towards a voluntary retirement scheme floated for the workmen and has been charged off in the profit and loss account of the company.

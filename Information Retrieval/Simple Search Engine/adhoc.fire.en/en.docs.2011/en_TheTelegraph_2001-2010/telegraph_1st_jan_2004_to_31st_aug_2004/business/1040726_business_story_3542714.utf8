 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 PC firms await clear duty rules
 A STAFF REPORTER Bit by bit 																								Calcutta, July 24: The computer industry hopes for some positive development on the duty front next week to relieve them from the uncertainty that has prevailed since the budget was announced.																								Supertron Electronics MD V. K. Bhandari said, PC sales have reduced by over 50 per cent this month. On the basis of an assumed price reduction, consumers are not ready to pay the existing rates. The vendors are also in no position to offer discounts. Supertron is one of the leading brands in the east.																								Mait executive director Vinnie Mehta said the PC industry has almost come to a standstill. Almost 3.5 lakh PCs are sold across the country every month.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram had nullified the import duty on finished goods (the complete PC system), while maintaining an excise duty at 8 per cent. This proved a threat to the local manufacturing industry.																								Most multinational companies (MNCs) import major components and source parts like motherboards and speakers locally. With no import duty on PCs, it would make sense for MNCs to bring in finished goods, adversely affecting local manufacturers. 																								The excise on parts and accessories currently stands at 16 per cent. This will make it impossible for local companies to reduce prices of either PCs or parts and accessories.																								The finance minister has assured us that a decision will be taken early nest week, said Mehta.																								Representatives of the hardware industry had met in the capital on July 12 and sent its proposals to the finance minister. 																								The industry has asked for a rollback of the duty structure to provide a level-playing field.

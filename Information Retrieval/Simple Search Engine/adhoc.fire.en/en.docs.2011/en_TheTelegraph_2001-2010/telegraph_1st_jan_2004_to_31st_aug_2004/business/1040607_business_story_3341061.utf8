 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Indian Oil cooking gas imports rise seven fold
 S. P. S. PANNU Gas guzzlers 																								New Delhi, June 6: A sudden flare-up in the demand for cooking gas, coupled with a shortfall in the domestic output, has forced Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to go in for a seven-fold jump in LPG imports during June and July to bridge the gap.																								A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that while the company was importing one ship-load of LPG each month until May this year, it has placed an order for seven ship-loads for June and the order is likely to be repeated for July. The demand for LPG has grown at a spectacular rate of 18 per cent between April and May this year, which is the highest among all petro products. The growth rate for the general basket of petroleum products is around 8 to 10 per cent.																								Supplies from the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar are reported to have fallen short by around 15,000 tonnes for the month. Similarly, Oil and Natural Gas Corporations (ONGC) Uran plant has also supplied 15,000 tonnes less than the targeted amount, while supplies from the Hindustan Petroleum refinery in Vizag were 11,000 tonnes less than the figure set in the logistics plan.																								The national oil companies have been enrolling new LPG customers at a very hectic pace and the total number of households that use LPG are now nearing the 8 crore-mark. At an average of even four members a family, there are 32 crore people in the country dependent on LPG, remarked an IOC official. This also explains the political importance of making the cooking gas conveniently available and the governments diktat to the oil companies to hold the price line despite soaring international prices.																								The higher sales of imported cooking gas are likely to bring the bottomlines of the national oil companies under further strain as they have to foot the major chunk of the subsidy bill on the gas. The government provides a fixed subsidy of only Rs 45 per cylinder. The remaining subsidy of around Rs 60 per cylinder is being borne by the oil companies. However, the fact that ONGC and Gail are also made to share this subsidy burden, the drain on the downstream companies such as IOC is reduced.																								The fresh LPG shipments have been sourced from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. This sudden spurt in imports has also placed an unexpected demand on ships.

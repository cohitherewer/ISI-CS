																								New Delhi, Aug. 20 (PTI): Tracing mobile number of any subscriber may now become easier with the telecom regulator starting the process of publishing telephone directory of the users of all private as well as state-owned service providers.																								In a multi-operator, multi-service scenario, there is a need for directory enquiry services across different networks and service areas, Trai said in a release.																								Mobile users represent about half of the telephone subscribers in the country and due to non-availability of a directory, they are largely unreachable today unless the caller has the number, it said.

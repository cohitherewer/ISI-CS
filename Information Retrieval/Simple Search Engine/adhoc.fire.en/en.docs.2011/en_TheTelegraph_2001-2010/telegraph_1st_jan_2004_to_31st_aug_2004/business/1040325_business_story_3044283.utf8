 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Ranbaxy, Morepen need tonic for growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 24: Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited and Morepen Laboratories Limited have shown a de-growth in the third quarter of the current fiscal, amidst an overall industry growth of 7.6 per cent. 																								During the third quarter ended December 31, Ranbaxy has shown a negative growth of 3.9 per cent at Rs 745.9 crore, whereas Morepen shrunk by 85 per cent to only Rs 22.5 crore compared with Rs 151 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.																								Bringing out the sectoral performances during the quarter, rating agency Icra has ascribed the decline in net sales of Ranbaxy to the decline in its exports. 																								On the other hand, growth in net sales of companies like, Cipla and Sun Pharmaceuticals have been ascribed to a buoyant export growth only. At Rs 480 crore, Ciplas quarterly growth has been 33.5 per cent, while that of Sun has been 35.5 per cent at Rs 256.9 crore. 																								The de-growth in the net sales of Morepen has been ascribed to not only a sharp decline in exports but also a fall in domestic sales, said Icra. 																								For Ranbaxy, while the dosage form exports to Europe, CIS and Africa during the third quarter were healthy, exports to Asia-Pacific and Latin America declined during the same time, the rating agency points out. The pharma majors dosage form exports to the US market, which marked a growth of 20 per cent, slowed down when compared with the other quarters of the current fiscal. 																								Ranbaxys sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) also declined by 14 per cent in the third quarter following decline in both domestic and export markets. 																								There was an overall 52 per cent decline in the net profit of Ranbaxy to Rs 102 crore in the reporting quarter of this fiscal compared with Rs 212 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. 																								Other factors that led to a dwindling bottomline for Ranbaxy during the quarter were a sharp increase in material cost, staff cost and other expenditure. There was a 34 per cent decline in profit before interest, depreciation and tax (PBDIT).

 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Dalmia eyes foreign shores to sell wares
																								New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): Dalmia Consumer Care, part of Rs 1,200-crore Sanjay Dalima Group, aimed to post profits next fiscal as it would take its upcoming non-tobacco cigarettes to 15 countries.																								We should be profitable in 2005-06 on a sales turnover of Rs 1.5 crore as we plan to take the non-tobacco cigarettes to 15 countries, besides making other non-tobacco products available in 900 cities in India, managing director Sudhershan Banerjee said.																								The company, which manufactures non-tobacco bidi Vardan and betel nut powder Chabaaza, has been investing Rs 50-100 crore every year and is in the process of manufacturing tobacco-less cigarettes.																								Dalmia Consumer Care plans to either export the cigarettes to 15 countries, including the US, France, Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal or establish cigarette-making units in one of these countries.																								We are planning to export the cigarettes or make it in one of the overseas markets as cigarettes constitute 90 per cent of the world tobacco market, Banerjee said.																								In India, the company is present in 300 cities now.																								Our idea is to gradually drive tobacco out of India and replace all the tobacco products like cigarettes and chewing tobacco with non-tobacco products, he said.																								Dalmia Consumer Care has also appointed Tata Consultancy Services to implement enterprise resource planning.																								The company, which invests Rs 50-100 crore every year, would continue to pump in money for brand-building and marketing, Banerjee said.

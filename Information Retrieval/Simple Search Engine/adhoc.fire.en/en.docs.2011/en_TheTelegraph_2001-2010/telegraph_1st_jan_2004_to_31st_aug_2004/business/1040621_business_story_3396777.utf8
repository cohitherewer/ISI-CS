 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Uco takes a call on telecom loans
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, June 20: Uco Bank is aggressively funding telecom ventures. It has given loans worth Rs 200 crore each to Reliance Infocomm and Tata Teleservices in the current fiscal.																								This has happened in the last one-and-a-half months. Both the companies had approached us with their expansion plans and we allocated Rs 400 crore to them. We are interested in making advances in telecom, apart from other infrastructure sectors, executive director B. K. Dutta said.																								Reliance Infocomm had approached domestic banks and financial institutions to raise around Rs 5,000 crore debt with a tenure of eight years for financing its expansion and rollout plans.																								Dutta said the bank is giving loans with a tenure of eight to nine years. But ideally we would like to give loans with a tenure of three to five years. However, we are going in for longer duration loans for the blue-chip companies, he added.																								The bank expects to receive more proposals from the telecom sector after the Union budget. Bank officials feel the budget will give a boost to the growing sector. 																								The bank has kept a target of Rs 5000 crore credit deployment in the current fiscal.																								Bank officials said a special thrust will be given on farm credit, particularly direct agriculture, and schemes to improve rural employment. The bank has already chalked out strategies for each of its rural and semi-urban branches to garner Rs 2 crore of additional business in the current fiscal.																								The bank has also decided to give export credit to large companies and small and medium units. 																								While disbursing credit, the bank will also inculcate risk management practices that will help in effective monitoring and constant reviewing of the advances portfolio, the officials said.																								A system for utmost vigil with a specific action plan has been designed for control and prevention of impairment of loan assets, they added.

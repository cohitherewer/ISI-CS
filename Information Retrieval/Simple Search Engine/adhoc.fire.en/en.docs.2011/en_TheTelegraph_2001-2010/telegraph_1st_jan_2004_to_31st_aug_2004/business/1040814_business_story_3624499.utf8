 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Private airlines to get more wings
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: The government plans to allow private airlines the freedom to wing its way unhindered to international destinations in a calibrated manner.																								Civil aviation minister Praful Patel told The Telegraph private airlines will be allowed to fly abroad but in a calibrated manner.																								The minister said the issue would be taken up in a holistic manner and we will see if the countrys requirements are not met by state-run airlines, then private carriers will be allowed to take off on international routes.																								However, he made it clear that such a move would have to be calibrated, that is, allowed in phases. They cannot be suddenly allowed the freedom to fly to any destination.																								The minister refused to state which countries or regions will be opened up first to private airlines. The government has already allowed private carriers to fly neighbouring South Asian countries, but that has just whetted their appetite.																								The countrys two private airlines  Jet and Sahara  have long been lobbying to get the government to also agree to let them fly to South East Asia and the Gulf, both lucrative markets.																								However, state-run Indian Airlines and Air-India have both been protesting this move stating that this could impact their bottomline and should certainly not be allowed till they are allowed to buy a new fleet of aircraft to service unused bilaterals.																								Some 60 per cent of the routes awarded to state-run international carrier Air-India under bilateral aviation pacts with countries across the globe are not used.																								Although Patel did not elaborate on plans, officials said route bidding may be considered at a later stage when private airlines are gradually allowed to fly abroad.																								At present, flights out of India are a state monopoly or awarded to foreign airlines under bilaterally negotiated pacts. 																								However, with Air-India and Indian Airlines short of aircraft, there are moves afoot to amend this policy and permit them to fly to nearby destinations in South Asia.

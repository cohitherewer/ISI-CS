 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Reliance delivers price punch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Load factor 																								Mumbai, Aug. 2: Reliance Industries (RIL) today jacked up prices of all polyester products by 4-10 per cent.																								The price rise is not unusual  its polyester items have become dearer in the last few months  but this is the first across-the-board hike in the recent past. Analysts attribute it to firm global crude prices.																								The increase is the sharpest in partially oriented yarn (PoY), whose prices will go up 9.6 per cent from August to Rs 75.65 per kg from Rs 69 last month. In polyesters, the price of polyester staple fibre (PSF) has been raised to Rs 66.50 per kg from Rs 64, a 4-per cent rise.																								In fibre-intermediates, purified terephthalic acid (PTA) is dearer by 4.5 per cent to Rs 42 per kg; mono ethylene glycol (MEG) will cost 6 per cent more at Rs 52.																								In polymers, the price of polyethylene (PE) is being raised to Rs 56.20 from Rs 51.70 last month. Polypropylene (PP) will cost 9.2 per cent more at Rs 55.70 per kg and PVC 4.3 per cent more at Rs 48.																								The price of linear alkyl benzene will be Rs 58.90 per kg, an increase of 9.3 per cent from Rs 53.90 per kg.																								The spurt in global prices of crude, its main feedstock, was among the concerns the company voiced when it unveiled its first-quarter scorecard last week. Net profit jumped 30.16 per cent to Rs 1,437 crore. 																								Despite battling a feedstock flare-up, Reliance achieved higher operating margins in refining and petrochemicals. The senior management pointed out that petroleum products and polyesters were the key drivers of its overall demand growth during the quarter.																								In polyesters, the firm has focused on speciality products to cope with the commodity nature of business. The effort has helped it achieve fatter margins.																								Reliance announced the acquisition of Trevira GmbH, a one-time division of Hoechst AG, for 80 million (Rs 430 crore), last year. 																								The buyout of Trevira, a leading producer of branded polyester fibres in Europe, came at a time when the Ambanis planned a massive expansion of polyester capacity to make the best of opportunities that would open up when the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) ends in January. The acquisition has added 1.8 million tonnes to its capacity. 																								Reliance is building facilities that will enable it to produce an additional 0.5 million tonnes of polyester. The investments will be made in a 2.4-lakh tonne polyester staple fibre plant in Hazira, a 2.16-lakh tonne polyester filament unit at the same place and in the 94,000-tonne polyester yarn facility at Patalganga.Cash for research																								One of the areas where Reliance will pump in huge sums is in research and development. It intends to build an intellectual property base and develop new products. 																								Analysts are of the opinion that impact of the textile quota phase-out early next year would not be limited to apparel companies but would even spread to those firms which make man-made fibres and yarns.

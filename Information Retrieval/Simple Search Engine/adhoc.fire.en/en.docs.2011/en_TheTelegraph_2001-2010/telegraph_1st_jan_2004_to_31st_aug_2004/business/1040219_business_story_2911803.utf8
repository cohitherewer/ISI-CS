 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Apex court upholds jute order
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 18: The jute industry is upbeat following a Supreme Court order to maintain status quo on the jute packaging order.																								The apex court upheld an order by the Calcutta High Court to continue a mandatory 100 per cent packaging of foodgrains and 90 per cent of sugar in jute sacks, Indian Jute Mills Association chairman Sanjay Kajaria said.																								The association had moved the high court opposing an order by the Union textile ministry in 2003 for progressive dilution in jute packaging to 50 per cent for foodgrains and 40 per cent for sugar in the first year. It would be further reduced to 20 per cent for foodgrains and no compulsion for the sugar industry in the second year.																								The Supreme Court has also asked the government to issue fresh notification modifying its earlier order.

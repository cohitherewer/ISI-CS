 What makes floating rate funds an attractive short-term option? Chandralekha Tulal checks out 																								Global interest rates are slowly winching up again: last week, the Bank of England raised its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 per cent. At around the same time, the Federal Open Markets Commission  the rate-setting body in the US  said for the first time in four years that it was looking to gradually nudge up the rates, raising the possibility of a rate rise in the next two months.																								The big question: will the Reserve Bank of India also signal a rate rise sometime soon  and if so how will it affect your investments in bonds?																								To understand this, lets see how the interest rate volatility affects the price of a bond? Suppose you buy a five-year bond with a face value of Rs 1,000 and a coupon rate of 10 per cent and the interest rate goes up to 11 per cent after that? 																								In such a scenario, the current bond will become unattractive as the price of that bond will decline. Now, consider what happens when the interest rate falls to 9 per cent. It is obvious that the price of the bond will increase, as it has now become lucrative for the investor to hold the bond till maturity as he will be able to earn at a rate higher than the market.																								In a volatile market where the interest rate movements are unpredictable, it is prudent to invest in funds with shorter maturity as the interest rate risk in such funds is much less. Thus, the answer lies in short-term funds rather than income funds. In the last six months, the short-term funds have given returns of 4.94 per cent compared with 4.30 per cent given by income schemes. 																								But in rising interest rate regime, even shorter duration funds may take a beating as these funds invest in fixed-rate instruments, which are not adjusted based on the market conditions. Thats when floating rate funds  or floaters in bond parlance  become the best investment bet. 																								Floating rate funds invest in instruments where the coupon rate is not fixed and is benchmarked against a market driven rate for example the Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (Mibor) which is adjusted twice a year. 																								Each time the Mibor fluctuates, the coupon rate on the instrument also fluctuates and gets adjusted accordingly and does affect not the market price of the instrument. Thus, the net asset value (NAV) of these funds does not react much to interest rate changes and have a low volatility.																								But theres a caveat here: the floating rate funds are pretty new in the Indian markets and there isnt a great deal of historical background to gauge performance. Until now, the interest rates have been travelling southwards and, therefore, floating rate funds have always under-performed fixed rate debt funds. 																								Since the choice of floating rate instruments in India is quite limited, the fund managers do not have a wide variety to choose from and tend to invest a lot in money market instruments. This has led to a situation where floaters give returns comparable to liquid funds and not proper debt funds.																								Again, lower risk means lower returns. Since interest rates on these instruments reflect the market rate, the prices of these instruments do not appreciate as much as fixed rate instruments.																								Floaters are recommended investments in a scenario where interest rates are rising. But it is prudent not to shovel all the cash into these funds because, if interest rates fall, then returns from these funds will again take a beating. 																								Floaters are just a little dicey - and much will depend on what your investment horizon is. If you have a horizon of more than a year, then the debt funds will do fine. But if it is for a shorter period, may be it is time to check out the floaters.

Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: Lights, glamourous candyfloss female hostesses, gleaming new models  Indias only auto show, held every two years, is touted as the biggest in Asia.																								Coming against the backdrop of a recent upturn in Indian auto industry  which is expected to be further turbocharged by the recent 8 percentage point cut in excise duty  the exhibition will mirror and espouse the needs and demand of the industry, organisers said.																								Organised jointly by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the show will host around 900 exhibitors representing 20 countries across an area of 60,000 square metres.																								Auto Expo sends a signal that the industry has matured and creates confidence in the government to lower taxes, said Subodh Bhargava, consultant to CII.																								He said the motor show would lay stress on the design segment, alternate fuel and components, which is fast becoming a major revenue earner for the country.																								Indias advantage is that it has a large manufacturing base coupled with lower production costs as compared to other East Asian countries like Thailand, he added.																								Japanese Nissan Motors and German Volkswagen AG will participate in the exhibition for the first time, while the countrys largest auto maker, Maruti Udyog Ltd, is turning up this time after giving it a skip the last time.																								Indian car sales are expected to report a full-year growth between 15-20 per cent after a meagre 6 per cent growth last financial year to March 2003. 																								A booming economy  expected to grow more than seven per cent this fiscal  and interest rates near three-decade lows have also boosted sales.																								The Indian auto companies can further cut cost by deploying information technology across the supply chain. Also, there is a greater need of electronic display in the vehicles...the auto show helps address these things, Bhargava said.																								Japanese car major Suzuki, which is expected to launch its two-wheelers for the first time in the country, will display its technology both in the two-wheeler and the passenger car segments.																								Other participants include commercial vehicle manufacturer Volvo, two-wheeler firms like Bajaj Auto, and luxury car manufacturer DaimlerChrysler. 																								However, Ford India, Toyota, Honda and General Motors have decided not to turn up this time round. Leyland launch																								Chennai-based Ashok Leyland today launched a range of heavy commercial vehicles, including the countrys largest 260-bhp, CNG powered bus. With 40 per cent capacity more than the conventional 11 Mtr bus, the 15.6 Mtr bus is Indias largest.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT  New horizons 																								New Delhi, May 23: Punjab National Bank (PNB) plans to float a subsidiary, PNB Principal Advisory Services, to retail financial products, including insurance, said a bank official.																								Sources said the firm, to be floated in association with Principal Financial Group, a US-based life insurer, state-run Vijaya Bank and Berger Paints, would have an equity base of Rs 5 crore.																								While the bank would hold a 37 per cent stake in the proposed fund, Principal Asset Management Company would have 26 per cent, Vijaya bank 12 per cent and Berger Paints 25 per cent.																								Earlier, Punjab National Bank had applied to the finance ministry to set up a pension fund, with an equity base of Rs 110 crore.																								We are keen to get this firm operational as soon as possible, said the official, adding, the bank is holding discussions with a company, which has an existing licence to retail insurance products. 																								Last year, Punjab National Bank formed a joint venture with the Principal Financial group to form PNB Principal Asset Management Company.

The Delhi-based bank has reported a 31.6 per cent jump in net profit to Rs 1,108.69 crore for the financial year ended March 2004. Gross income during the year stood at Rs 9,647 crore, up 10.4 per cent from Rs 8,735 crore in the previous financial year. 																								Advances stood flat at Rs 47,225 crore in the last financial year against Rs 40,228 crore in the previous year.

Total business also rose 16.5 per cent to Rs 1,35,141 crore from Rs 1,16,041 crore in the previous financial year. 																								The bank has asked the Reserve Bank of Indias permission to pay a dividend of Rs 4 a share in 2003-04 to its shareholders.

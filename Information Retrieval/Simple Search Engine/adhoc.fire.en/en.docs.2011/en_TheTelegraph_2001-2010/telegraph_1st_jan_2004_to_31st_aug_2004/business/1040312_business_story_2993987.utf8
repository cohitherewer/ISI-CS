 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 S amp;P warns of core sector pitfalls
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 11: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today said foreign direct investment (FDI) would gush into India due to a burgeoning market, but core sector gaps could come in the way of capitalising on this potential.																								Senior S amp;P officials said the business opportunities arise due to a large middle-class population, growing purchasing power and an unfulfilled demand for a number of products.																								Sharad Jain, director of Asia-Pacific Corporate and Infrastructure Ratings Group, said infrastructure has been a key constraint in realising growth opportunities. 																								High cost and poor quality of electricity, road and rail transport, ports and water supply continue to hamper sustained high economic growth in the country, he said. Frustrating labour laws and reliance on timely rainfall are some of the impediments affecting industry, he added.																								It is critical that companies manage their growth prudently. They need to guard against creating excess capacity or aggressively leveraging their balancesheets. Management resources can also pose a challenge for larger businesses, Jain said.																								S amp;P had a word of caution for investors too. Low interest rates and booming equity prices are partly responsible for the prevailing strong market sentiments. However, these factors are often beyond the control of the government and companies, and therefore can change very quickly, Jain added. 																								He, however, said India has demonstrated global competitiveness in information technology and business process outsourcing. Moreover, mobile call rates in the country are among the lowest in the world. 																								A large, educated and English-speaking population in India provides a competitive edge over many other developing nations.

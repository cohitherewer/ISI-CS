 Unit Trust of India has decided  to foreclose seven assured return schemes on March 31. The  seven schemes are estimated to have a combined asset under  management of Rs 10,000 crore. The schemes that are being  terminated are two Rajlakshmi Unit Schemes, two Childrens  Gift Growth Funds, two monthly income plans and the MIP  for Bhopal gas tragedy victims.																								Unit Trust would pay the guaranteed return in these schemes up to March 31. Thereafter, it is giving investors two options: they could redeem their units at March 31 prices, or convert their units into 6.6 per cent five year government-guaranteed bonds. Interest income from the bond is exempted from tax. Unit Trust had issued similar bonds to foreclose its erstwhile flagship scheme US-64. It pays 6.75 per cent per year on the bonds that it issued to foreclose US-64.																								The question facing investors is whether they should opt for the bonds or redeem their units. The thumb rule is people with high tax liabilities should opt for the bond. For people in the 35 per cent tax bracket, the tax-free interest of 6.6 per cent translates into a taxable yield of 10.4 per cent. For those in the 30 per cent tax bracket, the yield is around 9.6 per cent, and for those in the 20 per cent, its 8.4 per cent. But for investors who do not have to pay taxes, redeeming their units is probably a better idea. They could then invest the amount in high-yielding instruments like the post office monthly income scheme or 8 per cent RBI Bonds.																								However, even if you choose to redeem your units, dont rush. The bonds are going to be listed on stock exchanges, and you could make a wee bit more if you convert your units in bonds and sell them in the market. The bond is likely to trade at a premium to its face value. The price of the US-64 bond advanced rapidly once trading began. The secondary market yield on the 10-year taxable government security is currently pegged at around 5.15 per cent, which implies the market price of the tax-free 6.6 per cent Unit Trust bonds will rise once trading begins. But remember the bonds will be traded in dematerialised mode only. You must have them credited to your demat account to be able to sell them.					 ANIEK PAUL

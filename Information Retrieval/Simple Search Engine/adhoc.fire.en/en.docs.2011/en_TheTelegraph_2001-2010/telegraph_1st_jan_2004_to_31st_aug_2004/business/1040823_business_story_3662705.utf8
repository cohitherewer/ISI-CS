 Is the senior citizen scheme as hot as it is touted to be? Chandralekha Tulal benchmarks it against the post office monthly income scheme																								Two friends  Jyotirmoy Banerjee and Shubhendu Jana, both in their early sixties  are jaw-jawing about their investments and the various options available.																								Shubhendu is gung-ho about the recently launched Senior Citizens Savings Scheme. He is excited about the 9 per cent rate of interest that the scheme offers  especially at a time when bank deposit rates hover between 5 and 5.5 per cent. Like any bank deposit, the scheme offers a tenure of five years but provides the option of extending it by another three years. 																								People who are 60 years old are eligible to invest in the scheme. But theres also a relaxation for people who opt for voluntary retirement  with the entry level reduced to 55 years.																								Jyotirmoy, however, is more circumspect. He is a cautious investor and tends to weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding. He agrees that the UPA government has made an effort to offer a superior investment option for senior citizens. Nevertheless, he argues that certain anomalies do knock a few spots off the much-hyped scheme.																								Shubhendu, however, is absolutely convinced that the new scheme is the answer to all his dreams. So, both of them draw a point-by-point comparison between the new scheme and its nearest contender and the most popular, post office monthly income scheme.																								The new scheme offers 9 per cent interest rate whereas the post office MIS gives 8 per cent, said Shubhendu. 																								You forget that the post office MIS gives a bonus of 10 per cent on the deposited amount at the end of six years, which takes the effective rate of interest on the post office MIS to 9.67 per cent, said Jyotirmoy. But it is true that many people may prefer to receive a higher interest income now rather than an accumulated bonus at the time of maturity, agrees Jyotirmoy.																								The limit on investment in post office MIS proves to be a major hindrance for many investors who wish to park more than the individual limit of Rs 3 lakh and the joint limit of Rs 9 lakh, says Shubhendu.																								Under the senior citizens scheme, one can invest up to Rs 15 lakh individually and another Rs 15 lakh in the spouses name. 																								Yes, that is a hindrance, but in that case I think it is better to invest in the new scheme after the investment limit in the post office MIS has been exhausted, says Jyotirmoy.																								Moreover, the new scheme pays interest on a quarterly basis against a monthly payment in MIS. This may not attract senior citizens considering that most do not have a regular monthly income such as pension, says Jyotirmoy. 																								Again, the new scheme allows joint holding with the depositors spouse only and not with any other relation, says Jyotirmoy, while there is no such restriction in the MIS account.																								But, I do not think that it makes such a big difference because the new scheme does allow nomination facility, says Shubhendu. 																								Some senior citizens may find it irksome that they need to have a Permanent Account Number (PAN) before they invest in the scheme. Those who dont have a PAN will have to get one before they park their funds in the scheme.																								Any investment above Rs 50,000 requires PAN. I dont think it is such a big problem as investment in post office MIS above Rs 50,000 also requires PAN, says Shubhendu.																								I think the liquidity aspect of the new scheme, with the penalty much lower and more flexible than post office MIS, will be extremely beneficial for people like us because of unforeseen emergencies, says Shubhendu. 																								The penalty for withdrawal after one year but before two years is 1.5 per cent of the deposited amount. In the case of withdrawal after two years, the penalty is 1 per cent. But in an MIS, there is a penalty of 5 per cent of the deposited amount if it is withdrawn before three years. 																								However, premature withdrawal after three years will not attract any penalty. In that case, the 10 per cent bonus will be scrapped. 																								Shubhendu feels one should not keep all the eggs in the same basket. It is never advisable to invest all your money in one particular scheme. One should spread it out across various asset categories. Thus, it is important to invest in some liquid instruments, rather than breaking long-term investments prematurely, he argues.																								Thus, an investment should always be based on an individuals requirements such as return expectations, liquidity aspects, convenience. It is not solely dependent on the features of each individual instrument, be it the new senior citizens deposit scheme, post office MIS or any other scheme.

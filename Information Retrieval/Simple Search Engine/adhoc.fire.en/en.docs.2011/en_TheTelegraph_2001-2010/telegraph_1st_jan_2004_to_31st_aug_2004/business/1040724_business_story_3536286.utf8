 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Rate-swing cap on small savings
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Mohan: Steady run																								New Delhi, July 23: Small savings rates will not move more than 1 percentage point either way in a year if a Reserve Bank (RBI) panels sweeping suggestions on a revamp of the administered interest rates are accepted.																								The proposal came from the Rakesh Mohan Committee, which also wanted Kisan Vikas Patras and National Savings Certificate to be scrapped, but favoured the Public Provident Fund in its present form.																								The group has called for an end to the 6.5 per cent tax-free government bonds, but feels the 8 per cent (taxable) bonds and various other postal savings schemes can stay with revised rates. The interest rate on small savings, it says, should be linked to the returns on government securities, as suggested by the Y. V. Reddy Committee earlier.																								The committee also looked into the structure of the planned Dada-Dadi bonds, now renamed senior citizens scheme, and suggested that the three-year bonds can offer rates 1 per cent more than the benchmark. The gains, however, should be taxable.																								The committee, which broadly mapped out ways in which returns on savings schemes can be benchmarked, was of the view that NSCs and KVPs were too expensive in terms of their cost to the government. The returns on small savings could be reset at the start of each fiscal on the basis of the weighted average yields on government papers of the previous two calendar years.																								It is necessary to limit the inter-year interest-rate fluctuations to a tolerable extent, which will supersede the need for aligning the administered interest rate to market trends. This will be done in view of the movements observed during the last three years, it said. 																								With the inflation rate stabilising and financial market gaining depth and width, the panel said the cap would not act as a binding constraint. It wants the Reserve Bank to publish secondary debt market yields in its regular bulletins.

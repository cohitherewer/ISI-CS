 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Corporate India homes in on new way to splurge
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Climbing a different ladder																								New Delhi, May 4: India Inc is splurging its surplus cash on real estate. The reason behind this trend is that investment in properties in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore fetched higher yields than those in London, Frankfurt and Sydney.																								In its latest quarterly market review, real estate consulting group Chesterton Meghraj says a number of companies, including Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Ranbaxy, are considering real estate as an important investment tool and have purchased 1,350 acre of land at an estimated cost of Rs 1,600 crore.																								The Indian real estate market, which is still in the developing phase, fetches between 10-12 per cent yearly returns on commercial property investments, said Anuj Puri, managing director of Chesterton Meghraj Property Consultants Pvt. Ltd.																								This is comparable to the returns from the equity market in the longer term when you consider capital appreciation in the asset value as well, he explained.																								The report also said growth in office leasing in Delhi would continue in the near term since a number of firms are in an expansion mode. 																								In Mumbai, both property prices as well as rentals are on an upward growth curve helped by Indias growing economy.																								New demand in Delhi is likely to come from insurance and services like advertising and media while in Mumbai demand will primarily come from the IT-enabled sector, it said. 																								Analysts, however, said most real estate purchases were primarily made with an eye on a firms expansion plans rather than an investment portfolio.																								Infosys Technologies Ltd plans to set up another campus over 1.5 million sq ft with an investment of over Rs 600 crore. This is a pointer to things, he said. However, while institutional investors understand the real estate market, retail investors need to have a better understanding of the sector, Puri added.																								The property market, unlike any other sector, by its nature are illiquid and volatile but it does promise to give better than most of the investment instruments available in the market on longer-term investment, he said.																								This market is dynamic in nature as regulations or catastrophies in the economy indirectly affect the real estate stock as land is one of the primary factors of production, added Puri.

 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 A cover for your home
 Chandralekha Tulal opens the door to an insurance policy that every household needs																								Home is where the heart is: thats how attached you feel to your home  be it a humble abode or the most luxurious dwelling. But what if a freak accident like a fire, natural calamity, violent terrorist attack or an organised burglary rips apart your nest?																								Such incidents cause severe mental agony and the losses you suffer can be unimaginably high. The cost of re-establishing your house all over again can be quite expensive.																								In such a scenario, if you had the foresight to buy adequate insurance, you need not have any reason to worry. Insurance bought for your house will not only cover the structure of the house but also the belongings. The insurance company takes care of the losses and indemnifies for all the expensive items or consumer durables you bought over a period of time.																								Again, if something happens to your domestic help, the insurance company pays off the losses and liabilities under the Workmans Compensation Act. In other words, buying a house insurance policy buys you peace of mind as such risks are unpredictable but not impossible.																								Earlier, insurance was taken out only for tax-saving purposes or a necessary evil that accompanied high-cost purchases like a flat or a vehicle. But, insurance is no longer considered a waste of money since losses far outweigh the nominal premium that such policies demand.																								The public sector players  New India Assurance, United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and National Insurance  and the private players like IFFCO Tokio General Insurance, Royal Sundaram, TataAIG, Bajaj Allianz and Cholamandalam offer house insurance policies.																								You should opt for the householders package policy instead of taking different policies. Under this policy, you can opt for multiple sections or covers under one policy. Although some insurers may offer variants, there are usually 10 sections under the package policy. They are: fire and allied perils, burglary and housebreaking, including larceny or theft, all risks, purchase protection, plate glass, breakdown of domestic appliances, pedal cycle, baggage, personal accident, liability to third parties and workmens compensation risks. Scope of Cover 																								Household insurance covers your home, the structure and its contents  personal belongings  from financial loss in case of damage or destruction. It covers your precious possessions and provides you with compensation for liability claims, medical expenses and other losses that result from property damage and personal injury suffered by others. Most lenders require you to own a householders insurance if you apply for a mortgage.																								Apart from personal property, the place of dwelling, liability insurance for that person and his dependents are also covered.																								Household insurance protects your home, any structures attached to your dwelling as well as other tools like sheds, and indoor pools. Other belongings such as furniture, clothing, electronic gadgets and outdoor items like sports gear and gardening tools are also included in the coverage. Some policies insure at actual cost of the property while others do it at the replacement cost. Unless the policy specifically states that property is covered for its replacement value, coverage is for actual cash value. Safety measures																								Make a detailed list of all the belongings in your house and preserve it. This should include the quantity details, description, cost and the amount of loss associated with each item. The inventory list must be updated on a regular basis. Copies of bills and invoices should be kept along with the inventory list. 																								If you add any improvements to your house then they should automatically be included in your coverage. Even if the improvements are still in progress, it is better to insure them just in case they are irreparably damaged before they are complete. 																								The purchase date, serial numbers and price of all the electronic items should be kept for quick verification. 																								Make sure you include component parts and the contents of drawers, shelves, closets, storage boxes and built-in cabinets. You may be covered for things that are not excluded in your policy. 																								When you are selecting an insurance policy, do not go by the amount of premium alone. Get lots of quotes from various companies and then decide. The insurer should not only offer good service but also have a good record on payout of claims.

 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Microsoft appeals against EU curbs
 															- Case history: it giants feel the heat 																								Brussels, June 8 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp has appealed to EU courts against the European Commissions decision to slap it with a record fine and order changes in the way it sells its Windows software, the company said on Tuesday. 																								On Monday, June 7, we filed our appeal against the European Commissions decision with the EUs Court of First Instance, based in Luxembourg, Horacio Gutierrez, associate general counsel, said in a statement. 																								The Commission in March imposed a fine of 497 million euros ($613 million) on the firm and ordered it to change its business practices. 																								A spokesman for the company said it would make an additional filing seeking suspension of the remedies imposed by the Commission in the coming days. 																								Gutierrez said, The legal standards set by the Commissions decision significantly alter incentives for research and development that are important to global economic growth. 																								The Commissions 302-page ruling says that its goal is the opposite: to increase competition. 																								The decision says that Microsofts tying of its Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system (OS) interferes with the normal competitive process, which would benefit users in terms of quicker cycles of innovation due to unfettered competition on the merits. 																								The commission gave Microsoft 90 days to separate Windows Media Player, which plays music and video over the internet, from its Windows OS.

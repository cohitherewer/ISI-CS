 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 7: Rising global oil and commodity prices, along with the persistence of large capital inflows, can affect domestic monetary conditions in 2004-05, said the governments annual report card. 																								The Economic Survey, released a day before the Congress-led coalitions maiden budget, also said banks have failed in meeting the sub-targets of 18 per cent and 10 per cent set for agriculture and weaker sections of the society, respectively.																								It also noted that since 1999-2000, the share of the small-scale industries (SSI) sector in the outstanding priority sector advances has reported a decline and this is a cause of concern. Moreover, foreign banks have also reported a year-on-year decline in its priority sector advances in proportion to net bank credit, said the government.																								The observations of the survey are expected to spur the government effort to increase the flow of credit to the key farm sector from Rs 80,000 crore in the past fiscal year to March 2004 to Rs 1,05,00,000 crore in this fiscal. The farm sector employs nearly two-thirds of the countrys population of over a billion. The government had vowed to bridge the growing gap between wealthy cities and crores of rural poor, especially farmers.																								Thus, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in consultation with the government, had introduced a new credit delivery mechanism for priority sectors loans and instructed banks to provide loans to farmers who might be facing a huge debt burden from village money-lenders.																								The annual economic survey, however, noted the broad objectives and parameters of the monetary and credit policy for the fiscal ended March 2004 have been met and prospects for 2004-05 financial provide grounds for optimism.																								The hardening of the international prices for oil and non-oil commodities and the persistence of large capital inflows are likely to remain important issues which could affect monetary conditions in 2004-05, said the survey.																								Dealing with the surge in capital flows has become an important part of monetary management, it said, noting a number of measures taken by the RBI to moderate their impact.																								But sterilising capital flows through open market sales of government securities is at best a temporary policy and requires an adequate stock of marketable government securities. These declined to Rs 44,200 crore at the end of March from Rs 1,16,000,00 crore a year earlier.																								Sterilisation involves quasi-fiscal costs in the form of the differential between local and international interest rates, said the survey, adding that this exerts an upward pressure on domestic rates, which could necessitate more intervention from the RBI.																								With the improvement in the macroeconomic situation, it is likely that the present surge in capital flows will continue in the medium-term, it said.

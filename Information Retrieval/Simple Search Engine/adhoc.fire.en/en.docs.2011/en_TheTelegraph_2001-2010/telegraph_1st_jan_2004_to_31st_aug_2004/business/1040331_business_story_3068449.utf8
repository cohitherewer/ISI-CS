 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 South takes lead in tea futures
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Planning ahead																								Calcutta, March 30: The United Planters Association of South India (Upasi) has decided to launch futures in tea from April the first such endeavour in the world.																								This is a departure from the Indian Tea Associations stand, which is not keen on futures trading in tea. 																								Upasi has set up a company called Upasi Commodity Exchange Limited (Ucel) in which OTCEI is expected to take a stake soon, said B. R. Bhansali, chairman of Ucel. The initial equity of the company is Rs 25 lakh and the capital expenditure will be Rs 1 crore. 																								To begin with, Ucel will offer two grades of tea  orthodox BOP (broken orange pekoe) and CTC RD for trading in futures. About 2 lakh kgs of tea will be offered daily for futures. Coimbatore is expected to emerge as the major hub for Ucel. 																								Futures are exchange-traded contracts that require delivery of commodities or other asset at a specified price at a specified date in the future. Futures, unlike options, require the owner to buy the commodity traded in the future. 																								Futures contracts represent a pledge to make a transaction on a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. For price risk insulation, futures contracts are often hedged. 																								Futures contracts are a firm commitment to accept delivery of a specified quantity at a specific date in the future at a price agreed upon when the commitment was made. It is expected that this arrangement will help the tea industry, said Bhansali.																								South Indian tea has been the worst hit in the last four years. Futures trading will help all the members of the tea industry to contract a deal at least a month ahead at a fixed price. This will, to some extent, arrest the frequent ups and downs in the tea prices, Bhansali said. 																								He said that the exchange was structured for the benefit of the growers, processors or manufacturers, traders and brokers. The trading will be online, he added. The Futures Market Commission (FMC) had, almost two years back, permitted Upasi to trade in futures.We are also getting financial assistance from Tea Board, the Ucel chairman said.																								Upasi has already conducted an awareness programme among its members regarding futures trading.																								Asked whether they expect a good response, Bhansali said, We do not expect a result overnight. Initially when futures was introduced in rubber it received a lukewarm response. But today futures in rubber is booming.

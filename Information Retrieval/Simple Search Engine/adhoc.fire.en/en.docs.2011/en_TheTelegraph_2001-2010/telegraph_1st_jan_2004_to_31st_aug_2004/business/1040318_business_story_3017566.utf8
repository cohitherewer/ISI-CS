The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Way out for SBI stragglers
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, March 17: State Bank of India (SBI) may introduce an exit option scheme for its frustrated and de-motivated employees once the core banking solution is in place. The Union finance ministry has already cleared the proposed scheme, which is aimed at removing the deadwood.																								Senior bank officials said the management will take stock of the situation after the implementation of the integrated core banking system, currently under way. 																								Many posts may become redundant once the core banking solution is implemented, the official added. In 2001, the bank had offered a voluntary retirement scheme to 21,000 employees at a cost of Rs 2,271.24 crore.																								The core banking solution is expected to improve productivity, risk management and regulatory compliance, reduce time-to-management in MIS and transaction costs, and track non-performing assets (NPAs) efficiently. The exit option is targeted at all staff segments, including officers, clerks and other subordinate workers who are over 50 years old and have been stagnating in their existing grades for a number of years. 																								The officials added that the scheme is not aimed at right-sizing manpower, but seeks to improve the level of the banks morale. The management has, therefore, reserved the right to fill the vacancies caused by such retirements, unlike the earlier VRS scheme where banks were barred from filling up similar positions.																								Officers who have not been promoted to the next higher grade after four chances would be eligible for the exit option, while for the clerical cadre, it would be limited to those who have not been promoted to officers in the junior management grade scale-I after four chances. 																								For subordinate cadre employees, the offer would be restricted to those who are under-matriculate and therefore ineligible for promotion or those who are matriculate but have not been promoted to the clerical grade.																								Apart from the normal terminal dues, pecuniary benefits under the scheme would include ex-gratia payment of salary last drawn for 50 per cent of service remaining up to the age of 60 years as on the date of retirement subject to a maximum of 36 months.																								The bank has decided to give its employees the benefit of repayment of home loans after retirement. All other outstanding dues to the bank would, however, have to be paid or would be adjusted against ex-gratia.																								Moreover, the employees would be allowed to avail of perks such as residential accommodation and telephones till two months after retirement. In such cases, 50 per cent of the ex-gratia would be released after surrender of the facilities.

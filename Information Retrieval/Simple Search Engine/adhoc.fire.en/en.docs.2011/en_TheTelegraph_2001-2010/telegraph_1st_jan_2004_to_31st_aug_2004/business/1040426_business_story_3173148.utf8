The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Lenders turn to small units for credit growth 
 SATISH JOHN AND VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, April 25: Banks are focussing on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to spur credit offtake. This segment is emerging as a major growth centre alongside retail finance as commercial banks with liquidity find that large companies are not keen on loans.																								The net beneficiaries of this development are SMEs, many of whom were earlier at the mercy of the unorganised banking channel (read money-lenders). 																								Corporation Bank, for instance, said in 2003-04, lending to the small-scale sector has nearly doubled to Rs 1,100 crore from Rs 642 crore in the preceding year.																								Bank executive director P. K. Gupta told The Telegraph that there are good clients even in this sector and advances to this segment will grow in future.																								Other private sector banks are also targeting the small-scale sector and this follows the plunge taken by UTI Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.																								IDBI Bank has recently created a new division dedicated to this sector. While referring to the risk present in this sector, a senior bank official said, What is a banker who doesnt take a risk?																								Centurion Bank also feels that there is a huge potential in this segment waiting to be tapped. According to managing director Shailendra Bhandari, the bank is focussing on those sectors which have a synergy with its other businesses.																								Gupta of Corporation Bank said the small and medium enterprises demand for funds has fuelled banks interest in the sector. On the other hand, large companies have not shown much interest as they have wide sources of funding, including international markets, he added. 																								Gupta said realisation for banks from such enterprises are also comparatively better. Corporation Bank, he added, lends funds to SMEs at interest rates below 13.5 per cent.																								Banking analysts said apart from the attraction of earning 3.5 percentage points, lending to the small-scale sector enables a bank to have a well-diversified base. This would enable them to derive income from many streams.																								Though many public sector banks had earlier found that disbursing to this sector led to bad loans, those who are optimistic now point out that good risk management systems can yield positive returns. 																								Mortality while lending to SMEs can be high. Banks should have sound risk management systems and this can mitigate the risk, said a senior banker.

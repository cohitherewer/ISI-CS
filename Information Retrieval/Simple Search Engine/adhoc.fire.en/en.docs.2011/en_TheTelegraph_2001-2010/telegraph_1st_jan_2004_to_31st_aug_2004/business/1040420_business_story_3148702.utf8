 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 McDonalds chief passes away
																								Chicago, April 19 (Reuters): McDonalds Corp chairman and chief executive Jim Cantalupo died of an apparent heart attack on Monday in Florida, shocking the company and investors, just as his turn-around strategy was beginning to pay off.																								Cantalupo, 60, who died while attending a franchisee convention in Orlando, came out of retirement in early 2003 to take the helm of the worlds largest restaurant company after former CEO Jack Greenberg resigned under pressure.																								He acted quickly to focus on improved food and service that led to a revitalisation of the companys US market, which has turned around after a sustained period of flagging sales.																								McDonalds stock, which had been the second-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average in 2004, slumped 3 per cent in early trading, on concerns of who would take over from Cantalupo.																								A representative for McDonalds, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, could not immediately say who was taking over Cantalupos responsibilities.																								Were focusing on Cantalupo and his family, McDonalds spokeswoman Anna Rozenich said.																								Many on Wall Street have speculated that president and chief operating officer Charlie Bell has been groomed to take over the top job. Bell, an Australian, has also been instrumental in McDonalds turnaround.																								Cantalupo, a former vice-chairman and president of the company with experience running its far-flung international operations, was brought back at a time when McDonalds was struggling to cope with falling profits in a saturated hamburger market, the impact from outbreaks of mad cow disease in key markets such as Europe and Japan, and poor service.																								In little over a year, he helped standardise service in US stores, expand the menu with entree-sized salads and all-white-meat Chicken McNuggets, and launch the companys first unified global marketing campaign.																								In February, sales growth at US restaurants open more than a year rose to their highest level in 30 years.																								The worries are that perhaps there may not be a strong number two, since he was known as the one with the strong vision, said Art Hogan, chief market analyst for investment adviser Jefferies amp; Co. 																								In the short term, when you have a turnaround focused on one person, there will be a short-term disappointment in the stock, he added.																								McDonalds shares fell 96 cents to $26.50 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.																								Since the beginning of 2004, McDonalds shares are up 10.6 per cent, the second best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. In March 2003, the shares had fallen to a 10-year low of $12.45.

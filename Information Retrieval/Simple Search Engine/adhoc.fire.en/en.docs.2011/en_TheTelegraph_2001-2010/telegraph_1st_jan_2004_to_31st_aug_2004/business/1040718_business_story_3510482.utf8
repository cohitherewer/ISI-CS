The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Bid to stop sale of Tata Tea gardens
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 17: The Indian Tea Association (ITA) is lobbying hard to stop the sale of Tata Teas gardens in south and north India. The association will request Tata group chairman Ratan Tata to revert the decision. 																								Talking to The Telegraph ITA chairman C. K. Dhanuka, said, It is an unfortunate decision for the tea industry. We will ask Ratan Tata to re-evaluate the decision to sell the unproductive and unviable tea estates of the company.																								The Tatas want to exit tea production because compared to the rising cost of production, the unit price realisation is not showing an upward trend. 																								We will tell Ratan Tata that the governments of both Assam and Bengal are supporting the industry to increase productivity of the tea estates, Dhanuka said.																								The association will apprise Tata about the discussions the industry has had with trade unions and with the government.																								Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has told tea estate workers in Bengal that productivity needs to be increased substantially so that trade does not suffer. Tata Tea has four estates in Bengal.																								The Tatas had initially invested in Haldia Petrochemicals through Tata Tea. Later, however, investments were made through other Tata group companies. Tatas now want to exit Haldia Petrochemicals, in which they have around Rs 186 crore investment.

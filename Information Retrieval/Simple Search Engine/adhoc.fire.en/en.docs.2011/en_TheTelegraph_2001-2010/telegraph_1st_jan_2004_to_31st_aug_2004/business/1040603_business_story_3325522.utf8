 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Rural phone high on Marans agenda
 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Maran: Connect all																								New Delhi, June 2: Dayanidhi Maran, Union minister for communications and information technology, will seek financial support from the finance ministry for a special rural telephone programme and has directed the officials in his ministry and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd to prepare the plan.																								The rural programme will include a plan to connect 50,000 villages during the financial year 2004-05, a slew of tariff plans exclusively designed to meet the rural requirements (within the telecom tariff regulations prescribed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) and a high-speed internet package for villages with a population of more than 30,000.																								At a meeting held early this week with the Telecom Commission members, including the telecom secretary, Maran reiterated the need to double the teledensity during the current financial year from 7 per cent to 14 per cent.																								Sources in the ministry said: We are already in the process of implementing the village public telephone targets. The special scheme will primarily be undertaken by BSNL. The necessary financial support would be sought from the finance ministry since the minister was informed that the company would not be able to undertake the project without financial support.																								We have already received more than Rs 500 crore from the Universal Service Obligation (USO) fund. However, the resources would be inadequate if the target of completing 50,000 villages is to be met during the current financial year, sources said.																								The high-speed internet access is aimed to benefit tele-agriculture, tele-health and tele-education.																								According to a senior member of the BSNL board, the exercise to provide connection in 50,000 villages can be completed within a year, provided the required financial support is made available.																								The task to connect villages has fallen on the shoulders of BSNL as most of the private operators had managed to delay their rural obligation commitments according to the licence agreements.																								A senior executive of the Association of Basic Telecom Operators said, After we have migrated to the unified access service licence, the terms and conditions are even with the fourth cellular licence. The fourth cellular licence stipulates that 50 per cent of the district headquarters needs to be covered according to the licence conditions.

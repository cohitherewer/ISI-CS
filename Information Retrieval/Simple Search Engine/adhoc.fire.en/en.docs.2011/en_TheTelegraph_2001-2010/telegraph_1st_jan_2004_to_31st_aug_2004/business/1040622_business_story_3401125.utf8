 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Tall export aim in new foreign trade policy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Union commerce minister Kamal Nath in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 21: The government plans to announce a national foreign trade policy by July-end aimed at doubling the export target to $150 billion a year through greater emphasis on non-infotech services and farm goods exports.																								Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said the new policy will be far more comprehensive than the existing exim policy and would have a medium-term perspective to push up trade. 																								The minister said he would also hold extensive consultations with non-IT services sector representatives before formulating the policy.																								He said services like clinical research and healthcare need to be given special focus as the country had the capability to do well in these sectors.																								The government is also hoping to raise its export target to a 2 per cent share of world trade. The exim policy has set an export target of $80 billion a year by 2007 to capture 1 per cent of the world trade. 																								Talking on WTO issues, the minister said the G-20 paper on agriculture provided the starting point for arriving at a framework agreement by July-end, breaking the deadlock in trade negotiations after the collapse of the Cancun talks. 																								There was a stalemate in WTO talks before the G-20 meeting on the sidelines of Unctad XI at Sao Paulo.																								The G-20 paper, which insists on movement on all three pillars of agriculture negotiations in tandem, has provided the starting point for arriving at a framework, he claimed.																								The three pillars of agriculture include market access, domestic support and export subsidies. India has made it clear that all these should be taken up in tandem to address the food security and livelihood concerns of developing nations without which there could be no forward movement.																								He said technical teams of the group were currently meeting in Geneva for framework discussions, the outcome of which is expected by tomorrow.																								The negotiations have reached a crucial stage and the forward movement would depend on developed countries taking on board the interests of developing nations. The minister had also met leaders of non-Group 5 comprising India, Brazil, US, EU and Australia at Sao Paulo.

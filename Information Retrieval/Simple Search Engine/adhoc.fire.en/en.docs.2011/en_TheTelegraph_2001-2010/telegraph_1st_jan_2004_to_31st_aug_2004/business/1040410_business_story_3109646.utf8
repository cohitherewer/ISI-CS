The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Tata Motors turns group sales driver
 SATISH JOHN				 	 Here for the long haul																								Mumbai, April 9: Well on its way to a turnover milestone of Rs 15,000 crore in 2003-04, Tata Motors has gone from being a bleeding behemoth to the Tatas biggest cash cow.																								If the final numbers are in sync with estimates, the automaker will give the group that straddles seven diverse industries, more than a quarter of its revenues.																								Chairman Ratan Tata surprised analysts and shareholders when he reeled out the sales volumes for last year. 																								Tata Motors may see its turnover cross Rs 20,000 crore in 2004-05, if the industry maintains its growth, said an analyst tracking the automobile sector. Pushing it towards that goal will be the recent acquisition of Daewoos truck unit and stepped-up car rollouts.																								Tata Motors can make 1.50 lakh cars in two shifts every year. Having scripted a turnaround, the firm is finding its current capacity insufficient to meet the growing demand. It plans to hike capacity to 2.25 lakh cars.																								The firms expansion plans this year are expected to keep the company profitable even if the Korean factory continues to operate at 25 per cent of its strength. 																								The groups 80 companies gave it a turnover of Rs 54,227 crore. This included Idea, its GSM mobile telephony venture with the Aditya Birla group and AT amp;T.																								In 2002-03, the engineering business  which includes Tata Motors, Voltas and a few others  contributed 24 per cent to the group turnover of Rs 54,227 crore. Communications and information systems, including VSNL, Tata Tele and TCS, brought in 27 per cent.																								Analysts predict that the contribution of communication and information systems at Rs 12298.4 crore in 2003-04 may be unchanged this fiscal. One of the reasons for this is the hole in VSNLs sales made by falling international long-distance telephony tariffs.																								The materials business may also witness a surge as flagship Tata Steel reaps the benefits of a turnaround in business cycle, fuelled by a voracious appetite for steel from China. This segment contributed 19 per cent to its turnover last year. The energy sector (Tata Power) and consumer products companies (Titan, Tata Tea, Tata Coffee) turned in 9 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.																								But the toast of the season has been Tata Motors, whose fortunes have looked up so dramatically that Tata could not hold back his glee when told the EGM this week how the firms rights issue went abegging a few years back, in spite of it being priced cheap. In hindsight, the decision by us to step in and rescue the rights issue appears to have been a good move, he said.																								Even Tata Steel has plans to ramp up its steel making capacity to 15 million tonnes in the medium term. 																								The telecommunications business, which is yet to take wing, may take off in the coming years under the unified licence regime that will merge all telecommunication businesses in 18-24 months. Tata Power is also charged up, with the energy sector finally opening up to private players.

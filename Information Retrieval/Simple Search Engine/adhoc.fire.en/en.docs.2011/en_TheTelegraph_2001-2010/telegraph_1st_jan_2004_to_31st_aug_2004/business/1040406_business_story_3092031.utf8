 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Familiar recipe for IDBI recast on the table
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 5: The formula that M. Damodaran has in mind for the revival of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) is somewhat similar to the one he used to turn around Unit Trust of India. It is now a case study at the Harvard Business School.																								Damodaran, who now heads IDBI, besides UTI Mutual Fund, said the government would have to infuse a few thousand crores ahead of IDBIs conversion into a bank. 																								This could be arranged in a cash-neutral way, which means without having to draw the money from the national exchequer immediately, Damodaran said.																								The government could issue recapitalisation bonds for IDBI, and raise the fund from investors. If IDBI recovered in the same way as UTI, it would redeem these bonds on maturity, and the government would not have to pay a penny, he added.																								The conversion of IDBI into a bank needs to be approved by Parliament, and it should come up for discussion in the second  monsoon  session. On turning into a bank, IDBI may merge IDBI Bank with itself.																								Thanks to the recovery in the economy, IDBIs financial health is improving. It has cut its term lending rates from 12.5 per cent to 10.25 per cent, and in many cases, reset the interest rate to help companies service and repay their debts. It has sold off non-performing assets worth Rs 400-500 crore to the asset reconstruction company (ARCIL) that it has promoted along with State Bank of India. Damodaran said IDBI might sell over Rs 1,000 crore of bad assets to ARCIL.UTI Mutual Fund IPO																								UTI Mutual Fund that manages Rs 21,500 crore in assets, is mulling an initial public offering (IPO) of shares to give its sponsors an exit route. Five external agencies are evaluating the enterprise value of the asset management company at present. It might seek listing of its shares in a few months.																								The management of UTI Mutual Fund envisages a public holding of 60 per cent in it. Banks and financial institutions would hold the remaining 40 per cent. The agencies evaluating UTI Mutual Fund are expected to submit their reports soon.																								UTI Mutual Fund expects asset under management to grow to Rs 40,000 crore in this year. It is one of the few profit-making asset management companies in India. There are 4-5 profit-making asset management companies in India and we make more money than the others put together, Damodaran said.

 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Bengal ready to log into knowledge park
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Feb. 15: The Bengal government plans to set up a knowledge park similar to the one being set up in Hyderabad. 																								Writers Buildings sources said the government is in talks with ICICI Bank, which has been instrumental in setting up the park in Hyderabad.																								Manab Mukherjee, Bengal minister for information technology, confirmed that talks are on between ICICI Bank and the state. It is still too premature to comment. But we are in discussions with ICICI Bank for such a project, Mukherjee said.																								Sources said the project, if implemented, would be the largest in the east.																								The knowledge park will translate into reality the states vision to be among the top-three IT states by 2010 contributing about 15-20 per cent of the countrys overall revenues from the sector, they added.																								Mukherjee added that land is not a problem for an IT project.																								We have already allotted plots to various companies, including Reliance, without any delay. And so far as speed in file movement is concerned, our department has been able to set a standard, he said.																								While Mukherjee remained non-committal about the project, sources said it would come up on 150-200 acres close to Calcutta.																								The knowledge park will help various research projects in the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, IT and telecom sectors.																								The park will have a dedicated electric substation, uninterrupted power supply, high bandwidth connectivity backed by an optic-fibre local area network.																								Mukherjee said the state has attracted IT firms like Wipro, IBM and Infosys. We are talking to other prominent companies to rope them in too. Admitting that there is a high competition among the states in the IT and knowledge sectors, Mukherjee said Bengal will be able to cut a major slice in the IT market.																								The knowledge park in Hyderabad is being set up through a partnership between ICICI Bank and the Andhra Pradesh government on 200 acres of land.

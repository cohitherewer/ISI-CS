 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Jindal project on track, eyes power trading
 															- Steel majors All charged up VIVEK NAIR				 	 Powering ahead																								Mumbai, Aug. 22: Jindal Power Ltd (JPL), the P Jindal groups vehicle to realise its power ambitions, has achieved financial closure for its 1000-MW power project in Chhattisgarh that will initially have a capacity of 500 MW and will be later expanded by another 500 MW. The group is also looking at power trading.																								The company recently received sanctions of around Rs 2,300 crore from banks and financial institutions in a record time against the proposed debt of Rs 1500 crore, officials said. 																								The project that comes at a total cost of Rs 2,100 crore comprises a Rs 642-crore equity infusion and the remaining through debt. Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) will be pumping in the entire 100 per cent of the equity component.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, director Sushil K. Maroo said while the company approached banks for financing in February this year, all sanctions were received by May. This, he added, was one of the fastest financial closures achieved by a company in this industry and it went to show the confidence of the lenders towards a project promoted by a company having strong fundamentals.																								Lenders such as ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, Power Finance Corporation, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and IDBI were the principal players who had accorded their sanction to the project. 																								The company is now in the process of completing various formalities that included the loan agreements and this will be done by the next two weeks, Maroo added. 																								While the project has obtained clearance by the Union government, which has categorised it as a mega-power project, close to 350 MW will be used by JSPL and the balance will be sold in the market. Maroo here added that JSPL has also applied for a trading licence. 																								The power-trading scenario, which currently is said to be at a nascent stage, is expected to pick up dramatically as the power markets grow with reforms of state electricity boards and transmission systems getting strengthened. Among the majors who are aggressively looking at power trading are Tata Power Company, Reliance Energy and Power Trading Corporation Ltd.

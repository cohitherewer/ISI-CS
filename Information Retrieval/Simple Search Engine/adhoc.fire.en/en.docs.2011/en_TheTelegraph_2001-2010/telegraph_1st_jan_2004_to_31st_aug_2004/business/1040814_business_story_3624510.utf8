 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Bonanza for Reliance pre-paid phone users
 OUR BUREAUX																								Mumbai/Calcutta, Aug. 13: Reliance Infocomm today reduced pre-paid tariffs by about 60 per cent on Reliance IndiaMobile (RIM).																								Under the new tariff structure, which will be applicable on all recharge coupons from Monday, local and intra-circle calls to any RIM (pre-paid and post-paid) and Reliance India Phone will cost 99 paise per minute against Rs 2.49 per minute. A call to other GSM operators and landlines will attract a flat rate of Rs 1.79 per minute compared with Rs 2.49 to Rs 2.99 earlier.																								Similarly, inter-circle calls to any RIM or Reliance India Phone anywhere in the country will now cost only Rs 1.79 per minute (Rs 2.99 per minute) and to other GSM operators and landlines Rs 2.49 per minute (Rs 2.99 to Rs 3.99 per minute).																								Reliance Infocomm president (wireless products and services) S. P. Shukla said, All existing as well as new RIM pre-paid customers can avail of the tariff benefits when they recharge with a pre-paid voucher of Rs 325. It makes RIM Prepaid the best plan for all types of calls. This is a reiteration of our founder Dhirubhai Ambanis commitment to offer affordable telephony to the people.																								The new offer virtually doubles the talktime available on competing pre-paid services, said Shukla. 																								We expect to reach the one-crore-subscriber mark by the year end. The new tariffs are also expected to boost prepaid subscriber registration, he added.																								Industry analysts said Reliance Infocomms aggressive tariffs come at a time when its GSM rivals were contemplating a pre-paid tariff hike by bringing down the talk-time.																								Through this move, Reliance Infocomm is only striving to correct the imbalance observed in its subscriber base where a large number are post-paid users. Compared with this, the subscriber base of the GSM players mostly comprises pre-paid users, analysts added.																								Reliance Infocomm said its new tariff plan will benefit vast sections of mobile users and encourage new subscribers. The tariffs were earlier introduced in the Tamil Nadu and Chennai circles in June on a test-run basis.

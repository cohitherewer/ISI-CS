		 Monday, March 08, 2004  Q amp;A				 Old is gold
																																																																																													I have turned 65 years in September 2003. From which year can I claim tax rebate for being a senior citizen?																																																																													M. Demta, Calcutta
																																																																																													You can claim special tax rebate for being a senior citizen under section 88C from the current fiscal (assessment year 2004-05). 																																					Varishtha query																																																																																															I am 74 years old. Can I invest in Varishtha Bima Yojana? What is the maximum amount that I can invest and what happens in the event of my death?																																																																													C. R. Gupta, Calcutta
																																																																																													Anyone above the age of 55 can invest in the policy. You can earn upto Rs 24,000 a year in pension, which could be drawn monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually. The maximum amount that you can invest is Rs 2,66,665, which will yield Rs 2,000 in monthly pension. In the event of death, the nominee will receive the whole amount paid into the policy.																																					Tedious TDS 																																																																																															I am a senior citizen with income more than Rs 70,000. Can I avoid TDS on interest income by furnishing Form 15H?																																																																													Bishwanath Ghosh, Calcutta
																																																																																													Only people earning less than Rs 50,000 a year can submit form 15H to avoid tax deduction at source (TDS). Though you are entitled to special tax rebate under section 88C, you cant file form 15H to avoid TDS. You can, however, reclaim the tax deducted on your interest income by filing tax return.																																					Tax refund																																																																																															I am 60 years old and I earn Rs 10,800 per month from pension. Although I had invested in schemes that qualify for tax rebate under section 88 and 80, I found that a sum of Rs 17,000 was deducted as tax. What should I do?																																																																													S. . Banerjee, Bhubaneshwar
																																																																																													If the amount deducted as tax is more than what you should pay, you should file income tax return and claim refund.																																					Income distribution credit																																																																																															I hold units of MIP99(I) but have not received the income distribution credit for the last six months. What went wrong?																																																																													Anant Nevatia, Calcutta
																																																																																													UTI Mutual Fund says dividend was credited to your bank account through electronic clearing system. Check your account with Bank of Maharashtra where it was credited.

		 Monday, April 05, 2004  Q amp;A				 Protective husband
																																																																																													I have taken a home loan of Rs 5,00,000, which has to be repaid in EMIs for 20 years. The nominee of my house and the loan is my wife and in my absence, she will be liable to repay the loan. Is there any policy, which will pay the outstanding loan amount directly to the bank and my wife is relieved from the burden?																																																																													Rajat Kanti Ojha, Midnapur
																																																																																													You can take a mortgage redemption policy offered by many insurance companies, which will repay all loans and debts in the event of the death of the insured. 																																					PAN poser																																																																																															I am a housewife and my husband is a salaried person. Is it mandatory for me to have a PAN? Do I have to pay any tax on the insurance amount received on his death and on the property, which I inherit from him?																																																																													J. B. Singh, Calcutta
																																																																																													It is mandatory for any person who has taxable income and files income tax returns, to have a PAN. Moreover, if you have income from interest on bank deposits or other investments and the interest amount exceeds Rs 2,500, then TDS will be deducted from the interest amount. To avoid the deduction of TDS and to submit Form 15H, you need to have a PAN. 																																																																																													You do not have to pay any tax on the insurance amount received or to inherit any property. Subsequently, you will have to pay appropriate taxes to use the property.																																					Rebate debate																																																																																															I have invested Rs 70,000 under LIC, PPF etc and another Rs 10,000 in infrastructure bonds to claim tax rebate under section 88. Can I also claim tax rebate on childrens tuition fees up to Rs 12,000 per child? 																																																																													T. S. S. Prasad
																																																																																													You have already exhausted the limit of Rs 70,000 under which you can claim tax rebate on childrens tuition fees up to Rs 12,000 per child. But you still have room to invest a further amount of Rs 20,000 in infrastructure bonds.																																					Trio trick																																																																																															We have invested in post office MIS in these combinations: A and B  Rs 84,000, A and C  Rs 2,16,000 and B and C  Rs 3,00,000. Can A and C open another MIS account for Rs 3,00,000? 																																																																													Sunil Dey, Calcutta
																																																																																													An individual can invest up to Rs 3,00,000 in Post Office MIS. Three people jointly can invest up to Rs 9,00,000. Therefore, A and C can open another MIS account for Rs 3,00,000.

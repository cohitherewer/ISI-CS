 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Tata Motors keen on Korea assembly unit
				 	 Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata in South Korea on Monday. (PTI) 																								Gunsan (South Korea), March 29 (PTI): Tata Motors today evinced interest in assembling cars in Korea and said it was in talks with Korean automakers to forge alliances.																								If there is a market for cars in Korea, we should look at assembling in Korea, group chairman Ratan Tata said after taking over Daewoos commercial vehicles operations here.																								If the car major is successful in setting up an assembly line in Korea, it would be the groups first such venture outside India.																								The Tata group firm manufactures cars at its Pune plant and has a tie-up with the UK-based automaker, MG Rover, to sell compact car Indica in Britain and Europe.																								Talking about the groups other business plans in the Korean peninsula, Tata said the company was in talks with Korean firms across various sectors for forging alliances. He, however, declined to give details about the prospective partners.																								When asked whether todays Korean foray was a precursor to the companys entry into China, Tata said he has no specific plans for China at this stage. Only preliminary talks have been held so far in that country. 																								We would like to make Daewoo Commercial Vehicle globally visible and if that includes China then it will be so, he said.																								Analysts said the Daewoo takeover would give a fillip to Tata Motors China strategy.																								Tata Motors has a 15 per cent market share in the Indian car market and is the third largest producer after Maruti and Hyundai. It sold 104,155 cars last year recording a 17.5 per cent rise. Tata Motors has commenced work on a peoples car priced under Rs 1 lakh.

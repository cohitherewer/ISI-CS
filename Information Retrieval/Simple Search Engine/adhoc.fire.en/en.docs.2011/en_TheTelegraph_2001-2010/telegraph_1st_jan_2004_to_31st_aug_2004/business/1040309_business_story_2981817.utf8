The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Oil stocks on fire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vijay Kelkar, adviser to the finance minister, with IRDA chairman C. S. Rao in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, March 8: The overwhelming response to the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) stake sale was reflected in the stock markets today as, led by oil shares, the sensex ended with a gain of 55 points at 5935.19.																								Market analysts said while oil shares are being re-rated in the wake of the huge response to the ONGC public offer, both institutional and retail investors made a clamour for these scrips. 																								While ONGC, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Gail (India) Ltd were the leading gainers in the oil sector, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) PSU index spurted by 4.48 per cent or 174.88 points to close at 4082.00 against Fridays close of 3907.12.																								ONGC gained by around 6 per cent or Rs 48.65 to close at Rs 850.90. HPCL gained by over 6 per cent or Rs 31.50 to Rs 530.30, while Indian Oil Corporation rose by Rs 30.10 to Rs 526.75. Gail finished higher by Rs 15.45 at Rs 230.15.																								The BSE 30-share index opened with a modest gain of 5899.26 and moved to an intra-day high of 5951.03 before closing at 5935.19, a net gain of 0.93 per cent. 																								Bank stocks were also in the limelight, boosted by the government notifying guidelines on foreign direct investment (FDI) in private sector banks. The FDI ceiling, including FII holding, in private sector banks now stands at 74 per cent.																								Market analysts said while this move initially led to an increased buying of private bank shares, it later spread to the entire sector with buyers even flocking to nationalised banks. Some of the scrips which attracted investors included ICICI Bank, Federal Bank and J amp;K Bank. The bank index also spurted by 85.53 points or 2.92 per cent to 3018.27 from the previous close of 2932.74.																								Most of the other old-economy stocks, including cement, also attracted fresh buying interest from retail investors. While Reliance Industries (RIL) saw extensive trading, cement shares of Grasim and Gujarat Ambuja also witnessed spirited buying.																								Other index-based shares like Larsen amp; Toubro, ITC, Hindalco, Hero Honda and Ranbaxy also saw heavy trading. 																								The volume of business was relatively higher at Rs 2,666.91 crore compared with Rs 2,455.55 crore on Friday. Satyam Computer was the top-traded share with a turnover of Rs 240.00 crore, followed by Tisco at Rs 231.57 crore, ONGC at Rs 200.45 crore and RIL at Rs 142.27 crore.

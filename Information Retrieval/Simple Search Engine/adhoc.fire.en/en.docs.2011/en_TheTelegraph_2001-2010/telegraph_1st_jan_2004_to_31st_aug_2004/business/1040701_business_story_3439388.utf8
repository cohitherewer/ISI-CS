Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, June 30: Century Plyboards (India) Limited plans to delist from the regional bourses of Calcutta, Delhi and Ahmedabad after it is listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).																								Currently, we are listed on three regional bourses, but due to their defunct positions, we initiated listing on the major exchanges of the country  NSE and BSE. However, since our issued capital was Rs 5 crore  less than the prescribed limit of Rs 10 crore required for listing on NSE  we could not complete the process yet. managing director Sajjan Bhajanka said. 																								The company offered a rights issue in the ratio of two shares for every five held, which raised the issued capital to Rs 7 crore, he said. Recently, the company decided to issue bonus shares in the ratio of 1:2, which will take the issued capital to above Rs 10 crore, making it eligible for listing on NSE and BSE.																								The company has posted a 61.37 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 7.31 crore in 2003-04 against Rs 4.53 crore in the previous fiscal. The total turnover increased to Rs 128.01 crore from Rs 116.23 crore in the previous year.																								In 2004-05, we expect a Rs 40-45 crore increase in turnover, which will take the total figure to around Rs 175 crore. Once the expansion project for producing laminates is completed in December, our turnover will cross Rs 200 crore in 2005-06, said Bhajanka. The total investment in the project is Rs 38 crore, of which Rs 8 crore will be funded through the rights issue, Rs 6 crore through internal accruals and the remaining through bank borrowings.

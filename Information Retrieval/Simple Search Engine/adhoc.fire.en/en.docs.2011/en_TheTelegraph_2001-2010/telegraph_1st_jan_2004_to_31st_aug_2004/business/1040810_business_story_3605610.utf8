 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Icra forecasts 6.7% growth
																								New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI): Credit rating agency Icra today revised upwards its economic growth projection to 6.5-6.7 per cent for 2004-05, following budget measures to boost investment in agriculture and manufacturing sectors.																								While ruling out over 7 per cent growth this fiscal, Icra said the country can tick 7.2-7.7 per cent GDP growth in the medium-term if the government can implement policies of stepping up investment, infrastructure development, further liberalisation of trade and reducing fiscal deficit.																								GDP growth for 2004-05 would most likely be around 6.6 per cent, give or take 0.1 percentage points, Icra said in its Money amp; Finance report released today.																								Earlier, the agency had projected a 6.4 per cent growth for this fiscal assuming a 1.7 per cent growth in agriculture, 7.8 per cent growth in industry and services sectors taken together.																								But now, Icra said agriculture can grow higher than 1.7 per cent, while industry and services sectors can sustain 8 per cent, which would result in a 6.6 per cent GDP growth.																								Indications for south-west monsoon are good so far and it is possible that agriculture will grow somewhat, especially given the governments initiative in pushing credit for purchase of inputs, it said.																								Since some of the agriculture estimates, like foodgrain production, have been scaled down from 212.8 million tonnes to 210.8 million tonnes in 2003-04, Icra said it is possible to envisage a little more growth in agriculture output in 2004-05.																								It would be an extra-ordinary achievement to realise 7 per cent growth this year on the strength of higher agricultural output alone, the study said. Non-agriculture sectors  industry and services  would continue to grow at the same pace of 8 per cent as they did in 2003-04, Icra added.

Tempest said the Chinese operations of Ranbxy, which commenced about six years ago, is set to achieve operating profits this year. 																								Ranbaxy had recently acquired the generic business of Aventis in France. Tempest said that the company is keen on more acquisitions in the US and European market.																								Ranbaxy today announced the launch of three new herbal brands under the umbrella of New Age Herbals  Olesan Oil for cold, Olesan cough syrup for adults and children and Eat Ease (appetite enhancer) for children. 																								The new range of OTC brands, developed in-house by Ranbaxys research and development team, will be promoted through doctors and mass communication.

Officials said that it has entered the herbal segment after carefully assessing the global consumer trends and market potential.

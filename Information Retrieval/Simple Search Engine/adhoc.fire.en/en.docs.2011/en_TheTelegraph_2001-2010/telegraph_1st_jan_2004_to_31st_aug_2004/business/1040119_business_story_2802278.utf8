		 Monday, January 19, 2004  Q amp;A				 TDS: Fair or foul
																																																																																													I had written to you earlier, seeking clarification on whether post offices could deduct tax on NSS withdrawals. The post office deducted tax when I closed my NSS account. The postal authorities claim they could deduct tax on withdrawal, but there appears to be no provision for TDS in the scheme. Could you please forward my complaint to the National Savings Organisation?																																																																													U. S. Singh, Durgapur
																																																																																													You have been giving us an impression that you had invested in NSS 92. There is indeed no provision for tax deduction by the post office (TDS) in NSS 92. But having gone through your correspondence with the postal authorities, we suspect you might had invested in NSS 87. The post office could deduct tax on NSS 87 withdrawals. However, being a senior citizen, you are entitled to a special tax rebate under section 88B, and may not have to pay tax on the withdrawn amount. But for that, youd have to file income tax returns and claim refund from the tax authorities. Anyhow, we have forwarded your complaint to T. Dasari, regional director, National Savings Organisation. He has promised to get in touch with you.																																					Interest delays on PPF																																																																																															People having PPF account with the Jhargram post office are upset with the extraordinary delay in posting of interest. Sometimes, it wouldnt be posted until a year later. For instance, the interest for 2002-3 was posted recently. Account holders are concerned that this could result in financial loss. Complaints to the postal authorities fell on deaf ear. Could we transfer our PPF account to State Bank of India?																																																																													Prasenjit Bhakat, Jhargram
																																																																																													The matter has been referred to the regional director of the National Savings Organisation. He has promised to look into it. The delay in posting of interest would not have any financial bearing. Meanwhile, you could transfer your PPF account if you want to, to State Bank of India or any of the designated banks that accept PPF deposits. Youd not be allowed to withdraw the money from your account  a pay order will be issued in the name of the bank where you want to transfer your account.																																					Return relief																																																																																															I am a senior citizen earning less than Rs 50,000 a year from term deposits and post office monthly income scheme. Am I liable to pay tax? Should I file income tax return?																																																																													Karabi Sinha, Burdwan
																																																																																													Since your income is less than Rs 50,000, you need not file income tax return. Rest assured your income is not taxable.

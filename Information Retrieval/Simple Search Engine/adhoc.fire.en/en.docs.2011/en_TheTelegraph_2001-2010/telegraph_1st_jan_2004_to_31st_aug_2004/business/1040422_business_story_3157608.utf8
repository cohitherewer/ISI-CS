 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 SBI Life equity base to expand by 25%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 21: SBI Life Insurance, a 74:26 joint venture insurance firm between State bank of India (SBI) and French Cardiff SA, plans to increase its equity base by 25 per cent in 2004-05.																								The life insurer, which currently has a capital base of Rs 125 crore, plans to infuse an additional Rs 50 crore, likely to be funded through the companys internal accruals.																								The infusion will be done in a single tranche, a source said. The life insurer can increase its equity base by another Rs 65 crore according to the stipulated norms and regulations, the source added.																								While State Bank of India, the countrys largest commercial bank, would invest Rs 37 crore, the remaining would be funded by Cardiff, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas, the largest commercial bank in France and among the top ten in the world.																								The capital infusion comes on the back of the life insurer reporting staggering revenues in the financial year ended March 31, 2004. 																								Gross revenues generated through premiums jumped 233 per cent to Rs 200 crore, up from Rs 60 crore reported in the year earlier. It has issued over two lakh individual policies and provided home insurance to around 75,000 customers.																								The life insurer also plans to introduce four new products in this year, including a policy aimed at non-resident Indians. 																								Recently, it formed a marketing tie-up with Union Bank of India to sell its policies as well as floated a new scheme aimed at home-loan consumers.																								The scheme provides coverage to advances for term periods ranging between five and 15 years, while the size of the coverage would vary between Rs 50,000 and Rs 50 lakh. 																								The premium would be based on the loan amount, tenure and age of the borrower.																								Currently, SBI Life offers this scheme to housing loan borrowers from United Bank of India, State Bank of India and its seven subsidiaries and some non-banking financial companies dealing in home loan products.

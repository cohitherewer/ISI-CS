 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Non-audit fee for CAs on cards 
 RAJA GHOSHAL Out of the books 																								New Delhi, May 9: Chartered accountants (CAs) may soon be allowed to charge a percentage-based fee for expertise rendered in non-auditing work.																								The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has moved a proposal in this regard at its latest council meeting and it will now be placed before the government for approval. ICAI, which is the apex professional body of chartered accountants in India, regulates the professional standards and guidelines, besides issuing the Certificate of Practice to practising CAs.																								Talking about the proposal, an ICAI spokesperson said, A CA can only charge a fee in absolute rupee terms not related to the turnover or profit of the company. This pattern will continue for auditing work. But for non-auditing work like management consultancy, the proposal seeks to allow a percentage-based fee.																								ICAI will approach the central government to give effect to the amendments as early as possible. In the event of any delay, the council of the institute will seek permission to take decisions under the existing provision to permit its members to charge a fee on percentage basis in select areas to be identified and approved by the council.																								Right now, the CA (Amendment) Bill has been placed before the parliamentary committee along with the respective amendment bills for the two other professions  company secretaries and cost accountants.																								Under the present regulations, ICAI members are restricted or prevented from charging a fee on percentage basis, to even non-exclusive areas like merchant banking and consultancy, while members belonging to some profession and/or non-professionals have the liberty of charging a fee on percentage of profit, or contingent upon findings or results of the assignment, an ICAI official said. 																								The objective of the council of ICAI is that a level-playing field should be ensured for its members for the simple reason that while he is prevented for certain reasons attributable to his profession, others engaging/rendering services in the same area has the liberty to charge fee on any basis they like. Train abroadICAI has sought permission to allow students to take the internship and training in the country of their choice, a move that would largely benefit the increasing number of NRI students, says PTI. The move can fructify with necessary amendments in Chartered Accountants Act, for which the institute has approached the government.

 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 GTB bad loans on way to asset recast firm
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 27: Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) may transfer some of the non-performing assets (NPAs) of Global Trust Bank (GTB) to Asset Reconstruction Company India Limited (Arcil).																								GTB has bad loans worth Rs 1,500 crore on its books. Oriental Bank chairman and managing director B. D. Narang has said he will be able to recover 40-45 per cent of these in 12 months. We may consider transferring a portion of the NPAs to Arcil, an official said.																								If OBC is able to recover sticky assets worth Rs 600 crore, the networth of GTB can turn positive in a year, the official added.																								Arcil officials feel that OBC might approach them with the sticky assets of Global Trust. We are open to the idea of these bad loans, they added.																								The firm has already acquired financial assets worth Rs 9,000 crore from institutions and banks  the first organisation in the country to do so.																								We are in the process of selling these assets and passing on the realisation to banks and financial institutions (FIs). Some of the properties are mired in legal tangles. We are sorting out these problems, they added.																								Asset reconstruction firms acquire NPAs from institutions and banks to manage them and maximise their recovery. The lenders, relieved of the burden of bad loans, can focus on core activities. Arcil has been set up to fulfil these objectives in the banking sector. 																								Rooted in a bank-based model, Arcil has State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd, Industrial Development Bank of India, Housing Development Finance Corporation and HDFC Bank as its sponsors. To facilitate operational flexibility, it has been set up as a private-sector entity with 51 per cent of its equity with private banks. 																								Arcil, registered with the Reserve Bank of India under Section 3 of the Sarfasi Act 2002 as a securitisation and reconstruction company, started business from August 29, 2003. It is considered a public financial institution within the purview of section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956. The company is an associate member of the Indian Banks Association.

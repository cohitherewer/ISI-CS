 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Dells profit up 22% as sales jump
 TERRIL YUE JONES																								Los Angeles, May 15: Continuing its profitable roll, computer maker Dell Inc. has said that its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 22 per cent, helped by growth overseas and strong sales of server computers and high-capacity storage devices. 																								Dell earned $731 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period ended April 30, up from $598 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 21 percent to $11.5 billion from $9.5 billion last year. 																								The growth keeps Dell on track toward its goal of posting revenue of $60 billion to $70 billion by 2007. Dells revenue last fiscal year was $41.4 billion, a 17 per cent increase from 2002. 																								The market-share gains they had in the first quarter appeared fairly impressive, so I think theyre on a continued trend to take more share, said James Ragan, an analyst with brokerage Crowell, Weedon amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 																								Round Rock, Texas-based Dell is in tight competition with Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto, Calif., in personal computers, servers, storage and other computing systems, and the two are engaged in constant price wars that trim earnings. 																								Revenue in the current quarter probably will reach $11.7 billion, but profit in the period probably will not exceed analysts consensus estimates of 29 cents a share, chief financial officer Jim Schneider said in a conference call. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had predicted per-share earnings of up to 31 cents. 																								That helped send Dell shares, which had fallen 65 cents to $35.80 in regular Nasdaq trading before results were released, down to $34.68 after-hours. 																								Investors were also disappointed that although Dell posted higher sales than the company last month said it expected for the quarter, profit did not budge from forecasts.

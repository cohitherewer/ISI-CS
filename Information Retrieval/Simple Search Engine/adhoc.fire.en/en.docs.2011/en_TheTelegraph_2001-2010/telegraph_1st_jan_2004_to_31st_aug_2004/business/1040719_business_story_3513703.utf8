 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 ICAI clears air on forex cover norms
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, July 18: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has clarified that accounting standard 11 (AS11) will apply only to forward cover for current transactions and not for future ones.																								The clarification followed several representations made to the apex body of chartered accountants on the applicability of AS11 to the exchange difference arising on a forward exchange contract entered into by an enterprise to hedge the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or a highly probable forecast transaction.																								Technical director Avinash Chander said, The revised version of AS11 titled The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates became mandatory from April this year. It was issued in 2003. 																								Chander said forward cover is a hedge against the change in foreign currency rates. When it is applicable to present transactions, it means that the deal has already happened and recorded in account books. Future transactions refers to a firm and binding contract, which is slated to take place at a later date. Explaining the rationale for the clarification, Chander said when AS11 was initially issued, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was not allowing forward cover for future transactions to the companies. 																								However, now that the RBI is allowing it, companies and chartered accountants are in doubt as to how AS11 is to be applied in case of future transactions. As an apex body of chartered accountants, it was important for us to clarify that AS11 does not apply to future transactions and we have done it in the recent council meeting, Chander said.

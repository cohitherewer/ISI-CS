 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Jindals eye power trading
				 	 Full of energy																								New Delhi, May 2 (PTI): Jindal Steel and Power, part of $2.3-billion Jindal group, today said it would enter the power trading business, armed with the 1,250 MW of electricity that it hopes to generate four years from now.																								We shall soon apply for power a trading licence with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). We have an existing capacity of 205 MW, which will go up to 255 MW by the end of December this year, Sushil Maroo, vice-president (finance) of JSPL said.																								Jindal Power, in which JSPL would be a majority stake holder, is setting up 1000 MW (2x500 MW) plant at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh, giving JSPL 1255 MW by 2008. 																								The first unit will be completed by 2007 and the second by 2008, Maroo said. JSPL already sells power to Chattisgarh State Electricity Board and some private entities.																								Maroo said Jindal Power has agreed to give 350 MW to JSPL at Rs 2.10 per unit for 12 years, beginning 2007. This would ensure affordable tariffs for state electricity board as well as other players who buy it, he added.																								The company is targeting a two-fold rise in turnover to Rs 2,000 crore by 2005-06 from Rs 1000 crore in 2003-04. There will be a significant increase in turnover and profits with the early completion of the proposed projects in power and sponge iron ahead of schedule.																								Currently, JSPL uses about 100 MW for its own sponge iron units and sells the rest to electricity boards.																								The company said it has signed an understanding with the state government and the preliminary work on 1000 MW has already begun. JSPL is also negotiating with various equipment suppliers, including Bharat Heavy Electricals and some overseas firms.

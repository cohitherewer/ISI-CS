 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, June 13: The tea industry wants the Congress-led government to roll back an additional excise duty of Re 1 per kg imposed in the budget for 2003-04.																								A delegation of the Indian Tea Association (ITA), led by chairman C. K. Dhanuka, has recently met Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath to remove the additional excise duty which is a burden on the industry.																								Nath has assured the industry that he will look into the matter and discuss it with the ITA within a fortnight.																								The tea industry had been paying the additional excise duty since April 1, 2003.																								In the 2003-04 Union budget, the NDA government had abolished the then prevailing excise duty of Re 1 per kg of tea and introduced the additional duty by way of surcharge. According to the then Union finance minister Jaswant Singh, the collections would go to a fund to be utilised for development, modernisation and rehabilitation of the tea plantation sector.																								Singh had contended that it would not impose any additional burden on the tea firms, but would redesign the duty to help the industry.																								However, the industry has not got any funds till date from the additional excise duty corpus which has swelled to Rs 60 crore, subsequent to their contributions.																								Talking to The Telegraph, Dhanuka said, We had a meeting with Chidambaram and Nath last Wednesday. They have both listened to the problems of the industry which is suffering for the last four years. The meeting was encouraging.																								Nath has assured us that he will look into the additional excise duty and discuss the matter within a fortnight, he added.																								The industry wants the additional excise duty fund to be used for increasing the orthodox tea production, generic promotion of tea at home and abroad and research and development.																								Dhanuka said the industry has also made an appeal to both Nath and Chidambaram to remove the additional excise duty.

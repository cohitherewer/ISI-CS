 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Reliance Energy net profit leaps 300%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Friday (Reuters)																								Mumbai, April 16: Reliance Energy Ltd has posted a 300 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 100.38 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared with Rs 25.07 crore in the corresponding period previous year.																								Total income during the reporting quarter stood at 876.56 crore as against Rs 646.87 crore reported in the corresponding previous quarter.																								This electric performance, which has come a year after Reliance Industries Ltd obtained a majority stake in the company through its second open offer, has been attributed to the expansion of its customer base and increased sales of energy.																								Speaking to newspersons here today Anil Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Energy, said that two of its distribution companies in Delhi have registered net profits of Rs 94 crore and Rs 61 crore during the year as against losses of Rs 65 crore and Rs 103 crore respectively in the preceding year. It has spent close to Rs 3,500 crore to modernise and rebuild the distribution companies in the capital.																								For the full year, the company reported a 206.98 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 374.12 crore as against a net profit of Rs 121.87 crore in the previous fiscal and announced a final dividend of Rs 1.50 per equity share. 																								Total income during the fiscal rose by 29.8 per cent to Rs 3,582.78 crore as against Rs 2,759.29 crore in the previous fiscal, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.																								Ambani said that the companys primary objective is to gain customers loyalty. Its strategy is not only to provide uninterrupted power, but make it available at a reasonable tariff. 																								While there was a 12 per cent reduction in average billing rates during the last fiscal, the Reliance Energy chief ascertained that more re-balancing of tariffs are on the anvil with billing rates being brought down.																								In addition to such a reduction in tariffs, the company is also looking at ways to bring down the transmission and distribution (T amp;D) losses to single digit numbers. The thumb rule here is that for every one per cent reduction in T amp;D losses, close to Rs 30 crore will be added to the companys bottomline.																								When asked about the companys immediate plans, Ambani said that it may tap international markets to part-finance the mammoth expansion programme. Reliance Energy is placing an enabling resolution at its forthcoming annual general meeting.

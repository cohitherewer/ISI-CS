 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 No consensus on deal to prune subsidies
																								Paris, June 29 (Reuters): The worlds biggest steel-producing nations, including India, failed to nail down a deal on reducing subsidies to the sector on Tuesday and suspended formal talks until next year.																								They had been aiming for an agreement by September, but disagreed over the scope for allowing some subsidies in developing countries seeking special treatment, and subsidies for closing inefficient plants.																								The scope of these exceptions needs further discussion, said Herwig Schloegl, deputy secretary general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which hosted the talks.																								The steel nations, which have been trying to reach a deal since December 2002, still wanted an accord and planned to hold informal talks before reconvening next year, Schloegl told a news conference. He declined to give a date for a 2005 meeting.																								My sense is it would be some time in early 2005, James Jochum, US assistant secretary of commerce for import administration, told reporters.																								He welcomed the fact that the participants  the US, China, Brazil, India and a delegation from the European Union  had not totally abandoned the drive to cut out subsidies blamed for distorting trade.																								This could have gone the other way, Jochum said. So I think its reassuring that every delegate reaffirmed a commitment to the process.																								The US in part blamed foreign government support for steel for its 2002 decision to impose temporary tariffs of up to 30 per cent on steel imports.																								US President George W. Bush scrapped the tariffs last December in the face of a possible trade war with Europe, but Washington has continued to press US trading partners to cut subsidies for steel producers.																								The steel-producing states of Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania are expected to be key battleground states in the US presidential election in November.																								Since negotiations began, demand for steel from China has soared because of its economic boom, helping allay concerns among some steel makers about over-capacity in the world market.																								Growth in global steel consumption accelerated to more than 6 per cent in 2003, with a relatively high rate expected to be maintained in 2004 and 2005, the steel nations said in a communique after the meeting.																								Jochum and the European Commissions representative at the subsidy reduction talks said they intended to hold bilateral discussions with other steel producers in the coming months.

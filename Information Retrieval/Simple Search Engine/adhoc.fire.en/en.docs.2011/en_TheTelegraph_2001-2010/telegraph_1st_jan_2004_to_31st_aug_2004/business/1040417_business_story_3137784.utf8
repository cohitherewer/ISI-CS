 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Tax notice impact bigger than US backlash
 OUR BUREAU																								Bangalore, April 16: Wipro Ltd today said the Rs 261.4-crore demand notice served to the company by the income tax department had a bigger impact than the backlash in the US and added that it would file an appeal against it.																								The backlash we had, if we measure the impact on business, was not in the US, but in India, with this tax claim, Wipro vice-chairman Vivek Paul said.																								Wipro corporate vice-president Suresh Senapaty said the firm would appeal against the notice, as advised by its legal cell and outside consultants.																								He said the firm had not made provision for payment of tax. Senapaty said Nasscom was lobbying with the government on behalf of the software industry against the tax notice, but denied that the company had approached the Prime Ministers Office for redressal.Spectramind attrition																								Wipro Spectramind, the BPO subsidiary of Wipro, plans to sign non-poaching agreements with 11 BPO firms in the country to counter high staff attrition even as the company saw a dip in its strength at the end of the fourth quarter.																								We have signed non-poaching agreements with nine firms and plan to sign similar agreements with 11 more this year, Wipro Spectramind chairman and managing director Raman Roy said here.																								The companys strength went down to 9,300 in the fourth quarter ending April 2004, a net decline of 156 people, against 9,456 in December 2003.

 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Axe hangs on Gail facility in Maharashtra
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, Feb. 22: Gail (India) Ltd liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plant at Usar in Maharashtra has turned out to be a fiasco and the company is now toying with the idea of winding up its operations and shifting the plant and equipment to some other place to avoid an annual recurring operating loss of Rs 20 crore. 																								Gail has come under fire in the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for wasting close to Rs 300 crore in setting up the Usar plant even when it was known in the projects incipient stages that Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) would not be able to supply adequate natural gas for sustaining its operations.																								In fact, what little gas ONGC is supplying to the Gail plant is at the cost of its own operations at Uran which is 25 km from Usar. ONGC has to operate its Uran plant at less than full capacity to merely keep the Usar plant running.																								Gails plant, which commenced production in 1998, has been rapidly going downhill and is producing a measly 22,400 metric tonnes of LPG every year although its has a capacity of 139,500 tonnes. 																								This works out to a capacity utilisation of a mere 16 per cent which is worse than even Gails LPG plant at Lakwa in Assam that is operating at around 30 per cent capacity. Both these plants have been hamstrung due to low availability of gas.																								The CAG report says the shortage of gas had started showing up as early as 1995 when Gail had invested only Rs 2.32 crore in the project and there was a need to review its techno-economic viability at that stage. 																								The project was planned under the assumption that 16.5 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (MMSCMD) would be supplied from ONGCs Mumbai High offshore fields. Of this, 11.3 MMSCMD would be processed at the ONGC plant in Uran and the remaining 5 MMSCMD would be supplied to the Usar plant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Team to Pakistan for long tea innings 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 Pick of the season 																								Calcutta, Feb. 15: Pakistan is gradually emerging as a major market for Indian tea. The Indian Tea Association (ITA) has decided to send a delegation to Pakistan by March-end or early April. 																								The industry hopes to sell more than 10 million kgs of tea to Pakistan in 2004. The delegation will request for a cut in the import duty on tea, which is currently at 20 per cent. Except for Bangladesh and Nepal, all other tea producing countries like Sri Lanka, Kenya, India and Vietnam have to pay this high duty. 																								C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the ITA, said exports to Pakistan almost touched the 7 million-kg mark in 2003. We exported 1 million kg of tea in December alone, he added. 																								In June last year, the ITA took a delegation to Pakistan under the chairmanship of Bharat Bajoria. The association had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Pakistan Tea Association to export 10 million kgs of tea between July 2003 and June 2004. India has sent 5.6 million kgs between July and January. In 2003, India has exported 6.2 million kgs of tea. This is a substantial increase from the previous years, said an industry official.																								Till 2002, India used to export 3-3.5 million kgs of tea per annum. However, Indian tea makes its way to Pakistan through Dubai and Jordan too. Following the peace process initiated by India and Pakistan, the industry feels that in 2004-05, there would be a quantum leap in exports to Pakistan.																								Pakistan is traditionally a CTC tea market. The country consumes nearly 140-150 million kgs of tea annually. Pakistan imports tea mainly from Kenya and Sri Lanka.																								Producers from north and south India and merchant exporters will also visit Pakistan this time. 																								Having lost a major export market in Russia and Iraq, the Indian tea industry is also making a fresh move to enter the West Asian countries. 																								The tea industry is sending a delegation to Iran, Dubai and Egypt. We feel that countries in West Asia will become major export destinations, said an industry observer. 																								Indian tea exports have suffered a major setback in 2003 following the war in Iraq, which used to import 43 million kgs of tea annually. We are getting some tenders. But the industry cannot depend on that. So we have decided to enter West Asia, Dhanuka added.

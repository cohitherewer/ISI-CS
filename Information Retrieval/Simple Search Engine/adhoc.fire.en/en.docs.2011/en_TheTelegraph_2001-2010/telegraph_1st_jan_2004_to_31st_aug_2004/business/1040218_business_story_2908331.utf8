 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Tribunal backs govt on share of oilfield profits
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: The International Arbitration Tribunal at London has upheld the governments stand against Videocon, owned by the Dhoots, in a dispute over payments from the eastern offshore Ravva oilfields.																								The tribunal has ruled that the governments share of profit from the oilfields should be paid by private companies as and when the extracted petroleum was sold.																								The tribunal, comprising Justices B. . Kirpal, J. K. Mehra and G. Nanavati, has rejected the stand of Videocon Petroleum (now known as Petrocon India) that its licence for producing oil and gas did not set a date for the payment of profit. Videocon had used this argument to withhold the governments share of profit. 																								The tribunal ruled, The government was entitled to receive its share from the sale proceeds of the profit petroleum on the basis of the provisional post tax rate of return established by the contractor as and when the said profit petroleum was sold and it was only by way of convenience that the parties agreed that payment to the government be deferred till the end of each quarter.																								Videocon had taken the stand that the production-sharing contract does not specify the exact time-frame within which the amount has to be paid, hence it could pay the money when it suits the company.																								However, the other partners in the Ravva oilfields  Cairn Energy of UK, ONGC and Marubeni of Japan  had paid the government its share of revenue at the end of each quarter.																								The government had also asked Videocon to pay interests for the delay in payment of its share of revenue. 																								Sources said that the government has claimed roughly Rs 800 crore from Videocon as payments due to it from the Ravva oilfields. Videocon has admitted that it owes Rs 300 crore. 																								As a last resort the government had started deducting around Rs 3 crore a month from the sale proceeds towards the Rs 300 crore dues. 																								Earlier, the arbitration proceedings were held in Kuala Lumpur. But due to the SAARS scare the hearing was shifted to London.																								Videocon had also triggered a major controversy by taking a huge loan against the entire in-place reserves of the Ravva oilfields. The government had even issued a notice threatening to throw the company out of the joint venture. But Videocon had managed to wriggle out.																								The privatisation of some of the oilfields discovered by the ONGC is turning out to be a nasty experience for the country.

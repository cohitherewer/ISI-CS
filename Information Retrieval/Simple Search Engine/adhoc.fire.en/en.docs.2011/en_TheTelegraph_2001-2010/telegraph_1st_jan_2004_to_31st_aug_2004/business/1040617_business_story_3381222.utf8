 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Sterlite lines up Rs 900 cr for Balco
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Agarwal: Chipping in																								Mumbai, June 16: Sterlite Industries is planning to invest close to Rs 900 crore in Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco), a company in which it holds a 51 per cent stake.																								Balco will increase the installed capacity of its aluminium smelter to 3.50 lakh tonnes from one lakh tonnes and set up a 540-MW coal-based captive power plant.																								The total project cost is estimated at Rs 4,100 crore, to be financed through a mix of equity and debt. Balco has taken a Rs 1,000-crore loan from banks to finance its expansion plan. 																								The investment by the Anil Agarwal-owned company in Balco will be facilitated by a rights issue, which is expected to mop up Rs 1,972.30 crore. The issue comes in the ratio of one share for every two held, and each share is being offered at Rs 550.																								In its letter submitted to the market regulator, Sterlite has said the balance amount raised through the rights issue  Rs 1000 crore  will be used to retire its own debt and bring down current liabilities. Close to Rs 520 crore will go towards the repayment of old term loans and Rs 551 crore to reduce other liabilities.																								The company has short-term loans, such as working capital, non-convertible debentures and commercial paper, on which the average interest rate is 6.28 per cent.																								Sterlite is also planning to use Rs 365 crore from the rights issue proceeds to meet redemption requirements on its outstanding floating rate notes. The instruments carry an interest rate of Libor plus 130 basis points.																								Sterlite, however, said if a part of the identified borrowings proposed to be reduced are not repaid, it may increase its stake in Balco and Hindustan Zinc Ltd.																								Sterlite has a call option to acquire the governments rump holding in Balco, according to the shareholders agreement. It wants to exercise the call option, but is waiting for a decision from the government.																								Sterlite is also expanding the copper capacity at its Tuticorin smelter to 3 lakh tonnes from 1.80 lakh tonnes. The project is at an advance stage of completion and production is set to commence in the first quarter of the next fiscal. In addition to this expansion, a 1.27 lakh-tonne copper refinery is also coming up at Tuticorin.																								According to Sterlite, with the enhanced capacity in place, it would relocate its existing copper rod plant from Silvassa to Tuticorin, thereby making the site a composite one. This move is expected to reduce the unit cost of production.																								The company has posted a 17.58 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 197.14 crore in 2003-04 compared with Rs 167.66 crore in the previous fiscal. It paid out 60 per cent as dividend.

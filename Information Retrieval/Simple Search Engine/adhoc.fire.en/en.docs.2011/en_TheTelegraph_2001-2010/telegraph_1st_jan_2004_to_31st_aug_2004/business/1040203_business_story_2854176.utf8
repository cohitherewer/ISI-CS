 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Tea exports leave a bitter taste
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: Even as the government paints a rosy picture about the revival in the rate of growth in exports, there is bad news in store for the tea industry.																								Official statistics accessed by The Telegraph reveal that the government expects tea exports during 2003-04 to fall by 10 per cent from last years level which was lower than the preceding year. This will mark the third consecutive year in which tea exports have continuously declined. 																								During April-October 2003, 94.63 million tonnes of tea was exported compared with 120.73 million tonnes that was exported during the same period in 2002-03. This represents a sharp drop of 20 per cent in tea exports during the 7-month period. The US invasion of Iraq also took its toll on Indian tea exports.																								Going by this performance, the governments projection for the current year is quite optimistic as it expects tea exports to fall by around 10 per from last year. While 184.4 million tonnes of tea was exported during 2002-03, the government expects 166 million tonnes to be exported during the current financial year. 																								The government expects the Tea Boards marketing efforts to help stem the decline in exports but how successful these turn out to be still remains to be seen at the ground level.																								The loss of the traditional Russian market has been a major blow to Indian tea exports. Besides losing this captive market based on rupee-rouble trade, India tea exports have to face formidable competition from Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Kenya which have now made deep inroads into the international market.																								Commerce minister Arun Jaitley is of the view that the high-cost of production has made Indian tea non-competitive. The official impression is that since Indian tea gardens have to incur a high expenditure on various social welfare needs of their labour which other countries such as Sri Lanka and China do not, they cannot compete with these countries which can sell their tea at lower prices.																								Although the Tea Board has provided some financial assistance to exporters for freight and packaging costs this is not considered adequate. 																								The quality of India tea is another factor that has come into focus with the loss of the captive Russian market. Countries such as Egypt, Iran and even the Russians have had complaints with Indian tea. The presence of a high-level of pesticides has been one reason why Indian exports have suffered. 																								However, there is reason to believe that some of these complaints fall into the non-tariff barrier category.																								Interestingly, some exporters have been complaining that the import of tea from countries such as Sri Lanka for re-exporting has also led to the decline in Indian tea exports. However, the official view is that this tea comes only in small quantities and most of it is blended with Indian green leaf tea to improve the quality.																								Official statistics show that 4.23 million kgs of tea were imported during the first seven months of the current year which is not even one-third of 14.93 million kgs imported during the same period of the previous year.

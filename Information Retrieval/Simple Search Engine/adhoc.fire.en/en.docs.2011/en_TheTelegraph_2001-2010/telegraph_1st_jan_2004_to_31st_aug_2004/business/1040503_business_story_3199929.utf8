 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 End of the paper trail
 Demat has made life easy. Chandralekha Tulal finds out how best to stay on top of the system 																								A large number of investors missed out on the opportunity to ride the IPO boomlet that began with the selloff in a gaggle of public sector companies back in March. One reason for this was the fact that they were totally bemused by the prospect of having to transact in a dematerialised world.																								The paper chase continues but the paper trail is over. Puzzled? Lets try and demystify what happens in this paperless world of investment.																								The first thing to do is to open a demat account: it is virtually the only way you can invest in securities that are now on offer in the primary capital market.																								Under the Depositories Act, 1996, an investor has the option to hold shares either in physical or in dematerialised form. But the capital market watchdog Sebi  has made it compulsory for trades in almost all listed scrips to be settled in the demat mode and announced that the shares of all companies coming out with public issues will have to be compulsorily settled in demat form by all investors. 																								The paperless world has spilled over to the secondary market as well. Maybe, you have a stash of blue-chip stocks tucked away somewhere in the cupboard that you dont know what to do with. Youve been pretty happy with the dividend cheques that come your way but have no idea of how to unlock gains because of the sharp rise in the value of the scrip. You could be sitting on a goldmine whose value you have not been able to unlock.																								The Depositories Act governs the functioning of the two depositories  National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and Central Depository Services Ltd (CDSL). A depository holds securities in electronic form and provides services related to transaction of securities. The depositories interact with the investors through the depository participants (DP), with whom the investors have to open a demat account. Any financial institution complying with the requirements of Sebi can be a DP, but the charges levied on investors differ depending on various factors.																								The benefits of opening a demat account are manifold. An investor can also save on stamp duty as it is not levied on transfer of securities held in demat form. Change of name, address, mandate, registration of power of attorney, and transmission can be effected across companies by a single instruction to the DP. 																								As a result, paperwork and the need to sign multiple transfer deeds is done away with. Another major advantage of having such an account is investors can avail of advances against dematerialised shares.																								Dematerialising is the process of converting securities held in physical form to an equivalent number of securities in electronic form and crediting the same to the investors demat account. The process normally takes about 30 days.																								These securities do not have any certificate numbers or distinctive numbers and are dealt only in quantity. But they are assigned an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), an identification number given at the time of admitting such security in the depository system by Sebi and is common for both NSDL and CDSL.																								A demat account has to be opened in the same combination in which the securities are held in the physical form. If one share certificate is jointly held by A amp; B and another certificate is in the sole name of A, two demat accounts have to be opened  one in the name A amp; B and another in the name of A.

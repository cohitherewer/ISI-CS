 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Phone rental hike to keep villages abuzz
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 23: Monthly phone rentals  both fixed-line and mobile  could rise by the end of the year. But theres a rider: the increase will depend on how things pan out in the computation of the access deficit charge (ADC). 																								The ADC is a charge that telecom operators pay to fund firms offering services in rural and remote areas as part of the social obligations set by the government. The service in these areas is characterised by high infrastructure costs and low returns.																								If the allocations out of the fund created from the ADC is stopped for private basic telecom operators and an additional 5.3 per cent is added to the revenue share they already pay the government, get ready for a rise in phone rentals.																								All issues relating to ADC are now up for debate with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) releasing a consultation paper today on the subject.																								The paper observes that operators have been facing difficulties in reconciling data (and, hence, related payments) and computing incentives for call bypass/grey market calls under the present ADC regime.																								We have reached a conclusion that these matters would be suitably addressed under a regime based on revenue share, said a senior Trai official. 																								Last year, the regulator had proposed that it would consider phasing out ADC funding to basic operators other than BSNL. It was also ready to look at revenue-sharing to fund ADC, which would gradually decline and be phased out within three to five years.																								Based on reasonable assumptions on growth of subscriber base for fixed and mobile services, capital investment and average revenues per user (including revenues from access and long distance services), it would be possible to calculate the revenue share that would fund the ADC, the paper states.																								Trai has sought a response from stakeholders by July 15. The paper has taken a range for BSNLs basic rentals, and thus has reached a range for the proposed ADC revenue share.																								According to Trai, an estimated monthly rental is about Rs 156, which was the amount, based on actual data for 2002-2003, considered for the Interconnect user charge (IUC) Regulation of October 29, 2003.																								The IUC regime stipulates that a payment has to be made by each operator for accepting and delivering a call over each others network. The regulator assumes that some revisions have been made in monthly rentals in a number of tariff schemes, as a result of which the average would have increased. 																								An upper limit of Rs 200 has been taken for monthly rental in the consultation paper. This amount was also used as the basis for IUC regulation notified last year, based on the standard tariff packages.

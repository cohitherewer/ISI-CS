 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Tech party lights up stocks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 13: Infosys Technologies 3:1 bonus announcement brought investors back to the market and helped trigger a rally in technology stocks and old-economy majors that drove up the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) sensex 121 points to 5904.52.																								There was all-round genuine buying with investors, both domestic and foreign, coming out of their hibernation, said a dealer affiliated to Birla Sunlife.																								Others were excited about the 1000 per cent dividend from Hero Honda and Infosys bonanza today, saying the two pay-outs helped firm up sentiment because they were better than market expectations.																								FIIs, which have made hefty net purchases of Rs 955 crore during last week, were believed to be heavy buyers in Grasim, L amp;T, Tata Motors, State Bank and Reliance. 																								The broad-based BSE-100 index also went up 62.58 points to 3146.38 from its previous close of 3083.80.																								Infotech shares even won over the doubting Thomases, who overcame fears of the BPO backlash and the hysteria over job losses in the West to focus on the bright forecasts. The stream of bonuses announced over the past week also tempted them to join the technology party.																								MphasiS, the midcap infotech firm, was the first off the block with the bonus announcement, handing out a 1:1 issue. 																								Azim Premjis Wipro has a similar declaration up its sleeve  to be made on Friday, when its board meets to take stock of its 2003-04 performance. 																								The liberal 3:1 bonus announcement by Infosys did come as a major surprise to market, which expected a 1:1 issue.																								Analysts say the bonus will now align Infosys American Depository Receipts (ADRs) to its domestic equity shares. This is because the company offered a 2:1 bonus for its ADR holders too. Analysts said two ADRs were equal to one ordinary share. This ratio will work out to 1:1, after the bonus announcement made today. 																								The earnings forecast left analysts surprised. Apurva Shah, IT analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, said though the EPS guidance of Rs 224 was in line with expectations, the 30 per cent growth projection for its top-line was better than anything the market had anticipated. 																								In the markets, the volume of business on BSE rose sharply to Rs 2763 crore from Rs 2,020.95 crore. Biocon was the top-traded scrip with a turnover of Rs 585.10 crore followed by Infosys Tech (Rs 298.26 crore) and Satyam.																								In the specified group, 139 shares, including 23 from the indices, registered sharp to moderate gains; 56 ended with losses. Markets closed																								Key stock, foreign exchange and money markets will be closed on Wednesday on account of B. R. Ambedkars birth anniversary.

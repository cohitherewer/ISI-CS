 Thursday, June 03, 2004 Big push to trade talks
ELIZABETH BECKER Washington, June 2: With little fanfare, trade ministers and diplomats have revived the global trade talks that fell apart in Cancun, Mexico, last year, hoping to salvage a framework agreement by the end of July. This week, at a World Trade Organisation session in Geneva, diplomats will debate a proposal from developing nations to reduce or eliminate tariffs on agriculture  the central issue dividing rich countries and poor countries in the negotiations. The goal is to make up for the time lost by the failure of the Cancun talks. If successful, this weeks round of discussions will lead to meetings of trade ministers and senior diplomats set to take place at the end of July at the WTO in Geneva. The so-called Doha round of talks, named for the city in Qatar where the round was opened in 2001 and dedicated to helping the developing world, has been revived since the US and the European Union offered new compromises on the issue of farm subsidies. There are very good atmospherics, said Keith Rockwell, spokesman for the World Trade Organisation. The long-standing problems of agricultural subsidies are slowly but surely lurching towards a solution.A breakthrough has been slow in coming, building over the last five months. Encouraged by support from Robert B. Zoellick, the US trade representative, Pascal Lamy, the European Unions top trade minister, offered last month to end Europes direct agriculture export subsidies despite grumbling by French farm interests.But any breakthrough on agriculture must be matched with serious proposals on industrial tariffs, services and other issues before a framework can be reached. Farmers in the US, Europe, Japan and other wealthy nations have fought against most attempts to cut back the estimated $300 billion in annual subsidies and supports they receive, giving the worlds poorer countries little reason to open their markets further to products and services from the rich nations. In the United States, Novembers presidential election looms large in part because the states most dependent on farm subsidies are also those that have regularly voted Republican in recent elections.

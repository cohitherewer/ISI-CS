 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Bond yields zoom to 6.66% 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 10: Spiralling inflation and soaring global crude prices hung heavy over the bond market, where yields on 10-year government securities hit 6.66 per cent before closing a little lower around 6.53 per cent.																								The worries overshadowed an early rally sparked by Mondays one percentage point cut in the EPF interest rate. The reduction from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent had held out hopes of soft rates continuing despite all indications that an increase in the cost of money is inevitable.																								The EPF cut did help government security prices  which move in a direction opposite the yields  bounce back 30 paise. However, the rally was short-lived as inflation and crude oil concerns took over. The US Federal Reserve is also meeting to take a call on increasing interest rates later today, but a 25-basis point rise is a foregone conclusion for most operators here.																								It was seen today that any spike in the market was used as an opportunity by the players to prune their holdings, a treasury chief from a private sector bank said.																								U. Venkatraman, head of forex and money markets at IDBI Bank, said the situation now is a marked contrast to the previous years, when declining interest gave bond market players fat gains.

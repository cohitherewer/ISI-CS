 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Reliance hikes product prices up to 9 per cent
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 2: Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) today jacked up product prices by 4 per cent to 9 per cent.																								Partially oriented yarn (PoY) will cost 8.6 per cent more at Rs 76 per kg, polyester staple fibre 3.2 per cent more at Rs 65 per kg and polyethylene terephthalte Rs 4 more (PET) at Rs 59.50. 																								Prices of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) have been raised 9.4 per cent to Rs 37.20 per kg and mono-ethylene glycol by around 8 per cent at Rs 43.65 per kg. The difference in rates is over the levels fixed last month.																								In polymers, polyethylene (PE) will be dearer by Rs 3 per kg at Rs 50.20, polypropylene by Rs 2 a kg at Rs 50.85 and poly-vinyl chloride by the same margin at Rs 50.85 a kg.																								However, the prices of linear alklyl benzene (LAB) have been brought down by 3.6 per cent to Rs 53.90 per kg.																								Reliance blamed the increases on firm crude prices, and analysts expect more such revisions over the next few months. Last week, as he took the wraps off third-quarter numbers, vice-chairman Anil Ambani talked about indications of an upturn in the petrochemicals cycle  a pointer that the prices would have to go up soon. 																								The companys net profit jumped 27 per cent to Rs 1374 crore against Rs 1083 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. For the nine-month period, petrochemicals contributed Rs 21,229 crore of the Rs 47,382-crore gross turnover that Reliance racked up. 																								In both petrochemicals and polymers, RIL is the countrys largest manufacturer with a market-share of 51 per cent and 47 per cent, respectively. It is also the leader in polyester intermediates with a share of 80 per cent. 																								The companys huge production units, coupled with its vertically integrated model, have enabled it overcome the cyclical nature of its commodity business. 																								It has, over the past couple of years, focused on speciality products that give it a premium over commodity prices. At present, 61 per cent of its PSF and 33 per cent of polyester filament yarn (PFY) sales come from niche products that fetch a premium of 5-25 per cent.

 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Rupee surges 25 paise
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 19: The possibility of Manmohan Singh becoming the next Prime Minister saw the rupee gain 25 paise against the dollar with government security prices also climbing upwards.																								The rupee, which also drew inspiration from a strong rise in equity values, closed at 45.2250/2350 against the dollar, whereas yields on the benchmark 10-year government security was lower at 5.19 per cent.																								In a fairly active trade at the forex market, the rupee opened firm at 45.31/33 per dollar and hit a peak of 45.17/21, buoyed by the news that Singh is likely to become the next Prime Minister.																								The rupee has thus gained by nearly 40 paise since it took a hit last week due to statements made by some Left parties that generated concerns about the pace of economic reforms. 																								Notwithstanding apprehensions about the direction of the reforms process, exporters sold dollars heavily in the hopes of a stable government at the Centre, leading other banks and participants to unwind long overbought dollar positions, bankers said. This had resulted in the rupee breaching the 46-per-dollar mark at the beginning of this week when there was a bloodbath on the stock exchanges.																								However, sentiments have changed for the better since yesterday when indications became stronger that Singh is likely to be the Prime Minister.																								Analysts said while the appointment of Singh is seen as a positive signal by the markets, outlook on the rupee could remain bullish against the greenback. However, some expect volatility as the sentiment will be news-driven with factors like Common Minimum Programme and the constitution of the new government weighing on the markets minds. Moreover, the observations of international rating agencies, which are expected over the next few weeks, could also affect the rupee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Clamour for WTO sops
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 3: The software and services industry will lobby the government to secure maximum benefits at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meet on the services sector even at the cost of giving in to a few demands of the developed countries.																								The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) will soon meet officials in the commerce and industry ministry to seek greater benefits for the services sector.																								Nasscom chairman Jerry Rao said, India has a three-fold benefit in the services sector: we have a large pool of talent, worldwide trade in services is growing compared to goods, and the cost and administrative issues are less in the services sector enabling greater cross-border business. This has to be exploited by us.																								We should be willing to accept certain difficult conditions while discussing the trade agreements if we can get a higher benefit for the services sector like removing all major barriers for movement of professionals without making major changes in the migration laws, said Rao.																								Rao emphasised that the country does not need to make major changes in the existing laws like introduction of data protection but rather incorporate these aspects in the IT Act. The idea is to give confidence to the world that India is a safe place to do business, said Rao. 																								The apex industry body, however, expressed concern over the frequent circulars issued by various taxation authorities around the country.																								The frequent circulars from taxation authorities create confusion and problems for companies. At least two cases have come to light where foreign companies, which wanted to set up BPO operations in India, developed cold feet after the infamous circular on taxation of captive BPOs came out, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said.

 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Timing of plan fuels speculation
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, April 28: The IBP top-brass was caught off guard by the Indian Oil (IOC) boards decision today to merge IBP, a company it already controls, with itself.																								Officials came to know about the plan along with everyone else  when this information reached the bourses.																								A senior official said the IBP board would meet in Delhi on Thursday to discuss the merger proposal, though he made it clear the process would be a long-drawn affair. Formalities like due diligence and ministry approvals usually take six to seven months, at least. 																								We knew it is under consideration, but never expected it this fast, the official added. What prompted IOC to rush along is not known at this stage. If the ministry or the government changes after elections, the proposal may even be reconsidered, a source said.																								The move follows Indian Oils aggressive bid for the stand-alone petroleum retailer at Rs 1551.10 per share, when the government divested its holding in the first phase of divestment. The stake-purchase was aimed at fending off competition from private and foreign firms eyeing a slice of Indias lucrative fuel-retail market. 																								Reliance is among the companies that have pumped up plans to set up petrol stations along the national highways. IOC, perhaps, wants to pre-empt this by using its 10,000 petrol pumps (including IBPs 2650 petrol pumps) to protect its turf before private players like Reliance and PSU heavyweight ONGC storm in, the source said.																								Analysts expect the merger ratio to be 1.25 shares of IOC for every one share of IBP. IBP shares closed higher at Rs 589.90 on BSE, while IOCs slid to Rs 519. The Centre sold its residual stake in IBP at Rs 620 last month. 																								IBP has cash reserves of Rs 1000 crore. This is a war chest that will strengthen the financial muscle of Indian Oil, which has two nominees on its board.

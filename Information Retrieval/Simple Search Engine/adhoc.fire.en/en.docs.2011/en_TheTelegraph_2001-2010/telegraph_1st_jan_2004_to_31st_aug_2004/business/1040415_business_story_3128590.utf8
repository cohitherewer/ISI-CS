 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Intel first quarter profit zooms
 TERRIL YUE JONES Byte might 																								Los Angeles, April 14: Intel Corp was back in the chips Tuesday, reporting that first-quarter profit nearly doubled as worldwide demand for microprocessors continued to climb. 																								Intel also benefited from a new manufacturing process that allows it to build advanced chips more cheaply. 																								Santa Clara, California-based Intel earned $1.73 billion, or 26 cents a share, up 89 per cent from $915 million, or 14 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Revenue rose 21 per cent to $8.1 billion, from $6.8 billion. Many companies reported lacklustre first-quarter earnings in 2003 as sales slowed in anticipation of the war with Iraq. 																								But Intel executives offered upbeat guidance for the second quarter and the rest of this year. For the quarter ending June 30, Intel forecast revenue between $7.6 billion and $8.2 billion, which would make it the third quarter in a row of strong earnings growth; in the fourth quarter of 2003, profit more doubled to $2.2 billion. 																								Chief financial officer Andy Bryant told analysts that the company had made superb progress in improving gross margins. In the first quarter, they increased to 60.2 per cent from 52 per cent a year ago and are likely to grow to 62 per cent in the second quarter. 																								Intels chips power 80 per cent of the worlds personal computers, and the continued growth in sales reassured some analysts that the recovery in technology spending may be gathering strength. 																								The biggest takeaway is how were comforted by their guidance, said Jonathan Lau, an analyst in New York with Banc of America Securities, which does investment banking with Intel. There were a lot of concerns about the PC market, but their guidance indicates a seasonally normal quarter which a lot of people will be comforted by.																								Tai Nguyen, a San Francisco-based analyst with the Susquehanna Financial Group, said: The indications this year are very strong for the PC market. It looks like the first and second quarter are on the high end of seasonality, so Intel will be entering the second half on a very strong note. 																								The new manufacturing process was introduced late last year. Semiconductors are now produced on wafers that are 300 millimetres wide, up from the previous-generation 200-millimetre wafers, Nguyen said, and the process can pack more than twice as many chips onto a single disk. 																								Intels main business division, computer processors, saw revenue rise to $7 billion from $5.8 billion in the quarter, with operating income increasing to $3 billion from $1.9 billion. 																								But the communications group, which lost $858 million last year, continued to wrestle with its memory chip business. Its operating loss in the first quarter grew to $219 million from $218 million, although revenue increased to $1 billion from $963 million. Intel will work steadily on improving the performance of the communications group, Bryant said. You go through all the investments youre making and make sure you stop investing in areas of low return, he said.																								, adding that the company will also work harder to get more flash memory chips into the marketplace, and continue to invest in manufacturing technologies. 																								Ill be disappointed if we dont show consistent quarter-by-quarter progress toward profitability. 																								Intel shares rose 7 cents to $27.67 on Nasdaq. They fell 41 cents to $27.26 in after-hours trading, following the earnings announcement.

 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Tractor makers have a field day
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Joy Ride 																								New Delhi, July 8: The government today abolished the excise duty or production tax on tractors, aimed to put more money in the hands of farmers and spur agricultural growth, but left the customs duty unchanged.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram has fully-exempted tractor manufacturers from paying the 16 per cent excise, a move that reflects the Congress-led governments first priority is agriculture and investments in the farm sector. The finance minister, however, proposed to maintain the peak rate of customs duty at 20 per cent. 																								The exemption is in keeping with the emphasis the government is placing on developing the agricultural sector and from that perspective it also meets one of the agenda in its common minimum programme, Ernst and Young senior partner Amitabh K. Singh said.																								Industry officials and analysts, however, said it is still unclear if the excise duty exemption is applicable on input costs, which ranges between 11 and 12 per cent, and forms a major cost component. 																								The duty exemption will give a fillip to growth. But it needs to be fine-tuned as it is still not very clear about the excise duty on input costs, Mahindra and Mahindra president, tractor division, K. J. Tavasia said.																								Escorts (Agri Machinery Group) business head Rakesh Chopra said, The net drop in prices would be Rs 5,000-10,000 due to rise in excise duty of steel and also the fact that a Modvat of 11 to 12 per cent, which might be still payable on inputs.																								The manufacturers would not be able to enjoy the full benefit of duty exemption as they would be foregoing the Cenvat credit which is now available to them, added Singh.																								Sales of tractors in the country, the worlds 12th largest economy and Asias third-largest, grew 11.7 per cent to 1.9 lakh units in the previous fiscal year to March 2004 from 1.7 lakh units a year earlier. Officials expect the industry to grow by a sizeable 21 per cent to end the year with sales of 2.3 lakh units.																								This is exactly what we have been asking for, Eicher Group chief executive  group affairs Ramesh Jain said. He said if the 16 percentage point cut in excise duty is being extended to input costs, there would be reduction in prices between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000.

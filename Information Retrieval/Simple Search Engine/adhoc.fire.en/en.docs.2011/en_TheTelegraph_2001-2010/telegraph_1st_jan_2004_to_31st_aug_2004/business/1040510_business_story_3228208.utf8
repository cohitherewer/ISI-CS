 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA On the roll 																								Calcutta, May 9: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is weighing options of procuring wagons under the own-your-own-wagon scheme. The quantum of investment that the steel major is planning to make, however, could not be ascertained.																								The company, which is facing a crisis on account of non-availability of wagons, is also in talks with the Railways as well as wagon manufacturers to resolve the problem. 																								The Railways did not procure adequate number of wagons over the past three years resulting in a steep crisis for every industry. Moreover, wagons are not the kind of products which can be made overnight as and when required, a senior SAIL official said criticising the short-sightedness of the Railways.																								The official noted that both the movement of raw materials and finished products of the company have been seriously affected over the past few months hitting its bottomline directly.																								More than 95 per cent of SAILs incoming and outgoing traffic is by rail.																								In 2003-04, SAILs hot metal production stood at 12.7 million tones which will be increased by another one million tonne in the current financial year.																								The saleable steel production is expected to cross 11.5 million in the current financial year compared with the production of 10.7 million tonnes last year.																								The increase in production will automatically necessitate more wagons to transport the finished products and also bring in raw materials to our four integrated steel plants. Hence, if the wagon crisis is not resolved immediately, the entire production roadmap will be affected, the official explained. According to a conservative estimate, the company will need additional 560 wagons in the current year.																								What is more important is that the company is weighing options to increase its capacity substantially in the next five years. Thus, wagon remains one of the key issues for SAIL to tackle.																								The company needed around 1,480 wagons per day to dispatch finished products from its four plants in 2003-04. SAIL needs more wagons to carry raw materials to its production sites.																								Sources said SAIL has already initiated dialogues with the Railways for additional wagons.

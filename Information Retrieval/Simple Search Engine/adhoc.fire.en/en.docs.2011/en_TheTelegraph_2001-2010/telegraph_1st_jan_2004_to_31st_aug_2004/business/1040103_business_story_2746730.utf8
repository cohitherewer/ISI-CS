 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Thumbs up to boom, leg up to public offers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Mumbai, Jan. 2: The current  bull run is likely to prod the government into hastening  the sale of its residual stake in CMC, IBP, IPCL and Videsh  Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), besides sparking a scramble for IPOs.																								According to market analysts, the government is likely to complete the residual stake sale in these entities before March even as the Centre may offload shares in Dredging Corporation to capitalise on the opportunity provided by the current bull phase. 																								While the government has already appointed advisers for the sale of its stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Gail, market watchers feel that Patni Computers and Biocon from the private sector will emerge as major players in the IPO market.																								According to Prithvi Haldea of Prime, the countrys major database on the primary capital market, if the market stabilises from its present levels, it could lead to a stream of IPOs. It is good in a way as we require a strong secondary market for IPOs to be floated, he said. Haldea, however, added that while the current bull run may lead to companies examining public issues, thus giving a boost to this market, it could also lead to aggressive pricing strategies. 																								Advising investors to be watchful in such a scenario, Haldea said another flip side of a rising IPO market could be the not-so-strong companies taking a sectoral advantage and pricing their issues to attract investors. In such cases, investors may choose the price and not the value, he added.																								According to Prime, in 2003, there were only 15 issues raising Rs 2,194 crore. This is better than 2002 which saw only 6 issues raising Rs 1,981 crore, it said.																								In a recent report, Prime said unlike the past, the IPO boom this time has not quickly followed the secondary boom as the pre-float process has taken too long. Further, the private sector took its time in believing that the public market can offer decent valuations.

 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Tata Motors on Rs 6000cr expansion drive
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Tata: Aiming high																								Mumbai, April 8: Tata Motors plans to spend Rs 6,000 crore in the next five years on a slew of expansion plans. 																								It will raise $500 million (Rs 2,200 crore) from the market to fund some of these initiatives. The balance will be met from internal accruals. Chairman Ratan Tata said the company would raise much of the money through debt with some equity as sweetener.																								He said the current rates are interesting and the outlook for the Indian auto market is good. He pegged the borrowing costs for raising $500 million at 3-3.5 per cent, but added that the company could even consider a zero coupon bond similar to recent offerings by Reliance Energy.																								It is a good time for raising capital and to improve our operational activities, Tata said. The companys earlier rights issue had been 50 per cent unsubscribed. In hindsight, the Tata groups decision to step in to ensure full subscription has been a right decision, he added. 																								Tata said the company was yet to decide on the type of instrument.																								The terms of the issue may not be obtainable in India. Both in terms of coupon rate and premiums are not acceptable to Indian investors, he said when asked about overseas funding plans.																								The companys sales for 2003-04 are expected to top Rs 15,000 crore, a jump of 38 percent against last years Rs 10,837.01 crore.																								Defending his dream project that aims to make a car for Rs 1 lakh, Tata said when the passenger car project was planned there were many who discouraged him from going ahead. 																								There are five million motor cycles purchased each year in India. If you can position a vehicle between a car and a motorcycle, there is a tremendous scope, Tata said.

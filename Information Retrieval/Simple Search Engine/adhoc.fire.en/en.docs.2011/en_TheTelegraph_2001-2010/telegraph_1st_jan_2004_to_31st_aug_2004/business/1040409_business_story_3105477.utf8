 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Ranbaxy wins patent battle against GSK
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, April 8: Ranbaxy Laboratories has prevailed in the patent infringement lawsuit brought by GlaxoSmithKline relating to Ranbaxys Cefuroxime Axetil product, a generic version of GSKs antibiotic Ceftin.																								GSK brought the matter before the US district court for the district of New Jersey in October 2000. The court originally granted GSK a preliminary injunction that initially stopped Ranbaxy from marketing its antibiotic. 																								However, in 2001, Ranbaxy prevailed on its appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Ranbaxy commercially launched its product after that court vacated the preliminary injunction.																								Now, after a full trial, the district court determined that Ranbaxys product does not infringe GSKs patent rights and Ranbaxy is not required to pay any damages to GSK, said a spokesperson for Ranbaxy. 																								Jay R. Deshmukh, vice-president, intellectual property, said, This is a major victory for the company, and we are thrilled with the outcome in this case.																								Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Ranbaxy Laboratories. RPI is engaged in the sale and distribution of generic and branded prescription products in the US healthcare system.																								Ranbaxy sells its products in over 100 countries and has an international portfolio of affiliates, joint ventures and alliances, ground operations in 34 countries and manufacturing operations in seven countries.

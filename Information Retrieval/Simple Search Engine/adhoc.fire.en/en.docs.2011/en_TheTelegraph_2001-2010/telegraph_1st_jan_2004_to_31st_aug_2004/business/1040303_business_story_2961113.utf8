 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 All for a berth																								New Delhi, March 2: The shipping ministry has decided to reduce the charges for container vessels berthing at the ports in Tuticorin, Cochin and Chennai to enable them to compete with neighbouring Colombo.																								Sources say the port charges will be reduced only for the long haul ships that call at these ports but the feeder services which carry containers that are merely being transshipped to Indian ports will have to pay the existing charges. 																								The issue was discussed at a recent meeting of the maritime states development board.																								Traditionally, Colombo has been the preferred port of call for big shipping companies plying on the long-haul routes between ports in the US and Europe and South Asia. These ships drop even Indian cargo at the Sri Lankan port from where it is transshipped to Indian ports on board smaller feeder vessels.																								The slow turnaround time at Indian ports due to the lack of modern equipment and lower draught which prevented big ships from coming into the harbour were the main reasons for modern ships staying away from Indian ports. These larger ships confer greater economies of scale and are preferred by shipping lines the world over as they are more profitable to run. 																								However, the Indian picture has started changing in recent years. The major ports of the country have improved their performance and some foreign companies such as P amp; of Australia have invested in infrastructure at ports such as Chennai and JNPT near Mumbai. This has reduced the turnaround time of ships and dredging has also been undertaken to deepen the harbours. 																								The shipping ministry is of the view that it is now time to start wooing the bigger shipping companies to Indian shores so that port traffic and revenues go up.																								This reduction in vessel charges at the ports is expected to get rid of a disincentive for foreign shipping lines and will enable the Indian ports to come at par with Colombo as far as the cost of berthing is concerned.																								The Tuticorin port chairman is reported to have recommended that the reduction in charges should not be extended to the feeder services in order to discourage transshipment of Indian cargoes. The suggestion has been accepted by the shipping ministry.																								Singapore and Dubai are the other two major ports for transshipment of Indian cargo. With the improvement in the functioning of JNPT, India hopes to further reduce its dependence on Dubai.

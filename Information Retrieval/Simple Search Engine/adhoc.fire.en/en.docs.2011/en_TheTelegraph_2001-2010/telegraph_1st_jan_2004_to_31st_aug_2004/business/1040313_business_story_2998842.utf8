 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Stabiliser bonds on their way
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 12: The first batch of market stabilisation bonds is set to come out in the first quarter of the next fiscal, Union secretary (expenditure and budget) D. Swarup said today.																								After attending the advisory panel meeting chaired by Reserve Bank of India deputy-governor Rakesh Mohan, Swarup said the scheme was in its final stages of approval and the amount to be collected by a government borrowing programme will be in place in the April-June quarter.																								The exact amount is yet to be finalised along with the date for the borrowing programme, he said.																								In its earlier meeting on February 23, the panel had decided that the market stabilisation fund, being set up to mop up surplus liquidity from the system, would have a ceiling of Rs 60,000 crore. Its interest rates would be linked to market rates. 																								The Reserve Bank of India had then said the fund would have a marginal impact on revenue and fiscal deficits of the government.																								The RBIs working group on instruments of sterilisation had recommended setting up of a market stabilisation fund from the governments public account.																								It had recommended issuing stabilisation bonds from this fund, which would not impact the fiscal deficit. The governments liability would be limited to payment of interest, which in turn will have a marginal impact on revenue and fiscal deficits, the cost of which would figure separately in the Union budget.

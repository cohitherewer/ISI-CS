 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 SAIL forced into output cut
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Slow-down signal																								New Delhi, March 11: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has been forced to cut down production at its Rourkella, Durgapur and Bhilai plants even as steel users are on the war-path demanding price cuts and higher supplies.																								While Rourkella and Durgapur have cut down production by an average of 15 per cent, Bhilai has slashed it by almost 25 per cent because supplies of high-grade imported coal from Australia has virtually stopped. 																								Top steel ministry officials said they were worried about the situation and would ask SAIL to tackle the situation on a war footing.																								Rourkella Steel Plant (RSP) has reduced coke pushings in its coke ovens from 326 a day to 275, while Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) has reduced to 260-265 from 315. When less coke is fed into ovens, less coke goes into blast furnaces and as a result less hot metal flows out. 																								Bhilai, which is the worst hit, has decided to use the opportunity to shut down certain units for maintenance work. A SAIL spokesperson confirmed that the company was facing some problems but said they were trying to sort it out and it was not too serious in nature. 																								The crisis began in February, when the Australian firms supplying coal to SAIL under a long term contract decided to use a clause called force majuer to suspend supplies in the face of rising coke prices. 																								SAIL refused to buy coke at spot prices that were higher than the long term contract prices at which they had been buying the essential raw material. 																								This did not have any immediate impact. However, the company could not sort out matters and an acute crisis eventually developed this month ... Bhilai has just two days stock instead of a seven-day stock now, DSP and RSP have similar two to three day stocks, officials said. 																								With supplies of high-grade imported coke virtually halted, SAIL, said sources, has been forced to bring in rationing of coke for its steel plant. 																								Imported coke is blended with local coal ... once the percentage of high-grade imports is lowered which has now been done because of the rationing, the ash content goes up and this reduces the efficiency levels in the plant, explained a SAIL executive director.																								SAIL is the biggest supplier of steel in the country and produces about 12 MT or about half the countrys steel production. Cut-backs by its plants immediately impact the supply situation in the entire country.																								Though steel firms have promised to hold the price line and even reduce them in some cases, retail prices have remained sticky. 																								Officials fear that short supplies will see retailers resorting to profiteering and charging higher prices from small customers.

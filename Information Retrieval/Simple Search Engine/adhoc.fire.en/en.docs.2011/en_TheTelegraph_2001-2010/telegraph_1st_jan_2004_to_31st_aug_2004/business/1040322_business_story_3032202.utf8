 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Sun Pharma to strengthen research muscle
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, March 21: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries will add two research centres to its existing facilities in Mumbai and Baroda for Rs 80 crore. The investment is being funded through internal accruals.																								The research and development units will work on drug delivery systems and new chemical entities to develop products mainly for the US and European markets. 																								The estimated $18-billion US generic market is expected to grow to $38 billion by 2010.																								The research facilities are being expanded four times the present capacity, chairman and managing director Dilip Shanghvi said. We will also add 200 employees in the new centres in the next 18 months, he added. 																								Currently, the company employs 3000 people, of whom 300 are involved in research activities.																								The Mumbai centre will have 250,000 sq ft of built-in space, while that in Baroda will have 60,000 sq ft.																								Sun, which manufactures speciality bulk actives and formulations in the country, markets its products in the US through the Detroit-based Caraco in which it has a 60 per cent stake. The company, however, files for its products through the FDA-approved Indian facility.																								International markets and research form our growth catalyst, said Shanghvi. We expect our business in the domestic market to show healthy growth. The funds will be reinvested in research and international business across regulated and unregulated markets.																								Sun also has an approval to market products in Australia.																								The countrys fifth largest pharma company expects to end the current financial year at Rs 1000 crore against Rs 850 crore last year.																								While the industry has seen negative growth in the last couple of years, Sun has been growing at twice the industry rate.																								With the new centres operational, Sun expects its exports to constitute over 50 per cent of its turnover in the next three years. Currently, exports contribute 30 per cent of the turnover.																								The current formulation capacity is around 6,500 tablets per year, while bulk actives are manufactured in 171 reactors with a capacity of 378 kilo litres per year.

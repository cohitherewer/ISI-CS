 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 More powers to dig out bad loans
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 8: Banks are expected to benefit from the union budget announcement to amend certain portions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 in a way that speeds up recovery of sticky assets.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram has put an additional responsibility on those public sector banks which are sponsors of regional rural banks (RRBs). Henceforth, the sponsor bank will be held squarely responsible for the performance of RRBs under its control. 																								The finance minister also proposes to set up a task force for co-operative bank reforms. The finance minister said in his budget speech that the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 has been upheld by the Supreme Court, except Sub-Section (2) of Section 17. 																								In the wake of the judgement, many banks have pointed out practical difficulties likely to arise in ferreting out the non-performing assets (NPAs). It is proposed to amend the relevant provisions of the Act to appropriately address the Supreme Courts concerns on a fair deal to borrowers while, at the same time, ensuring that the process is not delayed or hampered. 																								Related amendments to the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, if necessary, will also be made, he said. 																								The announcement in the area of the Securitisation Law is a positive move where the amendments introduced will better enable lending banks to recover distressed assets from delinquent borrowers, However, contrary to expectations, there is no mention of guidelines on how foreign banking branches in India can be turned into subsidiaries, said Ian Gomes, country managing director  India, KPMG.																								Section 17 (2) of the Securitisation Act which has been kept aside by the Supreme Court says that a borrower has to submit 75 per cent of their total dues before the debt recovery tribunal in case they want to make fresh appeal. 																								Bankers have demanded that the borrowers should at least deposit 25 per cent of their dues before the DRTs for making a fresh appeal. The sticky assets in the Indian banking sector is nearly Rs 1 lakh crore and the banks are aggressively pursuing to recover these assets.																								On RRBs, the finance minister said: RRBs that adopt new governance standard and abide by the prudential regulations will get recast funds.

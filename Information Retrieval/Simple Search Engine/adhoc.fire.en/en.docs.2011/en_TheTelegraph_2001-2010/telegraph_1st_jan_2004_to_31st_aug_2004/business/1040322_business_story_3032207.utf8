 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Mitsubishi gears up to launch Galant in India
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Power drive 																								Calcutta, March 21: Mitsubishi Motors may launch its executive-class sedan Galant in India through its partner, Hindustan Motors (HM). 																								Mitsubishi has done extensive market surveys to ascertain the viability of an executive-class sedan. It has encouraging feedback to support the plan, sources said.																								Mitsubishi already has a midsize sedan, Lancer, introduced about five years back, through Hindustan Motors.																								In terms of power and comfort, Galant scores over Lancer. While the Lancer is a 1498 cc car, Galant is fitted with a 1997 cc engine. 																								Mitsubishis reported plan to bring a new model to India coincides with the rollout of many executive-class sedans here by global auto majors. More important, it comes when Lancer sales declined about 33 per cent in 2003 compared with that of the previous year. Only 3000 units were sold last year against 4,500 in 2002.																								Auto industry analysts blamed stiff competition for flagging sales. The marketing has to be improved too, sources said. The company, however, expects the new Lancer variant launched few months back, to turn the tide.																								As things stand now, HM should sell at least 5000 units of Lancer this year and more in the next, sources said.																								Analysts have pointed out that Lancer faces stiff competition from Toyota Corolla, Chevrolet Optra and Skoda Octavia, which are fitted with more powerful engines. 																								However, neither the GM brass or HM officials would confirm plans to get Galant into the Indian market soon.

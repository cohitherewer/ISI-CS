The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Korean firm to swallow Parrys
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 16: The Murugappa group is exiting the confectionery business by selling its 60.39 per cent stake in Parrys Confectionery to Lotte Confectionery Company of Korea at Rs 283.12 per share.																								While Rs 64 crore is expected to flow to the Murugappa group, Lotte Confectionery will also announce an open offer to the shareholders of Parrys to mop up 20 per cent of their stake. Lotte will, therefore, have to shell out around Rs 108 crore.																								Parrys Confectionery today informed the stock exchanges that its promoter Murugappa group, represented by EID Parry India, has indicated their intention to divest their holding in the company in favour of Lotte. 																								Parrys added that it has entered into a tripartite agreement with EID Parry India and Lotte in order to facilitate the divestment of over 60 per cent held by the promoter group.																								We believe the selling is in the best interests of the company and its stake holders, said M. V. Subbiah, Parrys Confectionery chairman.																								Parrys Confectionery, which is part of the Rs 4,200-crore Murugappa group, commenced operations in 1914 from a unit in Tamil Nadu and later consolidated its presence to emerge as the countrys largest manufacturer of sugar boiled confectionery. For the second quarter of the current year ended September 30, the company posted sales close to Rs 25 crore.																								Last year in Parrys embarked on a financial reorganisation by dipping into the share premium account to clean up the balance sheet. The news led to the in Parrys scrip hitting a 52-week high of Rs 265.80, after which it finished lower at Rs 241.30.																								The agreement will become effective after getting relevant government approval, which is expected to take three to four months. Till such time the payment is received there would be no change in the board of directors of the company, sources said, adding that even after a full takeover by Lotte, a member of the Murugappa group would be on the board.

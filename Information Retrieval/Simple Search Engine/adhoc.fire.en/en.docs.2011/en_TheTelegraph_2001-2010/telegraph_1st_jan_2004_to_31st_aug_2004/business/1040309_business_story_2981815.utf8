 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Junk your PC if its a three-year-old
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Time to log out 																								New Delhi, March 8: If the personal computers at your office are more than three years old, dump them. Thats the wisdom of PC makers  and this has nothing to do with their efforts to ramp up sales.																								The computer makers say it is time to upgrade after three years because the costs of running and maintaining company-owned PCs have reached an economic inflection point.																								It is a lot cheaper to upgrade to newer hardware and software after the slew of sops announced in the interim budget. Currently, the impact on IT support costs is huge owing to higher frequency of help desk calls, more occurrences of support personnel touching the units, extended warranty costs and inventory costs of spare parts.																								At a meeting today on PC Lifecycle Management and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), Mike Renzulli, TCO/Lifecycle marketing manager, HP Services, said, The last major wave of PC upgrades was in 1999 due to Y2K concerns. Since then, companies have been delaying corporate PC migration plans because of cost concerns and a perceived lack of urgency.																								It is now 2004 and we have reached the point where the TCO of such legacy client computers has surpassed upgrade costs. Maintaining the status quo can eat up as much as 80 per cent of PC ownership costs, and we believe it is time to consider upgrading.																								Renzulli says the costs of replacing old PCs today are significantly lower as prices have dropped 43 per cent since the Y2K refresh.																								In addition, older PCs have several inherent factors that caused TCO to balloon over the past two years, including lost productivity due to downtime from security breaches and application conflict errors, more hourglass-staring time from PCs straining to support todays more powerful new business applications and crippled functionality because of outdated drivers and operating systems.																								With over 40 per cent of corporate PCs still running on older processors and operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 98 and Windows NT, Renzulli is seeing an increased sense of urgency in IT managers. 																								Security in particular is top-of-mind for many CIOs today. In 2002, three viruses alone (Nimda, Code variants, SirCam) cost companies $4.41 billion; this years newer viruses and worms, such as MyDoom, are sure to top that, said Renzulli.																								Also tipping the balance are productivity gains from newer processor and operating systems combinations, such as Intel Pentium 4 and Windows XP, that allow users to perform routine tasks 21 per cent faster than with Pentium III and Microsoft Windows 2000.

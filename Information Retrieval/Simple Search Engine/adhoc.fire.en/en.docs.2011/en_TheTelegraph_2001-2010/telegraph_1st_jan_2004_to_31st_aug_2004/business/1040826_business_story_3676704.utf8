 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi Aug 25: The Planning Commission has set up 17 consultative groups to consider ideas and inputs from a variety of sources, including the non-governmental sector, while formulating the mid-term appraisal of the Tenth Five Year Plan.																								These groups will provide guidance in the selection of key issues and emerging problems for preparing inputs for the mid-term appraisal. Each group will be chaired by a member of the Planning Commission and have subject experts from government and non-governmental agencies as members.																								For the first time, trade unions are also being invited to join in the process. This is being done to try and build consensus on sensitive issues such as labour reforms.																								These groups will also assess the existing institutional delivery mechanism in the areas concerning the subject of the consultative group and will give specific recommendations or suggestions to make it more effective.																								The consultative groups have been set up in the area of social inclusion and empowerment, labour and employment, poverty elimination and rural employment, environment and forest, agriculture, water resource, culture, higher and technical education, elementary and secondary education and literacy, youth affairs and sports, transport sector, tourism sector, industry, urban infrastructure, external sector and energy.																								The consultative groups will have the power to co-opt and associate professionals and domain experts into the group. They will also have powers to set up sub-groups and steering committees of officials both from central and state governments as well as non-officials to finalise views on specific areas.																								The ministries or departments concerned with the subject of the consultative group can be invited by the group to make presentations before the group on issues in their areas of concern requiring immediate attention of the government.																								The consultative groups will consider the appraisal notes prepared by the ministries or departments concerned. They will also review the draft material to be prepared by the commission on the subject and give critical advice for improvement.

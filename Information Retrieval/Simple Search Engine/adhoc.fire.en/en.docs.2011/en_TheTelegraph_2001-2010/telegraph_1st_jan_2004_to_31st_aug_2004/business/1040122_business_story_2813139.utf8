 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Oil majors in Lanka quest
 S. P. S. PANNU				 Mega plans 																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: Four Asian oil majors, including Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), are in the race for the Sri Lankan retail petroleum market with global majors Shell and Caltex having dropped the idea of setting up shop in the Emerald Island.																								Sources say that apart from HPCL and BPCL, the Malaysian national oil company, Petronas, and the Chinese national oil company are in the fray for the petrol filling stations that have been put up for sale by Sri Lanka.																								The four companies have submitted tentative bids and HPCL is reported to have bid the highest with BPCL in the second spot. 																								The tentative bids, which came along with the expression of interest, have been followed up by a due diligence exercise of the available assets by these four companies. The final financial bids are expected to come in soon.																								Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has already emerged as a significant player in Sri Lanka by taking over 120 petrol pumps from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. It will ultimately be paying around $75 million for its 100-odd petrol pumps and HPCL is reported to have benchmarked its bid with this price.																								IOC also plans to have another 150 franchisee retail outlets and is negotiating with various private dealers. The Sri Lankan government wants to have a third company to compete with CPC and IOC.																								Sources say the initial thinking in Sri Lanka was that the third company should not be an Indian company as it could lead to a dominance by a single country.																								Although Shell and Caltex were attractive propositions, the two companies are not interested in entering the Lanka market. 																								Senior Indian oil sector officials said that the global oil majors have shied away from investing in Sri Lanka because of the relatively small size of the Lankan market and the political instability on the island.																								Although Sri Lanka would prefer a company from a country other than India in view of the IOC presence, the price that it gets for its assets will also play a key role. Sources say that the HPCL and BPCL bids are way above their Malaysian and Chinese counterparts. But these are only tentative bids and the final bids will make the picture clearer.																								Sri Lanka consumes around 3.5 million tonnes of petroleum products out of which it has to import around 2 million tonnes.																								IOC has also taken up on lease the huge oil tanks in Trincomalee, which were set up by the British during World War II but are still in good shape because of the high quality steel used.																								IOC plans to use this tankage in the long-run to provide bunker fuel for long-haul ships as Sri Lanka straddles a busy sea route. 																								The proximity of IOCs Chennai refinery will enable it to easily evacuate products to Sri Lanka and the India oil major is keen to exploit this advantage.

 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Rate of inflation shoots up to 6.16%
																								New Delhi, July 16 (PTI): The rate of inflation rose to 6.16 per cent for the week ended July 3, mainly due to costlier aviation turbine fuel and manufactured items, including edible oils, despite government assurance that price rises would be restrained.																								The point-to-point inflation rate was up 0.07 per cent to touch a 24-week high of 6.16 per cent from 6.09 per cent in the previous week, even as food articles prices fell mainly due to cheaper fruits and vegetables. The index was 5.15 per cent a year ago.																								Acknowledging that an unchecked inflation could cause all- round damage, the Centre had said it was committed to do everything possible to keep prices under control for which it would work closely with the RBI.																								The WPI, however, was down 0.2 per cent to 184.4 points during the latest reported week and it was 173.7 points in the previous year period. The government revised the inflation rate to 4.6 per cent for the week ended May 8 compared with a provisional level of 4.2 per cent.																								The final WPI stood corrected at 181.8 points at the beginning of the second week of May against 181.1 points.																								The index of mass consumption of primary articles fell 0.6 per cent to 185.2 points due to cheaper food articles, even as non-food articles prices shot up; the index was 181.8 points a year ago.

 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Tatas drive home with Daewoo
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Space for more 																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: Tata Motors today acquired the truck-making arm of Daewoo for Rs 465 crore, a move analysts at credit rating firms described as a step to reduce its dependence on the cyclical domestic market.																								Daewoo Commercial Vehicle, spun off from the bankrupt Daewoo Motor in December 2002, is the second-biggest maker of heavy vehicles in South Korea with a market share of 26 per cent and an annual production capacity of 20,000 units.																								This is indeed a major step for Tata Motors and a milestone for the group in its quest for globalisation, said group chairman Ratan Tata. We are excited as it gives us a product range and an entry into the commercial vehicle market in the advanced countries where we operate, he said.																								Analysts said Daewoos product range would complement Tata Motors medium-size trucks and provide a technology platform to develop high-end vehicles.																								The acquisition will add 4-5 per cent to the turnover, and as much to the companys profits, said an analyst. The price paid by the Tatas is considered reasonable.																								Higher exports would help the auto-maker beat the effects of cyclical swings in the domestic auto market and boost growth, the analyst added.																								Earlier, Tata said the buyout will pay off within two to three months, as the Daewoo arm is a profitable venture. The Korean auto-maker has reported an operating profit of 12 billion won in the first half of 2003.																								The buyout will add to Tata Motors growing international profile, following a deal with Britains MG Rover Group in December to sell 1,00,000 Indica cars in Europe over the next five years. 																								The initial response of the European market has been poor, similar to that when Indica was launched in the country. Indica sales, however, improved after the launch of a better version in 2001. 																								Tata Motors, the countrys leading maker of buses and utility vehicles, plans to triple its share of exports in sales to 15-20 per cent in five years.																								In 2002-03, the auto-maker has exported 3,528 vehicles, earning export revenue worth Rs 458 crore.

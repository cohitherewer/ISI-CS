		 Monday, January 12, 2004  Q amp;A				 Better bet hunt
																																																																																													My father, 64, had invested Rs 102,000 in post office monthly income scheme in 1998. He is earning 13 per cent on the deposit. Should he reinvest in the same scheme when it matures in April? Are there better fixed-income instruments?																																																																													S. Basu, Calcutta
																																																																																													A better option perhaps is Life Insurance Corporations Varishtha Bima Yojana, which pays 9 per cent. What your dad could also consider is the Dada-dadi bond that the government announced on Friday. Its going to be launched in April, and will pay better than similar products.																																					Money in the locker																																																																																															Please give details of Varishtha Bima Yojana. For how many years does the money get locked in? What is the minimum amount that could be invested?																																																																													Zair, Calcutta
																																																																																													The scheme locks up your fund for 15 years, and starts paying pension a month after you have invested in it. You could, however, borrow from LIC after three years of deposit at 10.5 per cent. The maximum amount that you could draw from the scheme is Rs 2,000 in monthly pension. The minimum investment is Rs 31,980, which is going to give you a pension of Rs 3,000 per year.																																					Investment opportunities																																																																																															I am a retired army officer and a senior citizen, earning Rs 160,000 in annual pension. I earn around Rs 85,000 from investments now, but they are maturing by December. Please advise in what other instruments I could invest around Rs 6 lakh.																																																																													Name withheld
																																																																																													It appears that you have been investing in fixed-income products only, and a natural extension of your portfolio would be the Dada-dadi bond. It appears that you have invested in all the safe haven instruments, including LICs Varishtha Bima, and created a sound but an illiquid portfolio. 																																																																																													You should invest a small portion of our funds, say Rs 1 lakh, in mutual funds. MIPs, or schemes that invest up to 25 per cent of their corpus in shares, are a good option. If you are completely risk-averse, you could consider debt schemes  they may not outperform assets like post office MIS, but would keep your funds liquid.

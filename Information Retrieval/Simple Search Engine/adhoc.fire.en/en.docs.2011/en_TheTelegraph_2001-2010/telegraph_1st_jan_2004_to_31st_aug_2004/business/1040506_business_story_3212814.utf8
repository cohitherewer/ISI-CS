 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Gail ready to pay penalty for supply slip
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Banerjee in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 5: In a bold initiative, Gail (India) Ltd is for the first time introducing a supply or pay clause in its new gas pipeline projects as a major incentive to customers. The company is ready to pay a penalty to its customers if it slips at any point in meeting its commitment to supply a particular quantity of gas.																								Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee said today that the company was able to ensure a 99.99 per cent availability of gas through its entire 4,600-km pipeline network in 2003-04 and it would like to leverage this strength to gain more customers.																								The supply or pay clause would also be applicable for customers who buy the liquefied natural gas (LNG) that is being imported at the Dahej terminal. 																								Banerjee said Gail would be able to maintain the current 14.5 per cent year-on-year increase in net profit during 2003-04 in 2004-05 as well. The growth could even be higher as Gail was getting market prices for the five million tonnes of LNG that is being imported at Dahej, he added.																								On the new projects taken up by Gail, he said the Rs 1,416-crore Dahej-Uran pipeline was under fast track implementation and would be completed by May 2005. Bids for the 470-km pipeline project were under evaluation and negotiations with Shell are in an advanced stage for capacity booking.																								He also said discussions were under way with Reliance Industries, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Cairn Energy over the proposed Kakinada to Uran pipeline project. This pipeline would transport gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin to Uran on the west coast. 																								He said Gail was willing to offer a tariff to these companies for transporting the gas that would be the same or lower than what it would cost them if they laid their own pipeline. The project cost would be over Rs 1,500 crore.																								Banerjee said the capacity of the Dahej import terminal would be expanded to 17.5 million standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD). Another 10 MMSCMD of gas would be supplied by Shell through its Hazira terminal. Reliance was expected to supply 40 MMSCMD of gas from 2006-07 onwards.																								Gail also expects to get access to the 5 trillion cubic feet gas find in Myanmar. Gail and ONGC have a 30 per cent stake in this field with Korean companies owning the remaining 70 per cent. The transportation of these additional quantities of gas would provide new business opportunities for Gail.

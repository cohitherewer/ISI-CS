 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 London court asks BoI to pay 82 million
																								London, March 19 (Reuters): Londons High Court on Friday ordered Bank of India (BoI) to pay around $82 million in compensation over fraudulent transactions with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).																								Judge Nicholas Patten said Bank of Indias London-based manager K. L. Samant knew that BCCIs deposits with Indias sixth-largest commercial bank were being used to defraud BCCI creditors and that Bank of India must bear responsibility for the managers actions.																								BCCI collapsed in 1991 owing over $16 billion in the worlds biggest banking fraud. BCCIs liquidator, Deloitte, is currently pursuing a separate lawsuit of nearly 1 billion ($1.8 billion) against Bank of England over its regulatory role in the collapse.																								Bank of India denied knowing what was going on but Patten launched a scathing attack on its oversight procedures and said that allowing it to duck responsibility would set a precedent.																								It would allow banks such as Bank of India, which choose to rubber-stamp the recommendations of their senior managers without ensuring that all proper diligence has been carried out, simply to side step liability by relying on ineptitude.																								The case focused on six BCCI deposits with Bank of India between 1981 and 1985.																								Patten awarded damages of $43.2 million to Deloitte, which along with interest of $39 million, resulted in a total sum of just over $82 million.

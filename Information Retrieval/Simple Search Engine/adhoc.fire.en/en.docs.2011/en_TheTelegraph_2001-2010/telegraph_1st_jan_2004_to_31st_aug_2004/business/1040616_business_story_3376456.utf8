 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Uco to sell Reliance, UTI mutual schemes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Shetty: Branching out																								Calcutta, June 15: Uco Bank plans to increase its fee-based income through sale of insurance and mutual fund products this fiscal. The bank has approached UTI Mutual Fund and Reliance Mutual Fund with a proposal. It already has a similar tieup with Life Insurance Corporation.																								The higher income will help the bank tide over its non-interest expenses.																								This year we will maximise our fee-based income by selling insurance and mutual fund products, expanding depository services through our branch network and by garnering fresh corporate agency business, chairman and managing director V. P. Shetty told shareholders at the banks first annual general meeting held here today.																								The bank will also diversify into new businesses like risk hedging through interest rate swaps, options and futures  both in rupee and foreign currencies.																								The purpose of the drive is to attain a level of fee-based income that will either fully cover or overtake the entire non-interest expenses on a sustainable basis, Shetty said.																								During the current fiscal, the bank plans to attain a minimum deposit growth of 17 per cent, with 30 per cent of the incremental deposit in the form of low-cost deposits. Quite a few attractive savings-oriented deposit schemes are on the anvil, Shetty said.																								The bank sees credit deployment growing at a high rate of 27 per cent compared with a deposit growth rate of 17 per cent. To achieve the advances target, incremental advances to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore has been budgeted.																								Thrust will be on agricultural credit. We have already chalked out strategies for each of our rural and semi-urban branches to garner Rs 2 crore of additional business during the current fiscal, Shetty said.																								Replying to shareholders queries on the non-performing assets of the bank, Shetty said the bank is taking steps to bring down the NPA level to below 2 per cent by the end of the current financial year. The current NPA level is a shade over 3 per cent.																								He also assured shareholders that an extraordinary general meeting would be called soon to induct four shareholder directors on the banks board.																								The bank is also implementing core-banking solutions at 200 of its select branches. It will take another 18 to 24 months to implement the package, he said.

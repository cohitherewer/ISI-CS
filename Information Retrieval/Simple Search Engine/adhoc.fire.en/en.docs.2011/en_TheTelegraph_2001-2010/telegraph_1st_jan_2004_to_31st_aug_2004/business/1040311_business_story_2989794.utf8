 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 NHPC chided for Dulhasti delay
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, March 10: The Union power ministry has pulled up National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) for its failure to commission the 390-megawatt Dulhasti hydro-power project, resulting in a loss of Rs 5 crore a day and an increase in the project cost from Rs 1,260 crore to more than Rs 4,000 crore.																								The cost of power from this unit is likely to beat the tariff fixed by Dabhol Power Company at Rs 5 per unit.																								The Dulhasti hydroelectric project in Jammu and Kashmir was scheduled to be commissioned by December 2003. The project, which was launched 15 years ago, has not been completed in spite of commitment made by the corporation.																								The Prime Ministers Office had declared this project as a project of national importance and all necessary help was given by the Centre. In spite of the fact that the progress of this project is being monitored by the Prime Ministers office, it has not been completed as per the revised schedule, said an official in the power ministry.																								The delay has also led to hike in costs at the rate of Rs 10.25 crore per megawatt. As a result, power from this project will be generated at more than Rs 5 per unit, said sources in NHPC.																								Meanwhile, Powergrid Corporation of India Ltd has already set up the transmission line, which is lying unused causing loss to that corporation due to delay in commissioning by NHPC.																								The Dulhasti project was given for execution on a turnkey basis to a French consortium in 1989 with the target of completion by 1994. 																								However, in 1992, the consortium sought an extension by a few months and also payment of an additional claim amounting to about Rs 10 crore. However, NHPC did not agree.																								The French consortium abandoned the project in July 1992. From 1992 to 1997, parleys were held between the Indian and French governments to sort out the issue.																								According to an agreement reached between the two countries, the civil contractor of the French consortium was allowed to withdraw from the project.

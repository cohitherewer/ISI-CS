The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 NTPC float by September
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 9: Encouraged by the response of its recent international bond issue, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is likely to go public later this year, probably in August or September.																								The success of the recent public issues has encouraged the central power utility to think about tapping the market.																								A senior official said the response to the international bond issue had been overwhelming.																								The $200-million bond issue was oversubscribed one-and-a-half times and the Asian markets responded very well. The European markets accounted for 47 per cent of the subscription, Asian markets 45 per cent and the rest 8 per cent, he said.																								The bonds, to be listed on the Singapore stock exchange, would mature by 2011 and the interest would be 5.5 per cent.																								NTPC wants to increase its installed capacity to 40,000 MW by 2011 from the present 21,000 MW and for that purpose it would need more than Rs 50,000 crore. The company had tied up with LIC to borrow Rs 7,000 crore over the next four years for its ongoing projects. The proceeds of the bond issue would be used for the same purpose.																								Under the Tenth Plan, the company hopes to add 15688 MW of power. Some of the new projects to be implemented in this period are UnchaharIII, KahalagaonII (phase-II), SipatI and II, North Karanpura and others.																								NTPC is planning to go public later this year, probably in August-September, to gather roughly 5 per cent of its equity capital of Rs 7,812 crore. 																								However, no final decision has been taken on the size, price or timing of the issue. We are talking to the merchant bankers, he said.																								The official added that considering the multi-dimensional opportunities in the energy sector, NTPC would adopt a multi-pronged strategy for capacity addition through greenfield sites, expansion of existing stations, takeovers and joint ventures.																								NTPC also plans to venture into the distribution business for which it has already floated a separate company.																								We have also drawn up investment plans for the LNG terminal for which bids have been invited from the international parties. The last date of submission of the bids is April 27, the official added.																								The corporation also plans to set up power plants abroad and invest in coal mining and washeries. It has also floated a separate subsidiary for entering the hydel power generation.

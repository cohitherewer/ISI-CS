 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rao: Watchful																								New Delhi, March 9: Insurance agents doling out commissions to prospective customers had better watch out! The insurance watchdog has bared its teeth.																								The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) is planning to crack down on errant insurance agents breaking its ban on these inducements  which is known as rebating in insurance parlance.																								Rebating is totally against the law. We will definitely take action against agents who are offering rebates in cash or kind if we come across such incidence. Also, the insurance companies will be penalised who have employed these agents, IRDA chairman C. S. Rao said on the sidelines of an international insurance summit organised by General Insurance Corporation.																								Some insurance agents have been flouting the rules by offering rebates to boost sales of insurance products. If such cases are detected by us, it might even lead to cancellation of agency licence, he added. 																								There have been incidents of agents offering special rebates in the form of colour TVs and other freebies to lure consumers in some parts of the country.																								The remedy should come from policyholders. If they dont demand for their cut, the agent will not have to give one, Rao said, adding that agents who are offering rebates may lack better quality service. For a long-term relationship, it is prudent to exercise your options with honesty, said Rao.																								IRDA also said it would come up with guidelines on corporate governance for insurance companies. These guidelines will help insurers act in a more transparent and regulated manner. 																								The regulator thumbed down the general insurance industrys demand for another review of the rates of agency commission and brokers remuneration. 																								The guidelines have been already reviewed. I dont think there is any need or scope for further review, he said. 																								The regulatory body had come up with a clear guideline of agency commission and brokers remuneration last week, which allowed companies with a capital of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 3 crore to bargain for a special discount of 5 per cent when they cover their risks directly with a general insurer. In an attempt to develop insurance linkages within developing countries, the regulator also said there was a need to develop a set of standards, which can be uniformly followed by all developing countries. 																								On whether the government should ask FIs to invest in the ongoing public issues, Rao said, I dont know what are the directives given to them. But if they comply and restrict to investment norms stated in the Insurance Act, let them do it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Date set for H-Ps share purchases in Digital
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 12: Digital GlobalSoft told stock exchanges today the bidding to determine the price for acquisition of the publicly-held shares in the company by its principal Hewlett Packard (H-P) was likely to begin at 10 am on January 19 and close at 3 pm on January 23.																								H-P reiterated that it was willing to pay up to Rs 750-a-share, but might refuse to buy the shares if offered at a higher price. Analysts are, however, hopeful that H-P would shell out more than Rs 750-a-share to buy out the public holding in Digital.																								Foreign institutional investors are tightening their grip on Digital. They have increased their combined holding to 25 per cent from 20.5 per cent over the last three months. Indian institutions, too, have raised their stake marginally. The combined institutional stake in Digital has gone up to 35.74 per cent at the end of December from 31 per cent three months ago.																								The increase in institutional holding is bad news for H-P, which holds 50.56 per cent in Digital, says an analyst. Institutions have greater bargaining power than individuals. The rise in institutional holding puts pressure on H-P, which may have to pay more that Rs 750 per share to gain 100 per cent control of Digital, he said.																								What is more, foreign institutions continue to buy the stock from the market, even as it is trading higher than Rs 750. In another despatch to bourses, Digital said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Espana, which held a substantial stake, had acquired 89,177 shares on January 7. The company now owns 17.43 lakh shares, which represents 5.22 per cent of Digitals equity capital. It has more than doubled its holding over the last three months. Other key investors in the stock are Templeton Mutual Fund, Citigroup Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs, among others.

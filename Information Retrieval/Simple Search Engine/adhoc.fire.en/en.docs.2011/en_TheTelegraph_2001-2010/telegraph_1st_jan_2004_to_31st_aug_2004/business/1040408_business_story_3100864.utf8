 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Skoda hatches plan for Octavia hatchback
 SRINJOY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, April 7: The Indian unit of Czech carmaker Skoda Auto may introduce a hatchback or the weekend version of its Octavia sedan to boost its presence in the lower-end premium segment.																								Octavia Combi, positioned in a segment where there is an increasing competition, will be priced between Rs 11.5-13.5 lakh, nearly a lakh higher than the existing versions. 																								Skoda, a unit of German automaker Volkswagen AG, has been in India since November 2001 when it began assembling and selling the Octavia sedan in two versions  the 1.9-litre, 90 bhp turbo diesel and 2.0-litre, 111 bhp petrol version. 																								It also markets the Superb, powered by a 2.8-litre, V6 petrol and priced between Rs 23-25 lakh, and Laurin and Klement. The Superb competes with DaimlerChrysler AGs C-class Mercedes Benz sedan while Octavia competes with Toyota Motors Corolla sedan.																								Skoda is increasingly beginning to use locally made parts in the Octavia and currently has a local content of around 62 per cent up from the earlier 41 per cent. The car is currently assembled from imported semi-knocked down kits.																								The carmaker expects a jump in its sales in 2004 helped by an expanding market that is expected to grow between 8-10 per cent. The premium segment, estimated at 40,000 units, grew by 6 per cent last year and 4 per cent in 2002.																								Data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers showed sales in April-February, the first 11 months of the fiscal, rose 31 per cent to 6,20,725 units. Nearly 83 per cent of the car market, however, is made up of small hatchbacks priced up to Rs 5 lakh. 																								The automobile sector has been one of the major beneficiaries of the countrys economic growth.																								More than two-thirds of car sales are through the financing route in an industry suffering from excess capacity. New models and discounts have also helped the market grow, analysts say.

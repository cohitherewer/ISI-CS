 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Panel moots Andrew Yule stake sale proposal
																								New Delhi, Feb. 5 (PTI): The disinvestment commission today recommended privatisation of Calcutta-based conglomerate Andrew Yule amp; Co and favoured offering 40 per cent stake in Indian Vaccine Corporation to IPCL.																								In its 24th report submitted recently to the government, the commission categorised Andrew Yule as a non-strategic firm and argued that there was no rationale for the company to continue as a PSU.																								The report said that the government should sell its entire 93 per cent stake in Andrew Yule to a strategic partner and provide for restructuring in consultation with the prospective bidders.																								Andrew Yule, whose history dates back to the British Raj, was set up in 1863 before becoming a PSU in 1979. 																								Currently, it acts as a group company holding stake in a number of companies, including Hooghly Printing and Tide Water.																								The panel also favoured disinvestment of equity in Andrew Yule group companies and asked the government to implement transfer of 26 per cent stake in Descon to Andrew Yule.																								It said in case a suitable partner could not be found, then the sale should be undertaken on a divisional basis after demerger of the units.																								Andrew Yule is currently organised into four units, including tea and electrical divisions, with most of the operations in losses. The company been posting losses for the past three years and was referred to the BIFR. The scrip trades on Calcutta and Bombay stock exchanges. 																								In the case of Indian Vaccine Corporation (IVCOL), the commission favoured offering 40 per cent government equity to promoters IPCL with the right of acceptance and refusal.																								The commission, however, asked the government to retain the remaining 26 per cent till IVCOL develops into a full-fledged company. 																								In case IPCL refuses to buy the stake, then government should invite fresh bids for the same.

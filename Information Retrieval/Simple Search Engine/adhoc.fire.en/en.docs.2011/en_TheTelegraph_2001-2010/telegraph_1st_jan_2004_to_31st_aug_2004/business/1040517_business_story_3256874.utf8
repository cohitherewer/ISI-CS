 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Survey to precede Dubai tea centre
																								Calcutta, May 16 (PTI): As a prelude to setting up a full-fledged auction centre in Dubai, the Indian Tea Association (ITA) has decided to send some varieties of tea (15,000 to 20,000 kgs) on an on-account basis to that country by the beginning of August to gauge the potential of the market.																								We had asked Contemporary Targett, a leading tea broking house, to prepare a report on how to move towards setting up an auction centre in Dubai, said C K Dhanuka, chairman of ITA, the apex body of tea producers in the country.																								Dhanuka said Contemporary Targett will make a presentation before the members of the ITA on May 24 after which they will dispatch the first assignment within the next 40 to 45 days.																								He said it would not be wise to suddenly make a huge investment in setting up an auction centre and then come to know that it was not worth. It will create a bad impression (as had happened after the closure of the London auction centre), if we are to close down the centre for some reason or other. Therefore, we are weighing all pros and cons and moving cautiously, he added.																								Dhanuka said after the presentation, ITA members would start shifting some tea for sale from Dubai on an on-account basis through Contemporary Targett on behalf of the association.																								This arrangement would continue for at least six months. During this period if we found that there is enough market and we can sell up to around one lakh kgs of tea from Dubai to other West Asian markets, then we will put up the investment for a full-fledged auction centre, he said.

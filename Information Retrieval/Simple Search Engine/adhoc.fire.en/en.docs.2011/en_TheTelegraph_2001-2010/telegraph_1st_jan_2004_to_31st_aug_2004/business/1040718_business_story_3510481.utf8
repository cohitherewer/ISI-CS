 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 17: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today indicated that the government is likely to announce changes in the rates of transaction tax and capital gains tax. 																								Brokers and investors have vociferously opposed the new transaction tax levied on purchase of all listed securities. This new tax was announced in the budget by the finance minister. 																								Chidambaram has already said the government expects to garner about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore from the new tax. The minister has indicated that he would clarify on the 0.15 per cent transaction tax during his reply to the budget discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday. 																								My entire revenue collection target is not based on transaction tax. It is less than 1 per cent of the total receipts. I will consider them, Chidambaram said.																								The finance minister said that he would consider changes in the rates of transaction tax, as it affected a large number of day-traders and bond dealers. 																								I had asked for three numbers for long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains and transaction tax. You have given me three numbers. I will consider them, he said.																								Mutual funds, brokers and other market intermediaries have voiced concern over the transaction tax on purchase of all listed securities. 																								Mutual funds have demanded the exemption of government securities and bonds from the tax. Brokers have requested the finance minister to spare day-traders and arbitrageurs.																								In his budget speech, Chidambaram had proposed the abolition of long-term capital gains tax, reduction in short-term capital gains tax from 15 per cent to 10 per cent and the introduction of a transaction tax.																								The finance minister also said that the government would create a third trading platform to revive the regional stock exchanges that have been hit badly after the rapid growth of Bombay and National stock exchanges.																								Chidambaram said a well-developed capital market was required for not only raising additional funds but also for efficient allocation of resources.

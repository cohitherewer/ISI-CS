 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Ranbaxy eyes prescription market abroad
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 7: After its foray into the overseas generic drug market, domestic major Ranbaxy is now eyeing the branded prescription market abroad. 																								Ranbaxy Laboratories today announced the launch of its first branded prescription medicine, Visclair tablets 100mcg (Mecysteine HCL) in the UK. 																								The brand will be promoted to health professionals by the Ranbaxy respiratory sales team, the new brands division of Ranbaxy (UK) Limited. The company was tight-lipped about the market size. 																								Visclair is a mucolytic drug that aids the expectoration of viscous mucus, a problem associated with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 																								A company spokesperson said, Generic drugs are sold through the channels of retailers in pharmacy, whereas in branded prescription, we route the product through the prescription of the doctors.																								The spokesperson said clearing viscous mucus from the patients lungs can reduce chronic cough, respiratory infections and exacerbation that COPD patients suffer from, thus leading to a greater quality of life and better health for the patient.

 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Pak duty slash stirs tea export hopes
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Cup of cheer																								Calcutta, June 14: Pakistan has reduced duty and sales tax on imported tea, bringing cheer to the Indian industry hoping to export 25 million kgs to the neighbour. 																								Pakistan has reduced the import duty on tea from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, sales tax from 18 per cent to 15 per cent and the income tax levied on imported tea from 6 per cent to 2 per cent. Therefore, the total duty and tax incidence has come down to 28 per cent from 52 per cent.																								The Indian tea industry has welcomed the move by Pakistan. Gautam Bhalla of Warren Tea said, We got the news from Pakistan Tea Association secretary K. N. Farooqi. Importers can now pay better prices for Indian tea. Moreover, it will help to reduce smuggling of tea to Pakistan.																								Pakistan consumes 150-155 million kgs of CTC tea annually. The countrys official imports stood at 118 million kgs last year. Around 35-40 million kgs was smuggled through Dubai.																								Indian tea industry officials feel that following this move, smuggled tea to Pakistan will not remain attractive.																								Price had been a major factor for Pakistan not buying Indian tea. Pakistan pays Rs 75 per kg for CTC tea produced in Kenya, which constitutes 75 per cent of Pakistans imports. But the same quality of Indian tea would cost Rs 85 per kg. Since the Assam CTC matches Kenyan tea, Pakistan was not ready to pay more for the Indian variety. 																								Pakistan being our neighbour, we would like to increase our exports to that country quite substantially, said tea industry officials.																								In July 2003, the Indian tea industry had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Pakistan Tea Association for exporting 10 million kgs in a year. In the first nine months, India has been able to export 7 million kgs of tea.																								We hope to export 9-9.5 million kgs in the whole year  almost double the volume that we used to export in the past, the officials added.																								However, the biggest beneficiary from this duty slash will be Kenya. We have to compete with them aggressively. We will have to reduce the cost of production, said Bhalla. India tea industry officials said this year is expected to be good for them. Production is down by 30 million kgs and exports up by 7 million kgs, they added.

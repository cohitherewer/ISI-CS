 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Farm-credit decree not full of thorns
 SUGATO HAZRA																								When the Union budget is strong on rhetoric, it sends shivers down the spine of bankers. Fortunately, finance minister P. Chidambaram did contain the possible damage on the banking system. True, the budget stipulates a doubling of agricultural credit in three years but with the decision to encourage farmers to diversify into horticulture, floriculture and oilseeds, it might not be difficult for banks to lend money to agriculture. The government deserves praise for realising that to boost credit to agriculture, activities generating fresh cash flow to farmers need to be promoted.																								But banks cannot wait for new activities to pick up. They must lend following the comprehensive policy announced recently. Banks have to boost loans under the Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme launched by Chidambaram when he was the finance minister in the UF government. In order to placate banks hurt by the direction, the National Housing Bank has reduced interest rates on refinance by a quarter per cent. This will reduce the cost of lending by banks. Also, the RBI will revise norms of repayment for rural housing loans. Clearly the government understands that default under the scheme is high and therefore, rules require a revision.																								Rural development needs funds. The onus of providing credit has gone on banks in the public and private sector, the regional rural banks (RRBs) and also the cooperative banks. Banks having rural network  mostly the government-owned banks  will be at the receiving end. These banks have been the sponsors of the RRBs and will be held accountable for the performance. Also, RRBs will receive funds for restructuring from the government only when these meet the prudential regulatory standards and adopt new governance standard. This implies restructuring. But how RRBs restructure and at the same time maintain the government expectation of expanding rural credit remains to be seen.																								The finance minister has realised that the other arm of delivering rural credit  the cooperative banks  has been suffering due to various ailments. The sector needs a thorough restructuring and an elaborate regulatory system. The budget, therefore, has suggested setting up of a task force to deliberate on the aspect and suggest remedial measures.																								Rural credit is one area where banks have been asked to increase exposures. Infrastructure is another sector where only the braves tread. Indian banks, the government feels, are the bravest ones to risk their money. The success of inter-institutional group of lenders in the power sector in bringing financial closure in six projects has led to the budget asking these banks and FIs to earmark Rs 40,000 crore for infrastructure loans. Initially, the fund will be spent on airports, seaports and the tourism sector.																								When banks are required to carry on so much burden for the state, can the government ignore the plea of banks? The finance minister, therefore, has promised to amend the portions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. The clause that was struck down by courts stipulated that borrowers had to deposit 75 per cent of the claim before filing an appeal against the claim. Such an amendment will make it easier for banks and FIs to recover a large part of their dues. But will the government extend the provisions of the act on the recalcitrant borrowers in the farm sector to whom fresh dose of credit will go?																								Judging by the dependence on the banking sector for providing credit to the pro-rural and pro-poor schemes, banks have a reason to feel moving back towards the eighties when directed credit was at its peak. For corporate sector borrowers, there is more bad news other than the amendment of the Securitisation Act.

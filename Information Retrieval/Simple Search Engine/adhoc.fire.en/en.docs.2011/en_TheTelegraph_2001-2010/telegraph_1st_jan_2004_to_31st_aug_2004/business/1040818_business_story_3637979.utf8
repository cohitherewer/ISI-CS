 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 17: The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has decided to give the rural electrification programme on a turnkey basis to central utilities  a move that has irked the contractors of the board, who have threatened to cease work.																								Senior WBSEB officials said according to the Centres decision, a massive programme has been taken up to complete rural electrification in the state by 2007.																								The programme has received financial assistance from Central Rural Electrification Corporation on condition that the work is completed on a turnkey basis. The board has, on one hand, decided to engage different central utilities for such works. On the other hand, it issued a tender on July 7 so that the empanelled contractors could be awarded the orders befittingly.																								The West Bengal Electrical Contractors Association has placed a demand with WBSEB that no work order can be given on a turnkey basis. The association feels that the decision will reduce their scope of work and cause unemployment for many contractors.																								If the board does not give work on a turnkey basis, this will create hindrance to get loan assistance from the REC, they added. The officials said the associations demands have been clearly mentioned as an alternative in the tender paper itself and the contractors will face no difficulty in submitting their tenders.																								The board, through its letter dated July 29, explained its stand to the contractors association and subsequently, invited them for a discussion on August 20.																								Therefore, the strike call is unjustified. The board is taking every measure to keep the service uninterrupted, they added.

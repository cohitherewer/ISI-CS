 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Intel comes under the scanner
																								Brussels, June 8 (Reuters): The European Commission confirmed on Tuesday it had re-launched a long-running investigation into Intels business practices. 																								Sources had earlier informed about the new moves by the Commission, which involved sending detailed letters of inquiry to computer makers and retailers. 																								A Commission spokeswoman told a news conference that the letters had been sent so that the EU executive could establish if there was a case to answer following complaints by Intels smaller rival AMD. 																								It is still at the beginning, she added. I suppose it is fair to characterize it as a new fact-finding phase.

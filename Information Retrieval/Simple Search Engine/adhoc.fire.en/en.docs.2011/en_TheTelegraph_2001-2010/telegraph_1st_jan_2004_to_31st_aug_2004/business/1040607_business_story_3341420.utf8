																																																																																													I am 61 years old and own a house worth Rs 40 lakh. I have booked one flat costing Rs 35 lakh. Of the following options, which is the best way to finance the purchase --- by taking a home loan at 7 per cent, by selling my vacant ground floor flat or by exhausting part of my savings?																																																																													Bholanath Das, Calcutta
																																																																																													You can get tax benefit both on the repayment of principal and interest by taking a home loan. Since you own a house, interest paid on housing loan is eligible for deductions under the head Income from house property up to Rs 1,50,000. Repayment of housing loan, both principal and interest, is allowed for deduction under section 88 up to an amount of Rs 20,000. 																																																																																													By selling your vacant ground floor flat, you will incur long-term capital gains that can be set off by acquiring another accommodation. Thus, you can save on your capital gains tax and also finance your flat.																																																																																													As for exhausting your savings, it depends on your future requirements and financial planning.																																					Cost of conversion																																																																																															I had purchased unit 64 Rs 14 each and have been allotted 6.75 per cent tax-free bonds Rs 10 each. What will be the tax treatments of loss on the conversion?																																																																													R. Jha
																																																																																													Assuming that you held the unit 64 for one year and was then allotted the tax-free bonds, you would have incurred long-term capital loss. It can be carried forward separately for eight subsequent assessment years and can be set off only against long-term capital gains. 																																					Taking leave																																																																																															I have received one-month leave encashment on account of leave fare concession sanctioned to me for visiting tourist spots. Will the amount be included in my gross annual income or can I get any exemption for the amount?																																																																													Mukul Dev, Bokaro
																																																																																													Leave fare concession for travelling within the country is exempt from tax up to the actual amount spent on travelling. The exemption is restricted to the lower of amount spent or air economy fee (if travelled by air) or AC first class fare (if travelled by rail). It is applicable to two journeys in a block of four calendar years starting from 1986, the recent block being 2002-2005.

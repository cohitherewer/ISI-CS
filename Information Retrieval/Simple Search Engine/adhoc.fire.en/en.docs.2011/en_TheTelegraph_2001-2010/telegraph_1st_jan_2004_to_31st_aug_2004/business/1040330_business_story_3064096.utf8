 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Mahindras to raise $100 m
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 29: Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) is planning to raise $100 million in long-term funds through an issuance of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs).																								The company board okayed the proposal here today. M amp;M has a right to retail an additional 15 per cent subscription, the company informed the stock exchanges.																								Executive director and president, finance and corporate affairs, Bharat Doshi said this issue would help the company meet the resource requirements for both organic and inorganic growth of its auto and tractor businesses and the emerging auto components segment.																								The company wants to raise capital through issuance of FCCBs considering the favourable capital market scenario in India and overseas at present, Doshi added. 																								The company said the FCCBs will have an appropriate conversion premium to the market price of M amp;M shares at the time of launching the issue. A green shoe option of 15 per cent will provide the company a flexibility to retain the extra amount in case of over-subscription.																								The M amp;M board also gave its nod to increase the foreign institutional investors (FII) limit in the company to 35 per cent of its capital. The FII investment in the company has reached 22 per cent against the present ceiling of 24 per cent.																								The company will convene an extraordinary general meeting on April 29 to consider these proposals.

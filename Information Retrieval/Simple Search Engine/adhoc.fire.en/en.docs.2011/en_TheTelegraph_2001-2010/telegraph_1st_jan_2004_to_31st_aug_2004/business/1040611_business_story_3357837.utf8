 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 CBI seizes files on Rashtriya Ispat coal purchases
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURYNew Delhi, June 10: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has seized files on spot purchases of coal by public sector major Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd that were made earlier this year.																								RINL top brass confirmed to The Telegraph that these files pertaining to spot purchases had been taken by the CBI but said all decisions were well recorded and cleared by the board of directors of the firm.																								RINL and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) jointly buy some 11 million tonnes of high grade coking coal valued at nearly $600 million under a long-term contract with a clutch of Australian suppliers. 																								However, after coal prices shot up on the global markets from about $58 a tonne to $120, these mining firms, which included MIM and Anglo, invoked a force majeure clause and said they could not supply coal to the two steel majors since their mines had been flooded and the roofs had collapsed besides suffering other damages.																								The steelmakers were therefore forced to buy nearly a quarter of the years purchases of coking coal from the open market. This means that the two PSUs together paid nearly $300 million extra for the spot purchases.																								Sources said it was interesting to note that the mines suffered damages soon after prices started rising. The Australian mines started sending out the force majeure notices between November 2003 and January 2004. 																								Sources said an empowered committee comprising bureaucrats and SAIL and RINL officials, which was set up by the steel ministry to oversee these coal purchases, allowed spot purchases. Spot prices were at that time reigning as high as $195 a tonne.																								SAIL tried to stall buying from the open market as the costs were too high and for some time tried to ration coking coal to its plant, asking them to carry out necessary repairs during this period. 																								However, the empowered committee did not take any legal recourse to stop the invocation of the force majeure clause or seek damages from the Australian mines. 																								SAIL and RINL top brass say that it would have been very difficult to challenge the force majeure conditions, especially as a three-member joint team that was sent to check on the conditions of the mines also gave a clean chit to the mining firms.																								However, the two steel firms have now started trying to push the Australians into some kind of accommodation and have started sending legal notices saying that their problems cannot continue forever and coal should be supplied at the contracted costs.																								SAIL officials now say that MIM and Anglo will soon be resuming coal supplies.																								RINL officials said they had taken permission both from their board and the ministry to go in for spot purchases which were absolutely necessary to keep their steel mills running.

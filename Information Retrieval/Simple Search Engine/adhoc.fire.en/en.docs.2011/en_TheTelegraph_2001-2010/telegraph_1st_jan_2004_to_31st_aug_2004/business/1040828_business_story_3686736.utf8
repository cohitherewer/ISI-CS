The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Banks plug into power fund
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 27: Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, Bank of India and Punjab National Bank will chip in Rs 100 crore each in India Power Fund (IPF). The fund has been floated by Power Finance Corporation (PFC).																								Senior PFC officials said, The banks have promised additional funds, if required. State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank and others are also keen to join IPF.																								The fund will channel investments for power sector development. IPF plans to accumulate funds worth Rs 7,000 crore over the next decade. This would amount to 10 per cent of the equity shortfall anticipated for investment in the power sector expansion, he added.																								Officials of Punjab National Bank said, Power is becoming a major area of investment. Following the introduction of the Electricity Act-2003, the power sector will become more transparent and well-governed. A major consortium lending is also coming up in the sector.																								In the last few months, many public sector banks have come forward to finance power projects. The Electricity Act has rekindled interest in independent power producers (IPPs) and several projects will achieve financial closure in the coming months.																								PFC has also approached the Centre to provide a Rs 1,000-crore corpus for the fund. Its a old request, but we have not heard anything yet. PFC has committed Rs 200 crore to start with. We are also in talks with National Thermal Power Corporation, PFC officials said.																								The IPF is a venture capital fund, registered as a trust under the Indian Registration Act with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The PFC will promote and incorporate India Power Fund Asset Management Company, which will be initially responsible for independent management of the trust funds.																								PFC is also planning an initial public offer. The request is still pending with the ministry of power. The markets are looking up and we may go ahead with our proposed IPO, PFC officials added.																								Based on the projections of demand in the 16th Electric Power Survey, additional generation capacity of over 1,00,000 MW is necessary to ensure power on demand by 2012. To generate over 1,00,000 MW of additional power capacity and associated transmission and distribution infrastructure, almost Rs 8,00,000 crore will be required in the next decade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Past the tax turn, market speeds up
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 22: Share prices of major pivotals moved northwards as investors welcomed the revised turnover tax announced on Wednesday.																								The 30-share BSE sensex, the bellwether index tracking the stock market sentiment, crossed the 5000-mark as a steady stream of impressive first-quarter performances by leading companies kept the mood upbeat for much of the session.																								The sensex closed 60.53 points higher at 5054.29  the first time it settled above this barrier since May 27. However, profit-booking took some sheen off the sensex after it touched an intra-day high of 5082.81 points.																								Dealers were still wary of a retarded monsoon, but concerns were put aside as the markets concentrated on the corporate results slated for the days to come.																								Much of the gains made on the bourses were due to the taxchanges announced by finance minister P. Chidambaram on Wednesday in Parliament. The transaction tax at 0.15 per cent will be levied only on the delivery of securities and will be shared by the buyer and seller, he said.																								The minister also listened to the pleas made by day traders to lower transaction tax for non-delivery trades to 0.015 per cent, while trades in the forward and options segment were brought down still further to 0.01 per cent.																								Steel shares rallied on the back of an outstanding performance from Tata Steel as analysts expect other companies to mirror the steel behemoths performance.																								With day traders back in the trading rooms, the turnover on the bourses naturally shot up. On the BSE, it rose to Rs 1802.32 crore from Rs 1494.37 crore on Wednesday.																								The nifty gained 16.70 points to end at 1,598.10.																								FMCG shares were among the few that closed in the red on fears that a bad monsoon would impact the sector more than the rest. Bank stocks rose as quarterly results of PSU and private sector banks showed much promise.Gilt prices tumble																								Concerns over rising inflation and hardening global interest rates drove government bond (gilt) prices sharply lower across the board today, arresting a brief overnight rally spurred by the exemption of debt instruments from the purview of the proposed turnover tax.																								Gilt prices fell 40-100 paise across the spectrum on a new wave of heavy selling. Uncertainties on interest rates were renewed after Fed chief Alan Greenspan told the senates banking committee that the Fed can continue to raise interest rates at a measured pace. He reiterated a pledge to raise rates more aggressively, if necessary.																								Only select short- to medium-term gilts were actively traded, dealers said.																								Traders fear that the rise in global interest rates would induce the RBI to raise the key bank and repo rates.

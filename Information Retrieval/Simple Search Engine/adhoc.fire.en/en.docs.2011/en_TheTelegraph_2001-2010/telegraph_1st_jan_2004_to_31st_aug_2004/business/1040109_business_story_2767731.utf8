 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Tax wall on cheap home loan razed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 Lofty ambitions 																								Mumbai, Jan. 8: The bringing down of perquisite valuation of home loan rates to market-determined rates will come as a huge benefit to employees taking concessional home loans from their organisations. They can now look for saving in their effective interest costs.																								This major relaxation came as a part of the mini budget. The government said the perquisite valuation of housing loans now be on a par with market rates. While the benchmark rate for housing loans was set at 10 per cent, this would now go down to below 8 per cent, in line with the existing interest rates on housing finance.																								However, housing finance watchers said the impact of this move would be far-reaching for those who are availing concessional home loans and their effective saving in interest cost could be in the region of 2-4 per cent. 																								Many firms offer concessional loans to their employees. The likes of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) or ICICI Bank offer such loans at interest rates in the region of 2-3.5 per cent to their employees.																								Two years ago, when the benchmark rate for housing loans was set at 10 per cent, the government said the interest rate benefit enjoyed by employees of various organisations should be treated as a perquisite and it should be taxed in the income tax bracket of the employee.																								Thus, the benefit arising to the employee out of the difference between the benchmark rate and the concessional housing finance rate was added to his annual income for calculation of tax. While the move raised employees tax burden, it also saw his effective interest cost in availing the loan going up by around 4.5 per cent.																								It was seen that the effective interest cost to the employee went up by close to 6 per cent. Thus, he paid an interest rate similar to the one taken for a normal housing loan, after taking into account the tax benefit, said an executive of a housing finance company.																								Though the anomaly will now be corrected following todays move, sources pointed out that the government or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now have to come out with a new benchmark rate for housing loans. 																								There are different market rates. Therefore, there should be a clarification on which market rate is the reference, sources said.

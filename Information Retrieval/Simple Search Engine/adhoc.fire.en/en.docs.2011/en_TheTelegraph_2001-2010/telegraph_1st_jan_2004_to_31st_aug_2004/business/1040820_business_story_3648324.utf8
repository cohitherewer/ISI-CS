The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Note of caution on brand wear amp; tear
 RAJA GHOSHAL New Delhi, Aug. 19: It  is a mantra that the Rs 11,000-crore Indian advertising  industry swears by, in good times and in bad. But do brand  promotions  using celebrities and pricing gimmicks  really  work?																								The answer, say ad world gurus, is both yes and no  as it is for most things in life.																								A brand should not go in for promotions all the time. One has to evaluate the brand from time to time, says Piyush Pandey of Ogilvy amp; Mather, a celebrity in his own right.																								Pandey, who is the executive chairman and national creative director of Ogilvy amp; Mather, says, Advertising and promotions are not two different things. Promotions include all kinds of communication, whether TV, print, direct mailers or point of purchase propaganda. In short, all kinds of communication to propagate the brand.																								Pandey reckons that celebrity promotions can be a good idea, but it should not be a shortcut dictated by creative laziness. One is not against the idea of one celebrity endorsing a lot of products, provided it works, he says.																								However, Piruz Khambatta, chairman and managing director of Rasna Limited, who recently signed on Karishma Kapoor to promote the brand, feels that one celebrity should not promote too many brands.																								Amitabh Bachchan, it is true, is promoting so many products and yet we have used him so effectively to do the social advertising of the polio campaign, Pandey said.																								There are no set rules. If you do not have a bright idea, no celebrity can help you, he added.																								Promotions either target the child in us, the adult in us or the animal in us, says Prasoon Joshi, national creative director and executive vice-president, McCan Erickson India.																								If a price-off appeals to the adult or the logical being in us, a day with a film star appeals to the child in us...... eat as much as you can, or the top ten cars in India, would appeal to the primitive or the animal side of us, Joshi said.																								A mismatch during brand promotion could spell doom, he said. You cant give chips with Chyawanprash as a freebie.																								If you have a bad brand, promotions will help to kill the brand faster, he added.																								Vikram Bakshi, who heads McDonalds operations in north India, agrees: We do go in for promotions for short-term market share and to tide over weak periods.																								Both Joshi and Bakshi feel that brand promotion should not overpower the brand. Promotions should learn to keep themselves insignificant in the total scheme of things, Joshi said.																								Bakshi feels that a price cut is welcome only if it extends for the entire season. Otherwise retailers could end up with a situation where the customer chases a brand because of the price discounts and dumps it as soon as the price cuts are withdrawn.																								Most advertisers and marketing men agree that a price cut is often the first sign that the brand may be in trouble. 																								Yet, price cuts are one of the most popular promotion tool available to marketing men.

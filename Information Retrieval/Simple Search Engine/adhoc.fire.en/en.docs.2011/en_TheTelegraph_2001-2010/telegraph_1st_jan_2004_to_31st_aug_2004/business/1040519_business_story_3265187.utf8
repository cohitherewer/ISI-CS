 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Soft rate stance for now
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 18: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained a status-quo on interest rates and liquidity with the bank rate, repo rate and cash reserve ratio (CRR) left untouched. However, the central bank dropped mild hints towards a possible shift to a neutral policy when it said that a close watch would be kept on global rates and inflation.																								In the credit policy announcement that saw the central bank perhaps waiting for more cues from the new government at the Centre, the RBI pushed credit availability to both the farm and non-farm sectors.																								Explaining the status quo stance, RBI governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy said domestic factors weigh heavily, indicating a need for stability.																								In the current assessment, interest rates are appropriate, Reddy said after unveiling the lean-season policy for 2004-05.																								The stance of the monetary policy for 2004-05 would be to purse an interest rate environment conducive to maintaining the momentum of growth and macroeconomic price stability, while continuing with the status quo, Reddy said. Interest rates in major economies are likely to harden, he added.																								Analysts tracking the annual policy said though Reddy has not overtly indicated a shift towards a neutral policy from a soft stance, he has issued pointers by asking to keep a close watch on inflation and global developments.																								The RBI kept the bank rate unchanged at 6 per cent, while both the repo rate and the CRR were untouched at 4.5 per cent.																								The RBI gave more freedom to bank boards on various counts. Bank boards are now open to enhance the exposure to a borrower up to a maximum of further 5 per cent of capital funds, subject to the borrower consenting to the banks making appropriate disclosures in their annual reports.																								At present, banks are allowed to assume single and group borrower credit exposure of up to 15 per cent and 40 per cent of capital funds, respectively, with an additional allowance of 5 per cent and 10 per cent of capital funds for the infrastructure sector. 																								Exposures of banks that are fully guaranteed by the government would be exempt from the purview of credit exposure norms. The central bank also allowed banks to raise long-term bonds with a minimum maturity of five years to the extent of their exposure of residual maturity of more than five years to the infrastructure sector.																								According to analysts, this move will lead to higher lendings in this sector, apart from avoiding asset-liability mismatches.																								In another move to extend further flexibility to banks on their loan policies, the RBI withdrew the existing limit on unsecured exposures to enable bank boards to fix their own policies on unsecured exposures.																								At present, banks are required to limit their commitments of unsecured exposure so that 20 per cent of their outstanding unsecured guarantees and the total of their outstanding unsecured advances did not exceed 15 per cent of the total outstanding loans.																								However, the central bank added that banks would be required to make a total provision of 20 per cent of the total outstanding advances in the sub-standard category to cover expected loss on unsecured exposures.																								In the farm sector, the annual policy allowed banks to waive margin/security requirements for agricultural loans up to Rs 50,000. To further boost securitisation, RBI said banks investment in securitised assets representing direct lending to agriculture would be treated under the priority sector.																								The annual policy also tried to reach out to the small and medium enterprises where attempts to kickstart a mechanism for debt restructuring on the lines of corporate debt restructuring (CDR) was initiated.																								On non-performing assets, he said banks have to introduce graded higher provisioning requirements according to the age of non-performing assets which are included under the doubtful for more than three years category with effect from March 31, 2005.

 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Success mantra: Consumer is king
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: The consumer isnt a dolt. And theres no such thing as bad advertising.																								When you pack a hall with advertising honchos, you can count on one thing: the glibness of the message. And the adroitness with which they can get out of pretty sticky situations.																								Great advertising always works, says Piyush Pandey, group president and national creative director of Ogilvy and Mather.																								So, what is great advertising? The first thing the creative guy in the ad firm has got to remember is not to treat the target audience as a bunch of morons.																								Some of the greatest advertising campaigns reveal that consumers are educated enough. They want to relate to an ad and be involved in it. They need fun; however, this needs to be coupled with some limited gyan, says Pandey.																								The key challenge, however, is to capture consumer interest that is changing at a rapid pace. India has a new and learning consumer market. The rules have changed over the years. Consumers have changed the way they consume things. Hence, marketers also need to change their style of marketing, claims Pandey.																								The explosion of ads on television has created a lot of clutter in the mindspace of consumers and brand recall poses a challenge. But big-spending consumer product companies arent complaining.																								Surveys conducted by Icra reveal that companies like Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) and Procter and Gamble swear by the money they have spent on their ad campaigns. For instance, HLL believes that every one rupee it spends on advertising its product earns it an assured return of 40 paise.																								With nearly 190 cable and satellite channels replacing the dowdy Doordarshan, consumers have a wider choice.																								Says Sunil Lulla, executive vice-president, Sony Entertainment Television: India has developed multiple methods of communication with its consumers, but how many times have the marketers allowed consumers to decide on how they want to be approached?																								Lulla claims there are three pillars of advertising: consumer insight, innovative ideas and inherent talent to identify the interest of the consumer. Good innovative ideas can sometimes make tremendous impact on the consumers.																								Ad gurus also believed that there is no such thing as bad advertising. Ignorant marketers who do not brief their agencies well are the ones who fail to communicate the right message to consumers.																								If you do it well, you do not need to worry about whether advertising is under or overvalued, says Pandey.																								Shortcuts make for poor advertising. If you make good ads, you can make a programme run on TV. Good ads assume the consumer is not ignorant. Advertising works when it is led by the feeling that there are intelligent people in the world, he added.

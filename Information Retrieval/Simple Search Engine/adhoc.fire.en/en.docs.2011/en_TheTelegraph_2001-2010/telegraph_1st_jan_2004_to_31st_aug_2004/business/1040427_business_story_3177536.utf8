The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Hind Lever to exit leather, seeds 
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, April 26: Hindustan Lever (HLL) is set to pull out of leather exports business. The FMCG major will also sell off its remaining stake in its hybrid seeds venture.																								The move stems from a decision to focus on just two segments  foods and home and personal care. Speaking to The Telegraph, a company spokesperson said, The leather business is the only non-core business that still remains and the company will divest it.																								HLL will also exit from its hybrid seeds joint venture project  Paras Extra Growth Seeds  in which it still has a 20 per cent stake, the spokesperson said. The company had already divested its seeds business two years back and the remaining stake is being divested now, the spokesperson said.																								On the leather export business, the FMCG major did not give any timeframe by which the business will be divested nor was it willing to reveal the names of potential buyers.																								We do not comment on mergers and acquisitions, the spokesperson said.																								However, the markets are rife with speculation that the company is in advanced stages of talks on the issue with Liberty Shoes.																								The other non-core businesses that HLL had exited from in the last two years include oils and fats (including Dalda), special chemicals, catalysts and also mushroom.																								With the recent restructuring of the Rs 10,837-crore company, there was speculation that it would be split into two as a fallout of the amalgamation of the five divisions of the company into just two  foods and home and personal care. But HLL now says there are no such moves.																								There is no plan to split the company. Both the divisions  home and personal care and foods  benefit from corporate synergies by being a part of HLL. We have several plans to leverage and build on these synergies further, the spokesperson said. 																								The restructuring is also not going to change the companys existing strategy of driving growth through the 30 power brands it had identified.																								Our power brands have been chosen based on their current size and/or future potential. The focus on our power brands will continue, said the spokesperson.																								HLL said its strategy to achieve growth will be by focusing on the power brands and by improving internal efficiencies. Knorr Annapurna, Brooke Bond, Kissan and Kwality Walls are some of HLLs power brands.

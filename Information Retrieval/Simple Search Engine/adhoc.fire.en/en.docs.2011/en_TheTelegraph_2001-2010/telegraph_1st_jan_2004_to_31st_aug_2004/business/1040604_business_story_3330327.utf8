Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, June 3: Bengal is fast developing into an investment destination for US industries, guided by recent state government policies.																								I am optimistic that the Left Front will be pragmatic in its approach to economic policy-making, said Lee Brudvig, minister counselor for economic affairs of the US embassy in India.																								According to Brudvig, there is a general perception that the Left parties, supporting the Congress-led government at the Centre from outside, may block economic reforms and hamper growth prospects. 																								But in recent times, the Left Front government had been welcoming foreign investment in the state, he said. It is also willing to finetune labour laws for the infotech industry and close loss-making public enterprises.																								The role of Bengal will be pivotal in the food processing industry as well as other forms of agri-business and will provide important sources of rural employment. Frito Lay, an American-based company, is investing in food processing in the state.																								The US wants to support Indias economic liberalisation process, bring in private sector funding for infrastructure, expand public-private partnerships, help promote rural and small businesses and provide technical support to modernise financial markets, he said. 																								These steps will benefit India and foster Indo-US economic relations and ensure regional stability.																								I believe that India would benefit greatly by removing limits on foreign investments. The new government should open more sectors, including some in which it plays a significant role, to foreign investment and global competition, Brudvig added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Bank of Rajasthan eyes Rs 120 cr net profit
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Managing director K. M. Bhattacharya in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Feb. 27: Bank of Rajasthan expects its net profit this year to go up to Rs 120 crore and is looking to acquire corporate loans worth Rs 500 crore from other banks to rapidly expand its asset base.																								The bank has been buying top-quality corporate loans from other banks, having failed in its attempt to gobble up a bank in the south.																								Bank of Rajasthan has been eyeing several private banks in the south, but so far its takeover plans have not materialised.																								The bank has now nearly given up the search, and is instead looking to grow through the acquisition of quality assets.																								Last year, it acquired assets worth Rs 150 crore from a nationalised bank, and this year, it has already scooped up a Rs 100 crore home loan portfolio from a private bank.																								We deploy Rs 600-700 crore in the call market every day at a 4 per cent annual yield. The cash available to us is increasing as our deposit base is growing fast.																								Because we need to use the cash more profitably, we are looking for opportunities to buy assets from other banks, said K. M. Bhattacharya, managing director of Bank of Rajasthan.																								The bank, which posted a net profit of Rs 91.17 crore in the first nine months of the current financial year, expects its full profit to go up to Rs 120 crore, which represents a 90 per cent growth over last year. A net profit of this order would translate into an earning per share (EPS) of over Rs 11.																								Besides taking over of others assets, the bank is fast expanding its branch network. At present, Bank of Rajasthan has 349 branches and around 35 extension counters. Bhattacharya said its branch network (including the extension counters) would be scaled up to 500 in two years.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 13: A task force on information technology (IT) has suggested the setting up of a National Technology Plan and also effect immediate changes in the policy, delivery institutions, regulatory mechanisms and fiscal incentives for skill generation and deployment of IT-enabled service (ITeS) professionals.																								The recommendations have also highlighted the need for attracting resources into IT/ITeS sectors, educating, developing requisite skills, certifying skill levels of resources, deploying trained, certified resources monitoring and guiding efforts related to the sector and research and development.																								While the recommendations are intended at driving the growth of the overseas market, they will also have a salutary ripple effect on other parts of the economy, including the domestic IT services and products industry as well as other global market-oriented industries.																								The task force has said the size of the global IT/ITeS market was estimated at $1,184 billion in 2002. It is projected to grow to $2,497 billion in 2009, registering a CAGR of 11 per cent between 2003 and 2009. India is expected to achieve a domestic and global market of $62 billion in IT/ITeS by 2009 from $12 billion in 2003. 																								The growth in IT/ITeS market in India will translate into a manpower requirement of 0.48 million for IT export services and 1 million for ITeS export services by 2009. Thus IT and ITeS manpower requirement is likely to grow from 0.7 million in 2003 to 2.2 million in 2009. It includes manpower requirement for domestic/captive IT services.																								Considering the current trends, the manpower gap for IT and ITeS for the year 2009 is estimated at 0.5 million. Estimates suggest that India could be one of the few countries in the future with surplus manpower availability and these could be effectively trained and deployed to meet the requirements of the IT/ITeS industry.																								Considering the growth potential of over 25 per cent per annum, IT/ITeS could become a significant contributor to the economic growth of the country. The share of revenue from offshore services to overall GDP could grow from 1.9 per cent in 2002 to 6.6 per cent in 2009.																								The task force has suggested that since IT has applications in all sectors of the economy, a National Technology Plan needs to be evolved involving all major ministries and departments along with the industry and the academia. This will guide the scale and direction of human-resource development efforts.																								The report has also suggested that the IT/ITeS industry is extremely dynamic in nature, and a dedicated team from the government, academia and industry must be appointed to conduct specific reviews every two to three years.

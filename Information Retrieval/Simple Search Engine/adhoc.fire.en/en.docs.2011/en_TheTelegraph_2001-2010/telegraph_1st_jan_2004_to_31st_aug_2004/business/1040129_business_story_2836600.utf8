 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Reserve Bank joins feel-good chorus
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 28: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today lent its voice to the feel-good chorus, saying it had evidence of a credit spurt, an IPO revival and a build-up in the momentum of industrial recovery now under way.																								The assessment comes amid a welter of forecasts that growth will top 7 per cent this year. An 8.4 per cent GDP rise in the second quarter has already put the country in the league of the worlds fastest-growing economies.																								Improved prospects for real activity globally should add strength to the upward momentum in growth, the RBI said in its Report on Currency and Finance.																								Painting a healthy picture of the economy on various fronts, the report says buoyancy has spread to most sectors, including industry, and is not confined to agriculture. There is a likelihood of investment demand picking up, too. Proof of this, the report says, lies in the extra demand for credit from banks and the rush of firms to raise equity. 																								The Centres borrowings will be below budgeted estimates, and forex reserves of over $100 billion will provide security against any financial crises.																								One area of concern is the governments house-keeping. The RBI is worried about the fiscal situation, especially the low tax-GDP ratio. The report is effusive in its praise of the manner in which remittances $15,174 million in 2002-03  have gushed in. This is seen as a sign of the comparative advantage in skilled and semi-skilled labour exports.																								On inflation, which has made policy-makers sit up in recent weeks, the report says the fiscal could end with a figure of 4-4.5 per cent. This is much less than the 6 per cent the country is experiencing. It would not be possible to attain the downward bias, the report said. The comment is an indication that though a rise in price was anticipated, the magnitude has been more than expected.																								The report concedes there is more volatility in the stock markets, as measured by coefficient of variation, but says it is not a cause for concern since the speculative trading appears to have declined in the rally. This is evident in the higher percentage of deliveries. 																								The report called for new instruments to manage capital inflows as sterilisation reduces the stock of government bonds.																								On capital account convertibility, the RBI said the country has gone down a long way towards that goal, but there are two areas where caution is needed unlimited access to short-term external commercial borrowing and providing unrestricted freedom to residents to convert domestic bank deposits and idle assets.

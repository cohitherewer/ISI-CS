 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: The rate of inflation today inched up to a new three-and-a-half year high of 7.61 per cent for the week ended July 31 on the back of higher food and oilseed prices. In the previous week, the rate of inflation stood at 7.51 per cent.																								North Block economists, however, also blamed cheap credit for the rising prices and said besides an imported oil shock and the effect of delayed rains on certain crops, the main problem is cheap credit  its driving up demand to too high a level.																								Most economist fear that the figure will touch the 8-per-cent-mark by August-end once rising oil prices are also taken into account.																								Manufactured products, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the inflation index, rose 0.2 per cent in the week to July 31. The primary articles index rose 0.4 per cent.																								The food product index rose 0.4 per cent to 174.5 from 173.8 the previous week due to higher tea and edible oil prices. The index for fuel, power, light and lubricants remained unchanged at last weeks level of 274.4.																								The government is already working on monetary and fiscal measures to check the runaway inflation. These steps may be in place as early as next week.																								The countrys bank rate, used to price loans, is at a three-decade low of 6 per cent, while the short-term repo rate is 4.5 per cent. These can be expected to go up.																								Sucking out excess money from the economy is a traditional way of cooling down prices. The countrys central bank is keen to allow this as its top brass believes that real interest rates paid to depositors, which today stand at a negative 2 per cent, should be at about 2.5 per cent.																								The Congress-led governments strategy on prices is likely to see a combination of price-line controls, attempt at talking down markets and import of goods in short supply besides sucking out excess money from the market to tackle its first real crisis  rising inflationary tide.																								The key concern areas are rising oil and steel prices, which affect all sectors of the economy. Coupled with this is the increase in prices of oilseed and sugar, two vital ingredients in the diet of all Indian families.																								In fact, price worries forced the government to raise the quota of free sugar sale in August by one lakh tonnes to 11 lakh tonnes to cool the prices, which are now likely to fall by Rs 10 to Rs 15 from a high of Rs 1,655 a quintal.																								Politically, high inflation rates can mean trouble for any government. High prices are unpopular because it eats into peoples incomes and in case these are fixed incomes, as is the case with pensioners, these could mean a drastic fall in living standards. For an alliance, which will face electoral tests in four key states soon, such a situation could spell doom.

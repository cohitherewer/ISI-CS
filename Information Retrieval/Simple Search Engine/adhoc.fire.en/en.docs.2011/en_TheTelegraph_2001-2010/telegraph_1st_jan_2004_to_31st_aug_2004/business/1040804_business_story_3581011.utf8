 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Volkswagen to set up base in Andhra Pradesh
 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 Arrival timeHyderabad, Aug. 3: The long wait is finally over: Volkswagen is coming to India and will set up base at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.																								Volkswagen (VW) is scheduled to sign a deal with the Andhra Pradesh government on August 22 for the project, said state industries minister Botsa Satyanarayana. 																								The signing of the memorandum of understanding  under which VW will commit an investment of Rs 1,000 crore to establish a state-of-the-art assembly line  caps almost a year of talks and swirling speculation over the car project.																								Volkswagen had been wooed by several state governments and had checked out sites in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. 																								Most of those discussions in Andhra were held with the Chandrababu Naidu government. VW officials, who toured the Vizag project early this year, were impressed with the facilities that the Naidu government offered and a change in government did not force a U-turn on the project.																								The German automobile giant  famous for its legendary Beetle cars  isnt saying yet which models it will make in India. All that is known is that it will import the parts in semi-knocked down (SKD) condition and assemble them here. VWs best-selling models are Passat and Golf.																								Satyanarayana said the VW plant would produce 2500 cars a year. Volkswagen is already present in India through the Czech automobile brand Skoda, which it had acquired. 																								Volkswagen AG designs, manufactures and markets cars, commercial vehicles and trucks under the brand names Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda. 																								The state industries minister hoped that the other German automaker  BMW  would also pick Andhra Pradesh for its car project. 																								The BMW representatives were in Hyderabad last week with a proposal to set up a plant to make 5000 cars a year. After talks with chief minister Rajasekhar Reddy, BMW executives had also inspected some of the plots around Hyderabad. They have projected an investment of over Rs 2000 crore. 																								BMW has been checking out a few sites in the country and recent reports said a team of officials had been impressed with the facilities and investment benefits that Kerala was offering.

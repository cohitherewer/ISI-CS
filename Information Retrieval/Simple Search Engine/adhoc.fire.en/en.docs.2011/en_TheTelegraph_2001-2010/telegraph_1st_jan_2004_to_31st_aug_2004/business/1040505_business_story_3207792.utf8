 															- Regulator finalises norms on Indian Depository receipts  A STAFF REPORTER G. N. Bajpai in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, May 4: Wealth creation for Indian investors will be the overriding motive for Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) when it draws up guidelines allowing companies incorporated overseas to raise funds through Indian Depository Receipts (IDR). The norms will complement provisions laid down by the department of company affairs (DCA) on the issue.If the wealth created in our country is shared by overseas investors, those in India should not be deprived of the chance to reap the gains made by foreign companies, Sebi chairman G. N. Bajpai said here today. 																								The process involves preparing draft proposals, inviting comments from the public and putting them before the Sebi board. All this is expected to take a couple of months.																								Although DCA notified IDR rules recently, they must get Sebis approval. The norms require companies to have a pre-issue paid-up capital and free reserves of at least $100 million and an average turnover of $500 million in the three financial years to the issue.																								They must be turning in profits for at least five years and should have declared a minimum dividend of 10 per cent in each of those years. The company should have a pre-issue debt-equity ratio of no more than 2:1.																								The IDRs must be listed on bourses in India and abroad, cannot be redeemed into underlying equity shares within a year of the issue and their total size should be limited to 15 per cent of a firms paid-up capital and free reserves.																								The Sebi chief cited Calpers decision to invest in India as an example of how foreign companies shovel their cash if they find Indian markets secure, cost-effective and efficient. He stressed the need for market regulators and participants to develop advanced skills through a variety of courses and modules. 																								Sebi will soon set up the National Institute of Securities in Mumbai. The institute, established in collaboration with an international institution, will offer advanced courses for regulators and participants. 																								On the revival of regional exchanges, Bajpai said 14 of them, including the ones in Delhi, Chennai and Ahmedabad, have agreed to join Indonext, which will provide them the trading platform and client base needed to shore up trading volumes. 																								Although Calcutta Stock Exchange has not decided to come on board, the brokers are considering if they should step in.

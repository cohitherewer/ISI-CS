 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Respite for Microsoft from EU sanctions
																								Brussels, June 27 (Reuters): The European Commission has temporarily suspended an order demanding that Microsoft change the way it sells Windows software, pending an EU judicial decision on the firms request for a longer-term suspension, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday.																								Microsoft had asked a European Union (EU) court on Friday to suspend the sanctions until the case was decided, according to sources familiar with the situation. 																								Later on Friday, the Commission told the Court of First Instance, the EUs lower court, that it would suspend the sanctions until court president Bo Vesterdorf decided what to do regarding the long-term suspensions which could last three years or more, one of the sources said.																								Microsoft would complete its filing by providing a hard copy to the court, which it had to do before a 90-day deadline ran out on Sunday, sources said.																								The Commission ruled in March that Microsoft had violated the law by using its dominant Windows operating system to compete unfairly against rivals, fining it 497 million euros ($602.8 million) and ordering it to change business practices.																								The Commission gave Microsoft 90 days to separate Windows Media Player from its Windows operating system.

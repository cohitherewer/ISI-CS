 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Trai to regulate tariff plans
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 8: The telecom regulator has finally stepped in to end the chaos.																								Telecom consumers have 1,421 tariff plans to choose from in the 19 telecom circles in the country. The regulator reckons that cellular and basic phone users have at least 42 plans to pick from and thats not counting another 500 plans that were offered last year as promotional schemes.																								Consumers love to be spoilt for choice  but this array is enough to send them into a tizzy. 																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has decided to step in and regulate the number of tariff plans that an operator should offer so that the subscriber does not turn into a confused wreck. 																								Operators have been carpet-bombing customers with tariff plans long before the unified licensing regime kicked in last October  which had prompted the regulator to suggest that an operator could not offer more than 22 plans.																								Trai had also fixed a fee of Rs 2,500 that an operator would have to pay while submitting the tariff plan for regulatory approval, which was later relaxed.																								Under an amended telecom tariff order notified in January, the service providers had been given the flexibility to report their tariff plans to the authority within seven days from the date of implementation after conducting a self-check with the relevant regulatory principles, which included tariffs being IUC-compliant, non-predatory and non-discriminatory. 																								A senior Trai official said: The competitive activity coupled with the flexibility in offering tariffs have led to a situation wherein a large number of plans are offered in the market. While a variety of choices for the customers would be a welcome development, too many plans confuse them and render informed choice very difficult.																								Basic and mobile service providers had submitted 3,925 tariff plans to Trai in 2003 alone. The figures are likely to go up soon with the entry of additional operators in several circles. These large numbers give rise to issues involving regulatory and consumer concerns. 																								Frequent revision and withdrawal of tariff plans further add to the confusion in the minds of the consumers.																								A Trai official said: Intense competition in the access service segment constituting basic and mobile services has resulted in substantial decline in tariffs. Considering this fact, the authority has forborne the tariffs for these services except for rural fixed-line subscribers.

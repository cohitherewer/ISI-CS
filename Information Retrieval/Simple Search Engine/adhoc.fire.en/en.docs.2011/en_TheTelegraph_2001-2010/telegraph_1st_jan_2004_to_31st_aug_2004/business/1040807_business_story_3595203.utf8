 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Bajaj Electricals on fast track
																								New Delhi, Aug. 6 (PTI): Bajaj Electricals, with a Rs 503-crore turnover, has decided to unleash a major marketing initiative to double its turnover in the next three to four years, the company said today.																								Bajaj Electricals, which had posted a net profit of Rs 11.36 crore in 2003-04 against a loss of Rs 9.80 crore in the previous year, had restructured its business by exiting from non-core areas, controlling operating costs and improving margins in the existing ones. We have divided the company into five strategic business units for enhanced focus as well as efficiency. These are lighting, fans, appliances, luminaires, engineering and projects. We hope to do well in all the segments with the renewed focus, said Shekhar Bajaj, chairman and managing director.																								In the appliances business, the company has been following a two-pronged approach in the domestic market. It is offering Bajaj products to customers in the value-for-money segment and UKs Morphy Richards products for premium buyers. With this approach, we hope to capture a sizeable portion of the market, he said.																								The company had entered into a pact with Morphy Richards in late 2002 for marketing and servicing the products of the foreign partner, which include steam-irons, coffee makers, toasters, sandwich makers and food processors. Bajaj also sells its own products, which include microwave ovens, desert coolers, personal coolers, water heaters, room heaters, oven-toasters, food processors, steam and dry irons.																								We would be offering gas-based water heaters soon with more and more homes getting piped natural gas directly. We have already introduced gas stoves in the market, Bajaj said.																								The company would lay greater focus on mixer-grinders and food-processors. It would also introduce a new range of domestic fittings in the luminaires segment.																								Bajaj Electricals is planning to launch premium fans. In the next two months, we will be launching fans in the premium category with a price tag between Rs 6,000-8,000, he said.

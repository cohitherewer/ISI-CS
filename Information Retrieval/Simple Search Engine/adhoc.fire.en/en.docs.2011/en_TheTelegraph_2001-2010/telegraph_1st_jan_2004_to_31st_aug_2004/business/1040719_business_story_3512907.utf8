		 Monday, July 19, 2004  Q amp;A				 Its a taxing life
What is the tax implication for a single premium unit-linked life insurance policy where the premium amount is more than 20 per cent of sum assured? Is there any minimum holding period for any tax benefit? 																																																																													S. K. Som, Calcutta
																																																																																													For any insurance policy where the premium amount is more than 20 per cent of sum assured, an individual would get a tax rebate only up to that 20 per cent limit. Any amount paid above that will not be eligible for the rebate.																																																																																													The policy has to be continued for at least two years to enjoy the tax benefit. In case of any single premium policy, the money is paid in the first year itself. But the policy has to be continued for one more year to get tax benefit. In other cases where you have to pay premium every year, payment has to be made for at least two consecutive years after the commencement of the policy. Otherwise the rebate allowed in the first year will be added to the taxable income in the next year. 																																					To buy or not to buy																																																																																															I am 52 years old and have six more years to retire. At present I have an LIC policy for which I have to pay Rs 13,600 as annual premium and the sum assured is Rs 1.5 lakh. Should I buy more life insurance policies or should I invest in National Savings Certificate? 																																																																													T. R. Anand, Calcutta
																																																																																													One should make investment decisions based on the financial obligations of a person and other parameters such as disposable income, investment period, liquidity requirements, risk profile and tax benefits.																																																																																													Also it is important not to put all your eggs in one basket. It is better to diversify the portfolio and park the investible funds in different saving instruments.																																					Rebate call																																																																																															I got tax rebate at the rate of 20 per cent on Rs 50,000 investment in NSC in the year of investment. Can I get any further benefit in the next year? 																																																																													Nikhil Ranjan Chaudhuri, Calcutta
																																																																																													You will get tax rebate under section 88 only on the interest accrued on the NSC in the next year and not on the principal amount.

 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 NIIT back on bourses 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: After a four-week hiatus, the shares of NIIT Ltd will resume trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange from Monday.																								NIIT shares had gone off the trading list of the stock exchanges in the second week of July 2004 to facilitate credit of new shares of NIIT and NIIT Technologies Ltd.																								This follows the spin-off of NIITs global software solutions business into NIIT Technologies Limited.																								The capital has been structured in such a manner that in lieu of 100 shares of Rs 10 each held by the shareholders of NIIT Ltd, they receive 50 shares of the de-merged NIIT Limited and 75 shares of NIIT Technologies Ltd, both with face values of Rs 10 each.																								The process of listing of NIIT Technologies Ltd shares is likely to be completed in the next few weeks.																								In the 12-month period ended March 31, 2004, NIIT Ltd, the global learning solutions company, reported global system-wide revenues of Rs 574.9 crore with an operating profit of Rs 23.8 crore.																								NIIT shareholders had approved the payment of an enhanced dividend of Rs 5 on every share of the face value of Rs 10 each at the annual general meeting held last month-end.																								In the quarter ended June 30, 2004 NIITs global system-wide revenues recorded a 10 per cent year-on-year improvement to Rs 152 crore. 																								The consolidated net profit from the learning business grew 12-fold to Rs 7.5 crore. The net profit, after accounting for share of profit of associates, stood at Rs 10.9 crore reflecting an earnings per share of Rs 5.60.

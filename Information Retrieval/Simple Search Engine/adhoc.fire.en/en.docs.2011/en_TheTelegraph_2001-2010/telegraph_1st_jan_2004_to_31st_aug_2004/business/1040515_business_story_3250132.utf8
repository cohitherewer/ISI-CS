 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Hedge funds in exit mode
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 14: As foreign institutional investors (FIIs) view the political somersault with some trepidation, another tribe of light-footed investors, namely hedge funds, would be in a hurry to exit with whatever gains they have made recently.																								In the past fortnight, FIIs have been selling heavily. When they buy, they buy big and when they sell, they sell big, rued a fund manager.																								In the last eight sessions, the net sales of FIIs have been around Rs 2,214.7 crore. On Thursday, they sold Rs 604.40 crore, the highest in recent history. Friday figures may reveal much higher figures, fear market players.																								The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), has shown remarkable leniency in allowing participatory notes in the market. 																								The instrument allows foreign investors to invest on Indian bourses without registering with Sebi. 																								It was feared that benami money from domestic companies and politicians would be routed through this channel. Participatory notes could also be used by hedge funds for easy access to financial markets with little downtime.																								As the turnaround at the Centre unfolds, fickle hedge funds may have already scooted by selling big on local markets.																								Sebi has allowed FIIs to invest through participatory notes, even after being warned that it would allow hedge funds, notorious for causing volatility on the bourses, to make an entry.																								It is believed that a large percentage of the foreign funds were invested through this medium last year.																								Sebi had noticed some time ago that 31 entities, appearing to be OCBs, have subscribed to participatory notes issued by some of the FIIs/sub-accounts.																								Investigations conducted by the regulator on alleged breaches of regulations by these foreign institutions may have reached a dead-end, according to lawyers.																								It is tough to find the ultimate person who is investing through FIIs, a market observer said. 																								When the markets were on a roll, Sebi did not like to be dubbed as the party pooper. Now that the markets are diving, Sebi may have to ask itself some harsh questions.

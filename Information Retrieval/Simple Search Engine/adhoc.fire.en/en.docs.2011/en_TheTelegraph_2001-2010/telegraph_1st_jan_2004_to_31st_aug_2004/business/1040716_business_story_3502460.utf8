 PALLAB BHATTACHARYACalcutta, July 15: The Birlas have vowed to demolish the will bit by bit in court, a senior member of the Birla group said today.																								We will see him (R. S. Lodha) in court. I can tell you that we will demolish the will bit by bit and we will emerge winner, he said.																								Amid reports about negotiations to settle the dispute over Priyamvadas will, the Birlas continue to hone their legal strategy. If and when Lodha goes to court to probate the will, the Birlas will mount an attack from several angles.																								Although senior members of the Birla family have kept their cards close to the chest, sources close to the Birla family said the veracity of the will would be challenged.																								Whether the entire will is forged or the widow of M. P. Birla was influenced while writing it are aspects the family is focusing on.																								It has to be seen whether the witnesses had signed on all the four pages of the will. The authenticity of Priyamvadas signatures also needs to be checked, they said. Even if the signatures are genuine, it has to be examined whether they are different from one another. If they are, it can be argued that Priyamvada was not well when she signed the will.																								The Birlas are also believed to be looking into the possibility of Priyamvada coming under the influence of Lodha while writing the will, or if she signed it without realising what she was signing. 																								As the chairman of the M.P. Birla group, Mrs Birla used to sign lot of papers everyday. It was not possible for her to check every paper before signing it. Now if somebody tries to take advantage of that, it is the court that will pronounce justice, a member of the Birla family said.

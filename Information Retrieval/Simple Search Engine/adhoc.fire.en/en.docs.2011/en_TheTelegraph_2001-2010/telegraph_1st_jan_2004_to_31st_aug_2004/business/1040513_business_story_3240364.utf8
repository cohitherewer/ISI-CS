Mumbai, Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry are the areas where the additions took place. The countrys financial capital alone gave it a million users.																								Now that we have got the momentum, its operation claw-back, said Krishna Angara, executive vice-president.

More than Rs 500 crore has already been invested in its network. 																								The investment over the last seven months equivalent of the funds deployed in the last six years, he added. It will pump in Rs 1000 crore this year, the money coming from vendor financing and internal accruals.

Quarter-on-quarter rise in revenues was also sharp, despite stiff competition and falling tariffs.

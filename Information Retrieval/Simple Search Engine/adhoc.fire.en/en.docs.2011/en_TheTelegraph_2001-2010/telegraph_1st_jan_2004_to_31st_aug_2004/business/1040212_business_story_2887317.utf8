The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Bharti gets Bengal for a song
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mittal: All in the cell game																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: Bharti Tele-Ventures (BTVL) today paid the lowest-ever licence fee in Indian telecom history of Rs 1 crore to offer mobile services in Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.																								The company paid a total of Rs 63.25 crore to the department of telecommunications (DoT) and received unified access licence to offer mobile services in Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Andaman and Nicobar, Uttar Pradesh (East) and Jammu and Kashmir. 																								In addition to Bengal and Andaman Nicobar Islands, the company has paid a licence fee of Rs 10 crore for Bihar, Rs 5 crore for Orissa, Rs 2 crore for Jammu and Kashmir and Rs 45.25 crore for Uttar Pradesh (East). 																								The licence has been granted to Bharti Cellular Limited, the cellular arm and subsidiary of BTVL. The company will offer mobile services using the global system for mobile communications (GSM) technology.																								Sunil Mittal, chairman and group managing director of Bharti Enterprises, said, With these new licences, we are set to further expand our footprint in the country. While we expect to receive the licence for Rajasthan shortly, we are well on our way to launch GSM services in these five circles in the second quarter of the next fiscal. This is in keeping with our commitment to build an unmatched telecom infrastructure in this country.																								The company has already planned to raise the resources through debt as the government has yet to approve the increase in the limit on foreign direct investment (FDI) in telecom services from 49 per cent to 74 per cent. 																								Akhil Gupta, joint managing director of BTVL, has already hinted that the company will examine the possibility of raising $500-$600 million through the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route. BTVL is likely to start the process by the year-end.																								The funds would be used to meet capital expenditure, expansion of network and refinancing of earlier debts, said Gupta.																								With the grant of five new licences, Bharti, which currently provides services in 15 mobile circles and five fixed-line circles, will have a pan India footprint extending from Jammu amp; Kashmir to Tamil Nadu, and from Goa to Andaman and Nicobar. 																								Thus, the population covered under its licence area has moved up from 600 million to 932 million (91 per cent of all India population).

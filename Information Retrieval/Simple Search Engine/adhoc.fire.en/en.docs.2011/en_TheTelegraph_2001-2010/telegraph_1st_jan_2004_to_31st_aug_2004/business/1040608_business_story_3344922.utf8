 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Farm trade-off outlined
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar (left) and commerce minister Kamal Nath in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 7: A meeting between agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and commerce minister Kamal Nath today led to the decision that India will focus on protecting its right to retain high-tariff barriers on sensitive farm products like foodgrain so that global firms do not flood the Indian market with cheap products, driving millions of domestic farmers into penury.																								The agriculture ministry has told the commerce minister that in all global trade talks, it would like to cover rice and wheat  items whose domestic prices are either higher, or tend to be higher, than world prices. In these products, India will assert its right to retain high tariff barriers and will agree to very low tariff cuts. 																								India will also insist that the West cut huge subsidies it pays its farmers and which make their products absurdly cheap. The degree of protection to European farmers, in many cases, are over 300 per cent. 																								The two ministries has charted out the importance that needs to be given to agriculture and the various issues related to it. This needs to feature prominently in the meeting of the Unctad (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). The 11th quadrennial meeting of the agency, to be held between June 13 and 18, is touted as the first chance for commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath to prove his negotiating capabilities at the multilateral fora. 																								After his 90-minute meeting with Nath, Pawar said his department has given a clear-cut briefing to commerce ministry on farm-related trade issues.																								The two ministers also took stock of Indias food and livelihood security concerns, and underlined the importance of safeguarding the interest of Indian farmers in the negotiations. 																								The agriculture minister has also said the assistance to grain exporters will not be given at the cost of food security of the country. We are discussing the new foodgrain export policy. It was cleared only in January. The countrys food security must be looked into as well, Pawar said. 																								The commerce ministry had earlier prepared a draft scheme proposing a Rs 600-crore grain export subsidy scheme to ship 60 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice. This would involve a reimbursement of Rs 1000 per tonne. The food ministry had, however, rejected the plan. 																								Soon after taking charge last month, Pawar had said the stocks were sufficient. There is no luxury to export; there will be no exports and subsidy on it this year.

 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 US trade deficit flares up on low exports
																								Washington, Aug. 13 (Reuters): The US trade deficit widened much more than expected in June, hitting a record $55.8 billion as the biggest drop in exports in nearly three years combined with record imports, the government said on Friday. 																								Wall Street economists had expected the deficit to widen, but looked for a gap of just $47 billion. In its report, the commerce department also revised Mays trade shortfall to $46.9 billion from the previously reported $46 billion. 																								The department said exports fell 4.3 per cent to $92.8 billion in June, the biggest decline since September 2001 and the weakest performance since February. At the same time, imports climbed 3.3 per cent to an all-time high of $148.6 billion, partly reflecting a run-up in oil prices. 																								Crude oil prices hit $33.76 a barrel, according to the departments measure, the highest price since March 1982. The quantity of crude imported also rose to a record level. 																								While other recent data had led economists to expect an upward revision to the governments measure of second-quarter economic growth, the trade data was likely to lead them to lower their sights. 																								The government said US gross domestic product advanced at a 3 per cent annual rate, a sharp slowdown from the swift 4.5 per cent pace at the start of the year. 																								The trade report showed the politically sensitive trade gap with China widened to a record $14.2 billion as exports eased and imports soared to an all-time high. US manufacturers and labour groups complain that Beijings policy of holding the value of its currency, the yuan, steady against the dollar has given it an unfair trade advantage. 																								The Bush administration has claimed it is making progress getting China to move toward a more flexible currency regime, but Democrats want to ratchet up the pressure with a trade investigation.

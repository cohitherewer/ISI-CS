 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Mutual agony
 Mutual funds have been hardest hit in the budget. Satish John sifts through it to study the implications																								Its the morning after B-Day and investors like Mohan Subramanian are scurrying to find out whether their carefully planned investments need a drastic overhaul. Not that they expected their investment plans to be cast in stone.																								The situation is particularly trying in these times when the financial markets of emerging economies like Indias evolve through trial and error. Subramanian, a middle-level executive in a local firm, believes that successful investors are those who are fleet-footed and adapt to changes quickly.																								One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of change, says management guru Peter Drucker.																								Subramanian and millions of other small investors have been trying to fathom the implications of a budget provision that slaps a transaction tax of 15 basis points on securities traded. 																								The tax means that for every purchase of securities worth Rs 1000, the investor will have to shell out an extra Rs 1.50 paise to the government exchequer. He doesnt mind paying it. After all, hes not a day trader who buys and sells shares in matter of minutes and the costs involved are not much, especially for long term-investors like Subramanian.																								Mutual fund analyst Dhirendra Kumar says two disasters have befallen investors.																								The Union budget 2004 contains some measures that will do severe damage to mutual fund investors, warns Kumar who heads Valueresearchonline.com, a website that tracks the mutual fund industry.																								The new provisions may push investors to directly invest in the stock markets as investing through mutual funds may become costlier if the finance bill becomes law.																								Investors like Subramanian have made a neat pile by investing in mutual funds recently. What the government has done is to drastically reduce the tax on the capital gains earned from equity investments. It has also completely eliminated tax on gains made from long-term equity investments. Sadly, the government has not extended this new tax regime to investments in equity mutual funds.																								The new budget provisions would entice investors like Subramanian to invest directly in the stock markets instead of routing investments through mutual funds who have professionals to manage funds.																								In effect, the government has made equity fund investment far more taxable than playing the stock markets directly, says Kumar.																								Further, all securities trading, including debt, will be taxed at 15 basis points of the value of the trade. In equities trading, this is a regressive and discriminatory tax, but is probably financially bearable, he adds.																								However, in the case of debt, this tax will often be actually higher than the maximum gains possible on a trade, he said.																								What this budget has clearly done is to encourage the long-term investor, says Hemant Rustagi, CEO WiseInvest Advisors, a leading distributor of investment products.																								India lacks an equity culture and the local markets need long-term investors, Rustagi reasons. Markets should have an ideal mix of fundamentals and technicals. Without short-term investors, the markets would be bereft of liquidity (volumes), a crucial commodity for price discovery. After all, it is the day traders who make up the daily volumes in the markets.																								Further, what the finance minister has done in the budget is to put a lid on the unabated rise in dividend stripping and bonus stripping indulged by mutual funds pandering to 65 per cent of their corporate investors.																								Rustagi maintains that the new provisions on distribution tax would affect corporate houses while leaving individual investors unscathed. Mutual funds will have to provide tax on dividends at 20 per cent from 12.5 per cent for companies, whereas distribution tax on dividend for small investors would remain at 12.5 per cent. 																								In view of the different tax structures, mutual funds will give different NAVs for institutions and individuals in the same mutual fund schemes, predicts Rustagi.																								While young investors like Subramanian are circumspect about their investment plans, their parents are heaving a sigh of relief.																								On the anvil is a friendlier scheme offering 9 per cent interest to senior citizens. Subramanian does not begrudge them that relief. As Pearl S. Buck, novelist once said, Our society must make it right and possible for old people not to fear the young or be deserted by them, for the test of a civilisation is the way that it cares for its helpless members.																								Dhirendra Kumar is at his despairing best on the governments U-turn on encouraging mutual fund investments. 																								Of course, the government of our country has a long track-record of making mistakes and then refusing to correct them out of sheer ego and cussedness. Lets hope (and pray, at least those of you who believe that prayers affects governments) that this doesnt turn out to be such a case, he says.																								Subramanian is willing to bide his time and is clearly not in a hurry. After the budget, the sensex fell 112 points on Thursday and recouped 102 points on Friday. 																								He doesnt feel vindicated yet, but believes in what Timothy Middleton said in The Bond King: At such times a basic confidence in the countrys future pays off, if one purchases securities and holds them until prosperity returns.

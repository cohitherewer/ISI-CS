 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Gas-fired Reliance power plant in Andhra
 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, July 15: Reliance Industries proposes to set up a 2000 MW gas-based power project at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. This was disclosed by state power secretary D. K. Panwar, who participated in discussions between Reliance officials and chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy.																								Panwar said the Reliance group also suggested that the Kakinada-Vishakpatnam belt be developed into an industrial hub.																								They presented a copy of the power policy of Uttar Pradesh, where the cost was pegged at Rs 2 per unit. Since the feedstock is available locally, the cost in Andhra Pradesh should be far below that benchmark, said Panwar.																								The Reliance offer has come in the wake of the Congress governments insistence that last years gas find off the Andhra coast be used for the states benefit.																								Reddy had voiced concern over Reliances proposal to set up a power project in Uttar Pradesh based on the feedstock from the high seas off the Andhra coast.																								Panwar said the commercial exploitation of gas by Reliance would start in October. The gas yield in the new find was 42 cubic meters per second, which will last almost 15 years, Reliance had earlier said.																								Reliance, which was chummy with the TDP government led by . Chandrababu Naidu, is now eager to build bridges with the current Congress regime.

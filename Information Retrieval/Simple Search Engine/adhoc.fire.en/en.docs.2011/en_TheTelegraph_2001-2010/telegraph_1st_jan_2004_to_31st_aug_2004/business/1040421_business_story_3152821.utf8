The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Markets feel part of the big league
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, April 20: Calpers, known to be choosy about where it invests, has focused on India, acknowledging the countrys growing reputation in global markets. The US-based pension fund has invested $2 billion in emerging markets.																								A portion of the $2 billion will be diverted to India. Whatever amount it is, the trend is important, DSP Merrill Lynch senior vice-president and head-equities Anup Maheshwari said. Changing the view on a country is typically viewed as positive, he added. Calpers has a reputation for being an influential market watchdog and a crusader for corporate governance.																								According to HDFC Securities head of research Jaideep Goswami, the visibility impact for India would be the huge positive.																								Institutional broking houses are already speculating on the mode of entry by Calpers  whether the company will register as an foreign institutional investor with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or invest through participatory notes.																								Pension funds are increasingly finding investment avenues narrowing in developed markets. As the demographic pattern gets more skewed towards the elderly, pension funds are increasingly under pressure for delivering reasonable returns. As a consequence, pension funds based in the US and Europe are looking at emerging markets like India and China to deliver attractive returns.

The division bench of the high court has directed Tata Power to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 315 crore against the earlier order of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to refund Reliance Energy in cash within 15 days.																								The Tata Power writ petition on sharing of standby charges has been referred to a soon-to-be-constituted appellate tribunal.																								Standby facility is used by a generating utility to augment supply when one of its units is not functioning. For sharing of standby charges, MERC had sought the advice of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).																								A Tata Power spokesperson said, This is an interim relief order. We are awaiting the formation of the appellate tribunal.

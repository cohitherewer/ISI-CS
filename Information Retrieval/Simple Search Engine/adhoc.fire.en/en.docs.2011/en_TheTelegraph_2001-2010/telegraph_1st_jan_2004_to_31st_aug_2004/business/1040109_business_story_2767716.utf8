 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Ex-Enron CFO in plea bargain talks 
																								Washington, Jan. 8 (PTI): Former chief financial officer of Enron, Andrew S. Fastow, is in negotiations with the government on a deal under which he would plead guilty and agree to a 10-year prison sentence, even as a Houston judge rejected a proposed plea bargain for his wife.																								Under the deal, Fasto, would help investigators find out what other top Enron executives knew about a scheme to manipulate the companys earnings.																								Lawyers for Fastow, whose trial on money laundering, fraud and other criminal charges are scheduled for April 20, met with prosecutors on Wednesday in Houston, the Washington Post reported today quoting sources familiar with the probe. 																								However, the status of the plea negotiations of Fastows wife, Lea W. Fastow, was in doubt on Wednesday after US district judge David Hittner rejected a deal that would have put her in prison for five months.

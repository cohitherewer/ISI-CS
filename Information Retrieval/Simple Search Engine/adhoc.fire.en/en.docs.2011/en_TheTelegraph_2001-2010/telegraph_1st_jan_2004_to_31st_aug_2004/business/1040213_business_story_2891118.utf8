 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Sahara ready for insurance foray
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: Sahara India Life Insurance has received the final regulatory approval  an R3 licence  from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) which will allow it to launch operations shortly.																								The regulatory approval ends the long wait and speculation surrounding Saharas insurance foray after Liyaquat Khan, president of the Actuarial Society of India and the then CEO, quit the firm last June.																								We have granted them the R3 licence just last week. The company has complied with all the necessary requirements, said IRDA chairman C. S. Rao.																								Sahara India Life, part of over Rs 12,000 crore Lucknow-based Sahara India group, is the second fully Indian private life insurance company to be formed after Reliance Life Insurance. To start with, the insurer has pegged its paid-up capital at Rs 157 crore.																								Although Khan refused to say why he quit, industry sources say, The financials and management of the company compelled him to take the decision.																								After receiving its in-principle R2 licence in early 2003, Sahara India Life was asked to file the name of its CEO, appointed actuary and management strength among other details to furnish R3, the operating licence.																								Reports indicate that . C. Sharma, former managing director of LIC, is taking over as the CEO of Sahara India Life. Another retired LIC official, K. K. Dharni, has been roped in to take over charge as the appointed actuary.																								Under the government rules, a retired official has to undergo a mandatory two-year cooling-off period before he joins any other private organisation. Sharma retired only in November 2002, which means that he still has a few months to go before he can take over as the CEO unless he gets the government to waive the requirement.

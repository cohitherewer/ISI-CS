 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Help at hand 																								Calcutta, March 7: Banks want a change in the management of sick and closed tea companies in order to provide financial help.																								According to the Tea Board of India estimates, there are 33 closed and sick tea gardens in North Bengal.																								Even though the Indian Banks Association (IBA) has worked out a financial restructuring package for the tea industry, public sector banks feel that the promoters of the tea companies are non-cooperative.																								We have made it clear to the Tea Board and the industry that we want a change in the management, a Calcutta-based public sector bank official said.																								Most of these promoters do not show up during any meeting, making it difficult for us to provide help to them, he added.																								A senior Tea Board official said, We cannot advise the banks to provide money. We have communicated this to the Union commerce ministry and the Bengal government.																								The commerce ministry said the promoters reluctance to invest in gardens was one of the factors that made them sick. A low equity base, high debt burden and ageing bushes are some of the other reasons. 																								Workers cannot be held responsible for the present status of the gardens. They are disciplined and willing to work. The tea associations and the state government should come forward and take up the issue with respective promoters, said a senior banker.																								Around 25,000 people work in these closed and sick tea estates. 																								The Tea Board had earlier taken an initiative to revive 25 sick and closed tea units in North Bengal.																								It had hired A. F. Ferguson to conduct a study of these gardens and suggest revival strategies. The gardens were divided into two categories  A (those which can be revived with financial assistance) and B (whose revival is doubtful, but something can be done with promoters support). 																								The consultant had submitted its report to the commerce ministry. Ferguson had taken into account the earnings before depreciation, interest and tax as the basis of its study.																								Based on Fergusons recommendation, the commerce ministry had asked banks and the board to work out a financial package for the eight sick and closed units out of these 25 gardens, so that they can be revived in five to seven years. 																								The Tea Board was asked to write off the loans it gave to these gardens. The government has said it will provide a 5 per cent interest subsidy to tea companies against fresh loans sanctioned to them by banks. The financial package has to be put in place by all the parties within a month. Some of the promoters have taken unsecured loans which they have failed to pay off.

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Iran petrochem invite buoys Indian Oil
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, March 10: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is eyeing a stake in a huge petrochemical plant in Iran and the due diligence exercise for the project has already begun. 																								A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran has offered a stake in an ongoing olefin project located in Bandar Imam. IOC is interested in picking up a decent stake that would allow board-level participation in the Iranian company, he added.																								The olefin plant forms a part of the petrochemicals hub at the Iranian port town that uses the countrys vast natural gas resources as feedstock. An IOC team visited Iran recently to get a first-hand feel of the ground realities. 																								A four-member team, comprising two representatives each of IOC and NPC, has been already at work to identify various areas for co-operation between the two companies. This project has emerged as the first concrete proposal. 																								IOC is also of the view that investing in the petrochemicals sector in Iran is a better business proposition than merely importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from that country. 																								The investment proposal for Iran forms part of the IOC vision to emerge as a leading player in petrochemicals in South East Asia by 2010-11. Having lost Indian Petrochemical Corporation (IPCL) to Reliance in the divestment sweepstakes, IOC has drawn up ambitious plans of expanding its own domestic capacities as well. It has started work on its Rs 5,000-crore petrochemicals plant at the Panipat refinery. The Rs 1,200-crore project at the Koyali refinery in Gujarat is also proceeding on schedule.																								Investment in petrochemicals business by processing the naphtha produced at its refineries is the logical step to move up the value chain. These projects will enable the company to absorb the domestic naphtha, which is becoming surplus with increasing oil refining capacities. 																								With greater emphasis on natural gas in the economy, it is likely that fertiliser and power units, which currently consume naphtha, could switch to using gas instead as it is cheaper. This would render even more naphtha surplus.																								Since Reliance has emerged as a near-monopoly in the petrochemicals sector, IOC is keen to fill the void and capture a neat chunk of the market. It had drawn up its mega Rs 6,000-crore plan to develop Haldia after taking over Haldia Petrochem (HPL). However, as the HPL management went for the investment proposed by Gail, the plan failed.

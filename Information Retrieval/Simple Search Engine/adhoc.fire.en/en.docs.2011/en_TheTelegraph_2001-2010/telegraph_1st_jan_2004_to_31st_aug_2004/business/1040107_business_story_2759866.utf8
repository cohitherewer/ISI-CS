The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 IOC-Gail suspense on Haldia deepens
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Open forum																								Calcutta, Jan. 6: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has opened talks with Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and other lenders of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) to invest in the Rs 5,170-crore company.																								The company is keen to invest in Haldia Petrochemicals. Our director (business development) recently met Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen. We are keen to hear from the state government. In the meantime, we are taking up the matter with IDBI and other lenders, sources in IOC said.																								The public sector oil-major has proposed to invest Rs 5,700 crore. The investment is divided into two parts  Rs 700 crore direct equity infusion in Haldia Petrochemical and the remaining Rs 5,000 crore in setting up petrochem-related plants in Haldia. IOC also wants some sort of control by investing such a large amount.																								It is not known if Gail (India) Limited, which reportedly wrote to HPL chairman Tarun Das saying it would like to invest alone to avoid of a conflict of interest, will stomach the idea of doing so with Indian Oil.																								The Bengal government, being one of the major promoters of the project, will have to take a decision on the matter. It is almost a situation of joint bidding. One has to see whose proposal the state government supports, a source from Haldia Petrochemicals said.																								A few days ago, Sen had said the state government, along with IOC, will work out a roadmap to give shape to the oil-majors investment proposal. He also mentioned that the roadmap will be worked out keeping in mind Gails investment proposal.																								A senior official of the state commerce and industry department said, We would not like to discuss Gails letter right now. We first want the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) to take place. Then we can talk about it.																								 I will not comment on Gails letter at this moment. What I can say is that the final negotiation of the promoters with the lenders ended yesterday. A package is expected shortly from the CDR cell, Sen said.																								Asked whether there will be an initial public offer of Rs 250 crore in the middle of this year, Sen said, The promoters have spelt out several options before CDR. This is one of them. The CDR cell will take a final view on all the options and come out with a package before January 22.

 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 IL amp;FS to sell stake in arm
 ANIEK PAUL																								Calcutta, Jan. 13: Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services (IL amp;FS) is looking to divest a minority stake in its asset management arm, IL amp;FS Mutual Fund, to an international player.																								. K. Sharma, president and chief executive officer of IL amp;FS Mutual Fund, said: Our sponsor, IL amp;FS, wants to rope in an international player as partner in the mutual fund arm. IL amp;FS will, however, retain majority stake in and management control of the asset management company.																								It appears that IL amp;FS, which now owns 100 per cent, could divest up to 49 per cent stake in its mutual fund arm. The size of the pie that we are going to divest is not pre-determined. It will be decided through negotiation with the potential partners, Sharma added.																								Discussion began with two to three global players in asset management six months ago. IL amp;FS is hopeful that it will be able to finalise an arrangement with one of them within the next few months, according to Sharma. The point of the proposed partnership with a global player is to bring in technical expertise in fund management, especially in investing in overseas markets.																								IL amp;FS Mutual Fund manages Rs 2,700 crore in assets through 13 schemes. Four of them are pure equity schemes, while the rest are debt-oriented or hybrid.																								Alongside, the fund house is also looking to grow through acquisition of passive players in the industry. Though he refused to name the funds that IL amp;FS Mutual Fund was eyeing, he hinted at some of the bank-sponsored ones. We are not looking to acquire a fund to grow our asset base. It must add value to our operation, which we are fast scaling up, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 US plays hardball on back-office deals
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Zoellick and Jaitley in New Delhi on Monday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Bush administration, seeking a second term in office, will press ahead with the ban on business process outsourcing (BPO) to allay job-loss fears.																								You have sensitive politics, so do we, US trade representative Robert Zoellick said today after meetings with commerce minister Arun Jaitley and national security adviser Brajesh Mishra.																								Adopting a tough posture, Zoellick linked any softening of the stand on BPO with India opening its doors to US farm goods. An upset Jaitley hit back by saying: It is strange that, on the one hand, people are talking about opening of markets, and on the other, banning business process outsourcing. Our agriculture is fragile since it is not subsidised, like in the US. 																								Asked whether he had given any assurance to the commerce minister in the past that the US government would not support anti-BPO law, Zoellick said: Trade is a two-way street...it should be a win-win deal. We have to see how we can create additional jobs on both sides. 																								Zoellick said anxiety over job losses in the US underpinned legislation banning outsourcing in some states  something that has unsettled many in India. He pointed to US trade deficit of $500 billion. India sells goods and services worth $13 billion to the US while its imports are $4 billion, leaving a $9-billion deficit.																								The imbalance can be corrected if India opens up services and agriculture. This will strengthen US hands in lifting the ban, Zoellick said, adding the planned bar on outsourcing in government was within multilateral trading rules. It is India which did not agree to a WTO agreement on government procurement.																								Zoellick, on a whirlwind world tour to narrow differences on the Doha development agenda after the collapse of the Cancun talks, left no doubt that US own interests were paramount, and that there was little scope for accommodating developing countries ahead of polls. 																								On a more diplomatic note, he said there were commonality of views on some of the contentious WTO issues between India and the US. There are some similarities on issues like elimination of export subsidies on agriculture and cutting domestic support. India will have to open up by bringing down its tariff wall, which was as high as 112 per cent, he said.																								Zoellick said though reforms have reduced tariffs in India, they are still high with a bound rate of 34 per cent and a peak of 20 per cent against 3 per cent in the US.																								On pushing the Doha development agenda forward, he said the recovery in the US economy bolstered Washingtons belief in broadening and deepening trade. The success of the Doha round will help countries like India and China emerge even stronger, Zoellick added.

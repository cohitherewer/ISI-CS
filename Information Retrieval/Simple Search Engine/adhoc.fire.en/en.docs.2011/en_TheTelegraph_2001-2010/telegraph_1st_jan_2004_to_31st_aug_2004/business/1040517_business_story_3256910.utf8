The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Track of hope for wagon makers
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Change of guard 																								Calcutta, May 16: The ailing wagon industry, 80 per cent of which is based in Bengal, is pinning its hopes of survival on the installation of a new government.																								Industry watchers say the Left parties, which had been railing against the steep fall in wagon orders from the railways, are expected to raise in Parliament, the issue of raising sales to its only customer.																								They have also pointed out that about two lakh workers engaged in the states wagon industry are struggling to make ends meet because of lack of orders.																								About half-a-dozen units based in Bengal, both in private and public sectors, have a combined manufacturing capacity of more than 30,000 wagons annually. But in the last five years, the orders were far less than their capacity, adding to the woes of the industry.																								Barring the K.K. Birla-owned Texmaco, most other wagon manufacturing companies slipped into the red, leaving large number of employees in the lurch.																								We hope the situation will change when Left parties wield greater control in the new government, a senior official of Burn Standard amp; Company (BSCL) said.																								A senior Burn Standard executive said the railways lopsided wagon procurement system has also led to a crisis in the availability of rakes, a situation that has hit the cement and steel makers hard.																								Over the past five years, orders from railways have been much less than what is required to meet the needs of cement, steel and coal industries  the fundamental elements for infrastructure development.																								Last year, only 20,000 wagons were bought, and the orders released late. As a result, barely 40 per cent of the orders could be delivered by the wagon manufacturers in the state, the Burn Standard official said.																								The order book situations of all companies remained similar in the past few years, pushing them to the brink of a financial meltdown, he added.																								The CPI(M) MP Basudeb Acharia had, on several occasions, taken up the matter in Parliament, but failed to make much headway in improving the situation.																								There is also a proposal that railways should take over BSCL, which is the largest manufacturer of wagons in the country today. The company, which is a subsidiary of the Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam Ltd, has three manufacturing units in West Bengal. But all the three units are in lying in an idle state because of the lack of orders, the official said.

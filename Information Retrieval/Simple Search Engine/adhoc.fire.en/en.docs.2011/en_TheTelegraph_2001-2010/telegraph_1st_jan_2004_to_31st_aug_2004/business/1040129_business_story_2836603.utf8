 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Broadband call for basic phone operators 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Association of Basic Telecom Operators (ABTO) in its new avatar as the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India plans to focus on broadband and enhanced consumer services, including lower tariff.																								The ABTO under the leadership of Reliance Infocomm has changed its name to Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India (AUTSPI).																								Its first president, Prakash C. Bajpayee, announced the new name of the association and unveiled the national agenda that it plans to pursue with the government over the next one year.																								Top on the list is to get the additional spectrum allocated for launching broadband services. This would allow the operators with a unified licence to offer high quality multimedia services, internet and other IT-enabled facilities over the mobile devices.																								We have to improve the broadband penetration from a dismal 0.2 per cent to a higher level soon. The trend of offering broadband services on mobile phones has started worldwide. It is a capital intensive industry and broadband will need an additional capital, Bajpayee said.																								He said most of the operators are ready with 3G infrastructure and can upgrade their network as and when the additional spectrum is allocated. 																								Among the other issues that the association will take up next year will be rollout of interconnect user regime and numbering plans as and when the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India finalises it.

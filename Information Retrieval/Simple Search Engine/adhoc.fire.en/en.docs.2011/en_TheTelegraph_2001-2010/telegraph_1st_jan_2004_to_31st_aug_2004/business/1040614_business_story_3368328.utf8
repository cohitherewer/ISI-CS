 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Adani firm plans capex
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 13: Adani Wilmar Ltd, a 50:50 venture between Adani Exports and the Singapore-based Wilmar Trading Pte Ltd, has envisaged capacity expansion, higher utilisation of its units and acquisitions to consolidate its presence in the edible oils and fats industry.																								Adani Wilmar, which markets its edible oil range under the brand name Fortune, has laid down a target to sell about 50,000 tonnes of edible oil per month by the last quarter of 2005. 																								The company plans to achieve this by expanding operations and attaining a 100 per cent capacity utilisation of its existing units. Adani Wilmar is now in the final stages of completing its over Rs 100-crore expansion project at the Mundra plant in Gujarat. 																								The modified unit would produce 2,200 tonnes of refined oils per day and 400 tonnes of vanaspati and speciality fats. 																								According to general manager, sales and marketing, Angshu Mallick, with this expansion, the Mundra unit will be the single largest plant in the country. 																								Adani Wilmar was ranked as the fastest growing FMCG company in 2003 with a growth of over 94 per cent (AC Nielsen). Though a growth of 95 per cent year-on-year would be steep keeping in mind the large base, the company expects to be quite close to this figure and retain its position this year too, Mallick added.																								While the category has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 27 per cent between 1999 and 2003, Mallick said last year it was the fastest growing category in the FMCG segment.																								If GDP growth continues at 7 per cent and there are normal monsoons, we see no reason why this growth rate could not be sustained. In India, 60 per cent of the population depends on agriculture and any increase in disposal income is first diverted to food. With the governments new plan for investments in agriculture, we see an increase in spending power of rural India, which should definitely lead to growth in this category, he added.																								Adani Wilmar had initially gone in for setting up port-based refineries. Over the years, it also opted for hinterland refineries at Indore and the company acquired the Mantralayam (Andhra Pradesh) plant from ITC.

 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Rourkela Steel on growth path
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug 7: Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), the only loss-making unit of the state-run steel major, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), is set to turn around in the current financial year.																								The buoyancy in the steel market has helped the plant to improve sales and bottomline substantially in the first quarter of the current fiscal.																								While sales grew by over 20 per cent at Rs 820 crore during the April-June, net profit, achieved in the first quarter after a long time, stood at Rs 55 crore.																								A senior SAIL official said the profit could have been bigger if the supply of coal had been smooth. All other inputs, including labour, are in place and production should have been at least 7 per cent higher had the coal supply been regular. 																								In the recent past, RSP had been going through a bad patch because of the heavy pay-out on interest and depreciation. Because of labour problem, productivity had also been dismal compared to other SAIL plants.																								But now the situation has changed and the plant is well placed to take off with substantial net profit, the source said.																								The plant has set an internal target of achieving a net profit of Rs 250-300 crore during the current financial year. We will not be surprised if the profit is even more, they added.

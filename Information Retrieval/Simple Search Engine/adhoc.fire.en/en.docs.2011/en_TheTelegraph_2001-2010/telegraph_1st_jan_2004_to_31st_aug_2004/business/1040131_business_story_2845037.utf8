 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 CSO cuts 2002-03 growth rate to 4%
 OUR BUREAU New Delhi, Jan. 30: The  government has revised its gross domestic product (GDP)  growth rate for the 2002-2003 to 4 per cent from the earlier  estimated 4.3 per cent.																								The latest data released by Central Statistical Organisation showed growth was aided by the manufacturing along with mining and quarrying sectors, both of which rose 8.8 per cent.																								However, it was dragged down by the agriculture sector, which holds the power to sway overall growth, due to a devastating drought. Overall growth fell from around 5 per cent clocked in the previous financial year and over 7 per cent in the mid-nineties.																								With two thirds of Indias one billion-plus population dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, the June-to-September monsoon is vital not only for farm output, which accounts for a quarter of GDP, but also for consumer demand. 																								However, there is a silver lining as growth for the current fiscal will now climb due to the lower base and aided by a bumper crop output.																								The railways, however, rose 5.7 per cent during the year, transport 6.0 per cent, communication 22 per cent, banking and insurance 11.6 per cent, real estate 5.9 per cent and other services clocked 6.2 per cent.																								The figures also showed that per capita income rose 1.8 per cent to Rs 10,964 during the year from Rs 10,774 a year ago. Economists estimate GDP to grow by more than 7 per cent this year making India one of the fastest growing economies in Asia this year.

 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 End-July date for TCS mega maiden offer
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 15: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is keen to launch the countrys largest private-sector maiden offer by the end of this month. There are indications that TCS would like the launch to coincide with group founder JRD Tatas birth anniversary and centenary celebrations of the group on July 29.																								However, all depends on the company securing the market regulators approval. Merchant bankers to the issue have put forward two plans  one that opens on July 23 and the other on July 29.																								TCS officials feel it is speculative to comment on the date, while sources say the company has submitted the clarification sought by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).																								TCS will approach the registrar of companies (RoC) after Sebi clears the offer. The company will need another 10 days to launch the IPO after all these formalities are completed.																								Sebi had sought some clarifications in the draft red-herring prospectus filed by the company in the first week of July. 																								TCS, set up in 1968, has pioneered the booming software industry in the country. Software companies that were set up decades after TCS, like Narayana Murthys Infosys and Azim Premjis Wipro, are already listed on the bourses in India and leading global bourses like New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.																								DSP Merrill Lynch, JM Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company (affiliated to Goldman Sachs) are investment bankers for the issue. Broker fees																								In a bid to settle the issue of broker registration fees, Sebi today launched an interest liability regularisation scheme for those in the cash segments.																								Under this one-time settlement scheme, if a broker pays the entire outstanding principal fee and 20 per cent of the outstanding interest as on a specified date in the regularisation period, the balance outstanding interest (80 per cent) would be waived, Sebi said.																								The regularisation period would be between October 15 and November 15, a Sebi official said. 																								After the scheme expires, a stock broker with outstanding registration fee liabilities would have to pay the entire outstanding amount, including interest. 																								They also would be liable to enforcement action under the rules.

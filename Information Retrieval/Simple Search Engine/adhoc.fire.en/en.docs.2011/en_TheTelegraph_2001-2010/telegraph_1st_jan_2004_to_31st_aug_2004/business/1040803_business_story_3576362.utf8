The company will target children and is planning a slew of Indian titles, a senior group official said. 																								Yash Birla was not available for comment.

Publication houses like Navneet have already sensed this, say analysts tracking the segment.																								Yash Birlas firm is already involved in the business by virtue of developing an educational software that enables school teachers to use computers as a medium of education.																								The group has interests in machine tools, carpets too. 																								The publishing company plans to introduce a smart start series for three-year olds and above.

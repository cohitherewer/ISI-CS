Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, April 23: Philips India Limited (PIL) has decided to sell its high-technology plastics division based in Loni-Kalbhor, near Pune, within three to six months.																								Shareholders approved the planned sale at the 74th annual general meeting of the company today. Talks with prospective buyers are under way and a deal should be clinched by December. 																								Philips intends to sell the unit, which makes high-tech plastics used in electronic voting machines and automobiles, even after a restructuring implemented last year brought down the staff strength from 308 to 142.																								The division contributed less than 3 per cent to the company turnover and the proportion of internal sales declined substantially. The Dutch parent has already taken the decision to sell of the division globally, vice-chairman and managing director K. Ramachandran said after the annual general meeting this evening. The Loni property has already been valued. 																								Last year, we showed satisfactory performance mainly due to better product mix, better management of working capital and lowering of the interest cost. The same trend will continue in the current fiscal, chairman S. M. Datta said.																								Having finalised the sale of its plastics wing, Philips is planning a shared centre in Chennai to handle global service-related assignments of Philips.

 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Switch-off signal for free farm power 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 24: The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government is likely to revive the concept of an all India minimum farm power tariff of 50 paise per unit. Eventually, it proposes to raise farm power rates to the level of 50 per cent of the average cost of generation.																								Sources in the power ministry said the issue would be taken up during the discussions with various state governments and other stakeholders in the power sector. 																								In 1996, a conference of chief ministers had adopted a common minimum national action plan for power (CMNPP) that said no sector shall pay less than 50 per cent of the average cost of supply. 																								It had also been agreed upon that power tariff for the agricultural sector should not be less than 50 paise per unit and raised to 50 per cent of the average cost in not more than three years.																								However, states have not been able to implement the agreement.																								Punjab was one of the first states to announce farm power tariff at 50 paise per unit but in the absence of proper metering had to junk that plan. At present, Tamil Nadu and Andhra are offering free power to farmers. 																								Union power minister P. M. Sayeed today reiterated that the Electricity Act 2003 would be reviewed with respect to two issues  reorganisation of state electricity boards and the separation of trading and transmission utilities.																								Delivering the inaugural address at a conference on Electricity Act 2003: The year after, Sayeed said, We are committed to the national common minimum programme that promises review of the Electricity Act 2003. The central government has prepared the draft National Electricity Policy after consulting the states and other stakeholders.																								The draft policy set the priority for development of power sector in accordance with the national common minimum programme. The policy will be finalised after further round of consultations with state governments so that we try and build a consensus.																								Sayeed said the mandatory date of June 10 for unbundling and replacing the SEBs has been extended. There is no other clause in the act on which a review has been sought. If there are any bottlenecks in the implementation of the act, we will look into them as and when need arises, Sayeed said.																								He said 13 states  West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Meghalaya and Punjab  are yet to reorganise their SEBs in accordance with the guidelines of the Electricity Act 2003. 																								The 13 states have requested the central government for more time. The proposal also indicated the time frame within which the states propose to complete the reorganisation of SEBs. The central government has conveyed its consent to the states, quot; said the power minister.

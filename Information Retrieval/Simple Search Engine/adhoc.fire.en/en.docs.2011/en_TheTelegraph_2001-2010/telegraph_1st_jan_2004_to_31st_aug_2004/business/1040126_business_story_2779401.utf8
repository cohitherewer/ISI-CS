 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Jan 25: The HRH group of hotels, run by the former Maharanas of Mewar, is on an expansion spree.																								We are in the process of finalising four properties in eastern Rajasthan. These can be acquisitions, management or pure marketing contracts. Also, our Ramgarh resort property will soon be turned into a spa, said Arvind Singh Mewar, chairman and managing director, HRH group of hotels and former Maharana of Mewar.																								With tourist inflow taking a nosedive post November 11, Mewars hotel chain suffered losses as did many other resorts and tourist hotels. However, the former Maharana hopes a booming Indian economy, better tourist inflows, cheaper air fares will lure more travel into India this year. 																								The last two years particularly have been bad for the tourism industry and therefore for us as well. But this year we hope to do well. We will make an investment of Rs 30-40 crore in the four new properties, said Mewar.																								Hence the decision to snap up four new properties to add to the groups 8-hotel chain, all of which have been set up by converting various royal properties.

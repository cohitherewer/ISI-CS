Of six million tonnes of products that the Bina refinery will produce annually, Hindustan Petroleum has indicated a requirement of 1.4 to 1.6 million tonnes of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene for marketing in Madhya Pradesh.																								The Bina refinery, where BPCL holds a 51 per cent stake, will be completed in the second half of 2008. The Oman oil company holds about 2 per cent interest and the remaining equity is to be offered to a strategic partner.

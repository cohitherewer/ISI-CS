 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Guidelines on intra-circle telecom mergers this week
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: The government will issue guidelines on intra-circle mergers and acquisitions this week, paving the way for big-ticket consolidation in the telecom industry.																								The issue of intra-circle mergers and acquisitions will be placed before me tomorrow or the day after and I will be able to report on it in two days, communications and IT minister Arun Shourie said at a technology summit here today.																								The guidelines are being eagerly awaited by the telecom industry. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had earlier recommended that in case of intra-circle merger of telecom service licensees, the frequency spectrum of the merging entities should be combined.																								However, it had put a ceiling on the maximum spectrum that a merged entity can hold. In metros and category A circles, the maximum spectrum is 15 MHz. In category B and category C circles, the cap is at 12.4 Mhz. Trai had also recommended that all intra-circle mergers should have the approval of the department of telecommunications.																								Trai had also said mergers and acquisitions should be subject to certain conditions like a minimum of three operators in a circle. In its guideline, Trai had said a competent authority (licensor) would examine the impact of a merger in cases where the marketshare of the merged entity is greater than 50 per cent and where concentration of the top two firms in a post-merged scenario is over 75 per cent.																								The hike in the foreign investment limit in telecom services to 74 per cent from 49 per cent will be looked into after the elections, the minister said. Only the Prime Minister and the deputy Prime Minister can decide on this issue, he added. 																								This issue has been hanging fire for the last few months with some agencies opposing the move on grounds of threat to national security. 																								Mobile telecom service providers like Bharti Tele-Ventures and Hutchison will be the main beneficiaries of a sharp hike in FDI limits. 																								Emphasising on the role of an independent regulator, Shourie said a certain portion of the licence fee should be made available to the regulator, but the issue needed to be discussed at length.																								A regulator has to be independent. The funding must be independent and adequate, he said.																								On the contentious issue of rollout of telecom services in rural areas, Shourie said the licensing norms needed to be tightened to ensure the adherence of all companies.																								Be careful in formulating clauses and be merciless on adherence, he said citing examples of companies like HFCL which took the plea that since BSNL had rolled out its services in certain rural areas in Punjab it did not have to do the same thing again.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Bharti inks deal with Siemens
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta/New Delhi, July 1: Bharti Tele-Ventures (BTVL) today outsourced a major project in the east worth about Rs 250 crore ($50-million) to Siemens Mobile to build, manage and maintain AirTel networks in the three circles of Calcutta, Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.																								Bharti is currently setting up the network in the Bengal circle, where it expects to launch the AirTel brand by the second week of October.																								Under the agreement, about 50 Bharti employees will be absorbed by Siemens. BTVL CEO (eastern region) Deepak Gulati said, The agreement is on a capacity on demand and pay-as-you-grow basis. It will provide seamless coverage in over 150 towns, national highways and rail routes in the three circles. Siemens will also manage the network capacity expansion.																								The deal bagged by the mobile communications group of Siemens AG is similar to one signed with Ericsson by Bharti early this year for Rs 2000 crore to build and manage 13 circles.																								AirTel plans to roll out its operations in Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa by the quarter ending December.																								Of the three circles, Calcutta was acquired from Spice. The Bengal circle is part of the second licence which it received in 2004 since there were no other bidders. The licence to offer mobile services in Madhya Pradesh was sought as part of bidding held in 2000.																								BTVL president (mobility) Manoj Kohli said, The agreement with Siemens takes forward our vision of aligning the interest of the operator and the vendor partner to meet the needs of our customers.																								The three-year service agreement with Siemens involves management, maintenance, quality assurance and capacity expansion of the AirTel networks in these three circles. 																								The initiative is aimed to provide end-users a congestion-free network with seamless coverage and enhanced quality in over 150 towns and cities in the three circles.

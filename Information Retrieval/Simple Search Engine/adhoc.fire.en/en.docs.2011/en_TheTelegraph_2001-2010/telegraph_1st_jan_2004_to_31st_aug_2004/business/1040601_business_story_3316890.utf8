 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Singh: Balancing act																								New Delhi, May 31: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh amid mounting concerns that his ministry would have to swallow duty cuts to shield local consumers from the impact of a flare-up in global crude prices.																								Chidambaram refused to say what transpired at the meeting. I will not comment. We will tell you when necessary.																								However, finance ministry officials said the finance minister briefed Singh on the revenue impact of customs and excise duty cuts on crude in discussions that took into account various options available.																								North Block officials feel that oil prices will have to be increased by a certain degree and duty cuts alone cannot resolve the problem. In all likelihood, the Prime Minister and the finance minister will take the middle path of balancing duty cuts with price increases.																								One of the options discussed was a price increase of Re 1, though finance ministry officials would like it to be slightly higher.																								The Centre would also like the state governments to reduce the sales tax on petroleum products. However, officials conceded this could not be done overnight. Chidambaram: Lips sealed 																								Chidambarams meeting today comes close on the heels of petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars letter to the Prime Minister, citing the high excise duties and other levies which account for more than 50 per cent of the price of transport fuels.																								Aiyar had conveyed to Singh that if the government wanted to avoid the politically unpalatable decision of a sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products, the taxes on these would have to be scaled down. 																								This is considered as the only solution for the oil firms in deep financial trouble as they have been asked not to pass on the high crude price to consumers.																								Any reduction in duties will have to be undertaken by the finance ministry, which has turned down the request of the petroleum ministry in the past.

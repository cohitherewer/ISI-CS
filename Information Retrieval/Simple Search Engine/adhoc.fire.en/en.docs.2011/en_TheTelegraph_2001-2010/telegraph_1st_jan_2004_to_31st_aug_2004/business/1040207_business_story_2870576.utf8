 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Upbeat Jaswant ignites hopes for 8% growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Singh: On a high																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: Union finance minister Jaswant Singh today likened the Indian economy  which is projected to grow at the rate of 8 per cent this fiscal, making it the second-fastest growing economy in the world  to a dynamo that was just waiting to be jump-started.																								Addressing a post-interim budget meeting organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Singh said: We want to tell the West that their stereo-typing of India is all wrong. We are now witnessing a psychological liberation. Im not overstating anything.																								It is Indias destiny to have a rate of growth in excess of 8 per cent, he said.																								Clarifying his position as the fiscal manager of the country, he said, It will be a mistake on the part of any finance minister to micro-manage the economy.																								The government should not confuse people with too much detail but only deal with the centrality of issues, the finance minister said. My only endeavour is to give people a sense of confidence in the management of the economy, he added.																								The NDA government has been hyping the feel-good factor in the economy as it prepares to take the message of good governance to the electorate, which will vote at the next general elections scheduled some time in late April.																								Singh said the feel-good factor would last as the fundamentals of the economy were strong.																								I sense that India is bubbling underneath. It only requires economic managers of the country to lift the lid, the finance minister said.																								With the government achieving an above 17 per cent growth in revenues, Singh said, If we have achieved revenue growth without having to take any additional revenue measures, there is something somewhere that we have done right.																								The one area of concern was that foreign direct investment (FDI) was not pouring into the country. 																								I have yet to figure out why more investment is not taking place in India? What is the inhibiting factor? quot;																								Admitting that the inflow of FDI was low due to the complexities within the system, Singh promised, We will definitely improve the situation on that front.

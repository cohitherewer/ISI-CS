 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Tirupur poised for makeover
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, Aug. 28: The textile town of Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is set for a dramatic change in the coming year when quotas will be lifted and a project for clean water will be flagged off.																								On January 1, the textile quota barriers will be ripped off and clean, drinkable water will be supplied to the residents from April. 																								A unique partnership between the state government, a public utility and private enterprises will ensure that Tirupur, a town that relies on tanker water, enjoy clean water for the first time.																								The Rs 1000-crore project is spawned by New Tirupur Area Development Corporation (NTADCL), a special purpose vehicle having the local municipality, the Tirupur Exporters Association and Mahindra Infrastructure Developers among its shareholders.																								The state government will ensure water supply from the Cauvery river, 65 km from Tirupur. The government has also approved the tariffs, which will be far lower than the current rates.																								There will be no subsidy of any kind. The project will be made financially viable, Mahindra Infrastructure Developers executive director Dinesh Tandon said.																								The success of the project will spawn other similar ventures, Tandon said. 																								Tirupur will attract many businessmen after the project comes up as a lack of clean water acted as a deterrent. It will be an image makeover for the town as well, he said. 																								Water is a crucial raw material for the textiles industry, Tandon said.																								According to sources, the municipal corporation plans to levy a fee of around Rs 7 for 1000 litres of water for households and Rs 40 for industries.																								The differential pricing by levying a higher tariff for industries will enable the municipal corporation to offer households a subsidised rate.																								Industry analysts associated with the project said the textile companies in Tirupur do not mind paying a higher tariff as it is still lower than Rs 60 per 1000 litres they pay for water transported through tankers. An added advantage is that the water is clean and drinkable, they said. Infrastructure companies like Mahindra Infrastructure Developers, Wilbur Smith and IDFC are looking forward to this project.																								Dewas, an industrial town in Madhya Pradesh, is keen to hive off its water supply utility, but is probably waiting for Tirupur to pave the way.

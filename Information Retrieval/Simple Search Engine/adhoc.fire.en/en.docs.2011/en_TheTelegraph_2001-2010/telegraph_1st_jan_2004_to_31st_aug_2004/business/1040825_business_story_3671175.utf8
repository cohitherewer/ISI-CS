The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Zensar zeroes in on US firm 
 M RAJENDRAN 				 	 Natarajan: In expansion mode																								Pune, Aug. 24: Zensar Technologies, an RPG Group company, will acquire a US company focused on retailing and financial services that will add $15-20 million to its revenues during 2004-05.																								It is also planning to undertake large acquisitions in 2006-07.																								Ganesh Natarajan, deputy chairman and managing director of Zensar, said, We will expand our presence in core application portfolio management, which includes retail and financial services, through acquisition. Next year, we will be acquiring companies for our BPO operations. We are targeting IT companies based in the US and not in India.																								Zensar is a joint venture in which Fujitsu and RPG Group hold 30 per cent each. The UK-based Electra Captive Funds holds another 22 per cent through its subsidiary, Electra Partners Mauritius Ltd. The public holds about 5 per cent, while the rest is with the employees.																								The company is aiming to boost revenues by 30-40 per cent this year and hopes to ratchet up revenues to $100 million by 2005. The company logged revenues of $59.3 million in 2003-04.																								We will continue to have organic growth in migration, product and enterprise resource planning. Telecom and utility will also be major focus areas for the company in the future. But, our goal is to become a $100-million company by end of 2005 through both organic and inorganic growth, Natarajan said.																								Zensar is optimistic about robust growth in revenues due to resurgence in the IT sector. It expects revenue growth to be buoyed by the merger and acquisitions of companies and the improvement in business process outsourcing after the US presidential elections in November.																								The company also plans to position itself in the markets of the US, Europe, Japan and Australia as a migration specialist with its unique Simply Better Productivity (SBP) model.																								The advantages of SBP are that it reduces time to market due to automation and re-use capabilities, allows easy migration and integration of legacy applications to open systems, reduces maintenance cost, allows companies to leverage new technology, using platform independent design, Natarajan said.																								As part of its expansion of infrastructure, the company has invested about Rs 60 crore to set up a 3000-seat campus in Pune that will be functional by October.																								Zensar future plans include expansion into key verticals.

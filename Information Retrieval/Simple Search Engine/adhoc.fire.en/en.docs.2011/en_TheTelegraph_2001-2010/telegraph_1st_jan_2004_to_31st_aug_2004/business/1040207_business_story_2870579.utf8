The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Smart debut for global deposits
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Good going																								Mumbai, Feb. 6: Citibank Indias global banking products for resident individuals were launched today amid indications that 200 of the several potential customers who made enquiries will actually lap up the new schemes.																								ICICI Bank is also betting that a similar plan to be launched by it next week will be greeted just as enthusiastically.																								These banks are among the first to woo customers after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the liberalised remittance scheme of $25,000 for resident individuals. Both banks have set the floor at $5000 (Rs 2.26 lakh).																								The relaxation by RBI, seen as a step towards capital account convertibility, would enable resident individuals to remit up to $25,000 per calendar year. Apart from holding foreign currency accounts, an individual can acquire immovable property, shares and other assets overseas.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Citibank India marketing director, retail banking, Amit Sah said while the banks branches have been flooded with enquiries about the scheme on the first day of its launch, it could see over 200 conversions to begin with. The response has been wonderful, he added.																								Citibank is offering a higher interest rate at 1 per cent over Libor. Its rates for a two-month period are 2 per cent on dollar deposits, 3 per cent on euro and 4.75 per cent on pound sterling. However, the rates may be revised after two months.																								The facility enables a resident individual to buy various assets such as mutual funds, equities, global bonds and other structured products in addition to investing in immovable property. Sah said Citibank will be offering vanilla products to begin with.																								Citibank officials said while its customers holding accounts for a minimum period of one year can avail of the scheme, others will have to provide a statement from their respective banks.																								Though competition is bound to increase with other banks joining the fray, Sah is not worried. According to him, Citibank is in a position to offer superior services to customers by leveraging on its global presence and expertise in various platforms.																								ICICI Bank, on the other hand, is planning to launch international deposits scheme for resident individuals in a variety of currencies and tenors.																								Senior officials of ICICI Bank said it would offer these deposits in five currencies, including dollar, pound, Swiss franc, euro and Australian dollar. The product will be offered in Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune and Chandigarh.

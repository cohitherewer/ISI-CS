 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Hint of mergers in textiles
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 29: With the deadline looming for the phase-out of world textile quotas by January 2005, India Inc feels that consolidation and restructuring will be the key factors that will determine its ability to raise its share of the $50-billion world textile trade by 2010.																								A study conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to assess the scenario after the multi-fibre arrangement ends this year said the industry is of the view that informal business pools should be developed among clusters for capacity consolidation to maximise returns without cannibalising the customer.																								The study titled Introspecting competitiveness of the textile sector in southern region has been undertaken to assuage industry uncertainties over this major development. 																								It is largely felt that the formation of business pools will enable a single reference point for an international customer. It will also significantly contribute to profitability. 																								Mergers and acquisitions will follow such a relationship, says the study. 																								At present, Indias share in textile trade stands at a meagre $11 billion, just 3 per cent of world textile trade.																								In a recommendation to attract both domestic and foreign capital into this industry, participants feel that the restructuring options of corporatisation, consolidation, cluster groups, textile upgradation funds, one-time settlements (OTS) and TRFs are required to be explored. 																								The study also states that the next step towards evolution would be a decentralised sector specialising in niche product range with shorter runs and smaller lot sizes, while the organised sector will focus on the opposite end of the spectrum.																								Both the segments need to exist to fulfil the demands of varying customer expectations, says CII.																								Recommending a shift from product orientation to service orientation, the participants are of the view that the textile industry needs to work closely and be participative with the customers in defining needs and not just focus on capacity utilisation. The first step towards it is to induct people from the FMCG, retail and telecom sectors to infuse fresh ideas.

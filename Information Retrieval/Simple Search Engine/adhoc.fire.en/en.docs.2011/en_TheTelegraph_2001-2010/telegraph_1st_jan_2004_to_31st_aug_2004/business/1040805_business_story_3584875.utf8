(PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has increased its billing collections to more than Rs 20,000 crore as West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have regularly paid their bills to the power utility during the last eight months.																								In a major turnaround, the three power defaulting states of West Bengal, UP and Bihar have paid 100 per cent of their billing since December 2003 till July 2004 amounting to more than Rs 2,000 crore.																								Ajay Shanker, additional secretary in the power ministry, said an additional corpus of Rs 7,000 crore has been infused into the system in the last nine months by ensuring 100 per cent billing collections for NTPC. Also the power utilitys generating efficiency was increased during the period to help it execute its pending power diversification drive.																								Addressing a seminar on Experience of power reforms and privatisation in Europe organised by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) here today, Shanker said the percentage of transmission and distribution losses have also been curtailed in the last eight to nine months, thereby adding to the revenue collections of NTPC.																								He said the NTPC management also improved its generating efficiency by introducing the required technical modifications in its generating plants all over the country, which has resulted in the efficient power supply management and improved its revenues.																								Earlier delivering the keynote address, Gordon Roberts, chairman of British Power International, said India should not be afraid of changes that are likely to take place in its power sector. He said Electricity Bill 2003 needed to be further modified as much provisions have not been incorporated in it to encourage private sector participation for the betterment of the power sector.																								Roberts ruled out any possibility of his companys investment in the state of Uttaranchal.

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 New norms for primary dealers
																								Mumbai, March 10 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced new guidelines for primary dealers (PDs) for investment in non-government securities to contain risks arising from their exposure to these instruments.																								Under the guidelines, which come into force with immediate effect, PDs should invest in rated non-government securities. They are barred from investing in securities of original maturity of less than one-year, except commercial paper and certificate of deposits.																								While making fresh investments in non-government debt securities, PDs should ensure that such investment are made only in listed debt securities, which should not exceed 10 per cent of the size of their non-government securities portfolio on an on-going basis. 																								The guidelines cover investments  through the primary and secondary market  in securities generally issued by companies, banks, financial institutions and state and central government-sponsored institutions, special purpose vehicles, the RBI said in a notification today.																								The investment covered by the guidelines are exposure to capital gains bonds, bonds eligible for priority sector status, bonds issued by central or state public sector undertakings with or without government guarantees and bonds issued by banks and financial companies, it said.																								These guidelines, however, would not be applicable to units of equity-oriented mutual fund schemes where any part of the corpus can be invested in equity, venture capital funds and investments in equity shares.																								The RBI clarified that the ceiling of 10 per cent will be inclusive of investment in security receipts issued by securitisation companies/reconstruction companies and also the investment in asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). 																								The unlisted non-government debt securities in which PDs may invest up to the limits specified above, should comply with the disclosure requirements as prescribed by the Sebi for listed companies, the central bank said.																								Considering the time required by issuers to get their unlisted debt issues listed on the stock exchanges, the RBI has provided transaction time to investment by PDs in units of mutual fund schemes where the entire corpus is invested in debt securities will be outside the purview of the above guidelines until December 31, 2004. 																								With effect from January 1, 2005 only investment in units of such mutual fund schemes, which have an exposure to unlisted securities of less than 10 per cent of the corpus of the fund, will be treated on par with listed securities for the purpose of compliance with the prudential limits prescribed in the above guidelines. 																								The PDs may invest in existing unlisted securities (issued prior to December 31, 2003) till December 31, 2004 provided the issuers have applied to the stock exchange(s) for listing and the security(ies) is/are rated minimum investment grade.

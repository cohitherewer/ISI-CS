 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 8: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today announced a major thrust for the infrastructure sector with the creation of a Rs 40,000-crore corpus, increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) ceiling for the telecom and civil aviation sectors, and tax breaks for the power and shipping industries.																								FDI has the potential to add a competitive edge, especially in the industrial sector. I, therefore, propose to raise the sectoral cap for FDI in telecommunication from 49 per cent to 74 per cent; in civil aviation from 40 per cent to 49 per cent; and in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, the finance minister said.																								He proposed to remove inadequacies in the infrastructure sector through a mix of policy and fiscal measures. The budget provides a thrust to water supply projects, ports, airports, railways, tourism and housing.																								The finance minister announced the setting up of an inter-institutional group consisting of financial institutions IDBI, IDFC, ICICI Bank, insurance behemoth LIC and banking majors State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank. The seven banks and financial institutions will pool their resources on a callable basis and a sum of Rs 40,000 crore would be made available as and when necessary for the infrastructure sector. 																								Presenting the first general budget of the United Progressive Alliance government, Chidambaram said: The IIG will ensure speedy conclusion of loan agreements and implementation of infrastructure sectors. Initially, airports, seaports and tourism will be the IIGs target sectors.																								He also fulfilled a long-standing demand of the telecom and civil aviation sectors on FDI.																								The governments proposal to raise the cap on FDI in civil aviation will spur the growth of aviation companies, said Captain Gopinath, CEO of the no-frills airline Deccan Aviation. Now we can find the resources abroad whenever we have problems raising funds here. This is good for aviation companies. 																								However, he added that the governments decision to withdraw exemption granted to Indian companies to lease aircraft or aircraft engines from foreign companies prospectively from September this year, will prove a stumbling block for firms that had planned to expand their fleet by leasing new aircraft. 																								All public sector enterprises in the infrastructure sector, including railways, will get a special push in the form of equity support of Rs 14,194 crore and a loan of Rs 2,132 crore.

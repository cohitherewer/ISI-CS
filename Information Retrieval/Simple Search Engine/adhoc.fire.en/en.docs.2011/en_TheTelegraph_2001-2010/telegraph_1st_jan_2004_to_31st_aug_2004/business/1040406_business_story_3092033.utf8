The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Bharti buys out Shyam Tele in Hexacom for Rs 430 crore 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mittal: Pulling it off																								Chennai April 5: Bharti Tele-Ventures today acquired Shyam Telecoms 67.5 per cent stake in Hexacom India Limited for Rs 430 crore in a cash-cum-share swap deal  and emerged as the leading mobile operator in Rajasthan. 																								The Sunil Mittal-promoted group signed a deal with the Shyam group for a consideration of Rs 430 crore which includes the premium for majority shareholding. The Bharti group will have a majority on the board.																								The transaction is principally a share-swap deal, wherein shares and optimally convertible redeemable debentures of Bharti Tele-Ventures are proposed to be issued to the Shyam group as swap for their holdings in Hexacom, a Bharti statement said.																								The deal will be funded by way of issue of equity shares of Bharti Tele-Ventures. The deal consists of three parts: Rs 75 crore worth of shares in BTVL, Rs 300 crore worth of optionally convertible redeemable debentures (OCRDs), and the remaining Rs 65 crore in cash. 																								Shyam Telecom holds a 10 per cent stake in Hexacom. Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL), a public sector company, holds 30 per cent and Telesystem International Wireless (TIW) of Canada holds 27.5 per cent. Shyam holds another 30 per cent through a holding company called Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Projects Ltd. Other financial investors have a 2.5 per cent stake. Shyam Telecom holds the majority stake in the holding company. 																								The Bharti group had earlier planned to pick up TIWs 27.5 per cent stake in Hexacom, a cellular operator in Rajasthan, for Rs 102 crore. 																								However, Shyam Telecom used the right of first refusal clause to oppose the deal and managed to pick up the 27.5 per cent stake of TIW. 																								TIW, which is a subsidiary of Telesystem (Mauritius), may also sell the minority stake held through a company called Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Hexacom. 																								TIW is dedicated to wireless operations, basic services and is a specialist in high growth markets. It is a provider of trunked mobile radio services in France and the UK and paging services in Mexico and the Netherlands. BTVL had also applied for a unified licence for the Rajasthan circle. 																								Bharti has already stated that it would like to have a majority stake in the company. When we took over Spice Calcutta, SkyCell in Chennai and JT Mobile in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab, it was a 100 per cent acquisition, quot; the release said. 																								They added that the company would be willing to pick up TCILs stake as and when the government decides to sell it. The acquisition is subject to a right of first refusal with the existing shareholder (TCIL) of Hexacom, regulatory and other necessary approvals. 																								This acquisition would give Bharti a presence in Rajasthan, thereby expanding its presence all over India. Bharti also intends to consolidate its stake in Hexacom as and when an appropriate opportunity comes its way. This will give Bharti a presence in Rajasthan, thereby expanding its footprint to 16 circles, the company said. 																								Ambit Corporate Finance advised Bharti on the transaction while Prime Securities advised the Shyam group. 																								Hexacom operates GSM mobile network in Rajasthan and has over 2.5 lakh subscribers as on March 31, 2004, with over 44 per cent share of the GSM market in Rajasthan. Hexacom also has a licence to offer GSM mobile services in the Northeast. 																								If all the conditions are met, the sale pursuant to this agreement is scheduled to close within the next two months, it said. 																								Hexacom offers mobile services with more than 48 per cent share of the GSM market. The other GSM operators in the state are Hutch and BSNL. 																								Shyam Telecom is one of the largest suppliers of radio, microwave and other telecom equipment in India.

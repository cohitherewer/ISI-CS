 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Stake cap not to limit bank consolidation
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, July 4: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to take a positive view of foreign banks wanting to acquire a private sector bank, provided the former complies with the central banks norms.																								This comes on the back of a fear in private banks that Fridays draft recommendations issued by the RBI may act as a dampener, fragmenting holdings and preventing foreign banks from taking an active interest in the sector.																								The 5 per cent ceiling proposed by the RBI is a major disincentive for foreign banks wanting to buy a stake in private sector banks.																								Analysts point out that if these recommendations are to be accepted, HSBC, which recently lifted a 14.7 per cent stake in UTI Bank, will have to bring it down to 5 per cent. Similarly, ICICI Bank will also have to pare its holdings in both Federal Bank and South Indian Bank where it has over 20 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively.																								An HSBC official said the bank would not like to comment as these are only draft guidelines. 																								Pravin Kumar Tayal of Bank of Rajasthan said he is studying the suggestions.																								However, a senior official with a leading private sector bank averred that the private banking sector is not likely to see any further consolidation due to the stake ceiling. 																								But RBI officials do not agree with such a negative view. A senior RBI official said the central bank is not against takeover of a private sector bank by a foreign or another entity.																								If a foreign or another bank is interested in a takeover, it will first have to specify its intentions to the RBI. The central bank will then consider whether the interested acquirer fits into the norms issued on February 3. However, if an approval is given, the foreign bank has a choice to gradually bring down its stake in the bank over a period of time, sources said.																								According to the guidelines issued in February, the RBI would take into account the integrity, reputation, track record in financial matters and source of funds for an acquisition to determine the eligibility of an applicant.																								The central banks policy has now only become more transparent with regard to ownership in private sector banks, the RBI official said, adding that its move will encourage foreign investment as overseas investors will now know the exact procedures for getting an RBI approval.

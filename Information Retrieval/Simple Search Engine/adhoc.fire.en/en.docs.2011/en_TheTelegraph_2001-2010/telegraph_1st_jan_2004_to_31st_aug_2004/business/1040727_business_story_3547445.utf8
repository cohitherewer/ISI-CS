 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Duty rejig pacifies hardware sector
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 26: The government today announced an additional duty on finished computers to neutralise the impact of the excise duty on components and peripherals. 																								This removed the anomaly created in the budget, wherein excise duty on finished computers was removed, while that on components remained at 16 per cent.																								The additional duty, under the Customs Tariff Act, is equivalent to that paid by local manufacturers to import parts and peripherals. 																								The rate is 7 per cent for a full system (CPU-box, monitor, keyboard and mouse) and 6 per cent for a CPU-box alone.																								The excise/countervailing duty on inputs would remain at 16 per cent, it said.																								The government has also abolished the customs duty on electro-mechanical parts like cabinets and key-switches from 5 per cent and on power supply from 10 per cent.																								There will not be any perceptible change in PC prices, which will continue at pre-budget levels, Mait executive director Vinnie Mehta said.																								The marginal drop in prices due to reduction in customs duty on electromechanical parts and power supply will be neutralised by the 2 per cent cess, he added.

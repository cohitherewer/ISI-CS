The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Suzuki sounded on Maruti stake sale
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Shourie in New Delhi on Friday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: The government today confirmed that it has started talks with Japanese auto major Suzuki to offload its remaining equity in joint venture Maruti Udyog.																								We are bound by the agreement entered during Narasimha Raos time that all parties will be taken into confidence, including Suzuki and the Maruti employees and that it should be done in harmony, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said here today. 																								We have the call and put options but we are also careful to address the concerns of Suzuki which is apprehensive about a sudden offloading of a large amount of shares in the open market that could be cornered by others, he said.																								Shourie also said the government would complete the sale of the residual stake in IPCL, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL) and IBP by mid-February and bring public offer for offloading equity in Dredging Corporation.																								On the privatisation of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), Shourie said, The legal option is imminent and we are in constant touch with the Attorney-General over the matter. I think there will be a comprehensive reconsideration of the matter.																								Shourie was speaking at a session organised as part of the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas entitled diaspora youth in India, a blueprint for engagement. 																								Shourie said a reverse brain drain has already started and bright young professionals were keen to work in India. Forty per cent of doctorate scholars in multinational company GEs India operations are people who have chosen to return from US to work in India, said Shourie. During the last three years, more than 25,000 professionals have returned to India from US, of which 90 per cent are IT professionals he said.																								Shouries message to the diaspora youth was that India has to be made a land of opportunity from one of ideas. Giving his suggestions to these youth, Shourie said, Continue to excel in your host country. He also asked the diaspora youth to tell about India to the world. The diaspora youth should not necessarily have to come back to India, he said. Price hike																								Maruti today hiked prices of its six main models and their variants by almost 0.2 per cent to 0.75 per cent citing higher input costs and a rise in the value of the Japanese currency, yen. 																								The increase of Rs 671 to Rs 2,000 has been made on the highest-selling M800, Alto, WagonR, Zen and Esteem cars as well as the Omni van with immediate effect. There has been no hike in prices of the multi-purpose vehicle Versa, premium mid-size car Baleno and utility-vehicle Gypsy.																								Maruti said the hike was much lower than planned earlier due to a relief in the customs duty announced by the government yesterday, which it has decided to pass on to the customer.

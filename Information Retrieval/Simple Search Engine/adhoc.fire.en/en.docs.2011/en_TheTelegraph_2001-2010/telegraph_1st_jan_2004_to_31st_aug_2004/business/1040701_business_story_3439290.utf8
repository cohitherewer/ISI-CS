 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Kesoram plans to raise cement, tyre capacity
 A STAFF REPORTER Birla: Cementing growth 																								Calcutta, June 30: Kesoram Industries, the BK Birla group flagship, plans to invest Rs 350 crore to raise the capacity of its cement plant. The company is also considering fresh investments in the tyres division, whose growth has been driven by a booming auto-sector.																								We want to increase capacity in cement and tyres. We are examining the issue and a decision is expected in the next four to six months, chairman B. K. Birla said.																								An internal group of senior officials is preparing a report on the quantum of funds that will have to be invested.																								The cement capacity will go up 35 per cent, from three million tonnes to four million tonnes, at a cost of Rs 350 crore, Birla said. The extent of expansion at the companys tyre plant, based in Orissa, is not known at this stage.																								Funds for expansion will come from internal accruals and loans. We will not go back to the market, Birla said. Voicing his preference for brownfield expansion over buyouts, he said: I dont believe in acquisitions. If I have the money, I will expand existing plants. 																								Talking of the spun-pipe business, which did not do well in 2003-04, Birla said it should turn in a better performance as the demand for this product will look up. The rayon division weathered dumping by China to come out strong, and should stay that way this year as well.																								Kesoram posted a net profit of Rs 64.91 crore on a turnover of Rs 1,576.73 crore in the previous financial year. The tyre division contributed Rs 739.83 crore, cement Rs 561.92 crore and rayon and chemicals Rs 190.97 crore.																								Meanwhile, the combined holding of financial institutions, banks and mutual funds in Kesoram Industries has come down to 17.96 per cent on March 31, 2004 from 20.64 per cent in the year-ago period.

 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 MTNL-Qualcomm pact in sight 
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Feb. 24: Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) is in talks with US telecom major Qualcomm Inc for technological and financial tie-ups to enter overseas markets, particularly in Mauritius and African countries.																								Sources said MTNL plans to rope in Qualcomm as a token partner in its overseas ventures, especially in Mauritius.																								The Indian telecom company has bagged three licences for offering fixed, CDMA-based mobile and international long distance services in Mauritius. It plans to invest over Rs 150 crore in the first phase.																								The company will set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, Mahanagar Telephone (Mauritius) Ltd, in the island country.																								Qualcomm will be invited to pick up a token stake in the Mauritius subsidiary, according to sources. The US telecom major has an investible corpus of $400 million for small and medium-sized projects in information technology and telecom worldwide.																								Earlier, the company had decided to pick up a 4 per cent stake in Reliance Infocomm for $200 million. 																								MTNL is planning to start its services in the next six months in a limited manner. In the next couple of years, we will be able to establish ourselves as a major telecom player, a source said.																								The Mauritius venture will boost the companys business plans in Asia and Africa, sources added.																								Initially, MTNL plans to set up a network of 50,000 lines (upgradable to 100,000 lines) based on CDMA technology. The target is to cross half-a-million lines in the next 2-3 years, they added.																								The company is also in talks with Qualcomm for CDMA handsets which could be used for international roaming. The CDMA technology will play a major role in telecom businesses in Asia and Africa and we would like to grab this opportunity, a senior MTNL official said.																								Mauritius is the second country after Nepal where MTNL has made a foray. In Nepal, the company has set up a joint venture with VSNL, a Tata group company, Telecommunication Consultants India and Nepal Ventures to provide mobile services.

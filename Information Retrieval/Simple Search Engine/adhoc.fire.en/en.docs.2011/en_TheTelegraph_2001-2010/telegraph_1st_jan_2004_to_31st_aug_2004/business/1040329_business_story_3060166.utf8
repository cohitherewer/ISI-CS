 M. RAJENDRAN Digital dream 																								New Delhi, March 28: Qualcomm, a pioneer of code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, is now eyeing the convergence market in India and plans to offer its technology to service providers.																								The company is bullish about the role of broadband in India in the next five years. It expects no problems from the regulators since its technologies have been accepted worldwide and are established in communication systems.																								Paul Jacobs, group president of Qualcomm wireless and internet group, said, India is positioned today to grow into one of the leading countries in the world based on the initiatives it has taken for mobile services. It can be a leader in broadband services. The governments initiative and the efforts by the regulator will help broadband growth.																								Qualcomm is ready to offer the technologies to service providers. It is a huge market for a combination of services on a single device. We have the technology for it, said Jacobs.																								Just as digital technologies have revolutionised communications, information processing and the television industry, a new digital technology is being developed by Qualcomm to provide the motion picture industry with a Digital Cinema solution that offers new capabilities, superior quality, and opportunities for new business.																								As it has done for the mobile telephone, wireless internet and mobile satellite industries, we have taken the lead by applying its unique system-level capabilities to the development of core technologies for the new digital cinema era, said Jacobs.																								The company is working with motion picture studios, the creative community, industry standards-setting organisations and exhibitors around the world to develop a system-level solution to provide the motion picture industry with technology supporting a cost-effective, reliable and feature-packed digital cinema system.																								The digital cinema system encompasses many advanced technologies. Qualcomm and Technicolor have already formed a joint venture  Technicolor Digital Cinema  to bring this technology to the market. 																								Digital Cinema is a system designed to deliver full-length motion pictures, trailers, advertisements and other audio/visual cinema-quality programs to theatres throughout the world using digital technology. The Digital Cinema system delivers motion pictures that have been digitised, compressed and encrypted to theatres using either physical media distribution (like DVD-ROMs) or electronic transmission like satellite multicast methods. 																								Authorised theatres automatically receive the digitised programs and keep them in hard disk storage, while still encrypted and compressed.

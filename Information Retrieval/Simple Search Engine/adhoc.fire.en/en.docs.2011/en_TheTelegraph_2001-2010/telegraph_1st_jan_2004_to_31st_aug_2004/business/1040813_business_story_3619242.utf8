 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Bharat Petro to join race for airport equity 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Fuel for thought																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), the state-run petroleum refiner and marketer, is planning to join a consortium bidding to pick up a 74 per cent stake in Mumbai and Delhi airports.																								The Rs 56,818-crore BPCL said it had decided to talk with the Airports Authority of India and other private bidders to explore the possibility of its participation. 																								However, no investment proposal has been approved by BPCLs board yet, officials said. BPCL was keen on the Mumbai airport but was not averse to bidding for Delhi also, they added. 																								For the cash-rich petroleum marketer with nearly Rs 3,700 crore in reserves, it makes excellent business sense to join in an airport consortium by picking up a small stake. The purchase will mean a steady client for its aviation turbine fuel business at one of the countrys largest airports. 																								The move is being seen as a sign of confidence within the Congress-led government that the fracas with the Left over airport privatisation would be resolved in its favour after the hard bargaining on this issue and the proposed relaxation of the foreign investment limits in the areas of telecom and insurance.																								Although air traffic control and policing will remain within the governments purview even after these two gateway airports are privatised, the Left feels the kind of access a foreign power will enjoy if a transnational loyal to it controls most facilities at a major Indian airport will be enormous.																								The government wants some 74 per cent equity in Delhi and Mumbai airports to be sold to private entrepreneurs, including up to 10 per cent to airlines and 49 per cent to foreign stake holders. 																								Bidders who are being shortlisted by the merchant banker will be considered by an empowered group of ministers (GoM), headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, sometime later this month after a Left-Congress coordination panel clears the airport sale proposal.

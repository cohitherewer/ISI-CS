 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Britannia MD slot still vacant
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Britannia chairman Nusli Wadia in Calcutta on Thursday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 19: The board of Britannia Industries has failed to appoint a managing director even after a year since S. K. Alagh left the organisation. Alagh left the company in June last year.																								The company today sought shareholders approval to appoint Nikhil Sen as manager for another five years. Sen, currently the chief operating officer, has been designated as manager. However, he will not be on the board of directors. Sen joined the company in August last year.																								Addressing shareholders, chairman Nusli Wadia said, The board has not yet decided on the appointment of a new managing director. It will decide in due course.																								Wadia feels that the key challenge in the biscuit industry in the coming years will be to manage profitability in an environment where input costs have been steadily increasing, and where possibility of increasing consumer prices is becoming more and more difficult. Britannia has a 38-39 per cent market share (valuewise) of the biscuit industry.																								This can only be done by increasing volumes at a faster pace and by managing all operating costs. Strong measures are being taken to address both these critical areas, he added.																								The company has closed down its factory in Mumbai as the cost of production was very high. It was an old factory and the wages and salaries were high. We want to improve the cost of conversion. So we closed it, Wadia said. About 289 people have opted for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS). The present staff strength is 2,500.																								The company is setting up a greenfield project in Uttaranchal to augment its capacity at an estimated cost of Rs 55.2 crore. The factory, which is expected to be operational by May 2005, will produce 45,000 tonnes of biscuits per annum. The factory will churn out the primary brands of the company.																								The company sources a major portion of its biscuits from contract producers.

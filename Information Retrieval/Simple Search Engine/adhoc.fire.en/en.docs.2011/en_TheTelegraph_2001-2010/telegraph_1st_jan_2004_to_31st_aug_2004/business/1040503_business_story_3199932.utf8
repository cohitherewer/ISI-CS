		 Monday, May 03, 2004  Q amp;A				 Take on tax
																																																																																													I am a retired person with a total income of Rs 54,000 for fiscal 2003-04. I have already invested Rs 4,000 as LIC premium. How much more should I invest so that my tax liability becomes nil?																																																																													P. K. Raman, Calcutta
																																																																																													We are assuming that the total income of Rs 54,000 is after allowing all the deductions under section 80. In such case, your tax liability is Rs 400. If your gross total income is within Rs 1,50,000, then you will get a tax rebate of 20 per cent on the LIC premium of Rs 4,000 which comes to Rs 800. If your gross total income is above Rs 1,50,000 but within Rs 5,00,000, then you will get a tax rebate of 15 per cent on the LIC premium of Rs 4,000 which comes to Rs 600.Thus, your tax liability becomes nil with the current investment. 																																					Second slot																																																																																															Is the second holder of National Saving Certificate entitled to get I-T rebate, if the amount of investment is paid by him? 																																																																													Subhas Mondal, Maheshtala
																																																																																													The second holder of National Savings Certificate can claim tax rebate provided the investment has been made from his income. 																																					Retired hurt																																																																																															I am 50 years old and have taken early retirement on medical grounds but will continue to receive monthly salary till the age of 60. I have invested the settlement amount of Rs 1,50,000 in Kisan Vikas Patra of Rs 50,000 each, two in my name and one in my wifes name. Will the maturity amount be taxable or will there be any deduction in the maturity proceeds?																																																																													A. Kali Das, Jamshedpur 
																																																																																													The amount received on maturity will be taxable income in that financial year but there will be no deduction in the maturity proceeds.																																					In the race																																																																																															If the total income of an individual is less than Rs 8,50,000 and includes winnings from horse race, then is surcharge applicable on the winning amount?																																																																													Shyamaprasad Chatterjee
																																																																																													Surcharge is applicable if the total income of an individual exceeds Rs 8,50,000 and is thus not charged on winnings from horse race as the total income in this case is within the prescribed limit.

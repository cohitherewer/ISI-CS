 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: China has granted tariff concessions on exports of 217 items to India under the Bangkok agreement, while India has reciprocated by extending the same on 106 items, the commerce ministry said here today.																								China will maintain an average margin of preference for 217 items at 13.5 per cent of the prevalent most favoured nation (MFN) tariffs every year. These preferential tariff rates between India and China are effective from January. The customs notifications have been issued by the two countries.																								These concessions are already available to other member countries of the Bangkok agreement, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea.																								Indias bilateral exports with Bangladesh, the Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka are also eligible for concessions. The commerce ministry claims that more than 700 items will be eligible for concessions for export to China.																								Goods exported to China can avail of tariff concessions if they comply with the rules of origin of the Government of China under the agreement and are accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by an authorised agency listed in the Indian exim policy handbook of procedures (2002-07).

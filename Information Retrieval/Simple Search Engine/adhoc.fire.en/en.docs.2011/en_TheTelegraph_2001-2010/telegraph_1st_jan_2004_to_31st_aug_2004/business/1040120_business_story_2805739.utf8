 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Seven UTI schemes put on exit route
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 19: Seven schemes, including two meant for the girl child, from the old Unit Trust of India (UTI)  now SUUTI  are being wound up from March 31.																								The Rajlakshmi Unit Plan (RUP-94) and RUP 99- specific schemes for the girl child, and five others with a combined unit capital of around Rs 10,000 crore, will be closed.																								Letters are being despatched since last week to investors, giving them the option of converting their investments into bonds carrying an annual interest of 6.60 per cent.																								The Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI), which was saddled with all assured return schemes after the carve-up of the erstwhile UTI, is finding it difficult to sustain the interest rate of 14 per cent and 12 per cent on the two RUP plans over a maximum period of 20 years.																								The five-year bonds now being offered are transferable and tradable, like the US-64 bonds. The interest will be paid half yearly, on October 1 and April 1, till 2009. The principal and the interest carry an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by the government.																								The ministry of finance decided to cut short the tenure of seven schemes after the encouraging response it received from US-64 unit-holders to 6.75 per cent bonds.																								RUP 94 will be foreclosed by March 31. Under the regime of falling interest rates, the returns assured under the scheme have become difficult to sustain, M. Damodaran, administrator of specified undertaking of UTI, said. 																								The fate of RUP-94 investors is similar to those who put their money in RUP-92, which was ended in mid-2000. The decision was greeted by legal challenges from investors, but the petitions were dismissed in court.																								RUPs were designed specifically to meet the social and economic needs of women. Anyone could invest in the scheme on behalf of a girl child up to five years of age.																								The RUP-94 proposal envisaged the beneficiary (girl child) could use the money after completing 16-20 years of age. It guaranteed an interest rate of 14 percent.																								The axe could now fall on Monthly Income Plans MIP 98 and 99, Children gift Growth Fund of 1986 and 1999 and Bhopal gas Victims Monthly income Plan of 1992. More branches																								UTI MF has expanded its distribution network by over 100 per cent to 110 branches from the present 54 in an expansion drive aimed at tackling the swelling corpus and clients.																								It is our constant endeavour to bring our services closer to the door-step of our investors, Damodaran, who is the UTI MF chairman and managing director, said.

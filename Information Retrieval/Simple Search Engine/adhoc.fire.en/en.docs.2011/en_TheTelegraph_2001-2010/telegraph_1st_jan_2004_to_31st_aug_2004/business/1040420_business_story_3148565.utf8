 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Shell finance boss shown the door
																								London, April 19 (Reuters): Royal Dutch/Shell ousted chief financial officer Judith Boynton on Monday, bowing to investor pressure after deep cuts to the energy giants oil and gas reserve estimates this year. 																								The Anglo-Dutch group also released the results of an internal probe into why its reserves were overstated by a fifth in the first place, and said it needed to trim its estimates for 2002 and 2003 for a third time and amend its financial results. 																								Boynton, a US citizen, the first woman to reach top board level at Shell and a rare executive import, was the third major casualty of the debacle, which has wiped billions of pounds off the groups market value. Chairman Phil Watts and oil and gas chief Walter van de Vijver were pushed out in March. 																								US regulators have launched an inquiry and several investors are threatening lawsuits. Details of an independent review released on Monday showed that the sacked executives knowingly hid the reserves problem from investors for years, and feared the game was up. 																								In one note to top executives in September 2002, Van de Vijver described the uncomfortable situation EP (the exploration and production division) is in. 																								The market can only be fooled if 1) credibility of the company is high, 2) medium and long-term portfolio refreshment is real and/or 3) positive trends can be shown on key indicators, his note said.

 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Lets go, on a Rs 2.3lakh Alto
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Cutting edge																								New Delhi, April 8: Maruti today introduced a lower-end version of its Alto compact car, priced around 19 per cent cheaper than the existing model. The variant comes without an air-conditioner and has been priced at Rs 2.30 lakh, which is Rs 35,000 cheaper than the Alto Lx. 																								The Alto is Marutis cheapest compact car, although the mini Maruti 800 and the Omni van are priced lower at Rs 2.05 lakh.																								The automaker, owned 54.2 per cent by Japans Suzuki Motor Corp, has a domineering 50 per cent market share in the small and compact sized segment, which includes Zen, Wagon R, Alto and the mini Maruti 800. 																								The small and compact car segment made up nearly 80 per cent of the countrys car market which sold nearly 8,00,000 units in 2003-04.																								However, Maruti is struggling in the mid-size and premium car segments, where only the Esteem and Baleno are positioned, and has a meagre 12 per cent market share. 																								In January, the automaker was forced to introduce a lower-end version of its premium Baleno sedan at Rs 5.6 lakh, nearly Rs 1 lakh cheaper than the existing low-end model, to spur sales in this segment.																								The variant, powered by Baleno Vxi models 1.6-litre petrol engine, is aimed at the mid-sized car segment, where it would compete with the local units of Honda City, Fords Ikon and Hyundais Accent. 																								Maruti said domestic sales of the Alto, whose high-end version competes mainly with the Indica from Tata Motors and the Hyundai Santro, jumped 135 per cent in 2003-04 to 60,629 units. 																								Exports grew 53 per cent to 36,436 units from 23,869 in the previous year. Cumulative sales in the last fiscal (April-March) leapt 30.3 per cent to 4.72 units driven by lower interest rates and a cut in the production tax.

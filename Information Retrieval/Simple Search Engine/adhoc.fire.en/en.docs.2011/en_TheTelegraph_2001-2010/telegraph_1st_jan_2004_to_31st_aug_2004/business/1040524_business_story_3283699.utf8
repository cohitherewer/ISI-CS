 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 23: Kotak Mutual Fund is charting an expansion path with a three-fold strategy of product innovation, geographical expansion and retail thrust.																								On the product innovation side, it has already lined up an opportunities fund and a fund of fund scheme. Ajay Bagga, chief executive officer, Kotak Mutual Fund, said it has already got the approval for the opportunities fund and is awaiting approval for the fund of fund scheme. 																								In addition to that, the fund has filed for the approval of a third product  portfolio management services. Under this, it will manage portfolios of high net-worth clients on a discretionary basis. The corpus size for portfolio management services will be on the higher side, Bagga said.																								The fee structure may be either on a profit-sharing basis or on a fee basis, which has not yet been decided. 																								The opportunities fund will invest in the most attractive sectors and the composition will be dynamic, based on the judgement of the fund manager. The total corpus of the fund will be invested in four funds, one of which will be Kotak fund and the others will be the top three performing funds.																								But Bagga said the funds are not going to be launched just yet. They are waiting for the turmoil in the market to die down and are targeting a post-budget period for the initial public offerings to hit the market. 																								The number of branches was increased to 19 in the last year from 13. The target is to take the figure to 30 within the next 18 months. 																								At present, 35 per cent of the funds corpus is with the retail investors and the total number of investors is 1,60,000. 																								According to Bagga, if the amount accumulated in bank deposits every year is taken to be the benchmark, then one cannot imagine the growth potential of mutual funds.																								The aim of the firm is to be among the top five mutual funds in the country, based on the total corpus size.																								On the future outlook and the current volatility in the market, Bagga said nothing has happened to change the fundamentals of the economy. The Common Minimum Programme by the new government and the budget will add momentum to the market.

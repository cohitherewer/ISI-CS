 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 RBI chief allays deficit concerns 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 16: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Y. V. Reddy today said the duty cuts announced by the government in last weeks mini-budget would not deteriorate the fiscal deficit or give way to more borrowings.																								According to current assessments, both the revenue and fiscal deficit for 2003-04 will be more comfortable than what was provided in the budget, the RBI governor said on the sidelines of a function organised by the Bombay Management Association (BMA).																								The RBI governor was echoing the words of Union finance minister Jaswant Singh, who last week said observers would be pleased about the countrys fiscal state when he presents the interim budget.																								Apart from lower expenditure, the Union finance ministry anticipates higher tax and excise collection and divestment receipts that will contribute to a lower-than-expected fiscal deficit.																								Singh had said while the impact on revenue will be temporary, the measures would enhance growth and stimulate investment.																								The fiscal and revenue outlook for the current year is likely to be better than what it was expected to be in the budget. That is what the ministry has assured me, Reddy said. Additional market borrowings were not needed to offset the revenue losses, he added.																								Last week, the Centre had announced a slew of measures beginning with a reduction in customs and excise duties across various sectors.																								Later, apart from relaxing the external commercial borrowing guidelines, the government also announced incentives for senior citizens and farmers. 																								It is expected that the loss of revenue from the duty cuts is likely to be Rs 9000-10,000 crore, thus impacting the countrys fiscal deficit. Some analysts also said the government, which has completed 70 per cent of its market borrowing programme for this year, may approach the market to bridge the revenue gap caused by the duty incentives.																								The measures have raised concerns that international rating agencies may take a hard look over its impact. These rating agencies have assigned junk bond status to the countrys sovereign debt due to concern about fiscal deficit and declining public finances.

 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 ICICI Bank sheds NPAs
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 10: ICICI Bank has transferred sticky assets  called non-performing assets or NPAs  worth Rs 2,400 crore to Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd (ARCIL).																								The banks gross non-performing assets have been trimmed by 35 per cent to Rs 2,040 crore till March this year from Rs 3,150 crore in 2003. The net NPA of the countrys largest private sector bank has thus come down to 2.9 per cent from 4.9 per cent last year. 																								ICICI Bank has transferred the bad loans for Rs 1,200 crore. ARCIL has paid cash for these loans and the bank, in turn, has reinvested the cash back in the company. 																								ARCIL has been set up by IDBI, State Bank of India, HDFC and HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, some other private banks and institutions.																								Depending on the value of investments, ICICI Bank will make further provisions/recovery on these loans. The bank securitised assets worth Rs 10,700 crore in 2003-04. 																								The bank has mopped up Rs 3,500 crore from its recent public issue, which helped it tap growth opportunities in lending. 																								The banks fourth-quarter net profit grew 35 per cent, faster than market expectations. Net interest income increased 20 per cent, trading gains jumped significantly, resulting in an operating profit growth of 107 per cent. 																								The banks retail assets increased 75 per cent, trading gains were high and fee income surged 65 per cent. Analysts feel the possibility of rising interest rates and concerns of a reversal in the commodity cycle are major risks to its earnings. 																								Mortgages have grown 80 per cent on a year-on-year basis and continue to be the largest component of the total retail assets. Commercial vehicles and auto loans have grown 102 per cent. A strong growth in retail loans helped the bank maintain the average yield on interest-earning assets at 9 per cent compared with 10.2 per cent in the previous year. However, there has been a steeper decline in the lending rates due to severe competition and downtrend in the interest rates. 																								Net interest income of the bank increased from Rs 1,420 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 1,880 crore in 2003-04, recording a 32 per cent increase. The rise has been backed by a 0.4 per cent increase in net interest margin, which stands at 1.8 per cent against 1.4 per cent in 2002-03.

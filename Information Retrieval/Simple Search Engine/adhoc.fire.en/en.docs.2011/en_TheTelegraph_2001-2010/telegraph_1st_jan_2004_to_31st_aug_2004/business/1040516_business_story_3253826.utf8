 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Trai asks mobile firms to stick to roaming cap
																								New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): Noting that the recent increase in roaming charges exceeded the stipulated ceiling of Rs 3 in certain cases, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked mobile operators like AirTel and Hutch to explain the hike and correct it.																								We have written to the operators that their recent announcement of hike in roaming charges was higher than the ceiling imposed. We have asked them to explain it and correct it, Trai member D.P.S. Seth said today.																								At present, the ceiling on roaming is Rs 3 along with 15 per cent surcharge, he pointed out.																								Only last week, Trai had said that it was examining the issue of increase in roaming charges by mobile operators after cellular service providers raised the roaming charges for post-paid customers by Rs 1.50.																								According to the new roaming rates, mobile to mobile calls up to 200 km would cost Rs 3.49 per minute against Rs 1.99 earlier and for distance over 200 km the new tariffs are Rs 4.49 per minute against Rs 2.99.

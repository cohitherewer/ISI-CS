 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Sebi floats plan to cut cost of share buyback
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 5: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to relax certain norms pertaining to share buyback by companies.																								According to a Sebi proposal, issuance of a daily advertisement by companies for an open market buyback may be dispensed with soon. While they would also be permitted to buy back only on stock exchanges having nationwide trading terminals, the regulator is also proposing an offer period of only 15 days in the tender offer.																								As per existing requirements, a company and its merchant banker had to give the information to the stock exchange on a daily basis regarding the specified securities purchased for buyback which was to be published in a national daily.																								It is now proposed that the information can be posted on a daily basis on the company or stock exchange websites and the advertisement would be issued on a weekly basis, and every time when an additional 5 per cent of the buyback has been completed.																								The present regulations also stipulated that the company should extinguish and physically destroy the security certificates bought back within 7 days from the date of acceptance of the specified securities. 																								Here, it has been suggested that a period of 14-30 days from the date of acceptance of shares should be allowed for their extinguishment and the certification process.																								It is now proposed that the tender offer buyback need be kept open only for a period of 15 days against a maximum period of 30 days. 																								According to the corporate finance department of Sebi, it was found that the cost of the buyback got reduced to 29.58 per cent of the offer size from 35.18 per cent if the suggestions were implemented. 																								It was also seen that the time required for securities buyback from filing of a draft letter of offer with Sebi to the final stage of extinguishment of shares was reduced by a minimum of 9 days and a maximum of 45 days.																								Some of the prominent companies in the past that have announced a buyback include Philips India, Cabot India, Sandwick Asia, MICO, Madura Coats, Indian Rayon and Finolex Industries.

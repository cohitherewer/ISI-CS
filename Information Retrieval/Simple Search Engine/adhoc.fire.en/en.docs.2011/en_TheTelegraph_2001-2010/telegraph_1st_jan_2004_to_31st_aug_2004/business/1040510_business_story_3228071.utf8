 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Operators ready to offer free mobiles
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, May 9: Cellular operators are willing to offer a free phone with a mobile connection and no hidden cost.																								However, an order from the department of telecommunications (DoT) stands between the free phone and the customer. 																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and mobile operators have lobbied for removing the 15 per cent duty on mobile handsets offered by operators. 																								Bharti chairman and group managing director Sunil Bharti Mittal said, Such duties are hampering high teledensity in the country. 																								He was speaking to newspersons after the completion of the Hexacom buyout. 																								We have done everything to convince DoT that there is a need to rework the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) that would allow the companies to offer handsets almost free of cost with the connections, Mittal said.																								Trais target of 100 million mobile phones in the country by 2005 could get a major boost if DoT agrees to make the changes in the AGR. We would be happy to offer a free mobile handset with each new connection as has been the trend in Europe. This has been responsible for higher teledensity, said Mittal.																								The acquisition of a majority stake in Hexacom is primarily a share-swap deal, wherein shares/optionally convertible redeemable debentures of Bharti Tele-Ventures have been issued to the Shyam Group to swap their holdings in Hexacom.

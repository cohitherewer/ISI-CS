 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 IISCO back in black after three decades
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 29: Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) is back in black. The company had suffered losses over the last three decades. 																								The Burnpur-based steel maker has reported a net profit of Rs 27 crore in 2003-04. The company had last posted a profit in 1974-75. IISCO dipped into the red within three years of the Union government taking over control from the Calcutta-based Mukherjee family. 																								However, the company could show a profit because of the Rs 56-crore interest waiver by the government. The company had suffered a huge loss of Rs 182 crore in 2002-03. Workers here are jubilant... there is a lot of excitement, said managing director H. M. P. Singh. 																								IISCO at one point was on the verge of closure since the government could not find a suitable buyer and also lacked funds for a revamp. 																								The 125-year-old firm, which reported a turnover of Rs 1,051 crore last fiscal, still has an accumulated loss overhang of Rs 550 crore. Singh said, We expect to get rid of that within two to three years.																								We hope to hike our output by 50-60 per cent this year and our performance by 20 per cent at least, he added. 																								Higher prices of iron and steel and lower costs have helped IISCO script its turnaround story. 																								In November, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction cleared the Rs 881-crore package to revive the firm. The revival scheme had already received government clearance.																								The original cost of reviving IISCO had been pegged at Rs 1,400 crore but was later pared down to just Rs 881 crore, after the Union cabinet was split on full funding for the scheme. 																								The bulk of the money, about Rs 540 crore, is being spent on a voluntary retirement scheme.

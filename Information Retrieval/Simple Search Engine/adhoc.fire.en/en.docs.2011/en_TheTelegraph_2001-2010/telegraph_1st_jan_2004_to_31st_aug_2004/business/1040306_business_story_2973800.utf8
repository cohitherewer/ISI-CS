 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Norms set for higher FDI in private banks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 5: The government today notified the guidelines to give effect to its January 15 decision to liberalise foreign investment in the banking sector. 																								The notification states that the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in private sector banks is raised to 74 per cent under the automatic route, including investment by foreign institutional investors (FIIs).																								This will include FDI under the portfolio investment scheme, FIIs, NRI investments, initial public offers, private placements as well as ADRs and GDRs.																								Individual FII holding cannot exceed 10 per cent, while their aggregate limit would be restricted to 26 per cent, which can go up to 49 per cent subject to the approval of the banks board.																								The government has also allowed foreign banks to open subsidiaries in the country or operate through branches or a private bank with a maximum holding of 74 per cent stake. However, a foreign bank will have to operate in India through only one of these channels.																								The notification assumes importance for foreign banks like HSBC, ABN Amro, Standard Chartered and Nova Scotia which have plans to set up subsidiaries in India following the relaxation of FDI norms.																								A foreign bank can set up a subsidiary either through conversion of existing branches into a subsidiary or through a fresh licence from the RBI. 																								The FDI hike in the banking sector was first suggested by the . K. Singh panel but the finance ministry and the RBI have added a slew of stringent conditionalities to prevent ownership of banks going into wrong hands.																								The FDI ceiling will not be applicable for public sector banks, while the limit remains at 26 per cent for insurance companies. 																								The RBI will separately issue the guidelines for foreign banks to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, which would be subjected to licensing requirements broadly consistent with those for the new private sector banks.

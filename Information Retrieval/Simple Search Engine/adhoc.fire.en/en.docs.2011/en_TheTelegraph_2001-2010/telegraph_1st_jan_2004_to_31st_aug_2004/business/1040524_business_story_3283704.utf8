 M RAJENDRAN Call connect 																								New Delhi, May 23: The domestic telecom equipment makers dream to set up a National Technology Plan may soon become a reality. The draft Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the new government has proposed the creation of a National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council.																								The draft CMP states that a National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council will be set up as a forum for policy dialogue to energise and sustain the growth of the manufacturing sector.																								The domestic telecom manufacturing industry is happy that a forum is being set up to examine and redress their grievances before they get ready to face competition from global manufacturers. According to the World Trade Agreement, India will have to open up its market by January 2005.																								However, the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (Tema) said the promise made by the Congress government in the National Telecom Policy-1994 to make India a telecom manufacturing hub is yet to be realised. Tema president N. K. Goyal said, If the efforts to make India a manufacturing hub as envisioned in the NTP- 1994 and also in 1999 had been realised, we would have become a force in the Asia-Pacific region. We are, however, happy that the new government is thinking on lines similar to what the Congress government promised in 1991.																								We need to have a National Technology Plan that will help the domestic manufacturing industry. In addition, we hope that the coming budget will provide us with incentives by way of tax exemptions and also implement the important clause in NTP-1994 to give special tax benefits to telecom operators who use indigenously manufactured equipment, said Goyal.																								The Congress government in 1991 had set up two working groups to examine the methods and requirements for growth of the software and hardware sectors. Goyal said while the government chose to accept the recommendations for the software sector resulting in the growth visible today, it had kept the hardware report in cold storage.																								Tema feels the new government will follow the reform process in the manufacturing sector that was initiated in 1991 and followed by the NDA government.

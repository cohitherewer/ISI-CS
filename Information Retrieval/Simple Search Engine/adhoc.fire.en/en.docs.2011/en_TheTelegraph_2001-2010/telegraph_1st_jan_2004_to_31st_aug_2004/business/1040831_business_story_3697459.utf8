 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Textiles to gain from trade policy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nath: Pragmatic 																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: The new foreign trade policy, to be announced by commerce minister Kamal Nath tomorrow, is expected to unveil a special package for large employment generating sectors like agriculture, textiles and handicrafts. Apart from the simplification of procedures, the policy will contain measures for the textiles sector which prepares for the quota-free regime from January next.																								As part of the package for promoting agri-exports, the government is expected to introduce concessions like duty-free entitlement for import of machinery and other inputs for the sector. 																								The policy is expected to take forward the thrust on special economic zones for boosting exports and lay a greater emphasis on service exports.																								The government is reported to be thinking of setting up a separate export promotion council for the services sector as it is seen as the countrys area of strength. The policy is also expected to allow 100 per cent FDI in warehousing for which separate free trade zones would be allowed to be established, an official said. 																								The commerce minister said today that the foreign trade policy would provide the long-term direction for exports. He said the government would send a clear message to exporters that taxes will not be exported.																								This was a clear indication that the government has decided to continue with the popular export incentive schemes and the duty entitlement passbook scheme till April 1, 2005.																								The foreign trade policy, which is the new name for what has until now been called the export-import (exim) policy, aims to capture two per cent of global trade by pushing up annual exports to $150 billion by 2010.																								Since the UPA government cannot afford to show that it is less dynamic than the former BJP-led coalition, the annual export growth target is also expected to be raised to around 16 per cent compared with the earlier target of 12-13 per cent.																								The fact that exports registered a 25 per cent growth during the first quarter of the current fiscal is being used as the rationale for raising the target to a more ambitious level.

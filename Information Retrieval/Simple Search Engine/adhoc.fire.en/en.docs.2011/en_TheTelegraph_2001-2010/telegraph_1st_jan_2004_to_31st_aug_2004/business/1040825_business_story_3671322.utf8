 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 S amp;P rating boost for seven companies
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 24: Standard amp; Poors today revised the outlook on foreign currency ratings of seven companies and two commercial banks to positive from stable. The revision comes a day after S amp;P revised the outlook for the countrys foreign currency rating. 																								Corporate houses whose long-term foreign currency ratings were revised are Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation, Indian Railway Finance Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, Power Finance Corporation Ltd and Tata Power. 																								 The international rating agency also revised the outlook on the BB+ long-term local currency rating of National Hydroelectric Power Corporation and State Bank of India to stable from negative.																								Further, the long-term foreign currency rating was also revised from stable to positive for ICICI Bank.																								Exim Banks BB long-term foreign currency rating was revised to positive from stable, while the outlook on the BB+ long-term local currency rating was revised to stable from negative. 																								The rating agency said that the sovereign ratings on India are supported by the countrys good economic prospects, with GDP growth likely to remain over 6 per cent over the medium term. 																								It had pointed out that the service sector is dynamic, while the industrial sector is benefiting from gradual deregulation, trade liberalisation, and modest improvements in infrastructure.																								Good economic growth could contain the pressure on Indias already weak public finances, provided tax reform continues, its analyst had noted.																								The revision in ratings, according to S amp;P reflected the countrys improving external liquidity and better prospects for the governments debt burden to stabilise. 																								It however, expressed that the sovereign ratings on India remain constrained by high public debt and serious fiscal inflexibility. In this regard, S amp;P maintained that the countrys fiscal weakness is the worst among rated sovereigns, leaving it particularly vulnerable to economic cycles and any decline in growth rates.																								The rating agency stated that while the government vows to adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003, which targets a gradual reduction of the budget deficit, the commitment is noteworthy coming from a generally left-leaning government, reflecting a bipartisan support for fiscal consolidation.

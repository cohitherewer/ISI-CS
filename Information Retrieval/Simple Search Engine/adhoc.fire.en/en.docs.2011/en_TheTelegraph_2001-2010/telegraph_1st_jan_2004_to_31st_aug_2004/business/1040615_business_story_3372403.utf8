The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Mega offer for Reliance cell users
																								Mumbai, June 14 (PTI): Reliance Infocomm Ltd has launched an exchange scheme, offering migration facility to existing customers for higher-end camera and video phones, while the private telephony major will refund the entire amount paid for existing handsets.																								The scheme is being launched to reward our early customers, who had become subscribers during the first year of operation itself, said S. P. Shukla, Reliance Infocomm president (wireless products and services). 																								Under the offer, customers who had activated the companys services on or before April 30, 2004, can exchange their existing black-and-white handset for colour handset, with options including video camera phones. 																								Reliance would offer credit for the new handsets and also adjust the entire amount paid for the earlier handset without deducting depreciation or any other charges. This is in stark contrast to the prevailing exchange schemes, he added. 																								The offer, which opened yesterday and would close on July 31, is available only to Reliance India Mobile pre-paid users and not to fixed-line users, he said.

 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Prospects for world trade deal bright
																								Geneva, July 31 (Reuters): Rich and poor nations, including India, were close to striking a historic deal to slash billions of dollars in farm subsidies, create more open industrial markets and put troubled global commerce negotiations back on track.																								We have closed the deal... This more than adequately addresses Indias concerns. Developed countries cannot, through artificial price mechanisms, gain access to Indian markets. They will now have to take firm steps in reducing their domestic support, commerce minister Kamal Nath said. Nath had rushed to Geneva from Bangkok after reports came in of a draft agreement that was not favourable for India.																								I think that the momentum is such that it is difficult not to conclude (successfully), Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim told reporters at the WTOs headquarters.																								This is the beginning of the end for (farm) subsidies. Export subsidies will be eliminated first, Amorim added.																								Brazil leads the so-called G20 group of nations which played a key role in the failure of last years talks in Cancun, where they mounted fierce attacks on rich countries farm subsidies.																								Any deal will have to be approved by the WTOs full 147-member body, which was expected to meet later on Saturday.																								Who knows if there may be a last-minute problem, but it looks like we got it done, said Australias ambassador to the WTO, David Spencer.																								After an all-night negotiating marathon, key WTO members, including the United States, the European Union and Brazil, earlier agreed on a deal, including the eventual elimination of farm export subsidies, a long-standing demand of developing countries.																								Agreement on the sensitive issue of agriculture opened the way for a similar understanding in the other key areas such as industrial goods trade, bringing the WTO closer to its aim of reviving the troubled Doha round of free trade negotiations.																								A successful conclusion of the Doha round  still some years away  could inject some hundreds of billions of dollars into the world economy and lift over half-a-billion people out of poverty, according to the World Bank. 																								Failure in Geneva would risk delaying further trade liberalisation for years.																								But the atmosphere at WTO headquarters, where the trade body has been rushing to meet an end of July deadline, contrasted with the bitter mood in Cancun. Diplomats from North and South all said they were committed to finding compromises. The EU, the United States and countries such as Japan and Switzerland, have said they will not slash the generous subsidies they lavish on their farmers unless they get greater access to developing country markets for industrial goods.

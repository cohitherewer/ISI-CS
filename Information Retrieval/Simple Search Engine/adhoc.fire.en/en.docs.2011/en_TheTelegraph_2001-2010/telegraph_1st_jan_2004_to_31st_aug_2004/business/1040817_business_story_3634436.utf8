The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Data Access plans stake sale
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Aug. 16: Data Access India, the international long distance (ILD) service provider, may sell around 30 per cent of its equity to a global investor for Rs 150 crore. The company called off its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year in March. The new deal may also have a debt component incorporated into it.																								Data Access India had planned to offload around 25 per cent equity through the IPO to raise Rs 100 crore, which would be used for expansion and debt servicing. 																								The IPO was put off after the Securities and Exchange of India sought clarifications on a Rs 84-crore payment due to BSNL and investments made by a Richard Lee Group company.																								Managing director Siddhartha Ray refused to confirm the move but said that the company was weighing different routes to acquire funds. He added there will be some development soon.																								Pacific Netinvest  closely held by Pacific Convergence (Mauritius), SPA Enterprises, Siddhartha Ray and Purva Rakesh had promoted Data Access India and they together hold 74.5 per cent of the company. Hong Kong-based PCCW holds 23.4 per cent and the rest is privately held.																								Data Access India has been restructuring its business and will exit the retail ISP business by November and concentrate on the wholesale voice business. 																								On an average, the company records 120 million minutes of traffic every month and has a 25 per cent market share and an estimated revenue share of 11 per cent. 																								For the financial year ended September 2003, the company earned revenues of Rs 601.4 crore with 96 per cent of its business coming from wholesale voice business and the rest from data. Seventy per cent of the revenues came from US business at Rs 421 crore and the rest from the UK and Middle East.																								The company has targeted a revenue of Rs 688 crore for the year ending September 2004.

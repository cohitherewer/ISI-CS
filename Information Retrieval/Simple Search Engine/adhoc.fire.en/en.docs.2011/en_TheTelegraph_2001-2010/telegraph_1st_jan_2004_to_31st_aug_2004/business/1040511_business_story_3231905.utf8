 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Slender rise in Bank of Rajasthan profit
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 10: Bank of Rajasthan suffered a net loss of Rs 22 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 on account of higher provisions. The bank had reported a profit of Rs 21 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.																								Additional provisions, which was in excess of the existing prudential norms, had a negative impact on the banks bottomline.																								For the financial year 2003-04, the bank posted a net profit of Rs 69.03 crore, up from Rs 68.42 crore in the previous year. The board of directors today announced a dividend of 20 per cent.																								Addressing newspersons, chairman P. K. Tayal said the bank has made an additional Rs 54.41 crore provision for its non performing assets (NPAs). Its net NPA is Rs 73 crore, which is less than 3 per cent. 																								The bank plans to recover around Rs 75 crore worth of NPAs in 2004-05 and bring the level of idle assets down to less than 1.5 per cent by March 31, 2005 to be followed by zero NPA in the subsequent financial year.																								On the other hand, while gross NPA was over 9 per cent, the bank proposes to bring it to 3 per cent. In its bid to reach this target, the bank may have to resort to large scale write-offs even as it is optimistic about higher cash recoveries this year, Tayal indicated.																								During the year capital adequacy ratio of the bank has come down to 11.18 per cent from 11.29 per cent due to excess provisioning. The cost of deposits also declined to 5.46 per cent in 2003-04 from 6.50 per cent. 																								Interest income was at Rs 502.85 crore (Rs 472.66 crore), while operating profit was higher by 25 per cent to Rs 185.30 crore (Rs 148.58 crore).																								Tayal said that the bank is keen on making a foray into life insurance and it may enter into a tie-up with an overseas company.

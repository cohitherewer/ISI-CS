 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Rupee bites Ranbaxy net
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Bitter-sweet pill																								New Delhi, April 22: The sharp rise in the value of rupee has pulled down profit growth at Ranbaxy, the home-grown pharmaceutical multinational. 																								The companys consolidated first quarterly result for 2004 showed a 10 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 190 crore on a sales turnover of Rs 1,307 crore. 																								The company said the growth rates would have been much higher were it not for the sharp appreciation in the value of the rupee.																								Ranbaxy has reported a 17 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 759.4 crore during the year ended December 31 on a consolidated sales of Rs 4,530 crore, a 22 per cent rise on last years level of Rs 3,713.8 crore. It declared a final dividend of Rs 12 per share.																								The board of directors of RLL at their meeting held today approved the audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the unaudited results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. 																								Like IT majors Infosys and Wipro, which are increasingly dependent on dollar revenues, Ranbaxy has taken forward cover on all its sales as a precaution. The company said the situation was not unique to Ranbaxy and was only a reflection of the resurgent economy. 																								The appreciating rupee has impacted the bottomline of the company. A forex team of the company is monitoring the position, said Brian Tempest, joint managing director and CEO (designate) of Ranbaxy. 																								Speaking to newspersons in a teleconference soon after the results were announced, Tempest said the European market was becoming increasingly important for Ranbaxy. 																								The European market is now about the same size as the Indian market. It has shown a particularly strong performance, said Tempest. In fact, the European market, with a sales of $50 million, has shown a 172 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2004. 																								The acquisition of RPG Aventis was successfully completed in this quarter and it contributed $17 million in the quarter. However, sales dipped in the US, another very important market for Ranbaxy, in the first quarter.																								Sales in the US market dipped by 7 per cent to $104 million. This was attributed mainly to a drastic fall in the sales of Ranbaxys key product, Cefuroxime Axetil, said Tempest.

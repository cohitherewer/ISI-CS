 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Companies act changes to be hastened
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 26: A concept paper on the comprehensive companies act will soon be ready. 																								Minister of state for company affairs Prem Chand Gupta said the comprehensive act, which is under way, will be expedited. The Competition Commission and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will also be set up soon, the minister said today after assuming office.																								The department of company affairs (DCA) is drawing up a comprehensive companies bill which will incorporate the latest developments and remove obsolete provisions, Gupta said.																								The minister added that the government will put in place the Competition Commission and the National Company Law Tribunal by July. Certain legal hurdles need to be sorted out before the two apex bodies can be set up, he said.																								Gupta said his ministry will work closely with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to safeguard the interest of investors. 																								In the recent past, the DCA and Sebi have come into conflict over jurisdiction. There is no clash between the DCA and Sebi. There is perfect harmony. The main purpose must be achieved and that is to protect the investors, said Gupta. 																								If necessary, DCA will review the existing guidelines in the Companies Act to ensure that companies raising money from the market do not dupe investors, Gupta said. 																								A slimmer, simpler, executive-friendly Companies Act is on the anvil. The department of company affairs has incorporated many provisions of the present law, amendments suggested to it by various bodies as well as the recommendations of the second report by the Naresh Chandra committee.																								The objective is to ensure that most actions are taken through rule-making powers without infringing upon sovereignty and without asking for major delegated powers. DCA officials maintain that the new legislation will make the Companies Act more flexible, apart from shortening it. 																								The simplified version will include many of the provisions of the Companies (amendment) Bill, 2003 which was sent back to the DCA for re-drafting, after there was opposition to it from several quarters.Bharadwajspeak																								Criticising the NDA government for appointing a bureaucrat as head of the Competition Commission, law minister Hans Raj Bharadwaj today said the decision fell foul with the Supreme Court as these quasi-judicial bodies have been traditionally headed by judges.																								The minister found fault with many decisions of the previous government  be it the appointment of commerce secretary Deepak Chatterjee as head of the commission or the delay in the filling up of vacancies in posts of judges in high courts.																								Indicating a change in the manner in which the previous government had pushed through divestment in companies set up under legislation, Bharadwaj said matters of such public importance cannot be solved without taking Parliament into confidence.																								The earlier government felt that in matters of divestment, Parliament could be bypassed. That was also the opinion of the attorney-general. That is not the view of the new government, Bharadwaj said.

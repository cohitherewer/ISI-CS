 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Broadband at a cheap rate set to become reality
 M RAJENDRAN				 	 Maran: Wired to growth 																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Union communications ministry will unveil the broadband policy this week that promises to offer low-cost connection through Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and cable operators.																								The proposal is to offer the service at a basic rate of Rs 250 per month, which could trigger a price war in the broadband market like the one witnessed in cellular services.																								We are trying to get Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announce the policy on August 15. The details could be unveiled by the communications minister later, sources said.																								Broadband has been defined as an always-on connection with a maximum speed of 256 kilobits per second. Once you subscribe to a broadband service, starting an internet connection will be like switching on a TV or a computer and all you have to do then is, click the Explorer or Netscape to jump on to the World Wide Web.																								However, Indian households may still not be able to dump their crawling dial-up internet connection for high-speed broadband connections if they subscribe to it from BSNL.																								Sources in the communications ministry said, The proposal is to offer broadband through a dedicated line. The offer can be both on a dial-up and by a digital subscriber line (DSL), which is a dedicated line. We are ready with the final report for the broadband policy and should be unveiling it during the week.																								The policy has also examined the issue of broadband over cable TV, which is a common phenomenon in the US where it accounts for more than 74 per cent and in Canada 55 per cent of the total connections. Senior officials in the communications ministry hinted at a special package for cable operators to offer broadband through cable.																								Broadband on TV will permit new services such as pay-per-view and video-on-demand to generate extra revenues. Cable operators can emerge as big players in the broadband business along with telecom operators. The policy will provide the details about the licence fee and other requirements to be met by cable operators.																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had recommended that the always-on broadband connection should be offered at a price of Rs 200-400 per month against Rs 1,500 per month, making it the cheapest and fastest way to surf the net.																								According to the regulator, there would be 20 million broadband users by 2007 if the government and broadband service providers implement its recommendations.																								The broadband connections will determine the growth of e-governance, e-heath, and e-education. It is a project that Maran has been very keen on.																								The policy is expected to allow internet service providers a direct-to-home facility along with internet service with a one-time entry fee of about Rs 2-5 crore.																								A bunch of duty waivers for broadband operators that had been recommended by Trai are likely to be put on hold till the next budget. The government is likely to allow the use of Global Information Service (GIS) to set up networks as it will help operators get a quick right of way.

 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Amadeus gets growth ticket
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Aug. 8: With tumbling fares and low-cost carriers fuelling a 10 per cent rise in air passengers in the domestic aviation industry, Amadeus expects a 10 to 12 per cent surge in its Indian business this financial year.																								The Spanish global distribution system and technology-service provider for travel and tourism has a 55 per cent market share in India. All major travel agencies and airlines use its software. We expect a 10 to 12 per cent growth this year. There are also plans to tap the small and medium-sized travel agencies in smaller cities and remote locations like the northeast, said Ankur Bhatia, managing director of Amadeus India.																								Amadeus software enables travel agencies, airlines and corporate travel departments to get information on schedules, availability, pricing and ticketing for customers; every second airline ticket is booked on its system.																								The firm will connect small and medium-sized travel agencies, besides introducing low-cost products. It will also ensure connectivity between the metros and remote regions like the northeast through satellite (V-Sat). 																								Domestic air traffic rose 30 per cent with around 10 million people taking to the skies against 7 million in the last quarter of 2003-04. In 2003, domestic passenger volumes grew 10 per cent over the previous year. The trend will continue, says Bhatia.																								He feels there is an immense potential for growth, at least 20 per cent every year, since only 15-16 million of the 300 million domestic tourists every year take a flight. Australia, with 22 million people, has 24 million fliers. On international routes, growth is mainly due to the resumption of traffic to Southeast Asia and the Gulf. Forty per cent of the outbound traffic is headed for West Asia.

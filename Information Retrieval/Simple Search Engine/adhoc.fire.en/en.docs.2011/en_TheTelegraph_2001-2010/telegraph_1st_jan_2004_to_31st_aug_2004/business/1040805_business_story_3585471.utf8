 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Oil prices slip 
																								London, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Oil prices slipped from record highs on Wednesday after US government data showed growing oil product stockpiles.																								US crude was down 30 cents at $43.85 a barrel, after striking $44.30, the highest since oil futures were launched on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983.																								Brent crude rose two cents to $40.66 a barrel, easing from a record high earlier of $40.99. That was the highest level since Londons International Petroleum Exchange launched trading in Brent futures in 1988.																								Oil prices have risen by more than one-third since the end of 2003 on worries that accelerating global demand has left supplies tightly stretched with little leeway for disruption.																								Some analysts fear that the relentless rise could take prices above $50 a barrel, with more damaging repercussions for the global economy.																								In its weekly data, the US Energy Information Agency said gasoline stocks rose 2.4 million barrels last week to 210.1 million barrels. Analysts had expected stocks to fall 600,000 barrels due to peak summer demand from vacation drivers.																								US distillate stocks rose 2.1 million barrels, above analysts expectations for a rise of 1.4 million barrels.																								Gasoline demand over the past four weeks was down 0.3 percent on the year, a reversal of strong demand growth that took US gasoline futures to record highs in May and helped push crude prices higher.																								Its a bad report for products, said Kyle Cooper, analyst at Citigroup Global Markets. We now are 8.3 million barrels above last year in terms of gasoline, and yet we are 50 per cent higher in terms of price. Id like someone to explain that to me.

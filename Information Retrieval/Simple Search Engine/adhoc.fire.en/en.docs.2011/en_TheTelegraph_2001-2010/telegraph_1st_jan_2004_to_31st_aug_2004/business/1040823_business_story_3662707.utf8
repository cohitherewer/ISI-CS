		 Monday, August 23, 2004  Q amp;A				 Pension poser
																																																																																													 I am a provident fund member since November 1996. Will I be eligible for pension once I complete 10 years of service?																																																																													Ramakanth, Patna
																																																																																													If you complete 10 years of service, then you will be eligible to receive pension on attaining 58 years of age. If you retire or quit before 58, you can start getting pension at a discounted rate provided you are above 50.																																					Loss or gain																																																																																															 I had purchased a house in 1995 and spent a considerable amount on extension and renovation of the property, which I now wish to sell. Will this attract capital gains tax? Is there any way to avoid paying the tax?																																																																													R. Eswanth, Calcutta
																																																																																													You can account for the amount spent by you on extension and renovation by deducting the indexed cost from the sale proceeds. You may avoid paying tax by investing the capital gains amount in tax saving capital gains bonds within six months of transfer of the asset. 																																					New address																																																																																															 I had invested in BOB ELSS95 while I was staying in Rourkela. After shifting to Calcutta, I informed the BoB Mutual Fund office in Mumbai. But the letter came back the office has shifted. Please help. 																																																																													Shanti Nanda, Calcutta
																																																																																													ew address of BoB Mutual Fund in Mumbai is 105, 10th Floor, Maker Chamber III, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400021. You can write to its investor services centre  Karvy Computershare, 49, Jatin Das Road, Calcutta 700029.																																					Deposit dilemma																																																																																															 I wish to invest in the fixed deposit scheme of a certain company offering interest at 10.5 per cent for one year, 11 per cent for two years and 11.5 per cent for three years, with an additional 0.5 per cent for senior citizens. They are going to issue post-dated cheques for the principal and interest amount. Will it be safe to invest in the company? 																																																																													Namita Seal, Guwahati
																																																																																													Before investing in a company deposit, do some homework. Check the reputation and performance of the company and be absolutely sure to check the credit rating of the company with AAA rating being the safest.

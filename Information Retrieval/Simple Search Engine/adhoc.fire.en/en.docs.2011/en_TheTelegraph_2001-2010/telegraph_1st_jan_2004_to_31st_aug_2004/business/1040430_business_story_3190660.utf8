 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Call to relax capital norms for ARCs
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 29: In a boost to the banking sector, a report prepared for the department of banking has said offshore investors should be allowed to buy up to 100 per cent stake in non-performing assets (NPA) auctioned by an asset reconstruction company (ARC).																								The report formulated by global management consultant, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), has suggested a number of structural reforms, such as the government should grant permission to offshore institutional investors to invest 100 per cent in ARCs.																								Also, an ARC need not maintain capital adequacy requirements and the initial capital required to float one should be lowered to Rs 5 crore from the existing Rs 20 crore, the report suggested.																								A single NPA investor, including foreign entities, should be allowed to hold the entire 100 per cent of security receipts issued under any scheme, said the report on Recommendations for changes in the existing ARC framework.																								The report also said, Investments in debt instruments of ARCs, whether issued in their capacity as trustees or otherwise, should be given the flexibility to structure tenor, coupon and end-use of funds according to their requirements beyond those provided in the ECB guidelines.																								PwC also suggested the creation of a rehabilitation fund which would provide funds to revive the ailing units. The government should offer a bevy of tax incentives, including waiver of income as well as dividend taxes and rationalisation of stamp duties at the state-level.																								The ultimate impact of the changes, however, will be reflective of the degree of effective implementation of the report, said a bank analyst. The government has already formed a committee to oversee the implementation of this report.																								The asset quality of scheduled commercial banks, as denoted by its gross NPA to loans (gross NPA ratio), has been improving in the past six years to around 9 per cent for the financial year ended March 2003, from 15.7 per cent in March 1997.																								Lower consent threshold level for security enforcement may be prescribed by RBI subject to a minimum of 41 per cent of secured creditors, PwC suggested. There should be a consent of secured creditors for security enforcement as a default option in absence of an inter-creditor agreement, the report added.

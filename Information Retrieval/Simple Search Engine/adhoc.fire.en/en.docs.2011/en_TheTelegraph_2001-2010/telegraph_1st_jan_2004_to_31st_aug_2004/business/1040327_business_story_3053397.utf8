(AFP)																								New Delhi, March 26: Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd today outsourced its complete information technology-related activities to IBM India in the biggest deal for the IT major in South East Asia that will help the telecom firm save at least Rs 175-200 crore each year.																								Under the terms of the deal, IBM India has absorbed 200 IT infrastructure professionals in the Bharti group. The total deal for the first five years is estimated to be about $250-275 million. Over a 10-year period, it will be about $700-750 million.																								The long-term on-demand business transformation agreement will help Bharti to consolidate, transform and manage comprehensive IT infrastructure and applications.																								The agreement specifies that payments made to IBM India will be linked to the percentage of revenues generated by Bharti Tele-Ventures and pre-defined service-level agreements. The percentage-linked revenue payment is modelled to decrease with an increase in Bharti Tele-Ventures revenues.																								Akhil Gupta, joint managing director of Bharti Tele-Ventures, said, This is based on a percentage agreement that we cannot share. If the subscriber volume of the company goes up, the revenue to IBM will come down. But IBMs revenue share will not be impacted. The deal is based on the rupee value though we would have liked it be in dollar terms.																								Sources in the company said the linked revenue payment agreement with IBM is about 5-7 per cent.																								Bharti chairman and managing director Sunil Mittal said, The partnership with IBM is set to redefine the existing paradigms in the telecom industry. Our customers, employees and shareholders will get more value. With predictable IT spend, better cash flow and optimised use of technology resources, it will enhance shareholder value.																								We will get IT service on tap. The operator has to just plug in and not be bothered about the IT and its related aspects for scaling up telecom services. This will be the trend in the telecom sector. Being the first, we stand to gain from the deal. It is not an exclusive arrangement; the more the tie-ups, the better for us since our network will be in demand, said Mittal. He said a few more deals like this one would take the sting out of those who oppose outsourcing in the US.																								Bharti needs to increase its IT and connectivity as part of its expansion plans. The collaboration will draw an IT roadmap with a state-of-the-art infrastructure to support its existing and new business operations.																								We expect the telecom subscriber base to reach 100 million in the next five years from the current 30 million. We would like to have a subscriber base of 25 million from the level of about 7 million. In 10 years time, we would like to have a 50-million subscriber base, said Mittal.																								Bharti Tele-Ventures will outsource all its hardware, software and IT services requirements to IBM.																								This includes all customer-related IT applications, such as billing, customer relationship management (CRM) and data warehousing. IBM will also service Bharti Tele-Ventures internal applications, for example, intranet, e-mail and online collaboration. On the infrastructure front, IBM will consolidate Bharti Televentures data centres, IT help desks, and enhance its disaster recovery capabilities. 																								IBM will deploy an open standard-based framework, a service provider delivery environment, allowing Bharti Tele-Ventures the flexibility to introduce the latest in voice, data and content-based services to its customers.

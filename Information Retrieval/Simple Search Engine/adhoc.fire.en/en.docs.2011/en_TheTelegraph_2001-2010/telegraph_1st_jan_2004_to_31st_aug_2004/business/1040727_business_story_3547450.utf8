 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 SAIL plans mega expansion 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 26: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) today announced an expansion programme, involving an investment of Rs 25,000 crore by 2011-12.																								The capital expenditure envisaged would double SAILs finished steel output to 16.6 million tonnes from the current 8.6 million tonnes.																								While hot metal production will hit a level of about 20 million tonnes, crude steel is expected to reach 18.7 million tonnes from 11.83 million tonnes at present.																								According to SAIL, the hot metal production of its steel plant in Bhilai will rise to 7 million tonnes from the current 4 million tonnes and that of Durgapur to 3.2 million tonnes from 1.98 million tonnes.																								Similarly, the hot metal production of its Rourkela Steel Plant will shoot to 3 million tonnes from 1.73 million tonnes, while that in Bokaro Steel Plant will stand at 6.5 million tonnes from 4.1 million tonnes at present.																								Chairman V. S. Jain said the plan would not adversely affect the companys financials as the board has already taken a policy decision to maintain the debt equity ratio at 1:1. The capital expenditure will be financed through internal accruals and will be aided by market borrowings, if required.																								Jain said the expansion plan has been drawn considering an overall steel usage of 8 per cent. However, the company may revise the plans from time to time if the usage level increases in line with growth trends and macro-economic indicators.																								SAIL has earmarked Rs 4300 crore for its priority schemes to be completed by 2006-07.																								Jain said SAIL is giving more importance to value-added products. The industry trend is to go in for more value-added products to cushion the price swings of the commodity. The company plans to reduce generation of the semi-finished commodity to 4 per cent of saleable steel from 20 per cent.																								The capital expenditure plan includes upgradation/modernisation of some existing assets as well as installation of new facilities. SAIL will develop iron ore mines and revamp iron and steel units at its plants in Bhilai, Durgapur and Bokaro.Sponge iron facility																								SAIL is looking at the possibility of setting up sponge iron facilities adjacent to its Bokaro and Durgapur units. The company is also open to the idea of taking a stake in joint ventures with overseas mining companies.																								Company officials, however, said the company has not yet finalised the capacity of the proposed sponge iron facility.

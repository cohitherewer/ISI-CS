 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 2: The rate of inflation fell to 4.30 per cent for the week ended March 20, taking the slide spell to four weeks and raising hopes that it will be tamed within the finance ministrys range of 4-4.5 per cent.																								The wholesale price index (WPI) that measures the price swing fell 0.48 per cent from the previous weeks level of 4.78 per cent, largely due to cheaper primary articles.																								The general price level was 2 per cent higher at 6.30 per cent in the year-ago period. 																								The WPI declined 0.1 per cent to 179.5 points even as key manufactured product prices were firm and food items became costlier. 																								The index was at 172.1 points in the previous year period.																								The government revised inflation to 6.24 per cent for the week ended January 24 against the provisional 6.12 per cent. 																								The final WPI was 178.8 points during the third week of January against the provisional mark of 178.6 points. 																								A moderate to sharp price dip in food and non-food items pushed down the index of primary articles 0.5 per cent to 180.3 points; it was at 177.6 points in the year-ago period.																								The index of non-food articles fell nearly 1 per cent to 190.8 points as prices dipped for edible oils, raw cotton, raw silk, gingelly seed and raw jute (one per cent each).																								However, there was a 3 per cent increase in the price of copra and one per cent each for raw skin and cotton seed.																								After remaining firm for five consecutive weeks, the index for fuel, power, light and lubricants increased marginally to 262.4 points in the week ended March 20. The index was 256.3 points in the year-ago period.

The index was at 151.4 points a year ago.																								The index of textiles group declined by 0.5 per cent to 138.7 points due to lower prices for cotton yarn-hanks and synthetic yarn (two per cent each), even as there was a two per cent increase in the price of texturised yarn.

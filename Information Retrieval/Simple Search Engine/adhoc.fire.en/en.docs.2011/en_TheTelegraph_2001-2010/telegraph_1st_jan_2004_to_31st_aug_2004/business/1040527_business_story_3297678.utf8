 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 SCI anchored in public sector
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Baalu: Back to harbour																								New Delhi, May 26: Union minister for surface transport and shipping T. R. Baalu today ruled out divestment of Shipping Corporation of India (SCI). 																								I am not mad to divest a profit-making public sector company. Shipping Corporation will not be divested, Baalu said.																								The company was on the selloff block and awaiting its final bid for an 80 per cent government stake. Two initial rounds of bidding had been completed under the NDA government.																								On the Golden Quadrilateral project, the minister said no ongoing project that is beneficial for the country would be disturbed. Golden Quadrilateral is an important project and will be completed on schedule by December 2004. All efforts would be made to remove the bottlenecks that may have slowed down the progress of the national highways development project in recent months, Baalu said.																								The minister said the total cess of Rs 1.50 on petrol and diesel for the road fund would not be hiked, even though development of highways needs a huge investment. He, however, ruled out any cut in road cess.																								Baalu said his governments priority would be to create an enabling environment for a modern and globally competitive shipping and ports sector and necessary policy decisions will be taken after interaction with the public and private sectors.																								A fast-track development in inland waterways, coastal, shipping and ports would be my focus in the shipping sector. The long-pending Sethu Samundram project would also be my priority, he said.Nalco privatisation																								PTI adds: Coal and mines minister Shibu Soren said a firm no to the privatisation of aluminium major Nalco. There is no need for the privatisation of Nalco as everything is working properly, Soren said.																								On whether he would reverse the decision of the previous NDA government to privatise the profit-making company, the minister said, Jab sarkar hi wapas ho gai hai toh ab kya wapas karne ke liye rah gaya hai (when the government has been voted out then what is left).

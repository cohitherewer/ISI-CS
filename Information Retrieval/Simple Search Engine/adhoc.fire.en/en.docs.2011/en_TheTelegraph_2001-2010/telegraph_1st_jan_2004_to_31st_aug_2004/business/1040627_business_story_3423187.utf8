 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Switchover to full float at a steady pace
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Reddy: Tread softly																								Mumbai, June 26: The Reserve Bank governor has advised caution at every step while the country moves towards full capital account covertibility.																								Capital account liberalisation is a process and it has to be managed keeping in view the elasticities in the economy, and vulnerabilities or potential for shocks. These include fiscal, financial, external, and even real sector  say, oil prices and monsoon conditions in India, governor Y. V. Reddy said in London today. 																								Reddy was speaking at the Central Bank Symposium-2004 organised by the Bank of England.																								The capital account records the inflow and outflow of investments and loans. India has limited convertibility, unlike some governments that allow their currency to be exchanged freely for others. The country has been considering a move towards full convertibility for quite some time now. 																								In India, convertibility is limited to exchanges needed for trade (known as convertible on the current account only). If allowed for investment and lending as well, then it is full convertibility, including the capital account of the balance of payments. 																								The Indian economy has seen periodic doses of liberalisation in the past decade, but most of it was in the current account for transactions in goods and services. 																								Caution is needed in moving forward. We must recognise that reversal of any step in liberalisation is very difficult since markets tend to react very negatively to reversals, unless there is already a crisis situation, he said.																								Observers who have closely followed the RBIs policy on capital account convertibility are not surprised by the governors stand on the subject. The RBI has traditionally toed a conservative line on capital account convertibility.																								The governor added that the management of the capital account will be effective under enabling conditions, such as reasonable confidence in macro policies, tax regimes and safeguards against misuse of the liberalised current account regime to effect capital transfers. 																								Sound management will also avoid dollarisation of the domestic economy and internationalisation of the domestic currency, Reddy said.																								He argued that prudential regulations over financial intermediaries, especially banks, in respect of their forex exposures and transactions must be an effective and dynamic component of management of capital account as well as financial supervision. Such prudential regulations should not be treated as capital controls, he stressed.

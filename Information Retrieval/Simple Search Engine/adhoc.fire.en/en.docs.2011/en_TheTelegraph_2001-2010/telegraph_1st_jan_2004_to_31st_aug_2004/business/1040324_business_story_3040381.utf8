The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 L amp;T scales the China wall
 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Dragon call																								New Delhi, March 23: Larsen and Toubro (L amp;T) is heading aggressively into China by trying to ratchet up machinery exports to the dragon country.																								L amp;T exports Rs 1,500 crore worth of raw materials, critical machinery and turnkey projects in countries, including Europe, the US and Gulf, but China accounts for less than 1 per cent of the total exports.																								The machinery maker now intends to outsource machine-tool components from China  which are both cheaper and technologically superior  and sell finished machinery there.																								China is a huge market to explore. Unfortunately we dont have sufficient knowledge about their requirements. We wish to import raw materials and machinery components (essentially steel) from China in huge quantities and then export finished products to them, Kuldip Goel, deputy general manager, Larsen and Toubro Limited told The Telegraph on the sidelines of an interaction on Indo-China machine industry organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.																								L amp;T sees it as a win-win situation for both the countries. We are now targeting China who wants superior machinery for its projects, said Goel.																								The company, which has its strength in infrastructural projects, including refinery, chemicals, petrochemicals, fertiliser and cement, is being helped by the Indian embassy in China, said Goel.																								We are also looking for business alliances with our existing clients who already have infrastructural projects in other parts of the world and are now setting up projects in China, he added.																								The total size of the machine-tool industry in India stands at Rs 2,000 crore. Chinas consumption of machinery is a staggering $7 billion (Rs 31,500 crore).																								India exported machinery worth $78.55 million last year to China, while imports from China stood at $298.91 million.																								Shao Qihui, president, China Machinery Industry Federation, said Chinas total machinery exports were $53.8 billion, which formed 20 per cent of its total exports. Both our exports and imports of machinery are very high, with imports constituting almost 70 per cent, he added.																								According to statistical data provided by the CII, bilateral trade volume between India and China has increased from a low base of $338.5 million in 1992 to $7.59 billion in 2003. Due to the initial low base, growth rates dropped to single digit figures in 1998 ad 1999. From 2000 onwards, trade volumes have increased dramatically, both in terms of total volume and rate of growth, said CII.

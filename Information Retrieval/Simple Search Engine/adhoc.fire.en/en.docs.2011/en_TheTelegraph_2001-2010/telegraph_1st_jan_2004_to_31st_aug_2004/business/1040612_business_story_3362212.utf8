 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Two-way treat for Pallonji
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 11: Shapoor Pallonji groups Pallonji Mistry, a leading shareholder in TCS and in Tata Sons, could reap a fortune when he sells a part of his stake in the software major. 																								Mistry, who will part with 12.61 lakh shares in the TCS issue, is expected to take home Rs 126.17 crore, on the assumption that the price will be fixed at Rs 1000 each. Along with his son Cyrus, who has put just as many shares on the block, he could be richer by Rs 252 crore in the IPO.																								In addition, the father-son duo has also offered 75 lakh shares each as the green-shoe lender. Tata Sons has put up 36 lakh shares in a similar capacity. If this option is exercised, the Mistrys could rake in another Rs 150, analysts say. In all, they control 76.46 lakh shares in TCS.																								They stand to get a double-bonanza because they also own a part of Tata Sons, the holding firm of the Rs 55,000-crore Tata group.

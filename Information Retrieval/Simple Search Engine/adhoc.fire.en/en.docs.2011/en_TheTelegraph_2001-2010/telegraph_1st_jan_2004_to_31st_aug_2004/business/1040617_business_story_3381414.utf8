 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Cell firms told to seek prior nod for roaming
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 16: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today asked all cellular service operators offering pre-paid services to inform their subscribers through short message service (SMS) about the roaming charges and also give the option to avail or discard it.																								The regulator gave this directive following complaints from a few pre-paid subscribers that they are being charged for auto-roaming services even though they do not want the service.																								Trai was also informed that the subscribers were not aware of the fact that charges for roaming facility apply only when they choose to make or receive calls while roaming. It was also noted that there is ambiguity in the mind of subscribers for the SMS charges while roaming.																								Trai has issued a directive to cellular operators to inform subscribers through SMS that they will be charged for the roaming facility only if they choose to either make or receive a call while roaming in another license area.																								Further, any fixed charges for roaming, such as roaming rental, should not be charged unless roaming is activated. It should be charged only when a call is either made or received by a customer while roaming. The SMS to inform the customer of these conditions shall not be charged.																								On the issue of SMS, Trai said that as on date, most of the cellular operators were not charging the subscriber for receiving SMS while roaming. All operators were directed to inform subscribers about this fact.																								In case any service provider charges the subscribers for receiving SMS while roaming, they were directed to inform the subscriber through SMS that that they will be charged for the roaming facility only when they choose to either send or receive SMS while roaming.

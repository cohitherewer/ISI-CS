 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Whiff of a deal with institutions
 ANIEK PAUL																								Calcutta, Jan. 27: Did the institutional shareholders reach an agreement with Hewlett Packard (H-P) on the price for its proposed acquisition of Digital GlobalSofts 49.9 per cent public holding on Friday  the last day of bidding that ran for five days?																								The price for the acquisition of 1.66 crore shares was determined through a screen-based bidding  called reverse book-building  on the National Stock Exchange. The regulations require H-P to pay the price at which the maximum number of shares was offered.																								Until Thursday, the fourth day of bidding, most bids had come in at Rs 950. But on Friday, most institutional shareholders suddenly revised their bids to Rs 850. Observers say institutions did so after they reached an agreement with ICICI Securities that represented H-P as investment banker, on the price for the proposed acquisition.																								Institutions held the key in the price discovery. Foreign institutional investors own 25 per cent of the companys shares. They are, as an investor class, the largest shareholder after H-P. Add to it the 10.74 per cent held by Indian mutual funds and financial institutions, and the combined institutional holding in the company goes up to 35.74 per cent. In comparison, individual shareholders own a small pie  14.16 per cent.																								The acquisition paves way for the merger of Digital GlobalSoft and H-Ps other Indian subsidiary, H-P India Software Operations. As a consequence of the merger, the public holding in Digital GlobalSoft would fall below the mandatory minimum level of 30 per cent. Had H-P not acquired the 1.66 crore publicly-held shares, the two companies could not have merged.																								Investors who offered their shares at a price higher than Rs 850 or did not participate in the book-building, can offer their shares later at the price determined for the acquisition through bidding (Rs 850).

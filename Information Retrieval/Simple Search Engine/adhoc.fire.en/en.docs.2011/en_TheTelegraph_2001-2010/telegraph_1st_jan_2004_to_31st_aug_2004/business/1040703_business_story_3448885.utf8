The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Kudremukh lines up Rs 1000cr mine recast
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 Down to earth																								Calcutta, July 2: Kudremukh Iron Ore Company will invest over Rs 1,000 crore in developing mines in the eastern region.																								Sources said the company has set a target of raising production capacity from 7.5 million tonnes to 10 million tonnes in the next five years. The new mines, mostly in Orissa and Jharkhand, need to be developed so that they produce more.																								Kudremukh is in talks with Steel Authority of India (SAIL) to form a joint venture for mining in Orissa. The steel major has mining leases in Barsua, Kalta and Taldih. These could be developed through the joint venture, which will sell its output at home and abroad.																								Kudremukh is also exploring the possibility of developing the Chiria mines  one of the largest iron ore reserves in the world. 																								SAIL, which is planning to jack up its hot metal production capacity from 13 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes by 2012, will need a large amount of iron ore to feed its blast furnaces. Therefore, the joint venture has come as a win-win proposition for both companies.																								Sources said there is a strong potential for iron ore exports due to growing demand from China  a country where India is the largest seller after Australia.																								According to Kudremukh sources, the joint venture will be able to carve a niche for itself in the Chinese market.																								The company is also planning to jack up its pellet plant capacity from 3 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes in the next couple of years. However, the size of the investment plan for the project is not known.																								The surge in global steel demand helped Kudremukh post sharp increase in sales and turnover last year. It notched up a net profit of Rs 300 crore in 2003-04, a sharp rise from Rs 87 crore in the previous year. Turnover went up to Rs 858 crore from Rs 636 crore in 2002-03. Sources say the net profit target for the current financial year has been fixed at Rs 500 crore.

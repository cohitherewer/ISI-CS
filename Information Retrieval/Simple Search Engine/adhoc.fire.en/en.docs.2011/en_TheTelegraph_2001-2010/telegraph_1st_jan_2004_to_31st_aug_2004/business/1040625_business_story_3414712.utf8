 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Airport FDI panel to meet next week
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 24: An empowered committee of the cabinet will review next week civil aviation minister Praful Patels plans to sell up to 74 per cent in Delhi and Mumbai airports to entrepreneurs, including 49 per cent to foreign partners. 																								The group of ministers (GoM), headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, will include finance minister P. Chidambaram and law minister H. R. Bharadwaj, besides Patel.																								The GoM will submit its recommendations to the Union cabinet for the latters approval. Besides considering Patels plans to cap the foreign investment at 49 per cent, the group would also finalise selection of a global technical consultant for the modernisation of the airports.																								The Planning Commission has always insisted that the civil aviation policy should be first cleared by the cabinet before the government takes policy decisions on investments likely to be allowed in airports or airlines.

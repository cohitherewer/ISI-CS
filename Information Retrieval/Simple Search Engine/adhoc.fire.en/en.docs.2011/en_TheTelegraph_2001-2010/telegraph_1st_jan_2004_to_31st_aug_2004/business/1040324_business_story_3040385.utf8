 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Maharashtra Scooters row lands in Shindes lap
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 23: The small shareholders of Maharashtra Scooters Ltd have approached chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde to intervene in the transfer of government shares to its joint venture partner Bajaj Auto. 																								The Maharashtra Scooters Minority Shareholders Association has gathered consent from nearly 20 per cent of the minority stake owners.																								Association chairperson Ramesh Mehta has sought an immediate appointment with the chief minister and apprised Shinde of the questionable state of affairs in Maharashtra Scooters and its adverse impact on the state and 49 per cent public shareholders. 																								Citing recent advertisements by the All India Congress Committee (AICC), Mehta welcomed the partys election agenda showing concern for small investors not only in words, but also in action.																								We have appealed for an immediate vacation of the arbitration proceedings, Mehta said.																								The questionable decisions of the Maharashtra Scooters board at various instances have forced us to request the chief minister to immediately dismiss the Western Maharashtra Development Corporation (WMDC) nominees on the board. Small investors have lost faith in these nominees, he added. 																								The association has also drawn attention to the non-disclosure of information under the Maharashtra Right to Information Act. Repeated requests to Maharashtra Scooters by the small investors to provide information on the Crisil report, the terms of reference and the details on the arbitration proceedings have been ignored. 																								The rating in Crisil report is lower than the companys intrinsic value, the association said. The shareholders want Maharashtra Scooters to be evaluated as an investment company and not as a manufacturing entity. The company holds a substantial chunk of Bajaj Auto shares.																								Maharashtra Scooters officials also refused to meet Icra, the rating agency appointed by the public shareholders to evaluate the true worth and ways and means for an equitable benefit to all shareholders. This lack of transparency had added to the confusion among the small public shareholders.

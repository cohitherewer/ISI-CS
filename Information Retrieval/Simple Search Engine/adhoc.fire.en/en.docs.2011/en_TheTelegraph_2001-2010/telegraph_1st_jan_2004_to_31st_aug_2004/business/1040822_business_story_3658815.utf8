Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: The transformation of Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) into a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) may get delayed as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is yet to sort out the conflict of interest issue. Referring to a report prepared  by UK-based Cadogan Financial Services, Sebi chairman G.  N. Bajpai said Amfi cannot be compared to a stock exchange  where one members ability to transact business depends  crucially on another member (counter-party fulfilling obligations)  and where self-regulation by professionals can be equated  to self interest.																								In the case of mutual funds, if a member errs and gets disciplined, it is to the advantage of the other as it, in a way, reduces competition. This will cause impossible conflicts of interest. Cadogan has categorically stated that Amfi should not be converted into a SRO. 																								Bajpai said, Sebi will try to pass on some regulatory powers to Amfi when it becomes an SRO. He was speaking at a seminar here on Wealth creation with mutual funds organised jointly by Assocham, Bengal Chamber, Amfi and UTI Mutual Funds.																								Sebi, as a market regulator, believe that the funds industry, with its current size and the large amount of work it has undertaken in recent years, especially with regard to intermediaries, is rightly poised to become an SRO. 																								Reacting to Bajpais comments, Amfi chief A. P. Kurien said, We are having constant dialogue with Sebi. Lets see what happens. 																								About investments in the mutual funds industry, Bajpai said it is not too bad an option when harnessed with understanding, caution and imagination. They can indeed be powerful wealth creation tools.																								Bajpai said the market regulator has received demutualisation plans for all the exchanges. They are being scrutinised.

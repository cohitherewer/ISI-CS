The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Bank of India on the prowl in backyard
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Venugopalan: Shopping around																								Calcutta, June 16: Bank of India (BoI) is planning to acquire a bank in a Saarc country. 																								It is cheaper to buy banks in countries that are part of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (Saarc). We may consider an acquisition within a couple of years, chairman and managing director M. Venugopalan said at the banking conclave jointly organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC).																								BoI already has branches and representative offices in 19 countries. It is also looking at opening offices in Nigeria, Argentina, Brazil and Bangladesh.																								We are planning to convert our representative office in China to a branch subject to approval from Chinese authorities, said Venugopalan.																								The bank is also planning to take a 13 per cent stake in Arsec India, the asset reconstruction company floated by UTI Asset Management Company. The total equity base of Arsec India is Rs 115 crore.																								The bank may not float its second public issue, for which it has recently taken shareholders approval, in the current fiscal.																								The current government holding in the bank is 69 per cent and the capital adequacy ratio stands at 13 per cent. Right now we have enough capital with us. We have passed an enabling resolution so that we can go to the market as and when capital is required, he said.																								The bank will raise its tier-II capital of Rs 300 crore in the third quarter through placement of subordinated bonds.																								BoI is also keen to participate in the equities of the commodity exchanges. We have acquired a 2 per cent stake in MCX and are open to the idea of acquiring stakes in MCDX, he added.																								The non-performing assets stand at 4.5 per cent of the total advances, but it could be brought down below 3 per cent in the current fiscal.																								In 2004-05, the bank targets raising deposits of Rs 80,000 crore and intends to lend Rs 35,000 crore.																								Earlier, addressing the members of Ficci and ICC, Venugopalan said consolidation of the domestic banking system through mergers and acquisitions is an important trend foreseen. Cost of technology, new customer service, product development, marketing and competition will dictate the economy of size. 																								We may thus see some very large banks emerging and others may acquire niche roles, he said.

		 Monday, August 02, 2004  Q amp;A				 Mutual attraction
																																																																																													I am 23 years old and wish to invest in mutual funds. How much capital is required for investments and from where can I find more information about mutual funds?																																																																													Dipankar Sinha Chopra
																																																																																													The lowest level at which you can enter a mutual fund is around Rs 3,000  5,000. Information about specific schemes can be gathered from the monthly fact sheets published by all the mutual fund houses. You can also visit the website of Association of Mutual Funds of India for investor-related information. For regular developments in the industry, you could read the newspapers and investment journals.																																					Retiring room																																																																																															I am a recently-retired PSU employee and would like to invest in the Scheme for Retiring Government/PSU employees, as mentioned in one of your articles. Please advise.																																																																													D. Raha, Calcutta
																																																																																													The scheme for retiring government/PSU employees has been discontinued in this years budget. If you are 60 years of age, then you can invest in the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme introduced by the government. The scheme will bear an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum and will pay interest on a quarterly basis. Or else, you may invest in other small savings schemes such as Post Office MIS, NSC, KVP and Public Provident Fund. You can also invest in 8 per cent RBI relief bonds.																																					Bond with the best																																																																																															I have invested Rs 1,00,000 in 8 per cent RBI Savings Bond and interest of Rs 8,000 received thereon would be added to my income. Is the said bond treated as government security and can I claim additional deduction of Rs 3,000 under section 80L? 																																																																													Nirmal Kanti Dutta, Calcutta
																																																																																													Interest received on 8 per cent RBI savings bond is taxable and you can not claim exemption under section 80L. 																																					Pension poser																																																																																															I am a retired government employee. My annual income for the year 2004-05 (inclusive of pension) will be around Rs 1,55,000. After standard deduction, the amount will be around Rs 1,35,000. Shall I get tax rebate at 20 per cent under section 88? 																																																																													Ranajit Chatterjee, Calcutta
																																																																																													Yes, you will get tax rebate at 20 per cent under section 88 since your taxable income is within Rs 1,50,000.

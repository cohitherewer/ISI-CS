 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 VRS for general insurance staff
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Union government today announced a special voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for employees of four public sector general insurance companies to cut the excess flab.																								 The special VRS for right-sizing manpower will be offered to class I, III and IV officials of New India Assurance, National Insurance, United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance, an official release said here. 																								This is second VRS for state-owned general insurance companies and aims at reducing manpower strength by 10-15 per cent. The first VRS round was offered to approximately 1,400 class II officers designated as development officers in year 2002.																								All permanent full-time employees, who have attained the age of 40 years and completed 10 years of qualifying service, are eligible to seek the special VRS, said the release.																								Employees will be given 60 days salary for each completed year of service or salary for the number of months of remaining service. As much as 50 per cent of the ex-gratia amount will be paid in cash and the balance either in a one-time cash settlement or in instalments as decided by the boards of individual companies.																								Posts vacated by those who take up the new VRS scheme will not be filled up and be abolished. However, posts of the rank of assistant general manager or above, which are vacated because of the VRS round, will not be abolished. The package is based on the recommendations of various committees and proposals submitted by the General Insurers Public Sector Association (GIPSA).																								The introduction of this scheme and exit of employees will necessitate rationalisation of operating officers of the companies and redeployment of employees to ensure that the companies working was not adversely affected. The VRS comes in the wake of redundancy in upper and lower grade staff after the public sector general insurance companies decide to rationalise manpower and step up the IT upgradation drive, said GIPSA sources.

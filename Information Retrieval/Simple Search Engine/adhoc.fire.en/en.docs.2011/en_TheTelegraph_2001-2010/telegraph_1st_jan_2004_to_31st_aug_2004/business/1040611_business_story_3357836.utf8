 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Banks want loan dues paid before appeal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 IBA chief executive H. N. Sinor in Calcutta on Thursday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, June 10: The Indian Banks Association (IBA) plans to appeal to the Supreme Court to review its order on the Sarfasi Act, 2002 so that defaulting companies pay 25 per cent of what they owe banks and financial institutions (FIs) before taking the legal course.																								Section 17 (2) of the Securitisation amp; Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfasi) Act says defaulting companies are required to deposit 75 per cent of their liabilities with a debt recovery tribunal (DRT) if they want to appeal against an order of attachment of their assets by banks and FIs.																								The apex court had declared this section unconstitutional in its order of April 8. 																								The IBA wants the defaulting companies to deposit at least 25 per cent of their liabilities before they appeal against the attachment order of their assets.																								The Supreme Court had upheld the constitutional validity of the Sarfasi Act, empowering the banks and FIs to attach and sell assets of companies that have defaulted in repaying loans.																								IBA chief executive H. N. Sinor said, There is pressure from member bankers to move the Supreme Court for reviewing section 17 (2) of the Sarfasi Act. We are examining the possibility of making a fresh appeal to the apex court. 																								He was in the city to interact with the members of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo).																								A senior bank official said, With the removal of Section 17 (2), the defaulting companies can simply move the DRT against an asset attachment order. If they are required to deposit a certain portion of their liability, they will have an urgency to settle their dues and it will be binding for them. This will expedite the recovery of sticky assets in the banking system.																								Sinor also said the IBA has written to the Reserve Bank of India on the criteria set by the regulator for declaring dividends by banks.																								The RBI has said the banks should have an 11 per cent capital adequacy ratio for three consecutive years and non-performing assets below 3 per cent for declaring dividends to shareholders. Sinor said the RBI should move out from micro management of banks. Let banks decide on their own on these issues, he added.																								On the wage negotiation of employees which is currently under way, Sinor said they are trying to push some management restrictive practices like mobility of people, special allowances and computerisation.

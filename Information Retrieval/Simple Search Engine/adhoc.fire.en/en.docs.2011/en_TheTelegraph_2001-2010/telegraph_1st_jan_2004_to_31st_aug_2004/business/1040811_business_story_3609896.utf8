 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Private insurers stay upbeat
 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Purdy: Confident 																								Dubai, Aug. 10: Private life insurers may be the minnows at present but they are preparing for battle with the behemoth  Life Insurance Corporation.																								Aviva Life Insurance managing director Stuart Purdy told reporters here today that private insurers could carve out an almost 50 per cent market share by 2010.																								LIC could well sneer at the challenge now. A recent study shows that the insurance top-dog has an 87 per cent market share though it grew at the rate of only 1.9 per cent last year. Private insurers  who have a 13 per cent market share at present  have together grown at the rate of 153 per cent. 																								People like Purdy believe that the next few years could change the landscape.																								Aviva has grown at a rate of 400 per cent and is planning to infuse fresh capital worth Rs 50 crore by January next year. Welcoming the proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit from the present level of 26 per cent to 49 per cent, Purdy said the parent company was ready to stump up the cash as soon as it was cleared.																								The company claims that it has performed better than its expectations in the Indian market, but it isnt advancing the break-even date. The normal gestation period for life insurance company is 7-8 years. 																								Aviva has a paid-up capital of Rs 243 crore. By injecting fresh capital, the total capital base will go up to Rs 293 crore.																								The private life insurer, a late entrant in the Indian market, claims that it earns nearly 70 per cent of its premium income through the bancassurance model. Aviva has tieups with four banks  Canara Bank, American Express, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and ABN Amro.																								Purdy said, The concept forms an integral part of our strategy. We might sign up with one or two more banks in near future.																								Aviva earned a premium of Rs 153 crore in 2003-04 and hopes to increase it by another Rs 27 crore in 2004-05. It aims to emerge as one of the top five life insurers over the next five years and emerge as one of the top three in bancassurance models. At present, it ranks ninth among life insurance players.																								Purdy said it would be practical to have one regulatory body overseeing both the insurance and pension markets.																								Insurers are already selling pension-linked products. It, therefore, makes more sense for them to sell pension products as well, he added.																								The insurance watchdog Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) had lobbied hard for the right to regulate the pension sector as well. However, the government was of the view that pension was a critical and complex market by itself and hence wanted to have a separate regulatory body.																								On the proposed 49 per cent FDI cap in insurance, which has become a bone of contention for the Left parties that support the government, Purdy said, I hope it (the hike in the FDI cap) will be a reality and the finance minister will be able to carry out the amendment to IRDA Act.

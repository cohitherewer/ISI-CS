 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Markets spring surprise surge 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 19: Just when you were thinking that the correction was here to stay, the markets took everyone by surprise today when the sensex turned round and gained 118 points as investors went bargain hunting.																								The markets witnessed a major correction of 248 points over the last two sessions as foreign institutional activity had considerably slowed down. Though FII interest is still being seen as crucial to maintain the uptrend, brokers feel that todays trading saw good interest coming at lower levels.																								This resulted in the BSE sensex staging a smart comeback. The index opened at 5967.39 and plummeted to a low of 5870.99. 																								However, as short-covering and bargain hunting occupied centre stage at lower levels, the trend was reversed with the index touching a high of 6076.97, a 205 point variance over the days low, and closed past the 6000 mark at 6064.10 against last Fridays close of 5946.19, a rise of 117.91 points or 1.98 per cent.																								Oil, automobile, steel, cement and some banking stocks grabbed the limelight during the day. expectations of good third results saw Tisco shares firming up 5 per cent to close at Rs 457.20 while Tata Motors gained nearly 4.5 per cent to close at Rs 509.45. 																								Oil counters too were crowd-pullers. ONGC witnessed good buying interest on news of Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy striking gas in Rajasthan. ONGC has a 30 per cent right in any discovery from the block. The Delhi-based exploration major gained over 3 per cent to Rs 841.50.																								Brokers added that FIIs that have considerably slowed down their purchases were also net buyers in index-based counters. Their buying was attributed to expectations of good corporate earnings.																								Apart from Tata Motors and Tisco, amp;T, SBI, Bajaj Auto, Reliance were some of the other gainers. Analysts here added that despite the disappointing third quarter results announced by some of the banks so far, heavy buying was witnessed in counters like ICICI Bank, which was one of the leading gainers in the index. The share gained by Rs 17.85 to end at Rs 301.25.																								 The volume of business dropped to Rs 2784.97 crore from Rs 3668.52 crore earlier. Tisco was the top traded share with the highest turnover of Rs 269.46 crore followed by Satyam Computer (Rs 182.14 crore).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Salons to spruce up Lakme growth
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 18: Lakme Lever, which saw a 32 per cent growth in 2003-04, plans to concentrate on growing the salon business through its Lakme Beauty Salons, while consolidating its core business of colour cosmetics and skin care.																								Anil Chopra, business head of Lakme Lever, said, The beauty care business in the country is estimated at Rs 1,000 crore, of which a mere Rs 170 crore comes from the branded segment.																								Currently, there are 60 Lakme Beauty Salons spread across 22 cities. During the year we plan to add another 40 salons and reach to eight more cities, said Chopra. The salon business contributes to 15 per cent of revenues from the Lakme brand and is expected to go up to 30 per cent over the next three years.																								Explaining its absence from the east, Chopra said that the company had recently adopted the franchisee model, which was built around the four original salons at Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Bangalore.																								We plan to enter Calcutta in the beginning of 2005, he added.																								Lakme also plans to start beauty treatment and hair styling courses next month through the Lakme Beauty Academy in Mumbai. The courses will include basic training and upgradation skills for professionals and cost between Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000.																								We require at least 400 people to manage our expansion plans. There is a dearth of skilled manpower, which the Academy will fill. There are also plans to take the Academy to major metros, Chopra said.																								The firm expects to grow at a rate higher than the industry average of 13 per cent.

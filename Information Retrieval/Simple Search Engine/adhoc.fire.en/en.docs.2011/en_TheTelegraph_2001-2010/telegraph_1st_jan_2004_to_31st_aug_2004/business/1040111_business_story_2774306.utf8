 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 NHPC set to charge up Purulia project
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Baghmundi (Purulia), Jan. 10: National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) will approach the Public Investment Board in a few weeks for a clearance to participate in the West Bengal State Electricity Boards (WBSEB) upcoming Purulia Pumped Storage Project. The project, which is expected to generate 900 MW hydel power, will cost Rs 3,180 crore.																								Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee said on Thursday, NHPC is keen to participate in the project. They have obtained certain clearances from the finance ministry and the Planning Commission. However, WBSEB has already advanced a lot with the project work. WBSEB and Japan Bank of International Co-operation (JBIC) have provided financial assistance to the project. This is the second-largest investment in a project in the state, the first being in Haldia Petrochemical.																								This is the first pumped storage hydel power project in India.																								The Bengal government is keen to give NHPC 70 per cent stake in the Purulia Pumped Storage Project. The paid-up equity of the project is Rs 900 crore. 																								The government is also open to the idea of roping in other partners if NHPC fails to join the project.																								Four units of 225 MW each will come up in a phased manner. The fourth unit will come up first in April 2007, the second unit in July 2007 and the third unit in October 2007. The first unit will come up in January 2008.																								JBIC will provide Rs 2,619 crore to the project as soft loan. It has already given Rs 610.7 crore in the first tranche. The Bengal government has provided Rs 16.48 crore to the project. The cumulative expenditure for the project up to November 2003 is Rs 526.43 crore.																								Banerjee said 96 per cent of a 6.5-km tunnel, a crucial portion of the project, has been completed. The civil work of the project is being carried out by Taisei Corporation of Japan. The other Japanese companies involved in the project are Mitsui and Marubeni. 																								The project will help to bring a balance in the thermal-hydel ratio which is currently at 97:3. This high thermal generation in the system adversely affects the frequency resulting in a collapse of the power equipment.																								Once this project is operational, the thermal: hydel ratio will change to 77:23 and bring stability in the entire grid, said the power minister. Moreover, the power generated will be able to meet the growing demand for power in Bengal.

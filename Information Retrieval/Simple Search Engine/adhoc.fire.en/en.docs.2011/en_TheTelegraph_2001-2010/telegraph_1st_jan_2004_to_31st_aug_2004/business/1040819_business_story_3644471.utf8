 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Stock options make a comeback
 SATISH JOHN Wired to the job 																								Mumbai, Aug. 18: Employee stock options (Esops) are back in favour, largely driven by a resurgent stock market. 																								Many companies plan to reward their employees through shares and retain their loyalty.																								Infotech firms  the pioneers of the reward system  have been left behind by banks, pharma and smokestack companies in the scramble to offer Esops to employees. The banking and pharma sectors, perceived as knowledge-based with high attrition levels, are actively instituting esops, which they hope can halt the migration.																								Infosys Technologies, the company that made almost a quarter of its employees millionaires, is again witnessing a perceivable trend of a stream of employees exercising the stock options of 1998. Infosys has so far had three Esop plans  the 1994, 1998 and 1999.																								Last year, the company had put aside Esops plans. However, industry analysts say Infosys might revisit the plan. The company spokesperson declined to comment.																								However, the employees of the infotech major have found the stock options attractive enough to exercise their options for shares once again.																								The boards of rating agency Crisil and UTI Bank recently met to finalise their stock options plan. Crisil has called an extraordinary general meeting to get shareholders approval for the esops plan.																								After Microsoft decided to halt issuing fresh esops, infotech companies worldwide have been doing likewise, said Sanjay Grover, partner at Ernst amp; Young, a premier consultancy firm.																								Grover said apart from an improved market sentiment, the competition and demand for good incentives for employees is driving the companies to use esops.																								Pharma companies have of late seen some attrition in the research and development side.																								When one company in the industry decides to adopt esops, peer pressure forces others to join in, said a senior official affiliated to a company that instituted the stock option plan recently.																								Consulting firms like Ernst amp; Young and others are also increasingly being sought to frame the rules for esops  on who should get it, how much and in what pattern (vesting period).

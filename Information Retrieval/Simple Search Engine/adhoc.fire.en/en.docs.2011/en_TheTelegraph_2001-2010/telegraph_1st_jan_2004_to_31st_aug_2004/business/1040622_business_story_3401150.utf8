 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Tema dials tax-cut number
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Cross-connection 																								New Delhi, June 21: The domestic telecom equipment manufacturers today demanded a level-playing field and urged the government to remove the sales tax or impose a countervailing duty on imports to take on companies like Nokia, LG and Samsung.																								The local telecom equipment manufacturers today demanded the imposition of zero duty on inputs/raw materials and capital goods. They have also asked for zero excise duty. The Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India (Tema) has urged the government to introduce an Information Technology Agreement (ITA)-compatible duty neutralisation scheme to reimburse all indirect taxes, including local levies.																								It also wants the government to ensure that the total effect of duties in India should not be more than those in other countries.Tema president N. K. Goyal said, We are not asking for any protection. The ITA provides import at zero duty by January 1, 2005. In 1998, the government had notified that telecom equipment will attract nil duty on inputs or raw materials by January 1, 2004 and on capital goods by January 2003. Zero excise duty was to be provided with zero customs duty. For dual purpose items, it provided deemed export or duty drawback.																								However, nothing has been implemented by the government. There is a disconnect between implementation and policy. How do we take on the players who have not invested in India (Nokia, LG, Samsung) but get all the benefits? asked Goyal.																								He also said the automobile sector that has grown tremendously gives us the method for developing the domestic telecom equipment sector.																								Goyal said, The automobile industry is a showpiece of local manufacturing, with the government strictly implementing the 70 per cent mandatory localisation, imposing an import duty of 60 per cent on new cars, 105 per cent on used cars and subjecting imports to approval by a government agency.																								Currently, the local telecom equipment manufacturing units pay a sales tax of 10-12 per cent to end-users and 4 per cent to licensed telecom operators for import of finished equipment. However, there is no sales tax or countervailing duty on imports of such equipment.																								Tema has sought re-imposition of special additional duty (SAD) at 10 per cent for finished telecom equipment on 140 per cent of import value to offset margin, marketing and distribution costs paid by domestic manufacturers.																								It also wanted a Rs 100-crore telecom equipment development fund and the establishment of a telecom finance corporation. It said the Tenth Plan proposal provided for an employment opportunity of 4.8 billion in the hardware sector and 2.2 billion in software and said this needed to be taken into account while finalising the budget for 2004-05.																								Telecom is a high-investment sector and a lack of domestically available finance encourages imports. A telecom finance corporation with a 10-year tax holiday to new and existing units as recommended by the working group on the telecom sector for the Tenth Plan should be immediately implemented, said Goyal.																								Its recommendation submitted to the communications ministry, includes, rebate on licence fees for purchase of indigenously designed, developed and manufactured telecom equipment, a mandatory approval for imported items under the ITA. It has also sought mandatory local after-sales service, card repairing and system upgradation, including software for imports under the ITA.

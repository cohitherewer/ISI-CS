The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Soorah unions blame Lodha
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Soorah Jute Mill workers demonstrate against Lodha in front of Birla Buildings in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Amit Dutta																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: Rajendra Lodha Murdabad ... Soorah Jute Mill khulte hobe ... Management jabab dao..																								From behind the iron gates of Birla Park and the courtrooms, the battle of wills rolled out on to the streets today with two labour unions of Soorah Jute Mill, part of M P Birla groups flagship Birla Corporation, accusing Rajendra Singh Lodha for the mills closure since March 29, 2004.																								Despite being one of the most profitable jute mills in the state, the management had shut it down without showing any reason. It wants the mill to relocate to Birlapur and sell off the prime land on Narkeldanga Main Road. All these plans were hatched by Lodha, shouted Rana Jana, president of the union, during a demonstration outside Birla Buildings.																								The demonstration  with placards and festoons against both Lodha and the management  didnt end with sloganeering alone as some of the protesters later went from R. N. Mukherjee Road to the office of Khaitan amp; Co  the solicitors representing the Birla family. They reportedly pleaded with the solicitors to save the countrys first business family from Lodha.																								There was little doubt among onlookers whose side the demonstrators were on, but they insisted that they were not taking sides in the inheritance controversy between the Birla family and Lodha. The two sides are fighting a legal battle over the assets of the M P Birla group. According to Lodha, Priyamvada Birla bequeathed all the assets of her husbands group to him and the Birla family is contesting the claim.																								We dont have anything to say about the dispute between the Birla family and Lodha. The matter is in the court and it will settle the issue. We are representing the 1700 workers of the mill, who are not getting their wages since April, stressed Md Iqbal of Intuc, steering clear of the controversy.																								The demonstrators also made it clear that their assembly was apolitical and organised jointly by Intuc and Soorah Jute Mill Sromik Union. Though Citu has a significant presence in the mill, there was no representation from CPMs trade union wing. 																								While no one from the Birla side  not even the public relations agency the family has hired recently  was available for comments, sources close to them suggested that the demonstration was the first among a string of such protests in M P Birla group companies against Lodha.																								The Lodha camp remained incommunicado. But Birla Corp, in which Lodha is the co-chairman, released an official statement in the evening and de-linked the mornings agitation from the controversy surrounding the M P Birla groups assets.																								A section of workmen from Soorah jute mills assembled demanding reopening of the mill. They submitted a memorandum to the management in Birla Buildings and left peacefully after discussions with the management representatives, said the release.

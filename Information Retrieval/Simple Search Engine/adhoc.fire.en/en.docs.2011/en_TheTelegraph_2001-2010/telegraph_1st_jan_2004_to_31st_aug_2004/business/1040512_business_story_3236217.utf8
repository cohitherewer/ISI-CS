 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 RBI hints at relaxation in payout curbs 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 11: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will consider dividend proposals of the public sector banks that have failed to achieve the criteria recently announced by the regulator for declaring dividends.																								The RBI last month stipulated that banks with net non-performing assets below 3 per cent and a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 11 per cent for the past three consecutive years can declare dividends without the apex banks approval.																								We will have to consider the cases and see what best can be done. Earlier individual banks used to come to us with their proposals for declaring dividends. But now we have liberalised the policy. The banks can now go ahead with their dividend proposal. But in case they fail to meet the criteria they will come to us, an RBI spokesperson said.																								We will then consider whether the banks will be able to declare dividends, the spokesperson added.																								Senior RBI officials said the regulator might give a timeframe within which the banks have to fulfil the above-mentioned criteria. There will probably be a rider for the banks who are keen to declare dividends to their shareholders, they added.																								Among the nationalised banks, Dena Bank, Indian Bank, Punjab amp; Sind Bank, Uco Bank, Allahabad Bank and Central Bank may find it difficult to comply with the new criteria.																								Allahabad Bank, which has trimmed its bad loans to 2.37 per cent, has already written to the RBI for allowing it to declare dividends even though the bank has not been able to maintain 11 per cent CAR for the last three consecutive years.																								Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director O. N. Singh said, In 2001-02, the bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 10.62 per cent. This is our stumbling block for declaring dividends. We have, therefore, written to the RBI for giving us a relief on this account.																								Similarly, Uco Bank has not been able to bring down its NPA below 3 per cent. The bank has registered an NPA of 3.65 per cent in 2003-04. Chairman and managing director V. P. Shetty said they have written to the central bank to consider their case.

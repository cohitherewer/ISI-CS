 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 ONGC operations give navy a headache
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, April 26: The Indian Navy is concerned about the expanding operations of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in the high seas and wants to be apprised of all the drilling activities so that it can draw up defence plans to cover these installations.																								The navy feels that it would have to acquire more frigates and increase its manpower to beef up security for the offshore oil installations. Sources said the navy wants to be prepared even against a sneak attack by hostile submarines.																								Senior naval officers have recently held meetings with the petroleum ministry and ONGC officials to present the defence perspective in offshore oil operations.																								The presence of foreign ships in Indian waters, especially to acquire hydrographic data, is a source of worry for the navy.																								This data maps the sea in great detail and enables experts to identify various underwater areas where submarines can hide without being detected. According to naval officers, a security risk is involved if this data falls in the wrong hands.																								With the deep-sea oil exploration gathering pace, ONGC has had to go in for state-of-the-art drilling rigs which are not available in the country.																								The defence establishment is not at all comfortable with the entry of foreign vessels, particularly around the eastern offshore, as the Andaman Islands is the base of the countrys tri-services command. 																								The navy had also made it clear even to the national oil companies that its permission would have to be taken before hiring any foreign vessel for undertaking drilling in the area.																								The navy has also opposed the entry of foreign companies for oil exploration in the offshore area of the Andaman Islands. It feels that any oil exploration activity in these waters should be taken up by ONGC and senior officials should be present on the oil rigs.																								An oil exploration block was put up for auction in the latest round through the international bidding route only after petroleum minister Ram Naik had several rounds of discussion with defence minister George Fernandes.																								There was deep resentment in the defence establishment over what was seen as the petroleum ministrys attempt to bulldoze its way through despite serious security implications.																								According to the petroleum ministry and ONGC, oil exploration is going on worldwide and multinational companies carry out most of these operations.																								ONGC officials said the permission required from the navy to induct foreign rigs often held up operations and there was a need to streamline the process so that oil exploration activities are not slowed down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Mutuals take a long view, stay calm
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 17: The net asset value of mutual funds will show a dismal fall, courtesy the mayhem on Dalal Street. But all the fund honchos are holding on to their investments, trusting their judgements on valuations and advising investors not to panic.																								We bought in todays market since we found the valuations compelling and if given a day or two, the whole scenario is going to stabilise and things should be back to normal, said Ashim Syal, chief investment officer, ING Vysya Mutual Fund.																								According to Syal, although the markets look choppy in the short-term, it is bound to do well in the long-term. It would be imprudent to judge the market in the current scenario. An investor with an investment horizon of more than six months should buy into the market and he would definitely be a gainer, he added. Investors should target those sectors which would not be affected by the new government.																								When asked whether the support-buying by Life Insurance Corporation of India restored the confidence of mutual funds and other buyers, Syal said no institution is larger than the market. Any institution or investor buys only when they find the valuations attractive and based on their judgement.																								Similar sentiment was echoed by Sivasubramanium KN, senior vice-president, equity, Franklin Templeton Investments. We continue to hold on to our investments and are in fact looking at increasing exposure to stocks whose valuations have turned extremely attractive due to the fall in the markets. Our view is that investors, both domestic and foreign, with a long-term view on India would actually see the current correction as a buying opportunity, he said.																								According to him, the domestic markets have witnessed a sharp correction in the past week and today due to a combination of technical factors, such as margin calls and FII selling, amid low volumes. The coming months will offer a clearer picture of the new governments policies and its ability to manage a coalition, and this is likely to drive the markets over the short-term. 																								Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research, however, has a different view on the future plan of action of the mutual funds. He says, Although the funds have not been big sellers till now and have actually made modest purchases over the last few days, they will be significant sellers in the near future. This will be on account of the huge redemption pressure, which will flood in from investors who have become cagey with the market crash.																								The investors of initial public offerings have short-term expectations and since the recent offerings by the mutual funds will definitely be in the red, the redemption requests will pour in, he added. This will be further enhanced by the fact that the leading equity funds have taken a larger hit than the index, since most of these funds were overweighed with the PSU and banking stocks. Thus, the stocks, which were instrumental in these funds posting superior gains, may be the cause for their downturn.																								Investors in equity funds are always advised by fund houses to take a longer-term view and not to get upset by the short-term volatility. 																								Although all the fund managers agree that the fundamentals of the market have not changed and all these unnecessary ups and downs provide attractive buying opportunities, it will not be easy for them to stem the flow or repurchase requests. 																								According to the data of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the mutual funds have been net purchasers in the month of May (till May 15). Only two days in this month  May 4 and May 5  witnessed the mutual funds reporting net sales. 																								The investment reports of the funds suggest that the funds have increased exposure in sectors where the stocks appear under-valued, such as steel, cement and auto ancillary.

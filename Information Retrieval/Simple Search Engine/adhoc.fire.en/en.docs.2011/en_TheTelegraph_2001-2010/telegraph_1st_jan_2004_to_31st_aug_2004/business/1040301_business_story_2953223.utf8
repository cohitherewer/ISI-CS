 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Feb. 29: Petronet LNG may not allot more than 10 per cent of the 26.09 crore shares it is issuing through a public offer to institutional investors. 																								The public offer, which opens tomorrow, is expected to receive a tremendous response from institutional investors  both domestic and foreign. 																								According to senior officials, up to 90 per cent of the shares on offer are likely to be allotted to employees, domestic brokerages, private firms and retail investors, against a mandatory minimum of 50 per cent. Ten per cent of the issue is reserved for employees of the company. 																								The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations require us to allot a minimum of 10 per cent shares to institutional bidders. While well have to fulfil this obligation, our intention is to allot as much as possible (which is 90 per cent) to non-institutional bidders, said a senior official. 																								Companies can keep allotment to institutional investors at 10 per cent of the issue size if more than 15 per cent of the project cost is funded by financial institutions. To restrict allotment to institutions at 10 per cent, we clinched a funding deal with ICICI Bank ahead of the issue, which took institutional exposure in our project to well above 15 per cent, an official said. 																								Investment bankers managing the issue are unhappy and are lobbying the management for a bigger allocation to institutions. But the management is in no mood to budge, especially after petroleum minister Ram Naik announced at the inauguration of the companys LNG terminal at Dahej that a bigger pie of the shares being issued would be allotted to the janta (public).

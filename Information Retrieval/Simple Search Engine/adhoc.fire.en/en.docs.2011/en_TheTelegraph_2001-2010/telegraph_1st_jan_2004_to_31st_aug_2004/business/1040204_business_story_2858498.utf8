The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Loan sweetener for tea
 OUR BUREAUS 																								New Delhi/Calcutta, Feb. 3: Finance minister Jaswant Singh has announced as part of his interim budget proposals a special term tea loan to bail out the beleaguered tea industry.																								In the case of small tea growers, the banks have agreed to extend fresh working capital limits of up to Rs 2 lakh at an interest rate of 9 per cent.																								The interim budget announcements have evoked mixed reactions among the industry.																								Indian Tea Association (ITA) chairman C. K. Dhanuka told The Telegraph, The special tea term loan will provide the much-needed financial relief to the tea industry. It is a welcome step. There will be liquidity in the hands of the industry.																								Tea Association of India president Suresh Bansal also shares the same view. We are happy over the development, he said.																								But both of them were upset over the governments decision to provide fresh working capital of Rs 2 lakh at an interest of 9 per cent to small growers, who contribute nearly 15 per cent of the total tea production in the country.																								The medium and large tea growers will not get this facility, said Bansal.																								The loan scheme, which has been finalised by the Indian Banks Association (IBA), will be repayable over a period of five years with a moratorium of one year. 																								The finance minister also announced that steps will be undertaken to examine the feasibility of a debt amelioration scheme for the tea sector.																								This is a step towards the right direction, added Dhanuka.																								The government has recognised the fact that the tea industry is an important agro-processing industry, employing a large number of people in North Bengal, Assam, the Northeast and some southern states.																								Clearly, these decisions need to be implemented on a war-footing to revive the tea industry which has been in continuous decline over the last three years. Although the Tea Board has provided some financial assistance to exporters for freight and packaging costs, this is not considered adequate. So, the soft loan package will come as a welcome relief.																								The government, which has otherwise been projecting a rosy picture on the overall exports front, expects tea exports in 2003-04 to dip by 10 per cent. In April-October, 94.63 million tonnes of tea was exported compared with 120.73 million tonnes in the same period in 2002-03.																								The official impression is that Indian tea gardens have become high-cost due to the high expenditure on social welfare for labour and this has made them uncompetitive.																								Proponents of this argument say Sri Lanka, China and Vietnam have no such obligations and are, therefore, able to sell their tea at cheaper prices. Clearly, any revival package from the Centre will be drawn against the backdrop of this premise.

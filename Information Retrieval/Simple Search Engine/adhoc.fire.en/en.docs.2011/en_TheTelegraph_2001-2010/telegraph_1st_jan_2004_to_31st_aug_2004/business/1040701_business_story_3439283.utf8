 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Price breather for steel users
 VIVEK NAIR  Holding on for now 																								Mumbai, June 30: Good news for steel users. Major producers are likely to leave prices untouched even though the self-imposed embargo on a rise expired today.																								Encouraged by stable international prices both in the raw materials and finished product market, steel majors may hold on to the current price levels. 																								Opinions, however, differ as to how long this stability would last. While a few see prices at present levels for the next two months, some feel the stability could hold over the long term.																								International prices have now stabilised. We feel that this trend will last for some time. In such circumstances, steel prices may remain unchanged for the entire quarter, industry sources said.																								At present, hot-rolled coil prices at the base grade are ruling at Rs 25,000 per tonne. Coke prices, which touched astronomical levels a few months back, have come off their highs. This ripple effect has come on the back of a relatively low demand from China. 																								While coke prices are likely to remain stable during this quarter, dry bulk freight rates too have subsided following measures by the Chinese government to cool down the economy.																								Early this year, spot earnings per day of shipping companies due to dry bulk freight had more than doubled to over $70,000 per day due to the massive Chinese demand for steel.																								The prospect of stable steel prices during the current quarter comes as a relief to users who had protested against the frequent rise in prices of flat steel. The domestic steel industry had then decided not to raise prices till June 30.																								Flat steel producers feel that while the increase was forced by rising input costs, domestic users were not at a disadvantage since hot-rolled rates were in line with international prices. 																								Industry sources feel that even after holding on to prices in this quarter, steel companies will continue to churn out a good performance as domestic demand continues to remain buoyant. In addition to this, demand for the commodity is also strong in overseas markets such as the US and Europe.

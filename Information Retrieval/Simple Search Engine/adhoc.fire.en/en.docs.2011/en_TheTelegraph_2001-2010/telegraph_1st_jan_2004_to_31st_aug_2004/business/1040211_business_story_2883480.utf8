 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Power board ropes in Hidco for distribution
 SUATNUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Feb. 10: The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has formed a 50:50 joint venture distribution company with Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco)  New Town Electric Supply Company  to provide quality power to the Rajarhat township.																								The paid-up equity of the company is Rs 10 crore, equally shared by WBSEB and Hidco.																								This is a pilot project. If we are successful, then the company will look after the electricity distribution in new townships that will come up in other parts of the state, said a senior WBSEB official.																								WBSEB chairman Sanjay Mitra will head the new entity. Asish Chakroborty of Hidco will be the managing director and WBSEB member (operations) Dipak Ganguly is expected to be the vice-chairman. WBSEB member (technical) Swapan Ghosh has also joined the company.																								A highly sophisticated power infrastructure will be built to deal with the rising population in the next three years.																								There has been a provision for the construction of a state-of-the-art hi-tech 33/11 KV sub-station together with pre-paid, remote control, SCADA and distribution automation facilities at Rajarhat. The system will help to constantly monitor the electricity supply in the new township and put a check on power theft.																								New Town Electric Supply Company will also undertake works of underground 33 KV, 11 KV and 400 volt power supply, the official added.																								In a bid to cater to the power demand for the next 30 years, the new company will build a 220 KV and another 132 KV sub-station.																								New Town Electric Supply Company will spend Rs 30-40 crore in the next three to four years for better distribution of power, WBSEB officials added.																								Power sector analysts consider the move to be unique. It will help to reduce the transmission and distribution losses of WBSEB, they said.																								The toughest roadblock to power sector development has been the financial health of state electricity boards, mainly due to poor performance on the distribution front. Of the total energy generated, only 55 per cent is billed and 41 per cent is realised.																								The gap between average revenue realisation and average cost of supply has been constantly increasing. The annual losses of state electricity boards are currently around Rs 30,000 crore.

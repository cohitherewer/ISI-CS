 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Move to dovetail sops for exports
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 28: Commerce minister Kamal Nath met finance minister P. Chidambaram to discuss the incentives to be provided to exporters in the forthcoming budget. Both direct tax concessions as well as customs and excise relief proposed by the commerce ministry figured in the two-hour meeting between the ministers.																								We had discussions on budget and exim policy proposals to see that both are well integrated so that exports from targeted sectors get a boost, Nath told reporters after the meeting.																								He said, The heads of export organisations had met me as well as the finance minister. We have to see what leverage can be rightly provided to enable export growth.																								The export incentives lead to a decline in tax collections and the revenue department is opposed to giving too many concessions on the ground that they are misused. The commerce ministry, entrusted with the task of achieving a higher export growth, feels that some of these tax concessions are essential to face the stiff global competition.																								The revenue department is of the view that tax exemptions are misused by exporters leading to a loss of revenue to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore which amounts to nearly half of the total annual customs collections.

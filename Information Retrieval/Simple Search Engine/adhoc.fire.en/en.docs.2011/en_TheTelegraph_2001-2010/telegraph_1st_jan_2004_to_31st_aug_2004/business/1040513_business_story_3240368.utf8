The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Tata Power scouts for funds abroad
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 12: Tata Power Company plans to raise up to $500 million (Rs 2,250 crore) in the international market.																								Tata Power, the biggest private sector utility in the country, is engaged in the generation, transmission and bulk distribution of power. The companys business has touched new highs after the government ushered in a slew of power reforms. 																								We plan to raise the money in tranches over a period of two to three years, said Amulya Charan, vice-president (finance). The money would be used to fund ongoing projects and also any new projects that come up.																								The move assumes significance as Tata Powers debt was downgraded last month by rating agency Icra to high safety from highest safety. According to Icra, the utilitys risk profile had increased as a result of likely long-term competitive pressure in Mumbai and certain regulatory uncertainties. 																								Icra had said that the companys large exposure in the telecom sector was unlikely to yield returns in the near future, and would drag down the return on capital employed. 																								Tata Power has a debt of Rs 2000 crore in its books and the cost of servicing the debt is 10 per cent, Charan told The Telegraph. The average interest cost of 10 percent is considerably higher than prevailing rates, say analysts.																								Part of the funds raised abroad may also be used for refinancing its old debts and thus lowering its interest costs. 																								Tata Power is also setting up a 330-MW hydro project in Uttaranchal at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore and another 120-MW plant at Jojobera for Rs 400 crore. The company needs funds to complete the two projects.

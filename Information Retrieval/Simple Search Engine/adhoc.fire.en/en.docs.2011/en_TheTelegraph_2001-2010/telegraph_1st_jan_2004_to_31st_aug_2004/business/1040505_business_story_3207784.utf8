 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Air France seals KLM deal
																								Paris, May 4 (Reuters): Air France succeeded on Tuesday in its bid to create the worlds top airline by revenue, winning nearly 90 per cent of Dutch rival KLM in an unprecedented takeover that heralds a new era for the industry.																								In a joint statement, the airlines said KLM shareholders had tendered 41.76 million shares, or about 89.2 per cent of the airlines capital, in the offer valued at nearly 850 million euros ($1.03 billion) which closed on Monday night.																								That was well above the 70 per cent threshold that Air France management had said it needed to call the takeover a success. The offer was extended on unchanged terms because Air France needs 95 per cent before it can take KLM off the share market.																								The combination represents the first cross-border merger of major European airlines and creates a company that ranks ahead of Japan Airlines System Corp as the largest airline in the world by sales. Air France-KLM will rank third behind AMR Corps American Airlines and UAL Corps United Airlines in terms of passenger traffic.																								Many analysts have applauded the deal as a trend-setter and predicted other airlines in Europe and elsewhere could follow suit in the coming years.																								The tie-up leaves Italian carrier Alitalia, which had pushed hard to be included, on the tarmac as it seeks to avoid bankruptcy. The government-controlled airline faces court administration if it fails to reach an accord with its workers on the terms of a rescue plan.																								KLM and Air France believe the deal will allow cost cuts and enhance revenues, helping to battle over-capacity in the market.

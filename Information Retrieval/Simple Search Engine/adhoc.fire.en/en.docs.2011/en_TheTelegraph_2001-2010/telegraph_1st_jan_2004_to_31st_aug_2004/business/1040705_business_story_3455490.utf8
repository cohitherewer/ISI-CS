 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Brake on car tax cuts looms
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, July 4: The government is unlikely to cut taxes on cars and utility vehicles in its 2004-05 annual budget although the automobile industry body has asked for an 8 per cent excise slash.																								The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), which represents around 35 vehicle makers, said in a memorandum the government should reduce production tax (excise) to 16 per cent from 24 per cent to boost demand for the fast-growing, but price-sensitive, industry.																								Rural India would benefit from a tax cut as utility vehicles are an important mode of mass transport due to poor road infrastructure and inadequate public transport, said SIAM.																								In the last budget, the government had cut production tax to 24 per cent from 32 that helped sales surge 27 per cent to about 9 lakh units in the year against 6.89 lakh units a year-ago.																								In December 2002, a panel had recommended that the government cut excise on motor vehicles to 20 per cent by 2005-06, as part of an overall tax reform plan, but sources said given the current fiscal deficit, the government is unlikely to reduce taxes. 																								Tax collections from sale of cars and utility vehicles in the 2003-04 financial dipped 14.5 per cent to Rs 1,779.36 crore against Rs 2,080.66 crore clocked a year-ago as higher sales still failed to make up for the excise cut. 																								Sales should have grown by around 35 per cent to be revenue-neutral following the lowering of excise, said the official.																								Around 40 per cent of the sticker price of a car now is made up of taxes and other levies, which still restricts the size of the car market in a population of over a billion people.																								An industry official said an 8 percentage point cut in excise duty would translate to a 5.5 per cent drop in a cars showroom price. Only 8 of every 1,000 Indian citizens own cars, compared with 35 in Thailand and 450 in the developed world.																								The automobile industry body also said tariffs on some industry raw materials like specific grades of cold rolled sheets, hot rolled steel and alloy steel, that are not available in the country, should be cut to 10 per cent from 15, to reduce costs and boost industry growth.																								It has also asked the government to introduce an incentive scheme to retire older, polluting vehicles in seven big cities, which should be extended to all cities over the next three to five years.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 CMIE sees growth for this fiscal at 6.3%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 12: Mirroring the projections made by some of the leading credit rating agencies and economists, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) today said that Indias economic growth is likely to slow down to 6.3 per cent in 2004-05 even as growth in the first quarter will be at 7.5 per cent.																								According to CMIE, the cash income available with the agricultural community due to a good harvest in 2003-04 will stimulate consumer spending in the first quarter of this year. 																								The cash available with farmers is more at the end of the winter crop. The impact of the expected rise in consumer spending is likely to be spread across manufacturing, consumer goods as well as the service sectors, CMIE observed.																								CMIE feels the robust growth rate of 7.5 per cent during the first quarter is likely to slow down to 6 per cent in the second quarter, then to less than 5 per cent in the third quarter and hover at around 5.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.																								The index of industrial production is likely to grow at 6.5 per cent in 2004-05 and the growth in the manufacturing sector would be aided by a rise in domestic demand and continuation of strong global commodity prices.																								While the services sector is projected to grow at 7.9 per cent, the growth rate in agriculture, which accounts for about 25 per cent of the economy, may slow down to 2.7 per cent against 9 per cent last year. 																								Industry is estimated to grow at 6.4 per cent. Due to these factors, the real GDP of the country would grow at 6.3 per cent in 2004-05.																								CMIE added that the real growth in GDP for 2003-04 was around 8.7 per cent with 10.2 per cent in the fourth quarter.

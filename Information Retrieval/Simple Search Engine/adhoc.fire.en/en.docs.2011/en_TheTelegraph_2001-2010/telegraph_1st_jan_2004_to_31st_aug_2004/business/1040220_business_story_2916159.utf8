 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Get a chip of the finest in worlds business, for Rs 25000
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Feb. 19: Principal Mutual Fund today launched a scheme that, for Rs 25,000, gives Indians the chance to take home a slice of the worlds best companies.																								Procter amp; Gamble, Novartis, 3M and Suzuki Motor Corp are some of those in which the scheme will park its money. That makes it the first-ever international equity fund for Indians who would like to diversify their investments by picking up stocks listed on NYSE or LSE.																								Principal is betting on the comfortable foreign exchange reserves which, at the last count of $108 billion, have prodded the government and the Reserve Bank to bring down the barriers for Indians keen to invest abroad. 																								Even though the funds portfolio will be invested in overseas stocks, the investor can enjoy the convenience that a domestic mutual fund offers, said Principal Asset Management Company CEO Sanjay Sachdev.																								All markets in the world are not correlated. When ours tanks, others could be going up. If you have to maximise the returns, you must invest in many baskets. This strategy, he says, helps investors get around shocks like earthquakes, riots and even US sanctions.																								At the same time, the fund gives investors the benefits that go to companies that have a presence in countries growing at a faster pace than India  for example China. It is always good to have a wider choice, said former UTI chairman S. A. Dave at the launch.																								Pointing to the way foreign funds own a bigger chip of several Indian blue-chips, he said it was time Indians bought their way into the best of global business. 																								Principal chief investment officer Rajat Jain said the collections through the international fund have been capped at Rs 200 crore under government regulations. This is the money that will be used to buy shares of 47 globally listed companies  those that hold more than a 10 per cent stake in their Indian subsidiaries.																								This norm will keep Cadburys, Carrier Aircon, Wartsila  whose parents bought back all the equity in their Indian arms and had them de-lsited  out of reach. We have asked for a relaxation on this score, Sachdev said.																								More Indians are travelling abroad than ever before. But we are truly linked to India when we invest, be it a house, or household savings. We have to de-risk our investment from the happenings that take place in India. More than that, we have to take advantages of events in other parts of the globe, Jain added.

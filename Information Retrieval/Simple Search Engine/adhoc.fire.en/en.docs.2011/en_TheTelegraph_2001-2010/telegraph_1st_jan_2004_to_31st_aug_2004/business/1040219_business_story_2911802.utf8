 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 BoB ups deposit rates for seniors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 18: Bank of Baroda (BoB) has revised upwards the interest rates on term-deposits of senior citizens for various maturities with effect from March 1. 																								Following the revision, the bank has decided to pay an additional interest of 1 per cent as against the earlier policy of paying 0.5 per cent extra to senior citizens.																								In a communication issued to the stock exchanges, BoB said the decision was taken today at a meeting of senior officials chaired by chairman and managing director P. S. Shenoy.																								It added that the additional interest of 1 per cent will be paid on fresh deposits of all maturities and all the amounts and also on renewals of the existing deposits.																								At present, BoBs interest rates on deposits range from 4-5.65 per cent on various maturities. Other banks like IDBI Bank and Central Bank of India have already raised interest rates on deposits of senior citizens.																								Earlier, Central Bank of India had decided to increase the interest rates payable to senior citizens by 0.50 per cent effective January 1, resulting in a total benefit of 1 per cent over the normal rate of interest. Despite such moves by the banks, banking circles project stable interest rates over the short-term.																								In a separate announcement, Bank of Baroda informed that at a meeting of its overseas territorial heads held on February 16 and 17, it has been decided to explore the possibility of expanding business activities in Singapore, Thailand, Germany, Italy, France, Netherlands, Spain, Russia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Trinadad, Tobago, Australia, New Zealand subject to approvals from appropriate authorities.

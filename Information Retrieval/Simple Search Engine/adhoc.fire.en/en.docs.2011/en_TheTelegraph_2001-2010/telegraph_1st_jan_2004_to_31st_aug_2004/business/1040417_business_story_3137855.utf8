 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Sale of automobiles zoom past million-mark
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 16: The Indian automobile industry crossed a major milestone by ratcheting up sales of over 1 million units in the year to March 2004, helped by soaring demand and a three-decade-low in interest rates.																								The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) today said in a statement sales rose 32.2 per cent to 1.03 million units in 2003-04, up from 779,203 units in the previous year. 																								Significantly, local sales of commercial vehicles, or trucks and buses combined rose to 260,345 units in 2003-04 from 190,682 units, a huge surge of 36.5 per cent. Analysts see this as indicative of the high GDP growth rates being posted by the country.																								SIAM said a number of factors, including an 8 per cent cut in production tax along with an expanding economy and lower interest rates, fuelled sales. It expected the strong growth to sustain in the current financial year also.																								Higher sales are subject to robust economic growth. We are hoping the government continues with reforms that are already in the pipeline or that have been promised, Jagdish Khattar, managing director of Maruti Udyog Ltd, told newspersons. 																								He said the government was expected to cut production tax by another 8 per cent in the annual budget exercise, likely to be held in June-July period.																								They have seen this year the impact of a lower excise duty and realised the importance of the manufacturing sector, Khattar said. The government has promised the emphasis on manufacturing sector will continue and whatever impediments are there would be ironed out.																								Thirteen firms make cars, vans and utility vehicles in the country, most of them units of global firms such as Suzuki, Hyundai, General Motors and Ford. Domestic car sales in March alone jumped 11.4 per cent to 75,482 units from 67,771 in the same month a year earlier.																								Asked what would drive growth in the current financial year, Khattar said: Its a combination of the manufacturers ability in the domestic sector to upgrade people along with easier availability of finance which can see growth.																								Motorcycle sales in March in the worlds biggest market after China rose 31.6 per cent to 369,309 units from 280,682 a year earlier. Sales in the full year rose to 4.1 million units from 3.65 million units.

 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Market panel to help FM tune in
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, June 4: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will have a special panel to keep him posted on the capital market as part of a larger initiative that would include a post-budget roadshow to build bridges with foreign institutional investors (FIIs).																								Launching a charm-offensive on the movers and shakers of the bourses at his June 2 meeting with top Mumbai brokerages, the minister appeared to have calmed jangled nerves, though markets are taking time to be persuaded about the new governments motives.																								The BSE sensex gained 71 points today to close at 4889, bouncing back from a 106-point slide on Thursday, even as Chidambaram was quelling fears in Mumbai.																								Chidambaram defended the common minimum programme, the new regimes Magna Carta, before a cabal of bulge-bracket brokers. There is no economics without good politics and vice versa, he said, referring to the swelling army of the unemployed who needed help. This year, 60 per cent of new voters do not have jobs.																								Brokers were worried about how big a role the FIIs  which have infused more than $14 billion over the past 18 months  would be allowed to play. We intend to continue to attract FIIs. We need to see if the brakes that we had placed 13 years ago, should still be in place.																								Talking of the budget, he said the effort would be to usher in a friendly, simple administration on indirect taxes. While we have as many as 35 million income tax payees, there are only 80,000 entities that pay excise duty. Expect a bit of sexy things in the budget. I will put my best foot forward in the weeks ahead, he told brokers.

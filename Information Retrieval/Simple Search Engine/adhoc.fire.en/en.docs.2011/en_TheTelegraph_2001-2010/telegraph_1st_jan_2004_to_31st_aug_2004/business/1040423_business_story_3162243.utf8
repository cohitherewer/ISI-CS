 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Overseas buy suits Raymond
 VIVEK NAIR				 	 Feels good																								Mumbai, April 22: Raymond Ltd is looking at worsted suitings acquisitions abroad even as offers for outsourcing have started pouring in from European nations.																								Senior officials said the Germany-based F. Y. Weiss has expressed an interest to source worsted fabrics and Raymond may enter into a strategic alliance with it. 																								The talks are at a nascent stage. If the deal materialises, it is expected to be a win-win situation as the German company can source fabrics produced at competitive costs, while Raymond can use the formers network for marketing.																								This development comes at a time when Raymond is looking at expansions within the country and acquisitions abroad. The company already has a 60 per cent share in the domestic worsted suitings market and over 70 per cent in terms of value. The domestic worsted suitings market is put at 35 million metres.																								Globally, the production base of worsted suitings has undergone a radical change over the past few years with India and China emerging as the key players. Both of them have dislodged their European counterparts from the positions of eminence they earlier held.																								The cost advantages enjoyed by the Indian and Chinese producers have been instrumental in reducing the production sizes in Europe. This has forced them to seriously consider sourcing from India.																								According to Raymond group president Nabankur Gupta, while the company is not averse to good acquisitions if available, it would look at a firm with a capacity of 4-5 million metres each time it carried out any expansion.																								Raymond was initially placed among the top three worsted suitings manufacturers worldwide.

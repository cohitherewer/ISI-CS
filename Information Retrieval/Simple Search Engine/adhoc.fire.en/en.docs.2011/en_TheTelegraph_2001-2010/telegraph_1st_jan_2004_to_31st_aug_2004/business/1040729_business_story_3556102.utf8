 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Maruti works out Fiat engine deal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Makeover time																								New Delhi, July 28: Maruti Udyog is busy discussing the terms and conditions of fee payment for using Fiats advanced diesel-engine technology. 																								Maruti, 54.2 per cent owned by Japans Suzuki Motor Corp, plans to set up a plant to make diesel engines for its vehicles. It has tied up with Italys Fiat and Europes Opel Adam to make 1.3-litre diesel engines using common direct rail injection technology.																								Discussions are on as to what would be the trade-off for using its technology. Chances are Fiat would part-hold equity in the new plant in lieu of a certain amount of its fees, sources said. General Motors is brokering the deal.																								US-based General Motors, the worlds largest carmaker, owns 10 per cent of Fiat Spa as well as 20 per cent of Suzuki. Adam Opel is a unit of GM.																								Maruti, the countrys largest automaker, plans to invest about Rs 350 crore to set up the plant in Haryana with an annual production capacity of 1 lakh units.																								The plan to set up a diesel manufacturing plant is still in the conception stage for we are trying to locate in which models we can integrate these diesel engines, sources said. 																								The plant will initially manufacture 30,000 engines and slowly step up production in sync with the demand. We are initially looking at the Indian market but we have a open mind about exports, the official said. 																								Maruti, which has a 47 per cent share of the domestic passenger vehicle market, has only a marginal presence in the diesel car segment. It uses diesel engines made by Peugeot of France in some of its vehicles. Nearly 18 per cent of the 6,96,207 cars sold in the country in the last fiscal used diesel engines. 																								In the first quarter (April-June) of 2004-05, sales at Maruti rose 19 per cent while net profit rose 42.5 per cent to Rs 171 crore from Rs 120 crore a year ago. 																								Net total revenue rose 24.1 per cent to Rs 2,616 crore from Rs 2,100 crore a year ago. Operating profit margin, a measure of efficiency, rose to 11.7 per cent in the quarter from 10.1 per cent in the preceding three months and 9.3 per cent, a year ago.

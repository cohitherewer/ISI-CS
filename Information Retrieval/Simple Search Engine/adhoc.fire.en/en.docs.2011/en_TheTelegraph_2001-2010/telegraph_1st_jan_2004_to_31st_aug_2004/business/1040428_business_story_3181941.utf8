 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 India Inc keeps fingers crossed
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, April 27: India Inc is worried that a rag-tag coalition at the Centre  a prospect that might arise if there is a hung Parliament  could seriously undermine investments in their pet projects.																								Several leading industrialists engaged advisers in debates today on worst-case political scenarios and what that might mean for their companies and their investments.																								If India Inc is worried about anything right now, it is about a hung Parliament with its attendant uncertainties and the possibility of a huge cumbersome government emerging out of the cattle trading that inevitably follow with its various pulls and pressures on policy-making.																								We do not want a hung Parliament, said Swati Piramal, managing director of Nicholas Piramal. We want either the BJP or the Congress to form the government .... we have seen the manifestos of both. 																								Both, she implied, focused on what her company and others were interested in: a friendlier investment climate, financial sector reforms which would make credit cheaper, a robust divestment policy and relaxaton of the limits on foreign investment.																								Like the Piramals, many leading industrial houses believe both sides have similar views on divestment, open-skies policies, relaxing curbs on foreign investments, opening up agriculture and farm trade and on sector-specific plans like coal privatisation. Privately, many admit that the BJP had an edge in their mind as it was seen as slightly more reformist.																								Delhi-based businessman Arun Bharat Ram said, I think the NDA government should be given an opportunity to see if they go through with the reforms which they promised.																								But the main worries are on whether the coalition will be stable or fragile. The NDA has demonstrated its ability to run a coalition. If the Congress comes in, there would be cause for concern as they lack experience in handling large coalitions, said stock market takeover artist Abhishek Dalmia.																								The other worry is the pressure that each individual member of a new coalition would exercise. For instance, if Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress comes back with a bang, coal privatisation could be stymied.																								The head of a Mumbai-based steel and telecom conglomerate, said, Some of us are worried for a different set of reasons: we have all paid money to political parties  but some have backed certain horses more strongly than others and this hasnt really remained a secret.																								Duncan group patriarch G. P. Goenka said that in the case of a hung Parliament, the coalition with the most numbers  which he incidentally sees as NDA  will have an easy task in picking from among several potential partners  DMK, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party ...																								But just in case the other side does form a government, Indian industry feels it can still do business. The Left is an obvious choice as a partner, if the Congress tries to stake its claim to government formation. 																								Even expatriate business executives like Richard Rushton, managing director of Shaw Wallace Breweries, believes, Coalitions have the ability to balance divergent views, regional and sectoral interests.

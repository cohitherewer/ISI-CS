 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Ranbaxy plans to spend more on research
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 10: Pharmaceutical giant Ranbaxy is planning to ramp up its spending on research and development (R amp;D) in its quest for new drugs.																								By 2007, the target is to allocate 10 per cent of the companys turnover to R amp;D activities, said a company spokesperson.																								The Rs 4,516.5-crore pharma major earmarked a 6 per cent of its turnover for R amp;D in 2003.																								Ranbaxy is also forging tie-ups with medical research establishments. On Tuesday, it signed a deal with New Delhi-based Institute of Nuclear Medical and Allied Sciences (INMAS) for screening and evaluation of formulations and new drug delivery systems using gamma scintigraphy.																								INMAS is a premier research institution under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). DRDO is the biggest R amp;D organisation of the government and comes under the defence ministry.																								INMAS will work on application of nuclear medicine in pharmacy. Together, Ranbaxy and INMAS will work on screening and evaluating new molecules using nuclear medicine science. The money that Ranbaxy has put into the project was not disclosed by the company. 																								Ranbaxy announced the agreement with INMAS, which was signed on January 22.																								The spokesperson said Ranbaxy was looking forward to more research-based joint venture programmes with credible institutions. Recently, Ranbaxy had signed a research-based alliance with Anna University, Chennai.																								INMAS has done pioneering work by introducing pharmaceutical applications of nuclear medicine, known as Pharmaco Scintigraphy. The studies are undertaken to provide a route map for the development of molecules and utilised to visualise precisely where oral, pulmonary and other technologies are delivering drugs.																								The method is a very powerful, efficient and cost-effective study designed to develop oral products and facilitates better candidate selection.																								Ranbaxy said that its partnership with INMAS was an endorsement of the companys commitment in working together with institutions and developing and leveraging mutual strengths to build winning combinations.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 12: The countrys industrial output showed a sharp upswing, driven by high growth in the manufacturing sector. The index of industrial production (IIP) recorded a steep 7.4 per cent growth in November 2003, as against only 4.1 per cent in the corresponding previous period.																								According to the data released by Central Statistical Organisation, the cumulative growth from April to November this fiscal was 6.2 per cent, up from 5.4 per cent in the year-ago period.																								As per segment-wise break-up, manufacturing sector recorded an 8.1 per cent growth during November, electricity sector recorded a 4.3 per cent growth and mining posted 4.1 per cent growth.																								It appears that the manufacturing sector has turned around shrugging off fears of a demand compression due to rising inflation rate and job losses. The sector recorded an 8.1 per cent growth in November compared with 4.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year. 																								Showing a healthy domestic demand, consumer durable sector rose 14.1 per cent in November compared with a fall of 1.4 per cent in the same month a year ago.

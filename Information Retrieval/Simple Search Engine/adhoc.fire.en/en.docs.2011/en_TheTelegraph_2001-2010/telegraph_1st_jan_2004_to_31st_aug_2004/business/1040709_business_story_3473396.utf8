The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Clock ticks on car price rise
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYACalcutta, July 8: The Union Budget for 2004-05 has evoked a mixed response from the automobile sector. The passenger car makers like Maruti may be hit because of the prospective rise in input costs.																								Industry sources said car prices will be forced to jack up prices to cope with the input costs, especially from the steel sector. 																								The countrys largest passenger car manufacturer, Maruti Udyog has already announced a price increase across the board to neutralise the 2 per cent cess levied in the budget.																								A Maruti spokesperson said the ex-showroom price in Delhi has gone up by about 0.38 per cent across all models.																								The price of a Maruti 800 standard will be dearer by Rs 792, while the price of Alto LX has gone up by Rs 1026 and Wagon R LX model will witness an increase of Rs 1262. 																								The company has even been forced to increase prices of Baleno Lxi by Rs 2153 although the model is a poor performer compared with its other models.																								Hyundai Motors India, the second-largest four-wheeler maker, does not, however, have any immediate plan to increase prices.																								Talking to The Telegraph, president B. V. R. Subbu said the company will try to absorb the 2 per cent cess which will not be passed on to the customers.																								This will of course put a pressure on our margins. We are currently studying what other impact we have to bear on account of budget proposals. We will take a decision on prices only after seeing the rise in input cost, Subbu said.																								What has worried the car makers is that steel prices are bound to increase phenomenally in the coming days. Although the customs duty has been slashed from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, the landed prices of various products like hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils, used in the auto industry, will remain prohibitive.																								The international steel prices are firming up by over $100 per tonne, putting an enormous pressure on the automobile industry. Even if the domestic steel industry hikes prices by another Rs 2000 per tonne, still it will remain cheaper, an auto analyst said.																								While the tractor manufacturers stand to benefit directly because of the exemption in excise duty, the makers of commercial vehicles too, are expected to make a gain because of the governments focus on the agriculture sector.

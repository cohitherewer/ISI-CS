The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 ICICI Bank thirsty for more equity
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 9: ICICI Bank is planning to raise funds through an equity issue to strengthen its position in retail and infrastructure lending and insurance.																								The board will meet tomorrow to consider a further issue of equity capital, the bank said in a communication issued to the stock exchanges today.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, senior bank officials said while retail banking now formed a significant part of the asset portfolio, more funds were required to strengthen its position in this segment. 																								Retail lending contributes to around half of our balance sheet. However, there is a huge potential still waiting to be tapped in the sector. This will require further funds, he said.																								Insurance is another focus area. Officials said funds would also be required to cater to the infrastructure sector. 																								Infrastructure lending is expected to pick up over the next few months with many power projects attaining financial closure. The demand for credit is also expected to rise with the economy projected to grow at over 8 per cent. 																								Banking analysts said the proposed issue was likely to be a combination of domestic and international equity. 																								It is, however, felt that with foreign holding already at over 71 per cent, the bank will be constrained from selling more than 3 per cent to international investors as current government regulations stipulate a ceiling of 74 per cent for foreign investors.																								The ICICI Bank share gained Rs 10.65 to end at Rs 333.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

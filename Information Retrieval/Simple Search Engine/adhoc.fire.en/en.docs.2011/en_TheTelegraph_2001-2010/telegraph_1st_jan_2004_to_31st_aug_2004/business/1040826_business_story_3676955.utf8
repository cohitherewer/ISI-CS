 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Govt banks on locals to sell eco-tourism
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Minister of state for tourism, Renuka Choudhury, in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: Tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury wants states to plan for rural and eco-tourism by involving local talent.																								We need to take these people on board and teach them the modern skills of preservation of their eco systems. We must look at this issue with great sensitivity and care, said Chowdhury, while inaugurating the two-day international eco and rural tourism marketing conference organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								While many varieties of nature-related tourism can be addressed as eco-tourism, it is essentially a kind practised in relatively undisturbed natural areas.																								The real ownership of ecosystems rests with the local people who celebrate their connectivity with ecoreality through rich rituals and festivals, she said. 																								Chowdhury, however, highlighted the fact that communities living in and around such ecosites are largely disadvantaged mainly due to insufficient and inappropriate inputs in rural development and welfare programmes.																								Stating that the tourism sector has a multiplier effect on employment generation, she said, We are trying to achieve globalisation with a human face.																								Chowdhury also expressed the need to create proper information dissemination system and develop infrastructure to involve local communities in tourism development exercise.																								She said, Our aim is to undertake poverty eradication in an environmentally sustainable manner by enhancing employment potential within the tourism sector. We need to foster economic integration, developing linkages with other sectors.

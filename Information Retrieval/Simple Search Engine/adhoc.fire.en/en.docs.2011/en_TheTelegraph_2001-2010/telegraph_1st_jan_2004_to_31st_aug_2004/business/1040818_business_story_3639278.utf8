The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Google ready for Nasdaq debut
				 Warming up 																								New York/San Francisco , Aug. 17 (Reuters): Google Inc appeared set to start trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, after the Webs number one search engine asked regulators for final approval to price its closely watched initial public offering (IPO). 																								Attention immediately shifted to the likely price of the shares in Googles unconventional multi-billion dollar IPO, which is being priced through an auction. Google is selling 25.7 million shares to the public in an auction that began last Friday, and is expecting its shares to price at $108 to $135 each. 																								The Web search company said on Monday it has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to declare its registration statement effective on Tuesday. 																								Former SEC lawyers familiar with the IPO process said most companies usually price their shares within an hour of having their registration statement declared effective, which allows them to sell shares to the public. If Google prices soon after, the shares would most likely start to trade in the next market session on Wednesday. 																								It looks like theyre all set to go, said Bryan Brown, a partner at Porter amp; Hedges in Houston and a former SEC attorney. 																								Google has said in regulatory filings and again on its website on Monday that it could accept successful bids for its IPO as little as one hour after it notifies bidders that the document has been become effective.																								This means theyre done, and I would guess this means that theyre within their range, said Gregg Berman, partner at Fulbright amp; Jaworski LLP. 																								SEC and Google spokespersons declined to comment. 																								Deal watchers continued to speculate on where Googles pricing would land, given the recent downturn in internet stocks.

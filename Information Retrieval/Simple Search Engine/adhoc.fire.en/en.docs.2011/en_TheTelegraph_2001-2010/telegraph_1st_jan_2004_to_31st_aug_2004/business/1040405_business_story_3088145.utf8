 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Petroleum stocks fuel makeover of indices
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, April 4: Oil and Natural gas Corporation (ONGC) has made its way into NSE nifty in a revamp that testifies to the rising importance of the oil sector in the market.																								The move mirrors trends on Wall Street, where laggards like AT amp;T and Kodak were plucked out from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the first revision in four years. 																								The inclusion of ONGC in the nifty on April 12 is likely to skew the index in favour of petroleum sector stocks.																								Fund managers have chafed at the way the NSE has tweaked its main barometer frequently, but say the entry of ONGC is timed right. Petroleum stocks are the flavour of the markets today. Every time ONGC sneezes, the nifty would catch a cold and vice versa. It will also gain every time the share rises on the bourses, an analyst affiliated to a key FII brokerage.																								Morgan Stanelys MSCI index, a global gauge that foreign fund managers swear by, also plans to bring in ONGC.																								The inclusions follow the recent public offer in which the government sold 10 per cent of its stake in the firm. The issue increases the ONGC floating stock to more than 13 per cent, but the government still controls a whopping 86 per cent in the oil exploration major.																								Giving ONGC company in NSEs 50-share index will be Gail Reliance Industries, Indian Petrochemicals Corp and state-owned oil retailers HPCL and BPCL. Gail came in with Maruti.																								Together, petroleum stocks would comprise 33 per cent of nifty, considered more representative than the oldest and more popular sensex. At present, petroleum stocks account for 21.25 per cent of the index.																								Making way for ONGC will be Digital Globalsoft, the infotech company bought out completely by its US parent through an open offer to local shareholders, and the subsequent delisting of its share from exchanges. 																								The Bombay Stock Exchange revised the sensex in November, including ONGC, Bharti, Wipro, HDFC Bank and Tata Power. This was done after it switched to the free-float mode in September, in line with global indices. 																								The ONGC weightage, a minuscule 2.62 per cent in the sensex, is expected to rise to 6.5 per cent after the 14.25 crore new shares make their way to the market. However, it will still be far below 15.52 per cent in the NSE nifty.

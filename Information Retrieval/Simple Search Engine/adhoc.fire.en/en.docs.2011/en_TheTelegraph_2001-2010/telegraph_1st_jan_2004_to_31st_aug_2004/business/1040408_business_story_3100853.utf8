 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Forts jewel in crown: A mall
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL				 	 All for the glitter																								Calcutta, April 7: Shopping for ornaments will take on a new meaning with Fort Knox, an exclusive jewellery mart promoted by the Calcutta-based Fort group, coming up in the city.																								The nine-storied mall, named after the famous Fort Knox Bullion Depository of the US, is a first-of-its-kind in eastern India. Located on upmarket Camac Street, it aims to bring together reputed national and international brands and non-branded jewellery.																								The idea is to provide the buyers with real value for money by offering an extensive choice range under one roof, Fort Projects Private Limited president Ashok Bengani said.																								Spread over 80,000 sq feet area, Fort Knox will have 37 shops in the first five floors. The fifth to eight floor will accommodate 35 offices for jewellers. This centrally air-conditioned mall will offer facilities like a parking area and a food court. Advanced security systems like burglary, theft and fire sensors will be installed. 																								The response has been encouraging with 60 per cent of the shops and offices already booked by leading jewellers from across the country, said Bengani. Apart from serving the local market, Fort Knox will cater to the requirements of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and other South Asian countries.																								The total investment in the project will be in the range of Rs 15-20 crore. It will be completed by September. 																								This is in wake of a growing jewellery demand in the city. Although gold jewellery found fewer buyers due to a steep price rise, platinum and diamond ones in the city dazzled customers from all over the country.																								According to Diamond Trading Corporation area manager (East) Premjit Sengupta, the city has witnessed a huge growth in diamond sales. In Calcutta, diamond sales increased by 31 per cent in 2003 compared with only 8.4 per cent in 2002. This growth is phenomenal compared with the other metros. Sales in New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai grew by 21 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.

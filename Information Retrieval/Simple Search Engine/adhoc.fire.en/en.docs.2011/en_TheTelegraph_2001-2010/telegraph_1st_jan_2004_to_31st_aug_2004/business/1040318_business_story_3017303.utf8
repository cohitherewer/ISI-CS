 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, March 17: Scarcity of railway wagons to carry raw materials and finished products has created an unprecedented crisis in the steel industry, particularly in the east. At least two sponge iron units in Bengal have suspended production as raw materials did not reach them on time. Many more units wait to face the same fate, sources said.																								The railways had placed an order for 1700 flat wagons, needed to move finished products from steel plants. However, around 3000 units are actually required, sources said. 																								Moreover, only 35 flat wagons were delivered till December.																								There is also a scarcity of wagons that move raw materials, especially coal, from the mines to steel plants.																								WBIDC chairman Somnath Chatterjee has approached the railway ministry and the Prime Ministers office with the problem.																								In a letter to railway minister Nitish Kumar, Chatterjee has highlighted the cause of 15 small and medium-level sponge iron and steel plants in the state.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Bipin Vora, managing director of the SPS group, said the company had at least 18 indent pending for the last three months and the situation has come to such a pass that it might have to drastically cut production.																								Balaji Sponge Iron unit in Durgapur is in a similar crisis. The company has failed to get a single rake despite all efforts in the last three months.																								Even our application for the rakes in December are pending because the railways failed to provide them. We dont know how long we can sustain the production levels with the current stock, Aditya Jajodia, managing director of Jai Balaji group, said.																								The rake problem has reared its head at a time when demand for steel is picking up.																								We bled for the last four to five years as the net price realisation was abysmally low. However, when the situation got corrected and demand picked up, we cannot reap the benefits, Vora said.																								The railways handled a total of 518 million tonnes of traffic in the last fiscal while this year the volume of traffic is expected to be in the region of 550 million tonnes.																								Both Vora and Jajodia feel the railways will fail to provide the rakes to handle this kind of traffic and the steel and cement industries will suffer.

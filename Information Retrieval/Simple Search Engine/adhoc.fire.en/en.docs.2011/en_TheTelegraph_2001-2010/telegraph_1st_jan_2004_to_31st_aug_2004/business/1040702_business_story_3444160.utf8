 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Joint plan to promote Destination India
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 1: The Union government today joined hands with the private sector to draw up a three-year plan to market India as a world tourism destination.																								The Union tourism ministry and the Experience India Society (EIS), which has been formed by a select group of professionals belonging to the travel and hospitality industry, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that seeks to target important markets such as the UK, the US, France, Germany and the South East Asia.																								Together we will be able to take the country forward and make it a good tourism destination. The sky is the limit for us, Union tourism minister Renuka Choudhury said at the MoU-signing ceremony. The MoU was signed by tourism secretary Rathi Vinay Jha and Raymond Bickson of EIS.																								The private partners in this project include hospitality majors like the East India Hotels, Indian Hotels Corporation Limited, Hyatt group, Intercontinental, Thomas Cook and Sita Travels.																								Chowdhury assured the industry that the government would provide all possible help and support to promote tourism and the two partners would responsibly work together in required areas.																								While both the government and private players will pitch in with money, Amitabh Kant, joint secretary in the tourism ministry, said, There is no exact amount that we can spell out now. It will be entirely activity based. There are some activities that the ministry can undertake and certain others which, as a government body, it cant. This is our first attempt to institutionalise public-private partnership.																								While films on Indias hospitality and tourism industry will be developed by the private players, the cost to air it on private channels will be borne by the government. The hospitality industry will also conduct shows like Experience India and run social awareness campaigns, said Kant.

 SATISH JOHN Way to go 																								Mumbai, July 4: Everyones suddenly rooting for the man on the street. Aam Aadmi (the common man) was the leitmotif that helped the Congress to come from behind to record a stunning upset in the elections. 																								Now, Bombay House  the headquarters of the Rs 50,000-crore Tata group  is fashioning plans that seek to woo the masses. 																								The idea to target the masses originally came from management guru C. K. Prahalads theory that the poor ought not to be seen as a burden but rather as a market with a huge growth potential. 																								Prahalad reckoned that the man on the street was the biggest source of growth left in the world that companies had not effectively reached out to.																								Tata mandarins have been spending quite a lot of time figuring out low-priced entry points to grab market share. 																								The effort to reach out to the common man began about three years ago when Ratan Tata first announced plans to come out with a peoples car that would cost just Rs 1 lakh. The car is already under development. 																								They hit pay dirt with the Tata Indica, the hatchback that forced even the best-selling Maruti 800 to slash its price. Nobody believed that Tata Indica, an Indian-designed car, would hit the markets. It is now the dominant car in its segment, J. J. Irani, a board member on Tata Sons, said recently. 																								Other group companies are also seeking to tap the lode in this peoples market. Tata Tea is offering Agni, a low-priced tea, in two economy packs priced at Rs 5 and Rs 10 in the leaf category. This new offering will give customers a chance to taste a great quality of branded tea at an affordable price, said Vivek Mathur, Tata Teas VP marketing, at the launch. 																								Tata Chemicals recently launched Samundar, a cheap edible salt, that targets customers who find flagship product Tata Salt too expensive. It also plans to launch a branded cooking soda  the first in this category. 																								Voltas, a Tata group company with interests in heavy engineering and consumer non-durables, is aggressively targeting the mass market. The aim is to penetrate the mass market, identify demand-supply gaps and develop products to fill them, Voltas said. 																								The company has launched cost-effective, high-performance cooling solutions targeting the semi-urban and rural markets with a range of refrigerators under the Coldcel brand. Its also offering a sub-Rs 10,000 airconditioner under the Vertis brand in 0.6 and 0.8 ton capacities that are aimed at the common man. 																								That isnt all. The Tatas are planning to build over the next five years a rash of low-budget hotels  150 across the country at a cost of Rs 10 crore each  with a room tariff that will be less than Rs 1,000 a day. 																								Indian Hotels, the owners of the upper crust Taj brand of deluxe hotels, recently launched indiOne. IndiOne is a peoples hotel, says Raymond Bickson, MD at Indian Hotels. 																								It will provide facilities that no one in the world can match, says Sheila Nair, chief operating officer of Roots Corporation, a fully-owned subsidiary of Indian Hotels. Nair says indiOne hotels would generate cash profits from the first year and will break even in five years. 																								She claims there are no hotels in India that offer wi-fi connections, fully airconditioned, with gym and housekeeping facilities in this price range. 																								Roots Corporation plans to take the concept across India, to prominent pilgrimage centres like Tirupati and Hardwar and tertiary cities like Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore and suburbs in metro cities. 																								Even at the price, the hotel rooms would be completely airconditioned, with a TV, bath, and offer basic snacks for its guests. Nair says no other hotel, including basic hotels Formula One in Germany, have the facilities they offer at Bangalore. 																								To pare costs, the hotel will not offer room service but will have a cafeteria and tieups with fast food chains. The 100-room hotel will have 25 personnel to manage the hotel. 																								Bickson says they will later take this concept to China and the Gulf. 																								At the same time, its not that Tatas are leaving out the upper crust. They are also planning to shortly unveil a series of spas in premier Taj properties across the country, at a cost of Rs 60 crore. 																								In tony Cuffe Parade, the premier hotel chain will also unveil one of the costliest service apartment hotels in Mumbai.

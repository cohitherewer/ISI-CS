The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 ECL close to turnaround
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, March 8: Eastern Coalfields (ECL), the loss-making subsidiary of Coal India, hopes to turn around in 2005-06.																								The company, which is still under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), will invest Rs 2,956.83 crore over the next five years to mechanise three underground mines and expand one opencast mine. 																								A. Kalam, chairman and managing director, said the investment would come from within the company while some external borrowings could be considered.																								We want to turn around and all the stakeholders want to see the ailing company make profit, Kalam said.																								The company is all set to float a global tender to access international technology, particularly to modernise the three underground mines at Kottadih, Jhanjhra and Sarpic.																								Kalam said the technical collaboration would be on a risk-gain basis. The technical know-how as well as equipment would be used by ECL on a deferred payment basis.																								Under the arrangement, the company will continue to own the mines. The collaborators will provide ECL with the equipment and technology on an understanding that the loss and gains will be equally borne by them.																								The modernisation of the three underground mines and expansion of the Rajmahal opencast mines will help the company raise its overall production capacity from 29 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 41.7 MTPA.																								Kalam says mechanisation is important not only to increase productivity in underground mines but also for safety reasons.																								Currently, various complicated jobs are done manually while in advanced countries much of the work is done by machines.																								Once we are able to mechanise the underground mines, the safety parameters will be totally met and if there is any surplus worker, we will deploy him in a more productive way, he said.																								The initial investment in the three underground mines will be around Rs 200 crore while for Rajmahal opencast, the investment has been pegged at Rs 800 crore. 																								We also plan to go for longwall mining for the Jhanjhra project, for which another Rs 200 crore will be required, Kalam said.																								Kalam said the Union coal ministry and CILs support has helped the company evolve a turnaround strategy to be implemented in the next couple of years.																								The amount of confidence and determination that I see in the employees of all sections should help us meet our target before time, he said.																								Coal India, under the instruction of the coal ministry, has recently written off over Rs 500 crore worth of unsecured loans. It has also agreed to convert the current account balance of Rs 1,532 crore into equity as part of the financial restructuring plan.																								ECL plans to set up a new committee to evaluate the viability of its collieries. According to a senior official, a fresh decision will be taken on the projects that were earlier abandoned for private mining. 																								The committee will look into the quantity and quality of reserves in all the mines, on the basis of which, a fresh decision will be taken so far as awarding any mines for private mining, he said.

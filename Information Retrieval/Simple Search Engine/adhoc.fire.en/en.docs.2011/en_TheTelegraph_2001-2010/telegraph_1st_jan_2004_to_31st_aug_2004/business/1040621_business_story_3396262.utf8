		 Monday, June 21, 2004  Q amp;A				 Home a-loan
																																																																																													I am above 60 years and a pension holder. I have purchased a piece of land for constructing a house. Can I get home loan from a bank?																																																																													S. . Das, Burdwan
																																																																																													For most institutions providing housing finance, the eligible age for applying for home loan is the retirement age or 65 years, whichever is earlier. A person who has a year of service left before he retires and is eligible for a pension income of at least Rs 6,000 can avail a home loan under certain terms and conditions. Since sanction of home loan is at the discretion of the institutions it would be advisable if you contact any institution and get proper guidance.																																					NSS solutions																																																																																															I had opened an NSS account in January 1991. The present balance in this account is Rs 1,20,000. Can I withdraw the entire balance and put the fund in PPF account for tax-free investment? Will the amount qualify for rebate under section 88 in 2004-05? Can I put the amount received from a matured LIC policy in PPF? 																																																																													Sunil Kumar Das, Calcutta
																																																																																													Although you can put the amount in PPF, tax rebate under section 88 can be claimed up to an investment of Rs 70,000 per annum. 																																					Gains, gains!																																																																																															 case of long-term capital gains, is any rebate allowed? How much is allowed to be included in annual income? If I lose money due to fluctuations in the market, can the amount be deducted from total income? 																																																																													R. Gupta, Calcutta
																																																																																													No rebate is allowed on long-term capital gains. If you suffer short-term capital loss, then you can set it off against any capital gains and long-term capital loss can be set-off only against long-term capital gains.																																					Varishtha poser																																																																																															I am 61 years old and retired. I have invested in Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana and earn Rs 2,000 per month from this scheme. Under which section can I claim tax rebate on this income and how much per year? 																																																																													B. K. Chatterjee
																																																																																													Income from Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana is taxable and no tax benefit is allowed.

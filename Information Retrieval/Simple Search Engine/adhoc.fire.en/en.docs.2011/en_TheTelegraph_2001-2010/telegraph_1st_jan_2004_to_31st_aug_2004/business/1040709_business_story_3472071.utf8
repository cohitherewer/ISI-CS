The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Coalition compulsions to the fore
																								The budget with a rural focus attempts to give a pro-poor face to reforms, possibly populist, increasing transaction costs in the financial markets backed by strong foreign direct investment complemented by higher FII limits resulting in a possibly stronger rupee. 																								While the thrust to agriculture in the budget is laudable, the implementation through active intervention is a challenge to help in generating gainful employment and improved infrastructure.																								The thrust areas are too large to achieve focused results in the coming six months as enhancing investment in industry, improving agricultural product markets and promoting agri-businesses with universal access to telecommunication facilities and housing for all are long-drawn processes that will not yield results in the immediate future.																								The populist flavour to the budget may prove to be a dampener for portraying India as an investment destination as archaic labour laws and weak infrastructure coupled with high incidence of tax will continue to plague the country. This in turn may affect productivity and efficiency as cost of goods produced will be higher and India as a manufacturing hub for foreign multinationals may not take off as expected.																								The budget possibly attempts at being politically correct though not necessarily making good economic sense as subsidies continue to increase and indirect tax rates continue to remain high. Moreover, individual disposable income has been adversely affected by a two per cent cess to fund primary education and mid-day meals.																								Possibly the silver-lining is the emphasis on research and development through accelerated tax benefits and revamping vocational learning centres like ITI to enhance the number of skilled technicians thereby possibly raising the services sector income in the country.																								Streamlining foreign direct investment rules and raising FII limits in debt funds and leaving the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) as a one-stop service centre and facilitator can result in increased foreign exchange inflows to the country. This is a step in the right direction. The disinvestment programme has been drastically changed possibly due to coalition compulsions and this can affect the pace of reforms.																								A notable feature of the tax proposals is the VAT, which is beneficial and can greatly simplify the process of taxation in the indirect segment in tune with international practices.																								However, the newly-introduced turnover tax can affect the markets adversely as transaction costs will increase thereby reducing liquidity, leading to a probable increase in the cost of government borrowings. Similarly the 20 per cent dividend distribution tax on corporate houses for debt mutual funds could be a retrograde step keeping in view the prevailing healthy economic climate in the country.

 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Wait over for ONGC share applicants
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 1: ONGC shares finally made their way into the demat accounts of applicants after a five-day delay. 																								MCS Ltd  the registrars to the largest public offering in the country  had messed up the allotment process by giving full allotment to some of the high-networth investors.																								The shares finally came to our customers account, said a dealer at Birla Sunlife, a brokerage outfit here.																								Once the allotment was done, the shares softened as supply increased with the governments 14.25 crore shares finding its way into investors accounts. 																								The share opened at Rs 821 and touched an intra-day high of 834.95 before closing at Rs 813.05.																								Many investors had jumped the gun last Friday by short-selling ONGC shares based on expectations that the shares would be deposited in their demat accounts by Monday. They found to their dismay that the shares were called for auction as they failed to honour their delivery of shares.																								Almost two lakh shares were auctioned at an average price of Rs 840, resulting in a huge loss for the smart aleck who tried to make a fast buck by selling shares that they presumed would be allotted to them on Monday.																								Meanwhile, the depositories have completed the process started by the registrars by crediting the shares to investors. The big question, however, remains on how the shares sold by investors on Monday would be treated by the regulators. MCS pullout																								After the ONGC fiasco, registrar MCS Ltd has withdrawn from the ICICI Bank issue to be replaced by Karvy Consultants.																								MCS Ltd, who were also the registrars for Power Trading Corporation, have withdrawn from working on the domestic equity issue of ICICI Bank, investment banking sources said here today.																								The allotment work would now be conducted by Karvy Consultants, they said.																								ICICI Banks equity issue aggregating up to Rs 3,500 crore opens tomorrow for bidding. The price band for the issue has been fixed at Rs 255 to Rs 295 per share.																								MCS was currently busy on the allotment work of Power Trading Corporation shares. The listing of PTC has been postponed twice and is now likely to be listed early next week on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

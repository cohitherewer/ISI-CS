 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Lodha responds with caveat filing
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 17: Rajendra Singh Lodha has filed a caveat in Calcutta High Court in order to get a hearing when the two joint wills of M. P. Birla and Priyamvada Birla come up for probate.																								Khaitan amp; Co, representing the Birla family, today filed a petition for probate of the two mutual and concurrent wills. 																								Fox amp; Mandal filed the caveat as the solicitors for Lodha.																								Now, there are four distinct strands to the case, two separate probate petitions and two sets of caveats, said a legal expert. According to him, the Birla family, in all likelihood, will question the status of Lodha  described as a rank outsider  and oppose his right to be heard in connection with their probate petition.																								With todays development, there is now the will of Priyamvada Birla, made in 1999, which Lodha has filed for probate in court. The Birlas are contesting this will and have filed caveats to get a hearing. In the joint wills filed for probate today, the roles are reversed  the Birlas are seeking legal authentication and Lodha is asking to be heard. 																								. G. Khaitan of Khaitan amp; Co. said that the joint wills were made on July 13, 1982 after making a few alterations to the couples earlier joint wills of 1981.																								These wills are not registered. Besides, why did the Birla family take so long in moving the probate petition? asked a source close to Lodha. 																								There was no need to file a probate petition in the lifetime of Priyamvada Birla, said Khaitan. The family couldnt have done anything till the mourning period was over. Priyamvada Birla died on July 3, but Lodha was ready with all the papers by July 7. 																								Khaitan added that mutual wills cannot be revoked. The Birla family, therefore, is convinced that the will with Lodha is not the will of the late Priyamvada Birla. 																								A new will after mutual wills needs clarification on what triggered it. So, the court will examine whether Priyamvada Birlas will of 1999 explained why she changed her earlier will, observed a legal expert. 																								The court will also weigh to what extent Priyamvada Birlas final will bore the spirit of the wishes of M. P. Birla, mentioned in his joint will with his wife, he added.

 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Crude bridges Exxon-GE gap
																								New York, May 9 (Reuters): Exxon Mobil Corp, the worlds largest listed oil firm, may soon surpass General Electric Co to become the worlds biggest company, if energy prices continue to rally.																								On Thursday, the whiff of $40-a-barrel oil helped Exxon shares reach a two-year high of $44.24, giving the company a market value of $287 billion. 																								GE, which makes everything from light bulbs, mortgages and sitcoms to jet engines and power-plant turbines, still has a comfortable lead at $311 billion, about 8 per cent higher. But analysts say its place at the top is in jeopardy.																								You dont need that much of a jump (by Exxon) for this to happen, Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P ) equities analyst Howard Silverblatt said. Oil prices are going up, while GE has a lot of financing businesses, where rising rates can interfere with earnings. GE disputes the idea that higher rates will have a major impact on its results. 																								S amp;P, the credit rating agency that manages the benchmark S amp;P 500 Index, forecasts Exxons market value will reach $328 billion this year  though it will be a photo-finish with software giant Microsoft Corp. 																								GE, meanwhile, could slip to $306 billion, according to S amp;P forecasts, as its earnings power dims this year. If the lead does change hands, it would cap off a remarkable period for the energy sector. 																								GE was the most valuable US company on December 31 for the better part of 10 years, with the exception of 2002, 1999 and 1998, when new economy fervor propelled Microsoft to the top spot. 																								GE was also among the five largest US companies throughout the 1980s and early 90s. 																								To be sure, these figures are only snapshots in time. Predecessor company Exxon Corp. ranked atop the S amp;P 500 at the end of 1990 through 1992, when military action in Iraq last sent oil prices above $40 a barrel. 																								While market cap is certainly one indicator of success, we are prouder of the disciplined management that we bring, said Exxon Mobil spokesman Tom Cirigliano. 																								Its no secret that Exxons fortunes rise and fall with the price of energy commodities. And with oil and gas profits gushing, investors have sent Exxon shares up 25 per cent in the past 12 months, outperforming the S amp;P 500 by three points. But those profit swings are the main reason oil stocks are less valuable. Exxon shares currently have a price-to-earnings multiple of 17, a steep discount to the S amp;P 500s multiple of about 27 times earnings. 																								Shares of GE, a diversified industrial and financial conglomerate, fetches 20 times earnings. Still, a growing number of investors have concluded energy prices wont fall back to historic averages any time soon. 																								On Friday, oil broke through the $40-a-barrel mark, the highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait in October 1990, on worries about security concerns in West Asia and thin US gasoline supplies. 																								High-energy prices are bad news for the global economy, but theyve generated windfall profits for Exxon.

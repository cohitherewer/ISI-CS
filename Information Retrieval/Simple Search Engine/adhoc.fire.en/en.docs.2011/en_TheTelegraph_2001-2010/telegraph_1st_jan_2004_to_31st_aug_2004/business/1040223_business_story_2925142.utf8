The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 All that glitters isnt gold
																								after the sharp rally in gold, its now the turn of silver to set the precious metal market ablaze. On Friday, spot silver closed at Rs 10,350 a kg in Delhi, having gained more than Rs 1,500 over the last couple of months.																								In international markets  like London and New York  spot silver is trading at a shade over $6.5 a troy ounce, having declined a few cents over the last two days on profit-taking.																								Last week, silver futures (for March delivery) hit a six-year high of $6.88 per troy ounce in New York  a level it has not witnessed since January 1998.																								In 2004 alone, silver has advanced more than 15 per cent, but bullion market observers say the metal may not have run out of steam yet.																								Gold, on the other hand, was trading at $398 a troy ounce in London on Saturday evening, having fallen from $430  a 15-year high it scaled last month.																								Its still considerably higher than a year ago, and analysts expect gold prices to firm up again.																								But why are these metals on fire?																								The simplest explanation is, precious metals are priced in US dollars in international markets and the currency is weakening. In the case of silver, which is a quasi-industrial metal, some analysts are of the view that it was further buoyed by the recovery in manufacturing.																								And it appears the recovery is going to continue, and silver prices will harden further.					 ANIEK PAUL

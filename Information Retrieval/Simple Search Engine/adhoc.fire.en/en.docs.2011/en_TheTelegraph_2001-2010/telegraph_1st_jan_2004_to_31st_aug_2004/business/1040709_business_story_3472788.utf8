 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Textile taxes get a new garb
 SATISH JOHN Mumbai, July 8: Finance minister P. Chidambaram introduced a new tax regime for the textile sector when he gave the industry the option of choosing the excise exemption or the Cenvat route  a move that cheered the handloom and powerloom sectors.																								Stating that there will be no mandatory excise duty on pure cotton, wool and silk, whether it is fibre, yarn, fabric or garment, Chidambaram said under the exemption route, no excise duty will be applicable under any stage, except on man-made fibre or filament yarn. 																								However, the non-cotton segment was at a disadvantage compared with that using cotton as its main raw material as Chidambaram ruled that if a non-cotton manufacturer opts for the Cenvat route where credit can be taken for all excise duties paid at earlier stages, the uniform rate will be 8 per cent. 																								On the other hand, for the pure cotton sector, the uniform rate has been fixed at 4 per cent on yarn, fabrics, garments and made-ups.																								But the man-made fibre and yarn industry that comprised polyester filament yarn (PFY) players such as Reliance Industries were in for a disappointment with excise duties for the segment left untouched at 24 per cent, while that on man-made fibre is at 16 per cent. However, in the case of viscose filament yarn, the excise duty has been hiked to 16 per cent from 12 per cent. 																								The finance ministers proposal to give the industry an option of choosing the excise exemption route or the Cenvat mode fulfiled the long-standing demand of the handloom and powerloom sectors.																								Powerloom and handloom units had expressed their anguish against this Cenvat regime stating that it was not possible for weavers who are illiterate and do not have any facilities to maintain records as necessitated by this system. 																								Many associations supported by political parties had suggested that the optional duty system allowed previously be continued and the mandatory Cenvat chain abolished.																								The finance ministers proposals were largely welcomed by the industry with experts pointing out that it is coming at an opportune time when the quota regime is set to go by January 2005. It is a good budget, said D. K. Nair of the Indian Cotton Mills Federation.																								Presenting the budget, Chidambaram said while prices of fabrics will be moderate due to the changes in the tax structure, industry analysts, sharing a similar view, point out that garment exporters could also stand to gain under the new structure.																								Analysts point out that the budget, which has introduced for the first time the option of zero-tax regime for the cotton textile industry, would help this industry make major strides in the post-quota regime with exports now becoming more competitive.Reacting to the budget proposals, Indian Spinners Association president R.L.Toshniwal said though the cotton textile industry would make significant progress in the post-quota regime, the earlier duty disadvantage of 5 per cent suffered by blended yarn has now widened. This he said, would affect the industry leading to even closure of some units.

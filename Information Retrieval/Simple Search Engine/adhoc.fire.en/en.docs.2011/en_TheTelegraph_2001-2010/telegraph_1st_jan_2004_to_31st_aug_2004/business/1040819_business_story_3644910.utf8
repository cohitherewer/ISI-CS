The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Flying into flak
 							 - Patel is a man in a hurry, impatient to get things done																								Walk into youthful civil aviation minister Praful Patels room and you get the impression that he is a man in a hurry to get things done. Perhaps because he is young, perhaps because he is trying to do too many things at a time. But then the impression sticks.Eventually, Patel  a businessman from Mumbai dealing in tobacco, construction, real estate, edible oil and healthfood  clears his desk, asks a few people to wait outside politely, beams a welcome smile and orders a cup of tea. He has removed the clutter from his table and his mindspace. Leaning forward, Patel launches forth in defence of his plans to modernise airports with private equity, a pet project of his which has attracted a lot of flak from the Congress-led governments main ally  the Left. His body language is one of a man trying hard to convince others about something he has worked hard for.Time will ultimately tell whether he does manage to convince his governments partners. But for some time to come now, Patel will remain a man in the eye of a storm, for trying to do what he wants in such a short time-frame.Excerpts from an interview of civil aviation minister Praful Patel with Jayanta Roy Chowdhury																								Q. There is strident opposition to your plan to privatise airports. How do you react to that?																								A. India needs better airports. Not just in Delhi and Mumbai but everywhere. Our problem is that we do not have enough money to go around. 																								Besides, we do not have the technical and managerial experience needed to run world-class airports. Once these airports are built, we can take up other airports using the experience we gain from the improvements wrought in these two airports. 																								Airports in Calcutta and Chennai can be taken up by the Airports Authority itself. 																								Q. Does this mean there can be compromises made to get the Left, which has been opposing your move, to agree?																								A. No, no compromises are needed with the Left. A holistic approach is needed instead. If we want Indian aviation to take off and provide new jobs, generate fresh revenues, we have to bring in better airports and that means more resources...																								Look, airport infrastructure is a large part of the solution to problems in our industry. Look at the potential we have. Dubai and Singapore have gone places, we have not. And these are airports which cannot service any domestic sector, people drive to domestic destinations there. Besides the global traffic potential, look at our domestic traffic. Q. The Left have sent an alternative plan for leveraging Airports Authority of Indias reserves of over Rs 2,000 crore and using cash flow expected over the next few years to modernise the two airports where you want investors to take up a 74 per cent stake. What is your response to their alternative?																								A. Their (Left) approach is incorrect ... the plan envisages using reserves to modernise these two airports, but we dont have that much money. There is not more than Rs 1,000 crore with AAI. We cant do (the work needed at Delhi and Mumbai with that kind of money. We need at least Rs 5,000 crore for each. 																								Even if we find the money, how good are we at managing projects like this? I will talk to the Left and explain to them our point of view, talk to the unions. I will continue addressing their concerns. From 74 per cent we have brought FDI levels permitted down to 49 per cent. We have already explained. No one will lose their jobs ....Q.The Left is also bothered about your plans to let private airlines buy up to 10 per cent stake in these two airports. They point out that this would mean these airlines could hog time slots and parking bays in these vital airports leaving the nationalised carriers out in the cold.																								A. No, we are keen that everybody participates in the process. We will encourage nationalised carriers too to participate in the bidding process. We want them to have a level playing field. Q. Private airlines want to go abroad, beyond the South Asian skies they have been allowed to go to. What is your take on that?																								A: Private airlines will be allowed to fly abroad but in a calibrated manner. It has to be done in a holistic manner ... we will see if the countrys requirements are not met by state-run airlines then private carriers will be allowed (to take off on international routes.)																								However, they cannot be suddenly allowed all freedom. There has to be a calibrated entry. I cant say at this stage which sectors will be allowed when. These are modalities which have to be worked out by experts.

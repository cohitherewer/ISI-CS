 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 LatAm companies woo local oil firms
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 2: Latin American countries are trying to woo Indian oil companies like Reliance Industries and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) for exploration.																								Recently ambassadors of a number of Latin American countries visited Reliances operations at Jamnagar in Gujarat in a bid to establish trade ties with the petrochemical behemoth.																								We met Mukesh Ambani at Jamnagar and requested him to consider undertaking exploration activities in our countries, said Juan Carretero Ibez, the ambassador of Cuba.																								Mr Ambani has promised to send a delegation of top officials of his company to explore opportunities in our countries. We have huge reserves, especially off-shore, he added.																								ONGC is believed to be close to reaching an agreement with the Cuban authorities that would allow it to commercially explore oil reserves in that country. We are at advanced stages of discussion with ONGC, the Cuban ambassador said.																								The ambassadors of Latin American states like Cuba, Uruguay, Chile and Brazil work in tandem to promote their countries. They have an informal alliance called Grulac  Group of Latin American and Carribean Countries  through which they pitch for investments in their countries. 																								Some of these countries like Cuba have been investing in India as well. Cuba has investments in biotechnology companies in India. Juan Carretero Ibez said Cuban state-owned firms were planning to scale up investments in India.																								Though Cuban investments have, so far, gone to Gurgaon and Bangalore, the ambassador says Bengal is on its radar.																								We are interested in eastern India as well. We are planning to bring to Calcutta a trade delegation from Latin American countries, said Juan Carretero Ibez, who was on a short visit to the city on an invite from Bengal Initiative  a group that promotes the state as investment destination.

 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Chinese policy fails to melt metal majors
 VIVEK NAIR 																								Mumbai, May 3: The domestic metal industry is not worried over the policies initiated by China to cool down its economy. Even though the local stock markets have raised an alarm.																								The industry is downplaying the recent mayhem at the metal counters as sheer over-reaction on the part of the bourses. They feel that commodity prices are likely to regain some of the lost ground and remain firm for a better part of this year on account of a strong demand.																								A senior official from a leading steel company here, said that notwithstanding the policies initiated by the Chinese government, the country is likely to import close to 30 million tonnes of hot-rolled coils (HRC) this calendar year to satiate the domestic demand. This demand will ensure HRC prices remaining firm between $540 and $570 per tonne, he added.																								What we are seeing now is only a temporary blip. The Chinese will enter the market again after May 8 for fresh buying. This apart, the other markets are buoyant as well, he pointed out.																								According to Anant Katare, metals analyst at Khandwala Securities, even if there is a slowdown, average metal prices will remain at last calendar years level owing to the existing demand-supply gap.																								Additional ferrous supply is expected towards the end of this year. Katare added that signs of improvement in the US economy is another encouraging factor. This could augur well for global metal prices as consumption in the worlds largest economy could pick up in the months to come.																								Such optimism is not restricted to ferrous metals alone. In case of non-ferrous metals too, industry players reckon that the terrific demand for steel and other metals will not result in prices coming down dramatically. 																								An official from a non-ferrous metal powerhouse here indicated that while copper prices cooled down to $2,650 per tonne, they are likely to inch up to $2,850 per tonne over the next few days.																								Metal stocks have been under intense pressure over the past couple of trading sessions. 																								While the Chinese government had earlier initiated moves to cool down its economy by curbing indiscriminate financing to the metal sector, sentiments dip further when Chinas premier said that the country wants to cool of its economy growth. 																								Following this, observers anticipated a slowdown in demand from that country. China has so far played a pivotal role in surging global commodity prices on account of its huge demand. 																								Despite the brave face put up by the industry, metal counters continued to reel at the stock exchanges today. On the BSE, Hindalcos price fell by Rs 48.25 to Rs 1,066.45, Tisco was weak by Rs 15.30 to Rs 342.50, Nalco ended lower at Rs 162.80 compared with its previous finish of Rs 169.60.

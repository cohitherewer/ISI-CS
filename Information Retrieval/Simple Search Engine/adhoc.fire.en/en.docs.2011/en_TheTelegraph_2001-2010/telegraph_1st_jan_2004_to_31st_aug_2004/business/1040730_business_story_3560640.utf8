 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Lever net slips on price war
 OUR BUREAUX 																								July 29: The blistering price war in the fast-moving consumer goods segment left a deep scar on Hindustan Lever with the companys bottomline declining 45.78 per cent for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. 																								Net profit dropped to Rs 244.49 crore against Rs 450.93 crore recorded in the same quarter of 2003-04. Sales declined marginally to Rs 2,571.64 crore from Rs 2,700.97 crore in the year-ago period.																								The companys board has recommended an interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per share for the year ending December 31, 2004, chairman M S Banga said here today. HLL has fixed August 16 as the record date for determining the shareholders who will be entitled to receive the interim dividend.																								Announcing the results, Banga said, In an unprecedented scenario, we have held volume market shares in most categories.																								Competitive pricing and higher brand support had an effect on our profits in the short term. However, we view this as an investment for the long-term growth, he added.																								The company spent Rs 256.66 crore on advertising and promotional campaigns in the reporting quarter, which was up 30 per cent from Rs 197.57 crore spent in the corresponding previous quarter.																								Hindustan Lever scrip opened at Rs 122 on the BSE today. It touched an intra-day low of Rs 116.95, but recovered partly to end at Rs 118.20, a loss of Rs 3.65.																								For the six-month period ended June 30, the company posted a lower net profit of Rs 539.37 crore (Rs 833.85 crore) on a total income of Rs 4,924.98 crore (Rs 5,071.90 crore). SAIL net zooms 336%																								Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) today reported a record 336 per cent jump in net profit during the April-June quarter to Rs 1,111.59 crore from Rs 254.69 crore in the same period last year, the company said.																								The steel major also registered its highest ever turnover of Rs 5,633 crore, up 18 per cent from Rs 4,765 crore a year ago.																								The significant rise in SAILs bottomline was led by the Rs 960-crore debt reduction during the quarter. The company reduced its debt burden to Rs 7,728 crore from Rs 8,689 crore in the corresponding period last year.																								After achieving the turnaround, SAIL is well set on a growth path. Our financial performance in the first quarter amply reflects this, said chairman V. S. Jain. Zee net up 18%																								The Zee group has reported a 17.58 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 73.25 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 62.3 crore posted in the corresponding previous quarter.																								Total income has increased to Rs 336.54 crore from Rs 308.38 crore a year earlier.																								The board has recommended a dividend of rupee one per share for the year ended March 31, 2004.

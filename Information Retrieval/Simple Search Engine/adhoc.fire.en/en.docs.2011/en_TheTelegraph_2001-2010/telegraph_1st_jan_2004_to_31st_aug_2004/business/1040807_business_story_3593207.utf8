Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Aug. 6: The China-based Shenzhen Hangsheng Electronics Company, a leading car electronics maker, is scouting for an Indian partner to set up a manufacturing unit in this country.																								International consultant Morgan Stanley, which is helping the company with its initial public offering, has advised it tap the Indian market.																								Talking to The Telegraph, Shenzhen Hangsheng general manager (overseas marketing) Mike Guan said, We are looking at the emerging market in India seriously. We are also exploring opportunities in the information technology sector to set up an IT facility here.																								Guan was speaking on the sidelines of the India-China business enclave organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here today.																								The company is located at Shenzhen in the Guangdong province in southern China. The city has one of the three special economic zones and is the first to carry out the opening-up policy in China.																								India is an emerging market with flourishing local industry. We are, therefore, looking for a local partner to expand our business in India, Guan added.																								On whether the company is looking at Bengal to set up the manufacturing facility, Guan said, It is too premature to comment. But if we find that the state suits our investment programme, we might look into it. We are aware that the state is strong in information technology.																								Shenzhen Hangsheng manufactures car audio equipment like DVDs and CDs. At present, the 10-year old company has a $100-million turnover, which the company expects to vault to $200 million in the current fiscal.																								The company exports its products to 50 countries, including Europe, America, Japan, Korea, South Africa and West Asia.																								The company plans to enter into India, Russia and Croatia. It wants to get listed on bourses either in Hong Kong or the US.																								Currently, the grey market occupies around two-thirds of the car stereo segment in India. However, the share of the grey market operators has been declining due to increased awareness about quality and after-sales services. Last year, the organised car stereo market, dominated by Sony, Panasonic, Alpine and Blaupunkt, grew 12 per cent.																								The automobile industry in India is still at a nascent stage but growing rapidly. The opportunities in the industry are attracting big names and they are investing in infrastructure, design and development, and marketing. 																								The automobile industry contributes 17 per cent of the total indirect taxes collected by the exchequer and is a driver of product and process technologies. It has become an excellent manufacturing base for global players.

 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 22: As Asian economies turn aggressive for growth, Indian automobile companies have started eyeing intra-regional trade.																								Easy regulations and cost competitiveness is motivating Tata Automotive Components to set up a manufacturing facility in China.																								We are looking at the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facility there, but nothing is finalised. While group companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy services and Tata Tea already have their presence in East Asia in a small way, we are willing to expand, said Kishor Chaukar, managing director, Tata Industries on the sidelines of the third Asia-Pacific forum organised by the Confederation Of Indian Industry (CII).																								Clarifying that low duties are not the only prompting factor to look eastwards, he said, Regulatory advantages drive production in China. In addition, easy movement of goods, quality of steel, designing and engineering are some of the key factors that will influence our decision.																								He also informed that Tata Teleservices, the telecom venture of the Tatas, will invest more than $2 billion in the CDMA network in India over the next two years. The money will be raised partly through debt and partly through equity, he said.																								The telecom venture is all set to roll out broadband services for home and corporate consumers, said Chaukar. 																								Stating that the entertainment sector in India is growing up to be a huge opportunity, he added, We are working on a direct-to-home (DTH) format.																								The Tatas have already floated a company by the name of Space Television, in which they hold 80 per cent equity, while the remaining 20 per cent rests with Star TV.																								Sharing his business plans for Mahindra and Mahindra, CII president Anand Mahindra said, We are looking up at opening an assembly operation for our sport-utility vehicles in Indonesia. But it is only at a consideration stage.																								He said that the low-tariff policy adopted by the Asean region for car exports until year 2005, is a driving force. 																								Stating that M amp;M is already present in South Africa and Russia in a small way, the automobile giant is looking forward to markets like Malaysia and Thailand.																								Speaking about the companys tractor unit, he said, We aspire to be number one manufacturers of tractors.We are looking at both organic and inorganic ways of growing in this area. 																								Mahindra said M amp;Ms inventory is at a historical low. 																								We only have a 15-day supply chain at present.This all is happening because the market is recovering very strongly, he added.

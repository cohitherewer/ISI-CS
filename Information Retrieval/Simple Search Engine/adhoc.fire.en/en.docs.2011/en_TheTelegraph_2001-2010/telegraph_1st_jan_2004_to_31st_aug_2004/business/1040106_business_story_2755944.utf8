 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Jessop case bunched with other divestment petitions
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court today tagged two more petitions challenging divestment in National Fertilizers Ltd and Engineers India Ltd (EIL) along with the one challenging the selloff of the governments stake in Calcutta-based Jessop Ltd to Ruia Cotex.																								A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice V. . Khare and justices S. B. Sinha and S. H. Kapadia issued notices to the Centre and said fresh hearing would commence after the reply by the Union government.																								The Chief Justice reiterated the apex courts decision in the oil sector divestment case that those (companies) nationalised by an enactment of Parliament would require another legislation to divest. In other cases (where no legislation was enacted by Parliament), the government could go ahead with divestment.																								At this, senior counsel for National Fertilizers and EIL Officers Association, Salman Khurshid, argued that even in public sector companies without a legislation of Parliament, the question of involvement of the Consolidated Fund of India is there to settle the question of the divestment process.																								The judges said this aspect could be argued during hearings. 																								The case will resume after four weeks when the Centres reply would be ready. 																								Attorney general Soli Sorabjee told the court that the apex courts decision in the oil sector divestment case too could be clarified in the light of emerging new economic situation.																								The Supreme Court had already indicated that a fresh look was needed in the matter and virtually agreed to re-examine its verdict quashing the process of divestment in the two oil majors  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL).																								The apex court had also stayed all proceedings for and against divestment in various high courts across the country and said it would give a comprehensive verdict in the matter so that conflicting verdicts by different high courts were avoided. 																								The judges agreed with Sorabjee that the case has presented an opportunity to have a re-look at the entire process of divestment, especially the judgement of the Supreme Court in the HPCL-BPCL matter.

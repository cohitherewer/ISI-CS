 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, March 29: Radico Khaitan Ltd (RKL) will launch two vodkas and one gin brand in about a fortnights time. Launching of the brands is part of an expansion drive at Radico, which includes brand acquisitions, capacity expansion and expanding the product portfolio.																								Abhishek Khaitan, joint managing director, RKL, said, We want to enter the white drink segment. In about 15 days time, we will launch two vodka and one gin brand. 																								The brand names are yet to be finalised, said Khaitan. One of the vodka brands will be a bottled in origin (BIO) product, while the other will be an internal brand of the company catering to the upper segment, he added. 																								Radico is an established player in the whisky and rum segment with its 8 PM brand of whisky and Contessa brand of rum. The new brands that it wants to acquire are likely to be in these segments only and not in the white drinks category, said Khaitan. We are in advanced stages of talks with some of the brands in the whisky and rum segments, he said.																								More than a year back, RKL had acquired Black Cat Rum from Sikkim Distilleries and Whitefield Whisky and brandy from Nirayu Distilleries.																								RKL is going for a total production capacity expansion, for which it will spend Rs 150 crore in the next three years to set up one distillery and 10 production units. Both greenfield and existing unit takeovers will be considered for expansion, said Khaitan. 																								Recently, the company took an external commercial borrowing (ECB) of Rs 45 crore to fund part of its expansion and acquisition plans. 																								Currently, the company has one distillery in Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, a new production plant it has recently put up in Rajasthan and 21 contract units from which it outsources production. 																								The total production capacity of Radico Khaitan is about 12 million cases, of which the current output is 9.5 million cases. We seek to have a production capacity of 17 million cases in three years time, said Khaitan.																								He said the expansion is in tune with the 45 per cent growth of the company. 																								The turnover of RKL was Rs 620 crore in the fiscal ended March 2003. The turnover for the nine months ended December last year stood at Rs 560 crore, a 60 per cent growth compared with the corresponding period last fiscal.

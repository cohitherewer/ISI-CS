 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Get that gizmo, cost no bar
 Shopping is fun. But what if you dont have cash? Chandralekha Tulal weighs the financing options																								Neighbours envy, owners pride  everyone remembers the green devil mouthing these words in the Onida ad. That marked the start of the consumerist craze of bringing home that gizmo and making all around you turn that delicate shade of green.																								With the economy booming, people have more disposable cash in their hand and what better way to splurge than owning the latest in electronic technology to grace your home. So, you go on a hunt and finally zero in on the right gadget  be it a simple colour television, washing machine, airconditioner, microwave oven or the latest home theatre, audio system, laptop computer, digital camera or even the snazzy mobile phone.																								But the lord knows that it hasnt been easy with the wide choice of brands, features, sizes and prices. Next, you have to figure out how you will pay for your dream choice. Banks and finance companies are there to bail you out, but you still have to choose the one with whom you want to walk. 																								Financing at zero per cent: wheres the catch? 																								With the interest rates bottoming out, the most common scheme on offer is zero per cent financing. Finance companies like GE Countrywide, Citi Financial and Bajaj Finance have associated with the electronic majors to provide this scheme through retail outlets. 																								But do not get carried away by that bait. More often than not, there is a hidden charge. You will have to pay a processing fee  GE Countrywide and Citi Financial charge 2 per cent of the loan amount or a flat Rs 600, whichever is higher.																								Some dealers may pass on a discount on the processing charge by foregoing some part of his margin. You may have to shop a bit for that finer rate. 																								Again, you will have to make a higher down-payment in the form of advance equated monthly instalments (EMIs). Normally, for a 12-month scheme, one has to pay four EMIs in advance and eight post-dated cheques.																								If you want financing for a longer tenure, then there may be some interest charges. So make sure to check the rate card and understand all the various options. Start with the number of EMIs, effective rate of interest, advance EMIs to be paid, and the processing charges.																								Moreover, dealers usually have a certain margin and give substantial discounts on cash purchases. But if you go for a financing scheme, then you may miss out on that discount. Again, you will have to do a bit of running around for that.																								It is always advisable to go to a large distributor as they have larger volumes and can give better discounts.																								Do banks give a better deal?																								Most banks, though not all, also offer loans specifically for buying consumer durables. If you do not have sufficient cash to pay for the 30 - 40 per cent of the price in the form of advance EMIs, then you can go to your banker and pay only 15 per cent as down payment. But the interest rates charged by the banks  at around 12-13 per cent  are much steeper than the finance companies.																								Moreover, they have got stringent eligibility norms and complicated documentation. Again many banks, like HDFC Bank and Allahabad Bank provide consumer loans only to the existing customers.																								What about a personal loan?																								Some banks offer personal loans, which can be used to purchase consumer durables. But if you are taking a loan to buy a durable, then opt for a consumer loan and not a personal loan.																								The reason is that the rates for a personal loan are much steeper and the eligibility criteria and documentation is also more complex as these do not require any collateral security. So, this is an option you can happily stop exploring.

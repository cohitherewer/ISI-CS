The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 ADB in exit mode at SBI Caps
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 17: Asian Development Bank (ADB) wants to sell its 13.84 per cent stake in SBI Capital Markets. The bank has already asked SBI Caps to rope in a foreign strategic partner. 																								State Bank of India holds 86.16 per cent in its merchant banking subsidiary.																								SBI Caps vice-president Sunil Srivastav said, We have no knowledge that ADB wants to exit SBI Caps. SBI is looking for a foreign joint venture partner. We have nothing to share right now.																								Indrajit Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Caps, was not available for comment.																								The move comes close on the heels of SBIs recent sale of a 37 per cent stake in SBI Funds Management to Societe Generale Asset Management for $35 million.																								At present, all leading domestic merchant bankers, except SBI Caps, have tie-ups with foreign investment bankers. The tie-ups have helped them corner the bulk of overseas business. Kotak Mahindra has tied up with Goldman Sachs, JM Financials has a joint venture with Morgan Stanley and DSP has a partnership with Merrill Lynch. 																								SBI Caps was not doing too well due to a downturn in the capital markets. However, it has recovered and last year, it witnessed a substantial increase in net profit and the trend is expected to continue in the current fiscal also. 																								Sources familiar with the development said ADB picked up the stake in SBI Caps under the condition that the investment bank would go public after some years of its operations. But SBI Caps is yet to come out with an IPO. However, company officials do not rule out an IPO. 																								SBI Caps, one of the oldest players in the countrys capital market, offers an entire range of investment banking services. With strong fund mobilisation strengths, it raises funds through capital market issues as well as through private placement.

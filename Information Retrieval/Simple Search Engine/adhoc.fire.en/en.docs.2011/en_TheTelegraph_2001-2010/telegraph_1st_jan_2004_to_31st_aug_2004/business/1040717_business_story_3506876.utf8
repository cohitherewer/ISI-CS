 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 16: The Board of Investment of Bangladesh has invited investments in all sectors from India.																								Board executive chairman Mahmudur Rahman said his team was not interested in trade-related talks, but wanted investment inflow from India in all sectors. He was speaking at a meet organised by the CII here today.																								Of the $432-million foreign investments in Bangladesh, a mere $5-6 million came from India. Major investments have come from Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand, he said.																								A 16-member Bangladesh delegation has been touring major cities like Mumbai and Bangalore to showcase investment opportunities in the country. The delegation met potential investors in these cities.																								We have put in place new policies that will facilitate a three-day clearance for any foreign direct investment, said Rahman. There are no restrictions on investments and there is a tax holiday for five to seven years.																								The Bangladesh apparel industry is ranked fourth worldwide, while India holds the 32nd position. We are interested in a collaborative effort in apparels with India. The finished goods can be exported from Bangladesh, he added.																								On gas reserves and policies related to the industry, Rahman said the country is not in a position to trade in gas as it is a politically sensitive issue.																								We are trying to generate employment by creating gas-based industries, he added.																								Recently, French company Lafarge has invested $255 million in a 1.2 million-tonne cement manufacturing unit in Bangladesh. Sun Pharma and Apollo Hospitals have also invested there. Nicco has set up a water park in Dhaka.

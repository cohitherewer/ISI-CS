 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 6: Vedanta Resources, the holding company of the Sterlite group, has purchased around 5 per cent stake in Sterlite Industries at Rs 1,477 per share.																								While Vedanta has bought around 18 lakh shares of Sterlite, the total acquisition price is valued at over Rs 264 crore. Market analysts said the purchase will come under the creeping acquisition route by which promoters are permitted to acquire up to 5 per cent of a companys equity capital.																								The share purchase will lead to Vedantas effective stake rising to 65.8 per cent from the existing 60 per cent in Sterlite. 																								The move is expected to boost the attributable earnings of the holding company. However, senior officials of Sterlite were not available for comments.																								Vedanta was recently in the news for its successful listing on the London Stock Exchange where it raised around $1 billion, the largest mop-up by an Indian entity in the overseas market through the equity route.																								The IPO proceeds are to be primarily used in funding the Bharat Aluminium Company (Balco) smelter expansion project and the Orissa alumina refinery project, both of which were expected to cost under $500 million apart from repaying debt.																								At the time of listing, Vedanta had said it intends to seek greater levels of economic interest in the groups underlying business. 																								While the groups effective interest in Sterlite was little under 61 per cent then, Sterlite also owned 51 per cent and 46 per cent in Balco and Hindustan Zinc, respectively.																								The group intends to simplify the ownership structure by increasing stakes in Balco and Hindustan Zinc. Additionally, it will seek to increase its ownership in Sterlite itself by further acquisition of shares through the creeping acquisition route, it said.																								Vedanta will fund the groups growth programmes through debt and equity investments in the Indian businesses, it added. 																								Recently, the board of directors of Sterlite decided to reward the companys shareholders through a 1:1 bonus issue. The bonus issue is to be followed by a rights issue that will be in the ratio of 3 new shares for every 10 existing shares of the expanded capital. 																								The company is proposing to raise at least Rs 1,400 crore. The rights issue was seen as a move to channel part of the IPO funds raised by Vedanta Resources into the companys expansion plans.																								At the time of listing, Vedanta had revealed that it would, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, own 55.2 per cent of the share capital of Sterlite and 80 per cent of that of Madras Aluminium Company (Malco). In addition Malco owns 7 per cent of Sterlites share capital, thus giving Vedanta an effective interest of 60.8 per cent in Sterlite.

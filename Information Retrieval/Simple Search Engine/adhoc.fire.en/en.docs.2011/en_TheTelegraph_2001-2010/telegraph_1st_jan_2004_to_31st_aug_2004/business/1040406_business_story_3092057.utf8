 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Subsidy leak in ONGC bottomline
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, April 5: The net profit of upstream oil giant ONGC is likely to plummet by over Rs 1,000 crore, for the financial year ended March 31, 2004 from the previous years level of Rs 10,529 crore.																								ONGC has taken a hit of over Rs 2,063 crore in its bottomline due to the subsidy burden on domestic cooking gas and kerosene that the government has asked it to shoulder as part of its national obligation.																								This has proved to be a major drain for the oil major. During the last financial year, this subsidy burden was borne entirely by the national downstream public sector oil companies  Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.																								A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph that the exact figures for the net profit are still being worked out. However, even the surge in crude oil prices during the last two months of the current fiscal and the better performance of its group companies, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, has not been able to cover up for this huge cash outgo.																								Sources say with the dollar depreciating by around 6 per cent over the year, the realisation in rupee terms for ONGC crude sales has not increased. The average price of crude oil between the two years is roughly the same at around $25 per barrel and the output has also stagnated at last years level. 																								On the positive side, MRPL is for the first time in recent years expected to make a profit of around Rs 300 crore of which ONGCs share works out to be around Rs 250 crore. OVL, which is emerging as a major success story, is likely to register a Rs 500 crore increase in net profit. These ONGC group companies have to some extent been able to cushion the subsidy blow for the national oil major.																								ONGC is also losing Rs 800 crore every year as it has to pay the subsidy on natural gas sold from the western offshore Panna-Mukta fields, the Tapti gas fields and the eastern offshore Ravva fields. Private companies such as Reliance, Videocon and BG that are partners in these fields get the market price for the sales of gas, while ONGC has to shell out the subsidy for the customers.

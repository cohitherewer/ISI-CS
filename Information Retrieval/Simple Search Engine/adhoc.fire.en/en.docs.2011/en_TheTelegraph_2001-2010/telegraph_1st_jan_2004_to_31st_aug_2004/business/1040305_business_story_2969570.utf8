 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Tarun Das gets new role in CII 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Das: Father figure																								New Delhi, March 4: Tarun Das is doing a Narayana Murthy. The CII director-general is making way for young blood and will take on the mantle of chief mentor of the apex industry association for the next three years. Das will be succeeded by N. Srinivasan, who is now the deputy director-general, from June 1.																								Omkar Goswami will step down as chief economist but his replacement has not been named.																								Omkars last working day is on March 31. But we will have a replacement very soon, said Srinivasan. With CII having six senior economists, the officials believe the competition in the runup to the prime post will be quite stiff.																								The official announcement about the change of guard at CII was made after a closed-door national council meeting attended among others by BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh.																								Srinivasan, an engineering alumini of Banaras Hindu University, has been serving CII since 1974 and in the past headed the confederations UK office and was a former executive director of the Automobile Components Manufacturers Association (Acma).																								CII stands for consumer focus, innovation and institutionalisation. The four pillars on which we work include policy focus, competitiveness, global networking and social development, he said.																								With Union ministers and the government busy with the election process, the industry association decided to postpone its annual general meeting from April to some point in early June, said CII president Anand Mahindra.

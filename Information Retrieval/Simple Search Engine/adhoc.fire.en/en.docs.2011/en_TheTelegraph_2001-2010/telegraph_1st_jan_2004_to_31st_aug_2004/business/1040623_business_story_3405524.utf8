 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Broadband rate cut signal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 22: Trai plans to cut the cost of domestic leased circuits by 75 per cent to bring down the cost of broadband and internet access.																								The telecom regulator believes that reduction in tariffs will also lead to higher growth as witnessed in mobile telephony and consequently much better capacity utilisation of networks and improvement in profits of service providers.																								The regulator has taken the cost of various operators into account in order to fix the cost of providing the domestic leased circuit. The revised ceiling tariff for capacities of 2 megabits per second (Mbps) and 64 kilobits per second (Kbps) for beyond 500 kms costs Rs 8.20 lakh and Rs 24,000, respectively. 																								The proposed revision in tariff in respect of 2 Mbps and 64 Kbps for beyond 500 kms would mean a reduction of about 63 per cent and 75 per cent, respectively, from the existing ceiling tariff in these categories, quot; the paper said.																								It is expected that higher capacities above 2 Mbps will dominate the demand structure in future.																								Trai says, Bandwidth being a crucial input for information technology (IT) and IT-enabled industries like BPO, reduction in the cost of bandwidth would go a long way in enhancing the competitiveness of these industries in the global market.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Common dossier to checkmate borrowers in dodging game 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 In the light of factsMumbai, May 5: The net was cast far and wide for loan dodgers today with the launch of Credit Information Bureau India Ltd (Cibil), a lender-promoted repository of facts and figures on delinquent borrowers.																								The bureau fulfils a long-felt need in the financial service fraternity to have a mechanism that tracks the payment record of credit takers  individuals or companies.																								Past behaviour is the best predictor of future responses, Cibil managing director Satish Mehta said at the launch. Financial institutions, banks and housing finance companies that account for 87 per cent of all lenders in business have signed up with the bureau. These entities gave away 90 per cent of all credit. 																								Cibil has already built up a fact-file on 5.5 million borrowers. From the perspective of a lender, India presents a challenge and an opportunity, in equal measure. There is the problem of rising non-performing assets (NPAs) among banks and financial institutions (FIs), Cibil chairman Santhanakrishnan said.																								The bureau has been promoted by State Bank of India and Housing Development Finance Corporation. Dun amp; Bradstreet Information Services India and Trans Union International Inc are technology and equity partners.																								The agency will help firms keen to cash in on the vast untapped market for loans in India  a country where the ratio of consumer credit to the total is only 3 per cent against 30-60 per cent in East Asia. Making the best of this opportunity without burning ones fingers is, admittedly, the dream of most Indian lenders.																								The commercial section of the bureau is expected to be launched in the second half of this financial year. This is the first time comprehensive credit information, covering both negative and positive data on borrowers, will be available to help lenders take informed, quick and objective credit decisions, Mehta said.																								Industry watchers say almost 6.5 lakh defaulters have already been tracked down and registered by the India Co-operation Committee of MasterCard credit card issuers. 																								The total spend on credit cards in India is around Rs 4,950 crore with a default rate of 8.75 per cent. In home finance, the default rate is 2 per cent. Santhanakrishnan reckons that this proportion would increase.																								David Emery, president of Dun amp; Bradstreet (Asia Pacific and Alliances International) said the firm has records of 150 million individuals in the US. In America, it is more important than a passport. Individuals build their credit history as data-bases have collated information of more than 10 years, he added. 																								Cibil will collate data from the current year, and will build on the information every month. This information will strengthen the diligence mechanism. In fact, it is the first level of the process, says Santhanakrishnan.

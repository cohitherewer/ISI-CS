 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Tea firms turn new leaf with Dubai auction plan
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Spreading the flavour																								Calcutta, March 23: Indian tea could soon be auctioned in Dubai if local producers are allowed to set up a trading platform in West Asias financial hotspot.																								A recent invitation to sell through Dubai Tea Trading Centre (DTTC)  developed by Dubai Metals and Commodities Centres (DMCC) and Dubai Ports Authority  has prompted tea majors here to consider setting up their own platform in that country, rather than accept the offer.																								If all goes to script, Dubai could be the next stop for growers used to Calcutta, Guwahati, Siliguri and Coimbatore, the traditional auction centres all these years.																								Tata Tea, George Williamson, Eveready Industries, Warren Tea, Goodricke, Dhunseri and Duncans have indicated that they will take the proposal to the Tea Board.																								The Tea Act of 1953 allows the board to set up an auction centre outside the country, either alone or in partnership with a body corporate based overseas. If the Tea Board clears the proposition, the Dubai auction centre will be Indias first such overseas venture.																								C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, told The Telegraph: Our members have decided to approach the board with a proposal to set up an auction centre in Dubai. The plan will be submitted in a couple of days. A separate auction centre in Dubai will be a shot in the arm for dwindling Indian tea exports, which are now pegged at 160 million kgs.																								Dubai is a vibrant financial centre and payment is guaranteed, said senior officials of the Calcutta Tea Traders Association. A separate auction centre will help the Indian tea industry contact buyers in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) directly and get a better price.																								Before the blueprint for a separate auction centre unfolded, a three-member team from Dubai, led by David Rutlegde, executive director of DMCC, Tariq bin Khalifa of Dubai Ports Authority and Sanjay Sethi of Sherwood, met the Tea Board chairman and producers with their proposal.																								DTTC will offer its members a range of commercial services to encourage firms to use Dubai as a regional distribution centre for tea, or run other value-adding businesses.																								DMCC is working on structuring the Dubai-authored tea initiative to meet the needs of the Indian tea industry. They have plans to return with a more detailed proposition, senior officials of the Tea Board said. 																								West Asia is emerging as a major importer of Indian tea. In 2003, India exported 42 million kgs of tea to the WANA region and earned a revenue of Rs 397 crore. The unit price realisation was to the tune of Rs 95 per kg. Of the 42 million kgs, about 25 million kgs went to Dubai.

 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 UK firm mulls Calcutta centre
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, June 3: Vertex, a UK-based BPO company, is eyeing Calcutta for its third centre in India. Vertex India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of British company United Utilities.																								We are evaluating various locations for our third centre. Calcutta is definitely on the priority list and we are studying various parameters like land cost, connectivity and infrastructure availability, said HR vice-president Sunil Kumar.																								Vertex provides services in customer care, content management and the mobile, retail and aviation sectors.																								At present, the company employs 1,150 people at its call centre in Gurgaon, where a second centre is expected to be operational by the year-end. 																								The new centre, which can house 750-800 people, will be spread over an area of one lakh sq ft.																								The third centre will have a capacity between 700 and 900 seats.																								We are on an expansion spree and plan to add 400 to 500 people to our present strength in five months. This could even go up to 1000 in case of acquisition of new clients, said Kumar.																								The company will be in Calcutta in the first week of June and plans to hire at least 100 people.																								Besides Delhi, we have been recruiting from Calcutta, Chandigarh and Lucknow, said Kumar. The main attributes that we look for in a candidate are communication skills, voice quality, attitude and problem-solving skills.																								Vertex has the reputation of putting in place a strategic growth plan for its employees, thereby curbing attrition.																								While the average attrition rate in the last two months was 43 per cent, we had a rate of 27 per cent, he said.																								Besides India and the UK, the company has operations in Canada and has recently acquired a US debt collection agency  First Revenue Assurance  to expand into the North American market.

 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Pressure to bring down oil duties mount
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Aiyar: In control																								New Delhi, May 27: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has sent a detailed letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the current oil price situation, highlighting the plight of public sector firms in keeping the prices of petrol and diesel on hold despite soaring international crude rates.																								Sources said the minister himself dictated the letter after brainstorming sessions with senior ministry officials. He has apprised the Prime Minister of the high excise duties and other levies which account for more than 50 per cent of the price of these transport fuels.																								Aiyar has conveyed to Singh that if the government wanted to avoid the politically unpalatable decision of a sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products, then the taxes on these would have to be scaled down. This is considered as the only solution for the oil firms which are facing deep financial trouble as they have been asked not to pass on the high crude price to consumers.																								Petroleum ministry officials feel that apprising the Prime Minister at the very outset is a wise decision as otherwise the matter could have hit a brickwall in the finance ministry. They have cited past experiences with the finance ministry, which has used the petroleum sector as a cash cow to raise resources in order to keep the fiscal deficit in check.																								Sources said the government has kept the decision on raising the prices of diesel and petrol on hold as it is awaiting the outcome of the Opec meeting on June 3. Saudi Arabia, which has the largest reserves of oil in the 11-member organisation, has already indicated that it is in favour of raising production levels to bring crude prices down to more realistic levels.																								The pressure from western countries, especially the US, which is going to the polls later this year, is another factor to be weighed by the Opec cartel.																								If prices come down following the Opec meeting, the governments task will be made easier as the oil companies will get a breather. The government is under pressure from the Left parties to keep prices on hold and increase subsidy on kerosene and cooking gas.

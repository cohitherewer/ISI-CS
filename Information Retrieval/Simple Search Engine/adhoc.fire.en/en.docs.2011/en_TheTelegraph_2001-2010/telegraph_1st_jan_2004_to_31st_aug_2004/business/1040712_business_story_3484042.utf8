 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Banks may help sell old-age savings plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Over the counter																								Mumbai, July 11: The Union Budget for 2004-05 proposes to expand the distribution channels for savings products. The department of posts, however, appears unfazed as it feels it will retain the monopoly over monthly income schemes, touted as the most popular savings plan among urban investors.																								The government probably has the proposed savings scheme for senior citizens in mind that offers an assured return of 9 per cent, a senior official from the department of posts said. Banks, including those in the co-operative sector, may be used to distribute the savings product created specially for senior citizens.																								We checked with our superiors in Delhi, and they are as clueless as we are, the source added.																								The postal department derives almost 60 per cent of its income from selling small savings products like Kisan Vikas Patra and monthly income schemes (MIS). It gets a service commission for raising finances, which are distributed to the central and state governments.																								The recent Finance Bill has an innocuous clause 106 that seeks to amend the Government Savings Banks Act, 1873. The act contains certain provisions relating to government savings banks. It is proposed to enable certain banks, companies or institutions, as the central government may, by notification in the official gazette, specify on its behalf to accept deposits under certain schemes of the central government, besides the post offices, the Finance Bill states.																								The banks cannot distribute postal MIS, the source said. The rate of interest for MIS is pegged at 8 per cent for the six-year scheme, with a 10 per cent maturity bonus that accrues after six years. Thus an investor in MIS would get an effective yield of over 9.3 per cent if the investment is held for six years. If banks start distributing this, they would see erosion of their own deposits in the bank schemes, the official said.																								The official said when private couriers were allowed for the first time, many Cassandras had predicted that the department would not survive. It has been proved wrong. No bank has the reach and scale of distribution as ours and we are sure that the government would protect our interests, he said.

 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Chidambaram fails to read the tea leaves
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, July 8: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has disappointed the tea industry.																								Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had made a representation to the United Progressive Alliance for coming up with measures to revive the tea industry  one of the traditional industries of the state.																								Bengal is one of the leading tea-producing states, with Calcutta housing the headquarters of all the big tea companies.																								The tea industry expected that the CPM-supported UPA government will come up with some relief measures for the sector which is reeling under crisis for the last four years.																								The budget has disappointed the tea industry. We expected that there will be some good news for us in the budget. The finance minister did not respond to our aspirations. We will take up the matter with the Union commerce minister on July 19, Indian Tea Association chairman C. K. Dhanuka said.																								The industry had demanded that the current additional excise duty (AED) of Re 1 per kg should be abolished. It was introduced in the Union Budget 2003-04 and was adding to the cost of production. Already, the spiralling cost of production is eating into the revenues of the tea companies.																								The industry pointed out that the budget for 2004-05 did not speak a word about disbursal of money from the fund created by way of collection of AED whose corpus now stands at Rs 60 crore, approximately.																								The industry had asked to deploy the funds in AED for increasing the orthodox production, generic promotion of tea and for export promotion.																								Tea Association of India president Suresh Bansal said, Very little has been done for the tea industry. Only customs duty of 5 per cent has been extended to certain items of plantation machinery. It was already present on certain imported machinery. We will take up the matter with the central government.																								For the coffee industry too, Chidambaram has reduced the customs duty on imported machinery to 5 per cent. This is a welcome move, said senior officials of the coffee industry.																								The officials of ITA said the reduction in customs duty on certain machinery will help in improving and upgrading the quality of tea and in value-addition.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 15: Amkette, better known as the diskette company, plans to set up a design and development centre in Calcutta for its imaging solution products.																								The last few months have witnessed a growth in the eastern region for IT products as compared to other regions, said Rajiv K. Bapna chief executive officer of the company. Calcutta contributes to 17 per cent of Amkettes overall sales and we aim to increase this to 21 per cent.																								The company will take a decision on the development centre next month. It is planning to invest Rs 3 crore for this, excluding land and infrastructure costs. The unit will design and develop products which will give customers an alternative to costlier OEM (original equipment manufacturer) consumable items like ink cartridges at half the price.																								Amkette already has a manufacturing and development facility in Udaipur in Rajasthan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Collision alert on petroleum haul
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, July 6: The stage has been set for a fresh battle between the railway and petroleum ministries. 																								The railways failed to provide the refineries in the Northeast with adequate tank wagons to evacuate their products, but still went on to complain to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against the oil companies which want to switch over to the pipeline route and leave the tank wagons idle.																								Railway Board member (finance ) Vijayalaxmi Vishwanathan told The Telegraph that the railways had the capacity to carry 32 million tonnes of petroleum products and this should be fully utilised before the oil companies are allowed to go in for any more pipelines. This is being taken up at the Prime Ministers level, she added. 																								Interestingly, the contention of the railways is that national resources have been invested in acquiring the tank wagons and these should not be wasted. However, when it comes to providing tank wagons to the northeast refineries, the railways have failed to meet the requirements, forcing these refineries to function at less than full capacity. 																								The movement of petro products has been one of the highest revenue earners in the past. But with the oil firms increasingly switching over to pipelines as the more modern and efficient mode of transport, the railways have been rapidly losing this traffic. Clearly, the ministry is making a last-ditch effort to stem this slide. 																								However, while the railways are keen to carry oil traffic on the routes in the north and west, they are not as enthusiastic about traffic in the Northeast as it entails a longer turnaround time for wagons. Senior railway officials, however, have been hesitant to meet petroleum ministry officials on the issue and the problem has persisted.																								Sources said that Bharat Petroleum chairman S. Behuria had met the railway board chairman recently to plead the NRL case but did not meet with much success. The railways had taken the stand that they do not have sufficient infrastructure to supply the 70-odd rakes (trains) that NRL needs every month and is providing the refinery with only 40-45 rakes. 																								This, however, has a cascading effect down the line and the refinery has to be slowed down since the products are not being transfered in time and the company faces storage problems. Since the refinery is not running at full capacity, the profitability of the company is hit. 																								While NRL has a capacity of 3 million tonnes, it is likely to process only around 2 million tonnes of crude at the current rate of production. While the government had diverted crude oil from the Ravva oilfields to augment supplies for the Assam refineries, the railways appear to have nullified the advantage. This has forced even NRL to look at the pipeline route as the only solution in the long run and Oil India Ltd has agreed to finance the project. Clearly, the railways are set to lose even this traffic in future.

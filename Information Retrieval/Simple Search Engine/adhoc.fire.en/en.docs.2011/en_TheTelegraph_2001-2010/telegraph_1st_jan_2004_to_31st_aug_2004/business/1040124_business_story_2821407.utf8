																								Calcutta, Jan. 23: Tata Motors plans to launch upgraded versions of Indigo and Tata Sumo. This is in line with the re-launch of Indica with new features.
																								Tata Motors vice-president Rajiv Dube said the company always makes an effort to offer more car per car through a makeover process.
																								We cannot give an exact timeframe for the facelift in Indigo and Sumo, he said.
																								Both Indigo and Sumo are selling well despite their competitive segments. Sumo is still the second largest brand after Qualis in the multi-utility vehicle segment in the domestic market, Dube said.
																								Asked whether Indigo will get a similar facelift as Indica as both are manufactured in the same platform, Dube said Indigo has a distinct feature which is meant for a different segment altogether. Therefore, the current makeover in Indica will not be seen in the Indigo, he added.
																								Dube said Indica has recorded considerable growth with its inroads in the European market in general and in the UK in particular.
																								In the UK, the company is exporting Indica in collaboration with MG Rover. The car is being sold under the City Rover brand. The company is looking for similar tie-ups in other major European markets for exporting Indica and other vehicles from its stable, he said.
																								The company is also looking for a joint venture partner in China. The company is currently in talks with prospective partners there as Indica has generated a lot of interest.
																								Dube said the passenger vehicle division of the company has posted a strong growth of 42 per cent in the first nine months of the current financial year with cumulative sales of 97,219 vehicles from all segments.
																								We are hopeful of achieving a growth of at least 25 per cent in the sales of the passenger vehicle segment by the end of the current fiscal, he said.
																								Regarding the companys plan of introducing a car at Rs 1 lakh, Dube said a lot of out of box thinking is required to concretise the plan. At least three to five years will be needed to come up with a concrete strategy for this small car, he added.

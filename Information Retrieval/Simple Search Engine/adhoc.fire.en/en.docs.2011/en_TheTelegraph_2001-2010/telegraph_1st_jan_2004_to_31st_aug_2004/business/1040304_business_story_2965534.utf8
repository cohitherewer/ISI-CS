 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 New savings hope for the self-employed
 ANIEK PAUL AND CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 				 	 Reason to smile																								Calcutta, March 3: The ministry of finance is considering a proposal to introduce a floating rate small savings scheme for people with modest incomes and a small investible surplus.																								The beauty of the product is it would be as liquid as a savings bank account but would pay a much higher interest rate, according to sources in the ministry familiar with the proposed deposit scheme.																								It will be an open-ended scheme, meaning therell be no fixed maturity, and you can take out or deposit money in it as and when you want, said a finance ministry official.																								There would be a cap, however, on the maximum amount that one could invest in the scheme. A minimum deposit, too, is likely to be specified.																								The target audience for the product appears to be self-employed people looking to save a small amount regularly through liquid assets. If launched, this will be the first liquid savings vehicle in the small savings bouquet. 																								At present, one could have a savings account with the post office, but that hardly serves as a vehicle for systematic savings  it pays a mere 3.5 per cent.																								The proposed scheme would be reserved for people with a small income. Only people whose income is less than a certain specified level would be allowed to invest in the scheme, said the finance ministry source.																								The government will offer a flexible interest rate on the deposit scheme, which will be benchmarked against traded securities like the 10-year government bond.																								The interest rate (on the scheme) would certainly be higher than the current yield on government papers (which is around 5.3 per cent), he added. Indications are it could carry an interest rate of 7 per cent in the beginning.																								The design of the product was finalised in a meeting of senior finance ministry officials held in late January, and it could be launched in the next budget at the earliest. But finances are a constraint and the government might have to abandon the product, cautioned ministry officials.																								Its not clear yet whether the government would go ahead with the floating rate deposit scheme that was tabled in a meeting in late January. The key constraint certainly is pressure on spending, said the source.																								Like all small savings schemes, the scheme might have to be fully subsidised by the Centre. State governments are unwilling to share the cost of deposits mobilised through small savings schemes though they get a lions share of these funds. Some states are known to have defaulted in repaying the principal, and many have started refusing the small savings funds offered by the Centre.																								The Centre, on the other hand, wants to cut costs and there is a proposal to align interest rate on small savings schemes with benchmark securities like the 10-year government bond, and might even decide to discontinue some of the high-yielding schemes.																								But the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has already announced that it would launch, if voted back to power, Dada-Dadi bonds  a product for senior citizens with an attractive interest rate like the Varishtha Bima Yojana. The proposed bond would be a further drag on the Centres finances.

 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Log-in for online tax payments
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 31: The income-tax department is introducing on-line accounting for tax payments collected by Reserve Bank and 31 commercial banks from Tuesday. 																								A finance ministry statement issued today said the procedure for tax payment has been simplified, reducing the number challans to three from seven at present. Taxpayers will fill a simplified single-copy tax challan at banks, instead of the four copies furnished now. 																								The new challan has a main copy and a counterfoil. The bank will stamp the main copy as well as the counterfoil, which will be returned to the tax-payer. Banks will feed data from the main copy and send it, online, to the departments national computer hub in the capital and regional centres spread across the country.																								Taxpayers will have to mention the challan identification number on their returns; no copy will be enclosed. The department said this will effectively dematerialise challans.

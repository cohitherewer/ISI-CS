 FARID HOSSAIN				 	 Tata: Big plans																								Dhaka, Aug. 22: Bangladesh is considering with an open mind a $2-billion investment proposal from the Tata Group  the single-largest offer of the kind made to the country.																								A five-member committee, headed by industries minister Matiur Rahman Nizami, discussed the proposal today but detailed talks could not take place because of a death in the family of one of the members. It will meet again on September 1.																								The Tatas plan a 1000-mw power plant, a 4.2-lakh ton-capacity basic steel facility and a fertiliser factory with an annual production capacity of 10 lakh tons. A company team told Bangladeshi officials last week that the plants will also make a good use of Bangladeshs natural gas. We have an open mind on the issue. All the pros and cons of the offer will be discussed, state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmood said.																								The proposal was formally made to Bangladeshi officials last week. That was a follow-up of the offer, submitted by the Tatas to the Bangladesh government on June 29.																								Bangladesh has opposed export of its natural gas to India, but said foreign companies interested in establishing gas-based industries here are welcome. We are considering the investment proposal seriously and examining all aspects, said state minister for energy A. K. M. Mosharaff Hossain. 																								He said the Tatas want uninterrupted gas supply for at least 20 years. We do not see any problem if other conditions are fulfiled.																								While the power plant and the steel mills are planned for the countrys western region, the fertiliser factory has been proposed for Southeastern Chittagong. Tata group chief Ratan Tata is expected to visit Bangladesh to sign the deal if Bangladesh approves the proposal.

 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Support price of kharif crops raised
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: As part of its pro-farmer policy, the United Progressive Alliance government today increased the minimum support price (MSP) of all kharif crops. While the prices of paddy and coarse cereals such as jawar and bajra were raised by Rs 10 per quintal, the groundnut price was increased by Rs 100 per quintal.																								The decision to increase the prices of the kharif crops was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The increase is designed to give the farmers a better return as crop yields are likely to be lower due to the delayed monsoon. 																								Briefing reporters after the meeting, finance minister P. Chidambaram said the MSP for groundnut has been increased by Rs 100 a quintal to Rs 1,500 a quintal and that of yellow soybean by Rs 70 to Rs 1,000 a quintal. The MSP of black soybean has also been raised to Rs 900 a quintal from Rs 840 a quintal.																								Sunflower seed support price has been hiked to Rs 1,340 a quintal from Rs 1,250 per quintal. Sesamum MSP has been raised by Rs 15 to Rs 1,500 a quintal. The MSP of gnigerseed has been increased by Rs 25 to Rs 1,180 per quintal.																								In other decisions, the CCEA permitted ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) to give 3 per cent of its stake in two Sudan oil blocks to Sudapet, the countrys national oil company.																								The committee allowed OVL to give a 2 per cent stake in block 5A and 1 per cent in block 5B to Sudapet, sources said.																								Currently, OVL has a 26.125 per cent stake in block 5A and 24.5 per cent in 5B.

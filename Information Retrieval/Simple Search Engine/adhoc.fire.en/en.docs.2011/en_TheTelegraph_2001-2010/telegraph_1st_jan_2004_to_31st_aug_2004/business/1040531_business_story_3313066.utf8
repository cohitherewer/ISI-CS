 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Panipat picked for naphtha facility
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, May 30: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has chosen Panipat for its proposed 0.8-million-tonne naphtha cracker.																								IOC was earlier looking at Gujarat for setting up the cracker, which involves an estimated outlay of Rs 6,300 crore. The naphtha cracker is part of a Rs 15,000-crore petrochemical blueprint drafted by the company. Senior officials said the board has decided in favour of Panipat in a recent meeting. In March, the IOC board had taken an in-principle decision to set up the cracker and a polymer unit after preparing feasibility reports.																								IOC plans to double the capacity of its existing six-million-tonne refinery at Panipat to 12 million tonnes. IOC officials said in addition to the cracker, the company is also in the process of setting up a paraxylene (PX) and purified terephthalic acid (PTA) plant at Panipat for Rs 4,500 crore. 																								Panipat will have a sophisticated petrochemical complex. Moreover, the capacity that we are talking about is also huge. For instance, the PTA capacity is itself at 5.53 lakh tonnes which is the largest in the country, sources added.																								The expansion of the Panipat refinery is scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2005, while the PTA/PX unit by August 2005. However, a timeframe has not yet been fixed for the naphtha cracker.																								Apart from IOC, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is also planning a venture in this sector, indicating tough competition ahead for petrochemicals giant Reliance Industries Ltd.

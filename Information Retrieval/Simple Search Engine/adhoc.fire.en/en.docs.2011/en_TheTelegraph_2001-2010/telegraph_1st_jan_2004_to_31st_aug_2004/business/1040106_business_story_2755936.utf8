 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Crude bank, LNG price on cabinet menu
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Oil drill																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Union cabinet is likely to clear on Tuesday the ambitious plan to create a strategic crude oil reserve facility for the country. 																								The ticklish issue of raising the price of natural gas, which has already been cleared by the group of ministers (GoM), has also been listed on the agenda for the cabinet meeting. 																								The petroleum ministry feels that since huge funds are required for the strategic crude reserves project, it should be taken up in phases.																								The first phase of the project envisages the creation of a reserve facility of 5 million tonnes that can last the country 15 days in case of an emergency. The experience gained in managing this 15-day stock can then be used to gradually increase the capacity to a 45-day cover.																								While a sum of Rs 1,500 crore will be required to set up the underground tankage, another Rs 5,000 crore or so will be required to buy 5 million tonnes of crude at a little over $26 per barrel. Besides, an expenditure of Rs 30 crore will have to be incurred as operating costs each year.																								The GoM had earlier recommended an increase of Rs 350 per thousand cubic metres (MCM) in the price of natural gas from Rs 2,850 per MCM to Rs 3,200. The gas is consumed mainly by power and fertiliser units and is supplied from the ONGC and OIL fields through the Gail network. The increase falls far short of the over Rs 4,000-per-MCM price that ONGC had sought. 																								Since elections were around the corner at the time, the GoM had decided to continue the regulation in gas prices as the interests of the vital power and fertiliser sectors have to be kept in mind. It now remains to be seen whether the proposal is cleared tomorrow. 																								The GoM has also recommended that deductions from the gas pool account will be made only for the subsidy that is being paid to the north-eastern states or up to a maximum level of Rs 100 crore, which ever is lower. This sum, however, is considered adequate to take care of the entire subsidy of the Northeast states. 																								This means that the payments being made by ONGC through the gas pool account to subsidise private companies that buy gas from the joint venture fields at market prices will be stopped.																								Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will be entrusted with the task of setting up the tankage and managing the strategic reserve facility. The new strategic oil tankage will come up at Vizag on the east coast and Mangalore in the south and situated well beyond the striking range of Pakistani warplanes. 																								Rajkot in Gujarat, which the petroleum ministry had also identified as a location for storing strategic crude oil, has been dropped as it is considered too close to the Pakistani border. 																								Two options have been proposed for financing the plan. The first envisages that the capital investment will be made through a one-time budgetary grant by the government and the operating expenses be met through the cess that is already being levied on crude oil. 																								The second option proposes that the funds required for capital investment and carrying cost of the inventory be raised through an across-the-board cess on petroleum products on the lines of the road cess being levied on the national highway project. The amount of this cess works out to around 10 paise per litre if it is levied on all the products or 20 paise per litre if it is imposed only on petrol and diesel.

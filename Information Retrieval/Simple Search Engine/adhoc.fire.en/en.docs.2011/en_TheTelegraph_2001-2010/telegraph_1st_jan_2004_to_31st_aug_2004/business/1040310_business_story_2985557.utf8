The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 L amp;T plans to ramp up sales
																								New Delhi, March 9 (PTI): Larsen amp; Toubro is set to hike its topline growth to Rs 20,000 crore and said it will soon come up with a new business plan to ensure a 20 per cent annual sales growth by 2009.																								The new business plan would be ready by September this year and would target Rs 20,000 crore by 2009, said A. M. Naik, L amp;T chairman and managing director.																								All divisions have been asked to frame their individual growth strategies to be merged with the comprehensive business plan and they would start working on their plans from early next month itself, he said.																								The divisions should earn at least 30 per cent of their sales from overseas operations and contribute a minimum of Rs 500 crore or 5 per cent sales revenue towards the overall turnover by 2009, he said.																								In addition, all the divisions should ensure a minimum of 20 per cent growth for their topline and bottomline.																								The idea behind the new plan is that each entity should have a sustainable existence in a competitive world, he said.																								The company is confident to end the current fiscal with a sales turnover close to that of the last fiscal, despite the demerger of its cement division. It hopes to cross the magical Rs 10,000-crore turnover mark by March 2005.																								L amp;T aims at generating Rs 3,000 crore towards total sales turnover from its global operations by 2006 and cross the Rs 5,000-crore global sales mark by 2009.																								L amp;T aims at a 20 per cent compounded topline growth for the next five years, while the bottomline should commensurate with the growth in sales turnover. 																								Speaking on the strategy to fill up the sales gap created by the demerger of cement division, Naik said, We will take care of this issue in the business plan.																								In order to generate over Rs 2,200 crore sales turnover that the demerged division used to contribute, L amp;T has started laying special thrust on its hydro and nuclear power wing, under engineering and construction contracts division.																								The strategic business unit for hydro and nuclear power should contribute at least Rs 1,500 crore by 2005, Naik said.																								Regarding the construction majors overseas acquisition plans, he said the company is looking at acquiring an engineering and technology company in the US. The acquisition would materialise hopefully in the next six months, he said.

 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 FM sees high tide in investment
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Chidambaram at a press meet in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, June 3: Finance minister P. Chidambaram wrapped up his two-day visit to the countrys commercial capital by sending out two messages. The governments commitment to the reform process apart, he projected a rush of investments over the next 10 months and thereafter.																								The purpose of my meetings was to convey a direct message that the government remains committed to reforms. We will do everything in our path to advance them, the finance minister told newspersons after his day-long meetings with the Reserve Bank governor, foreign institutional investors and leading industrialists.																								Chidambaram, who sees himself as the countrys investment minister, also wanted to share a very happy development. The prolonged period of investment drought is over, he announced. Initially, the power sector will be a major attraction. Gradually investments in other sectors will look up, he said. 																								Bankers have told me that in the last 10 weeks, they have been able to achieve financial closure of six power projects totalling 3700 MW of capacity. There are 10 more power projects in the pipeline where the capacity is 6867 MW, Chidambaram said.																								He reiterated that the government was committed to maintaining fiscal prudence and financial discipline. He added that his meetings have dispelled any questions about the common minimum programme which may have appeared ambiguous to some interlocutors. 																								My impression is that everybody is satisfied that the CMP will take the reform process forward and make the economy stronger, he added.																								The minister said the budget would be presented in the first week of July and he hoped that Parliament will clear it by the first week of August. However, the exact date will be decided by the minister of parliamentary affairs in consultation with the Speaker.																								Today, Chidambaram played host to the RBI governor, foreign institutional investors, chiefs of UTI, LIC and UTI and captains of the industry.																								The finance minister could not meet representatives from the mutual funds industry, but promised to meet them next week in the capital.

 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 Toyota targets maiden profit in March
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Top gear																								New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Indian subsidiary of Japans Toyota Motor Corp is expected to post profits this fiscal for the first time since inception, helped by record sales of its models, a company official said.																								Toyota Kirloskar Motors, a joint venture between Toyota and the local Kirloskar group, was established in August 1997 with a paid-up capital of Rs 700 crore and have since invested around an additional Rs 500 crore. 																								This includes around Rs 360 crore invested in component maker Toyota Kirloskar Auto Parts for the supply of transmission units to Toyotas global subsidiaries. 																								Sales have been good and we will break even on our investments this fiscal, said the official. 																								He said the auto-maker would gradually scale up its production capacity by around 15-25 per cent over a period to meet the growing demands.																								The Toyota Kirloskar plant, located on the outskirts of Bangalore, currently manufactures the Qualis utility-vehicle and the Corolla mid-size cars. It imports the luxury Camry sedans as a fully-built unit.																								Company officials said the auto-maker grew on an average 20 to 30 per cent in the past eight to nine months. In the full-year, it expects to sell around 37,000 units of Qualis, 10,000 Corolla units, and another 1,000 units of Camry. 																								Toyotas main competitors in the utility-vehicle segment are Mahindra and Mahindra, which controls about 47 per cent of the market, and Tata Motors, which controls another 23 per cent.																								In the first nine-month (April to December) period, we have earned revenues of Rs 1,760 crore and expect this to touch Rs 2,700 crore by the end of March, he said.																								The Indian car market has been on an upward growth curve ever since the government cut production tax or excise duty by 8 per cent to 24, which has put it in the league of one the fastest growing markets in the Asian region.																								Last month, the government lowered duty on all non-farm imports, by 5 per cent, which allowed some auto makers  Honda Motors and Maruti Udyog  to lower the sticker price on some of their models.

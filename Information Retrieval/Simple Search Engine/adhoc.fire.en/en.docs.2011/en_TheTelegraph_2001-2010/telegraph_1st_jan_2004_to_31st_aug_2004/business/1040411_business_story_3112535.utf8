 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From left) IUF vice-president Teresa Mackay with global co-ordinator Sue Longley and Meena Patel of the IUF South Asia office in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, April 10: IUF, an international trade union, today accused the tea-producing statesBengal, Assam and Kerala  of not implementing the three-month-old Supreme Court ruling (on a public interest litigation) that ensured the right to food and work for nearly 70,000 workers in the closed and abandoned tea gardens.																								The trade union has urged the three states to take legal action against the promoters of these closed gardens.																								Nearly 21 gardens are closed in Bengal, nine in Assam and 14 in Kerala. Another 14 gardens belonging to the Assam Tea Corporation are facing financial crisis and are on the verge of closure. 																								IUF global coordinator Sue Longley said: We have visited the closed tea gardens in Assam and Bengal. In these two states many gardens workers have gone without (full) wages, rations, water, electricity and proper medical services for the past two years.																								IUF  International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers Association  has 346 registered trade unions within its fold across 121 countries.																								Longley said the union would report the condition of the tea workers in India to the IUF executive committee, which will meet in Geneva later this month. The report would then be sent to the International Labour Organisation, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the tea packing companies in the European Union.																								The IUF delegation had an informal discussion with the members of the Indian Tea Association on the plight of the workers. They will provide us with relevant information, Longley added.																								However, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and labour minister Mohammad Amin refused to meet the delegation.																								IUF vice-president Teresa Mackay said, The delegation was horrified that the three-month-old Supreme Court verdict had not been implemented.																								Teresa said the IUFs recommendations to the International Labour Organisation will include a call for the owners and companies of abandoned plantations to fulfil their legal obligations, including payment of arrears of wages and provident fund.																								They should immediately repay the stolen PF money (deducted from the workers wages), she added.																								The IUF members also urged the state governments to take on board the Supreme Court ruling and pay Rs 500 per month to the workers of the abandoned tea gardens.

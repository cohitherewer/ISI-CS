 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Long overdue, say brokers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 7: Brokers today welcomed the long overdue move to introduce margin trading on bourses but felt that the 50 per cent initial margin specified by the board is on the higher side. 																								My sense is that it (margin trading) will be well received in the stockmarkets, said Ramesh Damani, a prominent BSE broker. Margin trading is basically a system to fund an investor who lacks the resources to cough up the entire amount. 																								Former BSE president Deena Mehta was more circumspect. At least, they have now recognised that there is a need for margin trading, she said. Mehta during her tenure had lobbied for the introduction of margin trading.																								Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services said, The introduction of margin trading would be a fillip for retail investors. Smaller brokers will now be able to arrange funds for their clients and my sense is that it will help them to survive. However, brokers feel that the initial margins which has been pegged at 50 per cent is on the higher side. The unofficial market has pegged margins at 30-36 per cent of the value of the purchases, they said. 																								But they expect the market regulator to review this once the system is in place. The 50 per cent is just to wet the feet and it will be relaxed over a period of time, they feel.																								Big brokers like Kotak Securities and SSKI already fund their clients. Sebis announcement today will help them legitimize the whole procedure. Many brokerages have been doing this unofficially, sources say. As a result they could not charge interest but mopped up the dues under heads like commission. Now, they can officially charge interest from those clients borrowing money to fund their purchases.

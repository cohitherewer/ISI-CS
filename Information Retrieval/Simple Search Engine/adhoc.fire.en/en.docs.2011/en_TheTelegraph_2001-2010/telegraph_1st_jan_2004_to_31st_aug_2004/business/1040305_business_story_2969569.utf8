 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 ECL draft revival plan in place
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 4: The loss-making Eastern Coalfields (ECL) has finalised a draft revival scheme which will be submitted to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).																								ECL, saddled with Rs 3,000 crore of accumulated losses, was referred to the BIFR for the first time in 1997. It came out of BIFR in 1998 and was referred to the board again in 1999 as its losses mounted. According to the proposal, Coal India will waive Rs 519 crore of unsecured loans and has recommended the conversion of the remaining loan amount of Rs 1,532 crore into equity.																								The package will hit Coal Indias exchequer by over Rs 2,051 crore, said the official, adding that the package is politically motivated.																								The company has also proposed to invest in the mechanisation of underground mines to increase production.																								ECL chairman-cum-managing director A. Kalam said the enormous coal reserves available in the command area of the company will help it bounce back in the black.

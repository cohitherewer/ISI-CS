 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Cry for cheap steel loans
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 7: The Indian Steel Alliance (ISA), a pressure group of flat steel producers, today sought cheaper finance for capacity expansion, even as it highlighted the need for a reasonable rate of return on investments if a production target of 66 million tonnes is to be achieved by 2011.																								Some of the industry stalwarts, including Jamshed J. Irani of Tata Steel, Prashant Ruia of Essar Steel, Sajjan Jindal of Jindal Vijaynagar Steel Ltd and Vinod Mittal of Ispat Industries, shared a common platform on the occasion of the unveiling of ISAs advertising campaign to highlight the importance of steel in daily life.																								ISA chairman Irani said while the capacity of the industry stands at over 35 million tonnes at present, increasing it by 25 million tonnes to achieve the 60 million-tonne target would require investments worth Rs 75,000 crore. 																								However, the steel producers should get a reasonable rate of return for such an investment, he said. Though the cost of finance have come down, the interest rates prevailing in India is still higher compared with other countries, Irani added.																								The flat steel producers, who recently received flak from the user industry for frequently raising the prices, said the government should continue its thrust on infrastructure reforms like construction of airports, roads, bridges and houses to boost steel consumption. 																								The association also sought assured availability of raw materials such as coke at reasonable prices. ISA president Moosa Raza said the recent increase in steel prices was due to rising input costs. Even as the current prices are realistic, Raza averred that domestic users are not at a disadvantage as the prices of hot-rolled steel are in line with international prices.																								In 2003-04, while exports were up by 2 per cent, domestic sales grew by 10 per cent, Raza said in response to the criticism that enough quantities of steel are not available to the domestic industry and steel producers have been exporting the commodity at the cost of local users.																								The ISA has called for resumption of the DEPB scheme to enable domestic steel exporters to compete in the global markets. They have also asked the government to maintain the current import duty at 15 per cent and the excise duty at 8 per cent.

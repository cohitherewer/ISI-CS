The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Bata slips deeper into red
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 31: Several rounds of restructuring could not keep shoe-major Bata India from getting sucked deeper into the red. The company has suffered a net loss of Rs 26.05 crore in 2003  much higher than the Rs 7.4-crore loss suffered in 2002.																								The company has decided to reduce the workforce by 1,500 to cut fixed cost and increase overall profitability. The company employs 12,000 people all over India.																								Net sales have improved marginally by 2.5 per cent to Rs 711.40 crore in 2003 against Rs 694.19 crore in 2002. The interest burden of the company has also gone down marginally to Rs 7.6 crore against Rs 8.3 crore in the previous year. The company will focus on manpower rationalisation to bring down the impact of fixed costs like remuneration on overall profitability. It has launched a voluntary retirement scheme to reduce the workforce by 1,500 at an estimated total cost (including benefits) of Rs 37.7 crore.																								State Bank of India, the lead banker of the company, has agreed to finance the manpower optimisation programme with a pay-back period of 1.7 years.																								The company is also in talks with the unions to introduce variable pay structure in the stores to keep the remuneration cost on a par with business.																								Bata, which is a 51 per cent subsidiary of Canada-based Bata Shoe Organisation, has also reached an agreement with unions regarding a ceiling on dearness allowance.																								Long term agreements (LTAs) signed in 2003 with the unions of shop employees and factories located at Bataganj, Mokamehghat and Southcan  and in 2004  with the union of shop managers  are expected to provide flexibility in terms of operations and cost structure.																								We are relentlessly working on cost reduction/optimisation initiatives to reduce the incidence of fixed costs, said director (finance) P. K. Nag. The results of 2003 have been better than 2002. However, one-time additional accruals for long-term agreements, catch-up charges on account of unfounded pension and write-off of deferred tax assets have affected profitability.																								However, a silver lining is retail business, which has increased by 106 per cent. Following the restructuring of its retail operations, which focuses on customer profile and various other initiatives by the company in 2003, the retail business is expected to bounce back.																								The companys emphasis on stock turnover and maintenance of stock levels at 73 per cent has helped reduce the level of working capital, which is getting blocked in merchandise. Bata India feels that its decision to clean up its wholesale business by building relationships with creditworthy buyers and converting three of its wholesale depots to cash--carry on a trial basis is expected to yield results in the coming years.

It abandoned the mineral water business in India last year as also its dessert mixes which came under the brand, Milkmaid. 																								Milo is not one of our top performing brands and it needs to go through a process of review for performance, said Carlo Donati, chairman and managing director of Nestle India. 																								Refusing to divulge whether the brand will be re-launched, Donati said, The brand needs to go through a scrutiny, and after that the company will decide if it needs to apply any new strategy for the product.

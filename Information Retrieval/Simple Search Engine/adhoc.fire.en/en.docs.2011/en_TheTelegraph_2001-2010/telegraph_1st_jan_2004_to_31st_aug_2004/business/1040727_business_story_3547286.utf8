 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Free flow																								New Delhi, July 26: Public sector oil companies are now free to raise or lower the prices of petrol and diesel within a 10 per cent price band every fortnight. 																								As a result, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum will be allowed to revise prices of the two fuels by up to 50 paise a litre without consulting the government. 																								The companies could raise prices as early as August 1. They have been clamouring for another round of increases on the basis of the argument that international prices of petrol and diesel are ruling above the domestic ones.																								The new pricing policy cleared by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) aims at shielding the consumers from major fluctuations in prices. At the same time, it allows the oil companies to make some changes in the domestic prices of petrol and diesel to bring them in line with international trends. The formula also provides for a reduction in excise duties when prices of petroleum products shoot up.																								However, the political fallout of allowing the oil companies to increase the prices of diesel and petrol for the second time after the UPA government took over cannot be wished away.																								For instance, the government did not allow the oil companies to pass on to their consumers the 2 per cent cess on excise duty introduced in the budget. There is strong opposition to increasing the prices of petrogoods from the alliance partners of the UPA and the Left parties, which the government cannot ignore.																								The Left parties have cautioned the oil companies against the misuse of limited freedom given to them. Such freedom cannot be exercised to continuously shift the burden of any increase in international oil prices to the consumers, they said.																								The Left parties have asked the Centre to review the duty structure for petro-goods. They added that the prices of petroleum products in the country were unusually high due to steep import and excise duties.																								With the failure of the monsoon, the demand for diesel has gone up for irrigation purposes. This is a political issue that the government will have to keep in mind before the oil firms can exercise their liberty.																								Under the new formula, the oil companies will work out the average prices of petrol and diesel during the last three months and also the averages over the past year.																								The mean of these two estimates will form the base price for each fuel. A 10 per cent rise over the base price of petrol and diesel has been fixed as the maximum limit to which the oil firms can raise prices when international rates go up.																								The new formula provides for calculating the base price over a much wider time span so that any sudden spurt in international prices in the short term is not passed on to consumers.																								The formula also provides for a reduction in excise duties of the fuels by the finance ministry if the prices of petrol and diesel jump above the ceiling.																								Similarly, if the international prices of the two fuels fall below the floor price determined by the 10 per cent band, the petroleum ministry is expected to inform the finance ministry so that the excise duty levels can be raised to ensure that a fixed revenue accrues to the government.																								The policy of feeding far-flung areas with petro-products at the same price as the nearest supply points will continue.

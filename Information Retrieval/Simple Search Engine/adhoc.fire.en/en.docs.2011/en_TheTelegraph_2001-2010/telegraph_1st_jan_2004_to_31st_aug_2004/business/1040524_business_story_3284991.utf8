		 Monday, May 24, 2004  Q amp;A				 Gifts galore
																																																																																													Is there any limit for gift in cash to nearest relatives? Is it necessary that the gift should be confirmed through subsequent affidavit? If yes, is there any time limit for the execution of affidavit?																																																																													. . Majumdar, Calcutta
																																																																																													There is no limit for gift in cash to nearest relatives. A declaration has to be made by the donor and it should be accepted by the donee and has to be submitted while filing returns.																																					Seniority benefits																																																																																															I am a senior citizen of 65 years of age. I have incurred some long-term capital gains from the sale of company shares purchased three years back. The total income tax payable by me, including the capital gains tax is, however, less than Rs 20,000. As per section 88B, senior citizens are eligible for a rebate of Rs 20,000. Am I entitled to claim exemption from paying income tax?																																																																													Biswanath Ghosh 
																																																																																													The tax rebate of Rs 20,000 is available on the total tax payable and since your tax liability is less than the rebate amount, you are not required to pay any income tax.																																					Commission claim																																																																																															I am an insurance adviser. My company deducts TDS at the rate of 10 per cent but I have heard that it is 5 per cent if commission exceeds Rs 20,000 in a year. Is it true?																																																																													Pankaj Kumar Singh
																																																																																													The rate of tax deduction at source on insurance commission is 10 per cent but an exemption up to Rs 5,000 can be claimed.																																					Loan transfers																																																																																															I have taken a personal loan of Rs 1,00,000 from a nationalised bank to apply for my companys initial public offering. But for some reason, my application cheque bounced. Now can I use the loan amount for purchasing 6.5 per cent tax-free RBI bonds? 																																																																													Gautam Nath, Calcutta
																																																																																													You should be able to purchase the RBI bonds but since there is change in the end use of the loan, you will have to inform the bank and take due permission.

 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Call for less telecom entry hurdles
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 27: The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is likely to advise the member states on need for harmonisation of spectrum, reducing the entry barriers for operators and transparent interconnection agreements.																								A regional working group on private sector issues of ITU has suggested that the spectrum allocated should be in contiguous bands, further quantum of spectrum should be indicated upfront with a clean road map for its actual assignment to allow for efficient design and planning of network. It has also recommended the use of ITU band plans for frequency allocation as this would encourage standard economies of scale.																								On the issue of cost of duties and levies, it observed that in developing countries the high cost of duties and levies were ultimately passed down to the consumers in the form of higher tariffs. This adversely impacts the ultimate objective of teledensity.

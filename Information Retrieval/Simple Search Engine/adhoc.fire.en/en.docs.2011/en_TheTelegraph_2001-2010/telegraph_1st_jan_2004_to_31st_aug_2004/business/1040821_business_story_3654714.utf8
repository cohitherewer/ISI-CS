 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Steel firms get duty stick, not sop shock
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Free flow																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: Hectic lobbying by steel makers has seen their worst nightmare  a cutback in the export incentives  being stalled for the time being.																								However, the increase in prices beyond global rates has forced the government to scrap the import duty on defective steel and on ships broken for scrap to 5 per cent.																								The two measures will hit long-steel producers and discourage further price increases by them. However, flat-steel makers will not be affected much.																								A gap between global landed and domestic prices and rising iron-ore rates means steel companies can raise prices again if they want to, and get away with it.																								Steel prices are $740 a tonne in the US and around $630 a tonne in Europe. In rupee terms, this would be Rs 28,000-32,000. 																								If customs duties and other costs are taken into account, the landed cost of imported steel here works out to about Rs 34,000-36,000 a tonne. This gives steelmakers the window of opportunity for a rise.																								However, they are unlikely to do so at the present juncture, as this would force the government to do what they have been fearing and what was recommended by the steel ministry  take away export incentives.																								Flat-steel makers claim they suffer from excess capacity to the tune of nearly four million tonnes, though this figure is hotly contested by steel-user forums. If they do not get export incentives, they will be forced to dump this huge quantity in the domestic market, thus depressing the prices.																								Steelmakers like Tata Steel, SAIL, Essar, Ispat and Jindals say the rise is justified as price of raw materials have gone up by multiples of 100 per cent in a year. The Indian Steel Alliance, a group of all big producers, argues that the cost of coke has gone up 300 per cent, iron-pellets 200 per cent and sea freight by another 300 per cent.																								But steel users complain that against an increase of 30-35 per cent globally, the rise in comparable prices in India stood at over 100 per cent over the last year-and-a-half.

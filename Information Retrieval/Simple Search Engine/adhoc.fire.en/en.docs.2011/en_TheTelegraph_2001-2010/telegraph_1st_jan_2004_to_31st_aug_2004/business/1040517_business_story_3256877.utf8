The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 SMS is just a coin away
 															- Calling card: Some root for cash, others spruce up services A STAFF REPORTER Bringing together 																								Calcutta, May 16: AirTel has unveiled a prototype of a public messaging system, similar to a coin-operated public telephone, that will enable users to send SMS and e-mails to any mobile phone or mail ID. 																								The messaging system had been introduced in Bangalore a few months back and is now being tested in Calcutta, said Deepak Gulati, CEO of Bharti Cellular. A report will be prepared based on the feedback from users at public forums and the necessary changes will be made before full-scale implementation.																								The SMS kiosk is very similar to a coin-operated phone, but instead of a phone dialpad, it has a keypad similar to a typewriter. The user has to drop a Re 1 coin in the slot and type the SMS or e-mail. The coin will drop into the machine after the message is sent across. On sending a message, the customer will receive a delivery report confirming the delivery of the message.																								In case of an undelivered message, the one rupee coin will be refunded to the user. The customer can also wait and receive a reply SMS from the mobile number to whom the message has been sent. The company is working out a strategy to charge domestic, national and international messages separately.																								Presently, the cost of SMS is Re 1, Rs 2 and Rs 5 for local, national and international destinations respectively.																								Gulati said that the kiosk will enable non-mobile phones users to experience instant messaging services. AirTel is yet to decide on a brand name for the product.																								AirTel plans to launch the product countrywide within the next couple of months.

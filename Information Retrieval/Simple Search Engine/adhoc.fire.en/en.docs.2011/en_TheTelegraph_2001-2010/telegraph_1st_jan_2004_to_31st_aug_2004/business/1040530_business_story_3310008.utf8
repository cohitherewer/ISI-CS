 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Residuary firms feel the heat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 29: The RBI working group has recommended a cap on net-owned funds of residuary non-banking companies (RNBCs) for mobilising public deposits. 																								To ease the burden on RNBCs, the cap on public deposits may be fixed at 16 times of net-owned funds as an initial measure. However, they will have to subsequently conform to the norms applicable to NBFCs for raising public deposits. 																								The time of such a transition should preferably be not more than five years. The RBI has been asked to fix suitable caps for RNBCs exposures to the capital market, real estate, unlisted but rated securities and units of equity-oriented mutual funds. 																								On RNBCs changing over to the business structure of NBFCs, the group said, At present, there are eight categories of NBFCs. Four of them are insurance, housing finance, nidhis and chit-funds carrying asset profiles different from the asset profile of RNBCs. Conversion of RNBCs to these four categories may not be appropriate. 																								In the other four categories, equipment leasing, hire purchase, loan and investment company, RNBCs may convert their asset profile to these categories.

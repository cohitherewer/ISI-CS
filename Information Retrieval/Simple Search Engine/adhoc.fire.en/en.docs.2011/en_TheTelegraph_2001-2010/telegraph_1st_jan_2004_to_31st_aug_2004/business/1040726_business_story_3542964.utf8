 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 National Jute Corp on arrear-clearance list
 S. P. S. PANNU Stretched all the way 																								New Delhi, July 25: The department of public enterprises has asked the finance ministry to sanction funds to pay the statutory liabilities of provident fund and insurance for the workers of sick public sector companies. The proposal is expected to go through as the central government has given the green signal for the move.																								Payments due to the employees of the National Jute Manufacturers Corporation (NJMC) Ltd are included in the list. The matter has assumed further importance with the Left parties pursuing the issue as part of the common minimum programme of the UPA government.																								The losses of NJMC have risen to Rs 3,973 crore against the paid-up capital of Rs 55.79 crore. The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) is reported to have issued an order on July 8 for winding up the company as its networth has turned negative to the tune of Rs 3,917 crore, eroding its paid-up capital several times over.																								NJMC is a sick public sector company, which was referred to the BIFR in 1992. The company has been incurring persistent losses from the time it was nationalised in 1980.																								Interestingly, while the NDA government had been concentrating on pushing through with the sale of high-profit-making public sector enterprises such as the oil companies, little attention was paid to the chronic loss-making ones that cause a major drain on the exchequer.																								All the units of NJMC have now ceased production, some as recently as six months back. The company has not been able to generate enough funds to meet its requirement of salary, wages, and essential maintenance expenses. Payments for salary and wages are being met by the company through non-plan assistance from the Centre. 																								During the current financial year, Rs 24.71 crore has already been released to the company to pay the salary and wages and meet essential administrative expenses.																								NJMC is in such a financial mess that it has not even been able to pay pension benefits to its employees on time. The central government had released Rs 28.71 crore in 2002-03 to enable it to pay the outstanding gratuity dues of retired employees. However, they seem to be left in the lurch as far as pension benefits are concerned.

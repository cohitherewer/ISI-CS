 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Sebi yet to finish crash probe
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 26: Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman G.N. Bajpai said here today that the investigation into the historic crash on the stock markets on May 17  when the sensex tanked over 500 points  will take some more time to be completed.																								Millions of investors were hurt when the benchmark 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index crashed 11 per cent to 4,505 points on May 17, the biggest ever intra-day fall, causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,00,000 crore.																								We will submit a report once the probe is completed. It is still on, said Bajpai.																								Analysts said the selloff by offshore investors which weighed heavily on stocks as well as the currency market, was due to margin-selling coupled with the uncertainity of economic reforms. 																								After pumping in $4.3 billion in the first four months of 2004, foreign funds have sold a net $840 million worth of Indian assets in May on fears of the reforms pace.																								Investment bankers and research houses cut Indian stocks rating to market weight from overweight saying investors should wait to see the policy pursued by the new Congress-led government.																								The new government, however, moved quickly to reassure investors that it was committed to economic reform and investor-friendly policies.																								Early this month, finance minister P. Chidambaram met senior executives of the corporate sector, Sebi officials and foreign investors to defend the governments policy blueprint called the common minimum programme (CMP).																								We would answer all lingering doubts on the governments commitment to reforms, said Chidambaram. Privatisation would be considered on a transparent and consultative basis where loss-making state-run firms would be sold off or wounded up.																								On profit making state-run firms which includes banks, Life Insurance Corporation, General Insurance Corporation, the finance minister had said that they would be allowed to raise capital from the market and would not be divested.

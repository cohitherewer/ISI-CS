 S. P. S PANNU				 Stepping on the gas 																								New Delhi, Feb. 15: With the first consignment of Petronets liquefied natural gas (LNG) landing at Dahej this month, the downstream oil companies will have to brace up to dispose of more naphtha in the export market at cheaper prices.																								The 2.5-million tonne LNG being imported is targeted at existing naphtha-users who will switch to the cheaper natural gas instead. Senior oil industry executives expect another 2 million tonnes of naphtha to be rendered surplus in the domestic market.																								The downstream national oil companies will have to take a collective knock of around Rs 200 crore on their bottomlines as the export price of naphtha is at least Rs 1,000 per tonne lower than the domestic prices.																								Both natural gas and naphtha are largely consumed by power plants, fertiliser and petrochemical units and sponge-iron plants. The two commodities are perfect substitutes for these industries.																								The imported LNG will be regassified at Dahej and sold at a cheaper price than naphtha. Some of the consumers of naphtha will then switch over to the gas.																								The oil companies have no short-term solution but to export the naphtha at a price that is anywhere between Rs 1000 to Rs 1200 per tonne lower than the domestic price.																								Roughly 11 million tonnes of naphtha are produced from the crude processed by Indian refineries in a year of which around 3 million tonnes is surplus and has to be exported. This figure will now go up to around 5 million tonnes.																								While Reliance Industries uses its naphtha in its downstream petrochemicals business, other oil companies have to sell most of it in the open market.																								Exports of around $224 million of naphtha have taken place in the first five months of the current financial year compared with $270 million in the year-ago period. However, the picture is likely to be reversed with the LNG beginning to flow in from Dahej.																								In the long run, the only way out of the dilemma is for the oil companies to move up the value chain by going in for petrochemical plants that will use naphtha as an input. 																								Indian Oil Corporation has already started work on a Rs 5,000-crore petrochemical project at its Panipat refinery complex.																								However, the project is scheduled to be completed only in the first quarter of 2005-06. Till then it will have to contend with the excess naphtha. Similarly, Bharat Petroleum also has plans of going into the petrochemicals business but this will take at least two to three years.																								The Dahej terminal will initially import 2.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum which will then be stepped up to 5 million tonnes. This amounts to about 20 million cubic metres of gas per day (MMSCD).																								The current supply of natural gas in the country is around 65 MMSCD, while the unfulfilled demand for the gas is 120 MMSCD. The government has allocated this gas on paper but does not have the supplies.																								However, this demand is based on the existing domestic price of the gas which is being supplied at $2.5 per million British thermal units (BTU). The cost of LNG is much higher and works out to over $4 per million BTU as the gas has to be first compressed into liquid form and then imported on board cryogenic ships entailing a huge investment.																								The gas has to be regassified at the special terminal after it is unloaded which further adds to the cost. The price, therefore, has been worked out to compete with naphtha that is a more expensive fuel.

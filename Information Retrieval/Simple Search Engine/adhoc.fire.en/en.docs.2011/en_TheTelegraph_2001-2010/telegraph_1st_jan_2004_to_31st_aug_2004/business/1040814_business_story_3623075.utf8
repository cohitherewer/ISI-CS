 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Bengal contests Ficci claim
 							 - Apex chamber says industrial disputes are rising in the state OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra (left) with eastern region council chairman C. K. Dhanuka in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 13: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said industrial disputes are on the rise in Bengal, even as it outlined the opportunities in the state.																								Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said the number of industrial dispute cases has risen to 205 in 2003 from 177 in 2000. Bengal contributes 55 per cent of total mandays lost in the country, he added.																								But the Bengal government contradicted the statistics put forward by Ficci. West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation managing director Gopal Krishna said, The statistics must have taken into consideration the closed industries in the state. Bengal includes closed industries while compiling the industrial dispute cases. Some states strike out the names after four or five years and therefore, their statistics do not show a surge in industrial disputes.																								Bengal has already brought about some labour reforms in its SEZ policy. We know a lot has to be done. However, the new industries in the state have no labour problems. We agree that labour problems still exist in traditional industries like tea and jute. We are trying to sort it out, Krishna added.																								Ficci today put forward a six-point agenda for Bengal.																								Mitra said Bengal should become the transport corridor for the vast hinterland. He suggested that converting Bengal into a transport corridor stretching from Punjab to Rajasthan in the north to Madhya Pradesh in central India to Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Tibet and the entire northeast region.																								Ficci put forward the proposal before the Bengal government to develop an international financial architecture in Calcutta. The government should make efforts to attract FDI in the financial sector to make Calcutta a financial hub for a globalised economy, Mitra said.																								The state government should concentrate on developing horticulture, floriculture and marine food export zones in Bengal, Ficci said.																								Bengal should be developed as a centre of excellence for education. The state has premier institutions like IIT, Kharagpur, IIM, ISI and National Law School. Seats in these institutions should be offered to students from Southeast Asia, China and West Asia, Mitra added.																								The state should place a greater emphasis on the development of knowledge-based industries, especially bio-technology, bio-informatics, drug development and other research and development.																								Finally, Bengal should try to develop itself as a destination to attract high-value international tourists.

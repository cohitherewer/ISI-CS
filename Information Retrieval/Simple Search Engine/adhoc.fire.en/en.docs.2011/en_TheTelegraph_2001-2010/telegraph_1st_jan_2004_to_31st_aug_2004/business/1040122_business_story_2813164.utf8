 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Yogesh Samat in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Jan. 21: Barista Coffee Company may follow the Starbucks model of buying out coffee chains to become the second largest chain after Starbucks in the next 10 years.																								Talking to The Telegraph, chief executive officer Yogesh Samat said, We are open to the option of acquiring coffee chains. Anything that makes business sense is acceptable to us.																								Starbucks too had been buying out coffee chains all over the world to become the largest player in coffee retailing business.																								The companys gameplan of growth also envisages opting for franchisee route. We receive at least 50-60 queries almost everyday, said Samat.																								The company is also in talks with Tata Tetley for selling its premium tea through Barista outlets. The talks with Tetley are at an initial stage. We have plans to convert our coffee parlours to cafes by providing a gamut of other products  tea being one of them.																								Tatas already have an interest in Barista and marketing Tetleys tea is a logical business proposition. Tata Coffee holds 34 per cent in Barista, Turner Morrison holds another 60 per cent and the remaining 6 per cent is held by the employees of the company. Fifty-one per cent of Tata Coffee is held by Tata Tea. We already have a relationship with the tea major, said Samat.																								He, however, refused to indicate whether there will be a change in the shareholding pattern in the coming months. The board will decide on this matter, he said.																								Barista plans to enter the Kuwait market in the next four to five months. It already has a franchisee tie-up with ETA-Ascom, a $3 billion company, for marketing Barista Coffee in West Asia. The company has already expanded its operations in Dubai with four stores. In Sri Lanka, the company has tied up with Jewelex Trading. Barista operates through three stores in Sri Lanka.

 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, March 20: Archies Ltd, the greeting cards and gifts maker, is set to open 50 new company-owned outlets over the next two years, aiming to convert the cards and gift shop chain into a retailing major. 																								In the next two years or so, we will be opening 50 new outlets across the country, mostly in the new malls that are springing up everywhere. We have started our bookings and each of these approximately 1000-square-feet outlets will cost about Rs 25 lakh each for the company, said Pramod Arora, executive director, Archies Limited. 																								With the retail sector booming, Archies wants to ensure its place under the sun. We are in talks with a lot of brands to sell their products through our outlets. Already we are doing this for Cadburys and some jewellery brands, said Arora.																								Archies, which had once ventured and then abandoned the music recording business, is planning to stock branded CDs, CD-ROMs, and music cassettes but feels that only a multitude of brands within a segment and not a single brand will give it mileage.

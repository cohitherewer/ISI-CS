 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 3: The Indian Tea Association (ITA) has opposed the Bengal governments recommendation for mandatory sale of 100 per cent tea through auctions.																								The tea committee set up by the state government under the chairmanship of commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen has recently made the recommendations public.																								The ITA has consistently opposed any mandatory stipulation regarding tea sales through auctions and has maintained that individual producers should be free to decide the mode of selling to derive maximum value.																								ITA chairman C. K. Dhanuka said this stipulation could choke private marketing initiatives pursued by individual companies to establish their own sales channels through which they derive significant value for their products.																								While commodity prices in the auction system are determined through demand and supply, effective marketing can have a significant impact on the net price line.																								Private marketing initiatives include tea branding and retailing directly to consumers, branding for retailers and giving monopoly rights of sale to agents at different consuming centres.																								All these initiatives have become attractive as they help avert auction costs of about Rs 3 per kg.																								The ITA is, therefore, completely opposed to any recommendation regarding stipulation of a specific percentage to be routed through the auction system, Dhanuka said.																								ITA has, however, welcomed the general tenor of the committees recommendations. 																								The ITA has particularly welcomed the suggestion of spreading the incidence of salami (lease rental) in case of lease renewals of tea gardens on transfer, in installments over 30 years with a moratorium on payment for the first two years.

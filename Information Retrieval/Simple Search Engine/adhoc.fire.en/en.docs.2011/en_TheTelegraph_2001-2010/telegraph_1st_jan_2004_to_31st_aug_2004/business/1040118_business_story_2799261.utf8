 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Kotaks equity fund mops up Rs 350 cr
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 17: Diversified  equity scheme, Kotak Global India has mopped up around Rs  350 crore in its initial public offering that closed on  Friday.																								Kotak Mutual Fund, which manages close to Rs 5,000 crore in assets, proposes to invest 65-95 per cent of the schemes corpus in shares of globally competitive Indian companies. The rest would be invested in bonds.																								It clearly shows that people are excited with the equity market. Not one equity scheme has done so well since the technology boom of 2000 when people had invested in a lot tech funds, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research Online, a mutual fund analyst.																								Over the last three years, retail money has been flowing entirely into debt funds. Of late, monthly income plans  or MIPs  that invest 15-25 per cent of their corpus in shares have gained popularity. HDFC Mutual Fund mopped up around Rs 950 crore in the recent initial public offering of its MIP.																								Some industry observers said the success of Kotak Globals IPO was due to intelligent marketing. Kotak rode piggyback on Goldman Sachs BRIC report that sees India emerging as the third largest economy after China and the US in less than 30 years.																								Rushabh Seth, head of equity funds at Kotak Mutual Fund, said the scheme would be investing in a wide range of sectors including automobile, auto ancillaries, pharmaceuticals, IT services, engineering and infrastructure. We are eyeing (shares of) 30-35 globally competitive, high-growth companies, he said.																								Minimum investment in the IPO was Rs 5,000. There was an entry load of 2 per cent for investments below Rs 2 crore. Theres no exit load. Continuous offer would start on February 13. The open-ended scheme offers both growth and dividend plans.

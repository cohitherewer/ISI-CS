 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 MGM plans special payout 
 JAMES BATES 																								Los Angeles, March 16: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc (MGM) is mulling paying out as much as $2.1 billion to shareholders in a special dividend. 																								Sources said the company was considering giving stockholders $6 to $9 a share. The bulk of the money would go to billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who controls the Los Angeles studio with 74 per cent of its 235 million shares outstanding. 																								Executives at MGM, which has eliminated its debt while significantly boosting the cash it is generating, made it clear last year the company would share its riches with stockholders if it failed in its bid to buy Vivendi Universals US entertainment assets. MGM eventually lost out to General Electric Co and its NBC unit. 																								Theyve been very verbal about sharing the wealth with their shareholders, said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with investment firm Harris Nesbitt Gerard. 																								At the time, however, MGM executives hinted that some kind of tender offer to acquire MGM shares was more likely than a straight payout. 																								MGM chief executive Alex Yemenidjian confirmed that the company was considering the one-time distribution, but said no final decision had been made.

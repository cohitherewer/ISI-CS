 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 BPCL refinery ramp-up in last lap
 S. P. S. PANNU																								Mumbai, July 28: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is racing ahead to complete the Rs 2,259-crore expansion-cum-modernisation project of its Mumbai refinery in early January so that it can boost its profits in the current fiscal. The capacity of the refinery will go up to 12 million tonnes from 8.7 million tonnes at present. 																								BPCL is at a disadvantage compared with Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum as it has a much smaller refining capacity.																								With refining margins ruling as high as $4.5 per barrel, the profit from this division is much higher than the marketing segment as oil companies have to sell LPG and kerosene at subsidised rates and are also not being allowed to raise the prices of petrol and diesel to international levels.																								BPCL chairman S. Behuria told The Telegraph that with crude prices continuing to rule at much higher levels than last year, the LPG and kerosene subsidy burden had also increased and it would be difficult for the company to maintain last years profit levels.																								With an additional capacity of over 3 million tonnes going on stream in the last quarter, the company will be able to partially offset the lower returns from LPG and kerosene sales. 																								BPCL director (refineries) Mukesh Rohtagi said the new hydrocracker unit is being set up with state-of-art technology from US global major Chevron and will be able to process a wide range of crude. This will also enable the company to get a higher yield of petrol, diesel and jet fuel from the same barrel of crude, which, in turn, will have a positive impact on profits.																								A Rs 315-crore lubricants manufacturing facility is also being integrated with the hydrocracker and will be completed in 2006. This will plug another chink in the BPCL armour as it currently has to either import lubricant base oils or buy them from Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum.

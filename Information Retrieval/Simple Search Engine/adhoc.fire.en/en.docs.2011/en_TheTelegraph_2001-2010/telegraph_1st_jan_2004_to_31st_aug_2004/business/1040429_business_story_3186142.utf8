 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Assam Company to run three ONGC oilfields
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 ONGC chief Subir Raha in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, April 28: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has outsourced the operations of three of its marginal oilfields in Assam, near the Galeki field, to Assam Company Ltd (ACL), a member of the Duncan Macneill Group. 																								Three other marginal fields in Gujarat have been outsourced to Prize Petroleum, which has been promoted by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.																								The service contracts for the fields were signed here today. The six fields are expected to reach a total cumulative production of 9 million barrels and a peak production of 1.5 million barrels per annum.																								ONGC had discovered these fields 20 to 30 years ago. Now, it expects to monetise these assets through smaller companies which can operate with lower overhead costs. The emergence of new technologies and high crude prices has helped to make these fields commercially viable. The fields will be developed as clusters to cut costs.																								Assam Company senior vice-president Ashok Jajodia told The Telegraph that the initial in-place oil reserves at the three fields  Laxmijan, Bihubar, and Barsilla  was around 44 million barrels of which 20 to 25 per cent was recoverable. Depending on the crude price, this oil would be worth $200-260 million. The fields also have initial gas reserves of around 46 billion cubic feet of which 60 per cent would be recoverable.																								Jajodia said Assam Company has drawn up a budget of Rs 30 crore for the development of these fields. But this could be increased or scaled down depending on the amount of oil that can be produced. He said the company was optimistic that on detail testing and reassessment, the reserves would go up substantially.																								In collaboration with Canaro Resources Ltd of Canada, Assam Company is already operating in Assam and is carrying out exploration in the AA-ON 7 block. It has completed new seismic surveys and plans to drill additional wells in the block. The two companies have also secured approvals to develop the 53-sq km Anguri field in Assam.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 RBI steps up price vigil
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Reddy: Close watch																								Mumbai, Aug. 11: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Y. V. Reddy today said that central bank is monitoring inflation trends and would respond in a measured manner to maintain price stability over the year.																								We at the central bank are monitoring developments. In particular, we are analysing how the oil-import shock is being felt globally and absorbed domestically, Reddy told reporters who asked him how he would respond to the spurt in inflation to 7.50 per cent.																								The governors reassurance reversed surging government security yields, which fell from 6.73 per cent early in the day to 6.61 per cent on bonds maturing in 10 years.																								Reddys comments today echo his remarks on Sunday, when he told reporters in Pune that the rise in commodity prices had come as a surprise. He blamed global crude prices, which have scaled new highs, the liquidity overhang and delayed monsoon in some areas. The cost of oil shot past $45-mark on Tuesday. 																								The rising inflation, along with hardening interest rates in the West, has led to many to believe that the cost of money at home would also go up. These fears have fuelled the rise in yields on government bonds above 6.50 per cent.

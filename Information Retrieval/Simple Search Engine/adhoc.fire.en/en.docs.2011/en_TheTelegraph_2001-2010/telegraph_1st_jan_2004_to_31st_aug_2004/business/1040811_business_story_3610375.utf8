 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 New cell on cards to hear telecom complaints 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: Individual users may no longer have to approach the telecom regulator for redressal of their grievances through a consumer forum but can directly approach an ombudsman, who could be appointed soon by the government.																								At present, there is no system in place in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to redress individual consumer complaints (which are to be addressed by consumer courts) or disputes between service providers and group of consumers, which are to be addressed by the telecom disputes settlement appellate tribunal (TDSAT).																								The telecom regulator receives complaints from the general public pertaining to the problems of individuals as well as those of a generic nature.																								The Trai Act does not explicitly fix the responsibility to redress consumer grievances on the regulator. The act, however, provides that Trai shall lay down standards of the quality of service to be provided by service providers, ensure the quality and conduct periodical survey to protect the interest of the consumers.																								It is, therefore, evident that there is a need to establish an internal mechanism like in other sectors such as insurance and banking, to deal with individual consumer grievances. One way of doing this is through establishment of an office of ombudsman for the telecom sector, said a senior Trai official.																								The regulator today recommended to the government the establishment of an office of ombudsman in the telecom sector.																								The authority also noted that the telecom service providers were not in favour of funding an ombudsman for the telecom sector. 																								Trai feels that the best recourse for establishing an ombudsman would be to make an amendment in the licence for which the licensor has full power and authority.

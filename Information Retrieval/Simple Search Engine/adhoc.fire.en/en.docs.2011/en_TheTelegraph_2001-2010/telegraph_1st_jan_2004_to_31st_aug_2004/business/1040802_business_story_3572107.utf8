 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 FDI pockets to open up for apparel firms
 VIVEK NAIR				 	 the best fit																								Mumbai, Aug. 1: The apparel industry will attract foreign direct investment (FDI) after textile quotas end from January.																								Analysts expect hectic activity in the sector in the next six to nine months with many overseas buyers either investing in domestic ventures or setting up dedicated units in association with local players.																								Skilled manpower, abundant availability of raw materials for cotton and man-made fibres and a well-integrated textile industry have lured foreign investors.																								The domestic apparel sector has also matured over the past few years, drawing lessons from the supply glut that began in the late 90s, analysts added.																								The units are now more focused and competitive. They have invested large amounts in machinery to scale up operations. At present, some of the apparel units employ more than 5,000 people compared with less than 500 earlier.																								According to sources, more than 10 firms are in various stages of negotiation between overseas buyers and domestic players. Some of these involve talks about equity participation.																								Some of the worlds leading brands, which are looking beyond mere sourcing, have expressed initial interest to cash in on the potential of India in a quota-free regime, sources added. Some of the well-known retail chains that are already using India as a major outsourcing destination will also look at such a possibility, albeit at a later date, they added. 																								Such movements have come at a time when European readymade garment maker Carrera will reportedly invest more than $100 million in India.																								Carrera is understood to have roped in a former textile secretary to jointly head its Indian operations. Raghav Gupta, associate director at KSA Technopak  management consultants with a long association with this sector  believes that Indian apparel firms will see anFDI burst in the next few months.																								The next six to nine months can see apparel buyers and suppliers setting up dedicated factories with buyers in some cases even putting up equity, he said. 																								The domestic textile industry is not new to foreign investors, Gupta added. More than a decade back, the US-based garment maker Kelwood tried to invest in this sector, without much success. Since then, FDI has eluded this sector.

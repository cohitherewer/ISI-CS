 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Sensex hits a ton in celebration
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			Mumbai, Feb. 9: Happy tidings about the health of the economy sent the markets on a bull-run today. The announcement of a GDP growth forecast of 8.1 per cent for 2003-04 kickstarted a rally that saw the sensex rising 140 points to close at 5926.22. 																								Shares of major pivotals recovered smartly to power the bull rally, said Dhiraj Sachdev of ASK Raymond James. 																								Although the action was centred around index heavyweights, the midcaps have still not retraced the old highs, brokers say.																								The sensex opened at 5810.21, rose to an intra-day high of 5935.68 before closing at 5926.22, a gain of 139.87 points against Fridays close of 5786.35.																								There was an across-the- board rise, dealers said. In the specified group, 179, including 28 index-based counters, registered sharp to moderate gains.																								Among the gainers were Reliance, which shot up by Rs 14.75 to Rs 589.10 and Tisco, which rose by Rs 9.50 to Rs 423.20. Satyam gained Rs 9.15 to close at Rs 328.50.

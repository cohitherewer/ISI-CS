 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Bid to recharge power
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: Union power minister P. M. Sayeed today asked the lenders in the power sector to be in constant touch with the borrowers and to improve their services in line with market conditions to offer the best deal to the borrowers.																								The minister also asked the lenders to identify the borrowers as business partners and involve them in furthering their business.																								Inaugurating the first private sector borrowers meet organised by Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Sayeed said, Lenders and borrowers need to understand each other. In todays business environment, it is unquestionably important for the lenders to constantly remain in touch with borrowers. They need to fine tune their services in line with changing market conditions.																								The minister also said the creation of generation capacity has not kept pace with the rising demand. 																								The country, therefore, faces a substantial power shortage. The average power shortage is about 7 per cent and peaking shortage is about 11 per cent.																								The installed generation capacity has to be doubled to over 200,000 megawatt (MW) in the next eight years, which will entail an investment of over Rs 4,00,000 crore. The country will need matching investment in transmission and distribution.																								Sayeed said, While public sector investment are being increased, such ambitious targets cannot be met without substantial private participation. The acid test for bankability of a project is its commercial viability. A low-tariff project will have no problems with either the sale of power or a payment by utilities. This is what we should aim at.																								The power ministry has already set up a green channel to facilitate quick clearances and financial closure of projects. 																								About eight projects with a capacity to generate 3,000 MW of power have been cleared by the ministry and another eight project to generate about 9,000 MW at an estimated cost of Rs 50,000 crore will soon be approved, the minister said.																								We are in constant touch with petroleum, coal, environment, natural gas to resolve the problems that are hindering the growth of private power projects. We are yet to come across any major hurdle in the meetings, which is regularly done, Sayeed said.

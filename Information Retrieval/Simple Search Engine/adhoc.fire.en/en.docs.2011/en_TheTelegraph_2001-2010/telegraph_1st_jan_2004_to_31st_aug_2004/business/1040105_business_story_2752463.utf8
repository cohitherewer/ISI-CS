 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 4: The Centre has sounded out banks and financial institutions for phase II of the securities buyback programme.																								The second round of securities buyback is intended to take advantage of the prevailing soft interest rates.																								Bankers said this round would result in a withdrawal of almost all the long-dated high coupon securities and a replacement with low coupon securities through a switch.																								Currently, the floating stock of high coupon securities is around Rs 1,50,000 crore.																								In the last auction, the government had replaced some of the high coupon securities with low coupons like the 6.72 per cent 2014 and the 7.46 per cent 2017. This time also, sources said, they expected the moves to be identical, though the securities to be issued are expected to be even more long-dated.																								In the last auction, the response was lackadaisical. The buyback elicited a response of about Rs 14,000 crore. Sources said many were less enthusiastic about this round than the first one.																								The strong banks are not keen enough to participate in this second round of securities buyback. Banks whose levels of non-performing assets are high have evinced interest to participate in the programme. 																								Banks, which still have arrears in provisions, have a substantial tax cushion and the buyback would help increase the coverage along with the tax cushion. The buyback profits used for meeting provisions are fully exempted from taxes. 																								Banks, which have a high NPA coverage ratio, are not keen to participate in the exercise. One major reason is that they had sought time-bound changes to section 36 (viii a) of the Income-Tax Act. 																								This provision in the Act provides for tax exemptions on provisions made for non-performing assets subject to a ceiling of 10 per cent up to 2005. The public sector banks had conveyed that the ceiling of 10 per cent be removed or raised to provide for accelerated/floating provisions. 																								But with the Central Board for Direct Taxes opposed to this demand banks with high NPA coverage ratios are in the process of getting rid of the high coupon securities anticipating that the Reserve Bank may ask them to participate in the buyback programme.																								Institutions in the market for such high coupon securities, especially the long-dated ones, are the life insurance companies, including Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). 																								However, bankers are also worried that such switches would lead to lower yields on investments, though the earnings this year were unlikely to be affected. However, it would imply that the cushion available in the form of hidden reserves in the undervalued assets would no longer be available.

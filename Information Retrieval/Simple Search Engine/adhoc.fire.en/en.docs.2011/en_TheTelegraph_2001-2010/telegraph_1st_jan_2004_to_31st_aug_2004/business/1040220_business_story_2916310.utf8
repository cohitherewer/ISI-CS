The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 RPG group to spend Rs 400cr on retail chain
																								Mumbai, Feb. 19 (PTI): The RPG group will invest Rs 400 crore to set up a total of 21 giant hypermarkets across the country in the next three years. It is also evaluating a possibility of divesting around 20 per cent stake in the giant retail chain to a strategic investor.																								We will have 21 hypermarkets in 12 cities, including four in Mumbai, three in Delhi and two in Chennai over the next three years, RPG chairman Harsh Goenka told newspersons here today after inaugurating the hypermarket at Malad in the western suburbs, making it the first outlet in the city.																								The company is expecting a turnover of Rs 3,500 crore from retail business by 2006-07, of which Rs 2,500 crore is estimated to come from giant hypermarkets, he added.																								On raising funds, he said: We will look at all the options, including an initial public offering, for expansion. However, we do not need the money immediately and have not yet decided on the option.																								The company would also look at diluting around 20 per cent stake in the hypermarket chain, Goenka said. The company is not planning any acquisition at the moment, he added. 																								RPG Enterprises president and CEO, retail sector, Raghu Pillai said, We expect the Mumbai outlet to break even in 12 months. 																								The company already has a giant hypermarket in Hyderabad, which was set up two years back.																								Pillai said the hypermarket would have private labels, which would be available at around 10-20 per cent lower price than the branded products.																								We expect private sales to account for 25-28 per cent of total sales in the next two years, he said.

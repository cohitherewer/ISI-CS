 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 20: Tractor major Mahindra amp; Mahindra and State Bank of India (SBI) today entered into a strategic partnership to offer a total solutions package to the customers. Under the deal, SBI would finance the purchase of M amp;M vehicles like soft tops, pick-ups, light-commercial vehicles and three-wheelers. 																								It is seen as a win-win situation for both the partners. M amp;M hopes to leverage on SBIs pan-Indian spread of more than 9,000 branches to further consolidate its presence in the rural areas. State Bank, which has been focussing on retail finance over the past couple of years, could now register higher loan disbursements in this segment.																								Turbo Sapne, the scheme launched by the duo, will offer customers a special price along with service, which is considered to be an important value addition for this category of buyers.																								SBI said that for loans up to Rs 2 lakh the rate of interest will be 10 per cent on reducing balance for a tenure of up to seven years.																								Alan Durante, executive director and president, auto sector, M amp;M, said, M amp;Ms heart has always been in the hinterlands. Today, there are more than 11 lakh Mahindra vehicles plying the length and breath of rural India. A large majority of these vehicles are the lifeblood of the rural economy, used for transportation of people and agri-products.																								 SBI has so far lent more than Rs 1,300 crore to transport operators under the small business finance scheme and a major portion of this portfolio consists of commercial vehicle users. 																								C. Sundarashyam, chief general manager (development banking), SBI, said, SBI keeps the customer in focus while designing new products and tie-up arrangement with companies in general and M amp;M in particular. 																								Mahindra Maxx Pick-up range is one vehicle which falls under this scheme. It is suited for transporting agriculture goods, dairy products, fruits and vegetables. According to M amp;M, these vehicles have found favour with a cross-section of consumers, from farmers to small businessmen and traders.

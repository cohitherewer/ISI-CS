 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 State Bank to review tea loans
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 29: State Bank of India has decided to review its tea loans and restructure them, if necessary. 																								SBI has an exposure of more than Rs 300 crore in the tea sector.																								Within a week all the tea accounts will be reviewed, SBI chairman A. K. Purwar said while addressing the members of Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.																								Purwar said the local head office would receive instructions by Monday evening.																								United Bank of India has already taken steps to restructure its tea accounts. 																								According to the revival package prepared by the Indian Banks Association, large tea growers and manufacturers will be considered on a case-to-case basis while irregular outstandings in term loan/working capital accounts as on December 31, 2003, may be converted into a special tea term loan.																								Earlier, Purwar said the bank has introduced a fast-track scheme for approving projects above Rs 2 crore.																								We have set up a central processing cell for clearing proposals over Rs 2 crore within 30 days. The move will help the bank achieve the projected 16.5 per cent growth in deposits, he said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Log-on mantra																								New Delhi, Jan 8: The excise duty announced today will make computers and laptops cheaper by Rs 1,500-2000 while cellphone prices  particularly feature phones (with camera)  will drop by Rs 1,000.																								However, the prices of entry-level cellphones will fall only marginally by about Rs 500, according to quick back-of-the-envelop calculations by industry mavens.																								India will now become the cheapest retail market for cellphones, said Pankaj Mahindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association. The grey market will get hit as the genuine handset market is expected to grow to 80 per cent.																								The impact (of the duty cuts) will be felt immediately and we may see a drop in prices within three weeks, added Mahindroo.																								In a major pre-poll sop to consumers, the government reduced the excise duty on computers from 16 to 8 per cent, while the customs duty cut on cellphones were cut from 10 to 5 per cent. Further, the customs duty on raw materials used for the manufacture of electronic components or optical fibres and cables have been reduced to 0-5 per cent from 5-15 per cent earlier.																								Specified infrastructure equipment for basic/cellular/internet, V-sat, radio paging and public mobile radio trunked services and parts of such equipment have also been exempted from basic customs duty.																								Sameer Kochhar, CEO, of Skoch Consultancy Services Pvt. Ltd, said, We expect a higher than 50 per cent growth. There will be an 8 per cent drop in prices resulting in an additional 20 per cent growth in the IT sector. This is over and above the current 30 per cent growth. The grey market will be the most affected with 30 per cent drop in their revenues from 60 per cent.																								Narendra Kumar Goyal, president of the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association, It is a very healthy move by the government and will give the much needed impetus to the telecom sector.																								MAIT welcomed the excise duty cut from 16 to 8 per cent and across the board removal of the 4 per cent Special Additional Duty. MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta said, The government has met a long standing demand of the IT manufacturing industry. Baggage rules have been liberalised. Laptops brought as part of baggage are being exempted from customs duty for a few categories of travellers. Manufacturers will be allowed to remove semi-finished goods and finished goods for further processing or testing, without payment of excise duty, he said. 																								Ashish Bakshi, country head of BenQ, said, This will help growth of mid- and high-end mobile handsets. While there will be a marginal drop in prices of entry level phones, the announcement will benefit the featured camera phones.

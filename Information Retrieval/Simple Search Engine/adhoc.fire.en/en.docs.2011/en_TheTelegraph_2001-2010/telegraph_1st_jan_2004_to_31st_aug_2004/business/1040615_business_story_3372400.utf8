 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Singapore firm mulls Orissa pig-iron plant 
 A STAFF REPORTER Rolling stock 																								Calcutta, June 14: Singapore-based Natural Resources Pte Ltd (NRPL), one of the largest exporter of coking coal and metallurgical coke to India, plans to set up a pig iron manufacturing facility in Orissas Jajpur district through its associated companies.																								The pig iron facility will help the company vertically integrate its operations with its coke plant, Neelachal Carbo Metallics, said managing director B. Chatterjee.																								The plant will produce pig iron with high carbon, high nickel and high chrome content, which will benefit stainless steel manufacturers, Chatterjee said.																								The company is yet to take a final decision on the investment and plant size.																								NRPL exports over six lakh tonnes of coking coal and 2,50,000 tonnes of coke to India, Chatterjee said.																								There is a huge demand for pig iron from the steel industry, which is facing a shortage of coking coal. Having a pig iron facility will give us an edge over other players as we have long-term sources of coking coal in China and Australia, he said.																								NRPL recently acquired Wellman Incandescent, which has two coke oven plants and one engineering unit, through associates Energy Trading Company in Calcutta. Out of the three units, two are in Bengal and a coke plant is in Orissa.																								The acquisition will help NRPL and its Indian associates to produce 2.20 lakh tonnes of coke, Chatterjee said.																								Half of NRPLs total exports of coking coal to India will be used in captive units, he said.																								NRPL acquired Wellman Incandescent for Rs 14 crore. However, all three units have been out of operation for quite sometime. So the company may need to invest more, he added.																								However, the two coke oven plants can give us a payback in reasonable time. I am not very sure about the engineering unit in Howrah, which is in a very bad shape, Chatterjee said.																								He is optimistic of getting some fiscal benefits from the state governments in Orissa and Bengal for the revival of the three units.																								NRPL also imports over 380,000 tonnes of iron ore from India for various Chinese steel plants. Chatterjee said the iron ore business will have a very strong potential even in the coming years because of the heavy demand from China.

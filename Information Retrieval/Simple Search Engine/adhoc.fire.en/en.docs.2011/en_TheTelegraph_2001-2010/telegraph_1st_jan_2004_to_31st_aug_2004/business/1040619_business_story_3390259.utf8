The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Steel firms want captive mining leases widened
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 ISA chairman J. J. Irani (left) with president Moosa Raza in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, June 18: The Indian Steel Alliance (ISA) wants the government to grant mining leases to companies with a production capacity of one million tonnes or more.																								ISA president Moosa Raza said the integrated steel plants should have captive iron ore mines to remain competitive. Only Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel and Jindal Steel and Power have such leases. 																								Ispat Industries and Essar Steel, both members of the ISA, have been seeking mining leases for some time. 																								Input costs have been rising over the past couple of years and steel companies face a crisis. Having captive mines will help them tide over the problem, Raza said.																								The alliance has also demanded that policies should be crafted to develop raw material resources within the country, besides providing relief on imported inputs.																								The ISA has decided to lobby the government to keep excise and import duties on steel at current levels of 40 per cent to fight large-scale dumping. It also wants DEPB benefits, withdrawn some time back, to be restored.																								Steel companies need exports to balance their earnings. If the price in the domestic market slides suddenly, selling abroad will keep firms going, Raza said.																								ISA chairman J. J. Irani said the government should speed up infrastructure projects that have the potential to boost steel companies in the coming months.																								Irani, the former managing director of Tata Steel, felt the steel companies should leverage their assets to double capacity. 																								Brownfield expansion is preferable to a greenfield one because it saves time and cost. We can produce another 25 million tonnes through expansion, he said.																								On moves towards a regulatory body for steel, Irani said the alliance is examining the issue. 																								The growth rates under regulation were much lower than those achieved after the industry was deregulated, he added.

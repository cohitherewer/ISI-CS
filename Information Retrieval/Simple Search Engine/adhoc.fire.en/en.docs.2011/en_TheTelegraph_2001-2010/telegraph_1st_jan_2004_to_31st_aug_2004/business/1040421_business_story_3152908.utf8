 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 GSM holds the edge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 20: Mobile operators using the GSM technology are likely to add 100 million customers by 2007 which will be about 80 per cent of the total subscribers growth in India. The GSM operators jointly have added about 26 million subscribers by March-end.																								According to Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), cellular or GSM technology will easily overtake the CDMA (code division multiple access) technology in India.																								In India, companies like Bharti, Hutch and Idea offer mobile phone service using GSM technology and companies like Reliance Infocomm and Tata Teleservices offer mobile phones using CDMA technology.																								Globally, GSM subscriber base touched the one-billion mark in February this year. According to GSA, the operators using GSM technology will increase investment in infrastructure and quality of service.																								The association feels that GSM will lead the race as it functions on open mobile standard and offers unchallenged economies of scale. Features like automatic international roaming are major contributors to the business plans of operators and easy to use facilities for the subscribers.																								Alan Hadden, president of GSA, said, Worldwide 22 out of 25 leading telecom operators use GSM and their average revenue from data contributes more than 18 of their total revenues.																								Hadden said the future for GSM operators is in Enhanced Data Rate for Global Evolution (EDGE) and Wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA).																								EDGE and WCDMA are the 3G technology that can offer streaming digital video on mobile phones. Operators offering mobile services claim that with the use of CDMA 20001XEVDO system, they can offer 3G services to their subscribers.																								More than 76 operators in 50 countries have already committed to deploy EDGE. It is already commercially available in 15 networks in all continents, including Idea and Bharti in India.																								For GSM, India is a success story. It is one of the fastest growing markets with its subscriber base doubling in 2003. Almost every Latin American operator has chosen GSM. In North America GSM growth is bigger than CDMA, said Hadden.

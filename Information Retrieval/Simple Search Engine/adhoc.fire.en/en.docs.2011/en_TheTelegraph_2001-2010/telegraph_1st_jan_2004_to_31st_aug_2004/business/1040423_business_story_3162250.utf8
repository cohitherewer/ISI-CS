The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Move to pare broadband rates to Rs 600 a month
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Baijal: Cutting costs																								New Delhi, April 22: Broadband services havent caught on in India because of the high costs. The telecom regulator is now initiating a move to pare costs from Rs 3,000 a month to about Rs 600.																								By the end of this month, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will come out with the final guidelines for offering broadband services  and the focus of the exercise is to shave costs to about Rs 600 per month for accessing the service.																								The regulator expects broadband growth to mirror the trend in mobile telephony where the sharp tariff cuts sparked greater usage and increased subscribers. Currently, the cost of broadband service is about Rs 3,000 a month, which may drop with the rise in number of users.																								Once that happens, you will be able to catch that cricket match or your favourite movie on a computer at a speed of 512 kilobits per second and an always-on internet connection.																								Trai chairman Pradeep Baijal today hinted at allowing the private operators and internet service providers to use the last-mile copper link to home in order to offer broadband services owned by Bharat Sanchar Nigam. BSNL will share revenues with the operators for allowing them provide the last-mile copper network.																								Speaking at a conference on South Asia Communications Infrastructure, Baijal said, We will release the broadband report this week or next. We hope the government will soon approve the guidelines. The country witnessed an explosive growth in mobile telephony when the price was set right by the market and we expect the same to happen here.																								The regulator has to play an important role in enabling the market to grow. Although our decisions were often termed as Wild West tactics by the operators, the operators and consumers are reaping the benefits. If the tariff is right, there will be automatic growth, said Baijal. 																								Trai also plans to initiate a discussion on foreign direct investment. Despite the background of the East India Company as the oldest overseas investor in this country, we are among the countries that can take a quick decision on allowing 100 per cent FDI. Once the security issues are taken care of, FDI in any colour should be allowed, said Baijal.

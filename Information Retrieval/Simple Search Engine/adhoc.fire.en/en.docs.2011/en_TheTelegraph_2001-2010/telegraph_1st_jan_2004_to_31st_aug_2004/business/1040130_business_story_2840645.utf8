 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Maruti rolls out cheaper, sleeker Baleno
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 Cut above the rest 																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: Maruti Udyog, the countrys largest carmaker, is barging its way into the upper mid-size segment with a new version of its Baleno sedan  the Lxi  which will be offered at a price of around Rs 5.6 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).																								The carmaker, 54.2 per cent of which is owned by Japans Suzuki Motor, has a dominant 50 per cent market share in the small and compact-sized segment spearheaded by the Maruti 800, Zen and Wagon R hatchbacks.																								Maruti is now looking to carve up some turf in the mid-size segment where it has a 12 per cent market share  a segment where it is represented by Esteem at the bottom-end and Baleno at the top-end. 																								The new cut-price Baleno will have the same 1590-cc engine as the other models with a 94 bhp. The recent customs duty cuts have also prompted Maruti to slash the prices of its Baleno VXi to Rs 6.29 lakh from Rs 6.55 lakh. The price of its estate version  the Altura  has been cut by Rs 25,000 to Rs 6.78 lakh.																								The Baleno and Altura, with a relatively higher import content, has seen a reduction in costs owing to the drop in customs duty, the company said in a press release.																								The new Baleno variant is aimed at the mid-sized car segment where it will compete with the local units of Hondas new City  which has been a tearaway success  Fords Ikon and Hyundais Accent.																								Analysts said the introduction of new variants in the mid-size segment reflects that the profit margins are the highest in this segment and this is where the real action lies.																								Last November, the local subsidiary of Japans Honda Motor had launched a new-look version of its popular City model with a lower power output and priced at Rs 6.67 lakh, almost Rs 1 lakh less than the earlier model. 																								Demand for the City sedan, which is manufactured at a plant located on the outskirts of Delhi, is heavy and there is a waiting period between four and six weeks for delivery. Marutis car sales jumped year-on-year 23.2 per cent to 37,091 units in December. Cumulative sales in April-December rose 30.3 per cent to 3.28 lakh units.

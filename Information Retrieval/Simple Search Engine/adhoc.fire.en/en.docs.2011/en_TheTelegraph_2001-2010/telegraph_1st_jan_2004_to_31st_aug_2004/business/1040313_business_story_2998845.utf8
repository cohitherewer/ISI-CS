 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Workers to toss up tea revival recipe
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, March 12: The Indian Tea Association will ask unions in Bengal and Assam to suggest ways to bring down the cost of production and to make the industry, reeling under the double-whammy of high wages and low output prices in the market, competitive.																								Talking to The Telegraph, chairman C. K. Dhanuka said: We want co-operation from workers. They should now come forward with some suggestions. We are holding a meeting of all our members on March 15 to see how we can approach the unions.																								The tea industry in Bengal and Assam employs 8 lakh people directly and nearly 25 lakh indirectly. The chairman will meet Bengal labour minister Mohammad Amin for a preliminary discussion on the matter. 																								We want to sit with the trade unions and work out a strategy to revive the health of the tea industry once the elections are over. We are getting full support from the chief ministers of Bengal and Assam. Both of them feel that productivity should be increased substantially to bring down the cost of production. 																								The cost of production of tea is highest in India compared with other tea producing nations. According to figures filed by the international consultant Accenture, the cost of production in India is $1.62 per kg compared with $1.23 per kg in Sri Lanka and $1.16 in Kenya. The cost of production in Vietnam, Indonesia and Malawi are below $1 per kg.																								Reduction in cost can be done in two ways  by increasing productivity or by reducing wages.																								The wages of tea workers in Bengal were settled through a tripartite agreement in 1999. The agreement said there would be a 40 per cent increase in wages for the next three years. Similarly, the bipartite agreement in 1998 for workers in Assam said there would be an increase of 55 per cent in wages for the next four years.																								The agreement for Bengal expired in 2002 and that for Assam in 2003.																								In the last seven years (1997-2003), wages in Bengal have risen 137 per cent, but the price the tea fetched at the auctions increased only 14 per cent. In the same period, the price of Assam tea went up by 21 per cent against an increase of 141 per cent in wages.

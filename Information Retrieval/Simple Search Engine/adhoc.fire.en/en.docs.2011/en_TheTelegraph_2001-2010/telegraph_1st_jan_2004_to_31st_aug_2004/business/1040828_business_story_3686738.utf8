 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Pact shadow on Aventis
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 27: The activities and medium-term growth perspectives of Aventis Pharma Ltd may be affected due to the uncertainty over the future of a joint venture agreement with Chiron Corporation of the US.																								Aventis had entered into a joint venture agreement in April 1998 with Chiron for the manufacture of the anti-rabies vaccine, Rabipur, and for the grant of distribution rights in India to the company for certain Chiron vaccines.																								Consequently, both Aventis and Chiron subscribed to shares in the joint venture company, Chiron Behring Vaccines Pvt Ltd (CBVPL). In this company, Aventis holds 49 per cent of its equity, while 51 per cent is held by Chiron. CBVPL manufactures Rabipur at its plant in Ankleshwar.																								Consequent to the acquisition of a majority stake in Aventis, France by Sanofi-Synthelabo, France, the company has notified Chiron of the change in control as required by the joint venture agreement, Aventis said.																								According to the agreement, Chiron is required to inform the company within six months whether it proposes to acquire the shares held by Aventis in CBVPL. 																								At this stage, the company (Aventis) is unable to anticipate the reaction of Chiron, Aventis said. 																								Aventis feels that the enforcement of these provisions (which include a buyout of its stake in CBVPL and termination of the distribution agreement and distribution rights) could have a significant impact on the activities profile and medium-term growth perspectives, even if it were to receive compensation for the termination of the considered contractual relations relating to the joint venture.																								At the time of forming partnership, Hoechst (the then parent of Aventis Pharma) had said CBVPL will make the anti-rabies vaccine and other vaccines of the Chiron Group and Hoechst will market them.																								Chiron had earlier entered into an alliance with Behringwerke AG, a Hoechst AG subsidiary for research and manufacture of adult and paediatric vaccines.

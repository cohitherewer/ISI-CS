 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 19: The private mobile telecom operators have opposed the continuation of access deficit charge (ADC) as it is an additional cess on the access services and tends to increase their tariffs.																								They want the ADC to be given only to those companies that are offering service in rural areas.																								Internationally, ADC is calculated on the basis of the difference between the actual cost of providing service and the mandated lower tariffs for providing subsidised access services to a class of subscribers.																								The operators feel that continuation of ADC will run counter to the fundamental principle of ADC which arises due to providing cheaper and below cost access services and cross subsidising the same from other telecom services.																								In a letter to Trai, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said, We suggest that there should be no ADC beyond March 2007.																								COAI has suggested that ADC should be merged with the universal service obligation (USO) regime as it has been done in other countries. Instead of having one more transition, we should straight away move to the final objective of funding telecom services in rural areas through USO fund only, the association said.																								In the suggestions submitted to Trai, response to the consultation paper on ADC regime released last week, COAI has said ADC funding under the proposed regime should be provided only to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).																								The other incumbent, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL), is providing services only in Delhi and Mumbai, the two biggest metros in the country. Moreover, it has no rural presence. 																								Similarly, private fixed-line service providers (FSPs) are not providing any services in the rural areas where the telecom regulators standard tariff package would be mandatorily applicable.																								All private FSPs have now migrated to the UASL regime, under which there is no rural roll-out obligation.																								It has also suggested that ADC should be performance linked with a Trai specified rollout of rural lines. This is necessary because in spite of the huge cross subsidies enjoyed by BSNL in the past, rural lines are still only about 20 per cent of total lines. This would be easily implemented if ADC is merged with the USO regime.

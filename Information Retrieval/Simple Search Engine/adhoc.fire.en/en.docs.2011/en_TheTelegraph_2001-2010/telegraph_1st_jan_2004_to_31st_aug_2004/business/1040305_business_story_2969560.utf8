 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Disney CEO loses chairmans post
				 	 Eisner: Feeling the heat																								Philadelphia, March 4 (Reuters): Embattled Walt Disney Co chief executive Michael Eisner on Wednesday was stripped of his role as chairman, but kept his position as chief executive even after 43 per cent of shareholders voted against him in an unprecedented protest. 																								Convening in Philadelphia after a stormy annual meeting, Disneys board said it had elected former US senator George Mitchell as the companys chairman and that 61-year-old Eisner had its unanimous backing as Disneys top executive. 																								The board once again rebuffed a $49-billion hostile take-over offer by cable operator Comcast Corp, saying it was insufficient, but that it would review any reasonable proposal. 																								Comcast called on Disneys independent directors to open talks, while Microsoft Corp chairman Bill Gates rejected speculation that the software giant would bid for Disney. The vote  widely seen as a rebuke to Eisners leadership  sent shock waves through corporate America and marked the strongest such protest against an incumbent chief executive ever. It signalled Disneys concession was unlikely to satisfy shareholders campaigning for Eisners removal. Calpers, the nations largest public pension fund, said the stunning result of the vote showed the depth of investor frustration with Eisner. 																								This discontent is too wide and way too deep in the marketplace, and it has led us to believe that Eisner should go, said Sean Harrigan, president of the board of administration of Calpers.

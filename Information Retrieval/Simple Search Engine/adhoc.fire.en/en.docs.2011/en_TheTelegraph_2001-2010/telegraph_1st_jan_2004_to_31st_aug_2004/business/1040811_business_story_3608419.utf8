 SHIFTING GEARSSUTANUKA GHOSALShifting gears																								Calcutta, Aug. 10: Hindustan Motors (HM) wants the Bengal government to set up an IT park in the surplus land at its Uttarpara factory  the Ambassador manufacturing centre.																								Plans are also afoot to sell the surplus land inside the factory premises, which is to the tune of 400 acres, company sources said. 																								State commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen told The Telegraph that, The HM management came to meet me regarding a sales tax issue. It was then that it put forward the proposal of setting up an IT Park at Uttarpara. I have asked them to get in touch with our IT department.																								The GP-CK Birla flagship has already sought the approval of the state government for alternative use of the surplus land at Uttarpara.																								The HM management has also approached the IT department with its proposal. State IT secretary G. D. Gautama confirmed the move and said, We have briefed them about the states IT sector. They are currently carrying out due diligence.																								Broadband connectivity will not be a problem at Uttarpara, Gautama added. BSNL-VSNL and Reliance gateway are already there. HM wants to set up the infrastructure and sell it off or lease it out to the interested parties, he said.																								On the success of the IT park at Uttarpara, Gautama said, IT entrepreneurs are working at Durgapur. So why not Uttarpara?																								However, it is not clear why automobile company HM is venturing into the IT sector.																								A company spokesperson said, The GP-CK Birla group has already diversified into IT through Birlasoft. So, this area is not entirely new to us.																								However, on the proposed IT Park, she said, The group has nothing to share now.																								Executive vice-president Ashwani Dubey also refused to comment. I am not aware of anything, he said.																								But the move to sell off the land or set up an IT Park has irked trade unions. Ajit Chakroborty of Intuc said, A major portion of the factory land was given by the state government. Now that the company is planning to sell the surplus land, the government should stop them from doing so. The Madhya Pradesh government had earlier stalled the companys move to sell off the surplus land at our Indore factory.																								HM needs nearly Rs 50-60 crore to modernise the interiors of the Ambassador and spruce up its features. The exterior will, however, remain unchanged as it is the cars USP.																								The company aims to sell 18,000 Ambassadors and 2,000 trekkers in the current fiscal. Last year, it sold 12,000 Ambassadors and 1,000 trekkers.

Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha																								New Delhi, May 19: General Motors India is set to buy Daewoo Motors production facilities here within the next quarter.																								A month might be too optimistic but I would be really disappointed if it is more than three months, said D. Nick Reilly, chief executive officer of GM Daewoo Auto amp; Technology Company. The due diligence process is on, he added.																								A deal like this is always complex since we still have some issues to resolve. However, we hope we will soon sign a definitive agreement which will enable us to bring mini (compact) cars to India. If at all we are not able to sign the deal, we will explore other avenues..., Reilly said. 																								Quite a lot of work needs to be done at these facilities and it would certainly be a year before we can start production.																								GM India today introduced the Travera under the Chevrolet brand name with a sticker price ranging between Rs 5.5-8.45 lakh and powered by a 2.5-litre diesel engine.																								The automaker, which expects to sell around 10,000 units of Travera in 2004, will outsource engines and transmissions from Hindustan Motors for this model.																								Hindustan Motors, one of the countrys oldest auto companies, will manufacture Traveras engines and transmission systems at its plant at Pithampur in Madhya Pradesh.																								Currently, General Motors manufactures the German-engineered Opel Astra, Corsa, Optra and Swing models at its Halol plant in Gujarat. But, this facility does not make engines.																								GM officials said Travera has around 85 per cent localisation which has helped the carmaker reduce manufacturing costs and price it competitively against Toyota Motors Qualis.

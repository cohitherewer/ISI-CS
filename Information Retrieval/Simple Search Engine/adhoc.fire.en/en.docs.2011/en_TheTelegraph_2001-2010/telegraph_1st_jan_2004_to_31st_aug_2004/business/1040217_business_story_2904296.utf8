 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 BMW to romance Indian auto lovers
 SRINJOY SHARMA 				 Raising a storm 																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: German luxury car-maker BMW plans to drive into Indias expanding automobile market with its X5 sports utility vehicle along with three other models  318, 330 and 745i  within the next couple of years.																								The homologation of the 318 model has been completed and the model is likely to be launched next fiscal. The other models would be introduced over a period of time.																								The homologation process of these models would begin soon, sources said. The carmaker is in the process of appointing new dealers, they added.																								He said the petrol version of the 318 model would sport a sticker price of Rs 24 lakh while the 745i model would cost Rs 61 lakh.																								All four models would be imported as completely-built units. In the case of the sports utility vehicle, both the petrol and diesel versions would be available, he added.																								The domestic market for premium cars and sports utility vehicles (SUV) is on an upward growth curve and has already attracted global automakers. The sports utility vehicles segment has reported a 50 per cent rise in sales.																								Last month, Bentley, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen, had launched its Continental GT model priced at Rs 1.67 crore followed by Mercedez AG of Germany which launched its Maybach with a sticker price of Rs 5 crore.																								Japans Nissan Motor, in which Renault of France holds 44 per cent, will launch its X-Trail sports utility vehicle, priced at Rs 20 lakh, in June. 																								Nissan would compete with Mitsubishi Pajero (Rs 32 lakh), Hyundai Indias Terracan (Rs 18 lakh), General Motors Forester (Rs 16-17 lakh), Suzukis Grand Vitara (Rs 15 lakh) and Hondas CR-V (Rs 15 lakh).																								Auto makers are importing these models as completely-built units despite the 115 per cent import duty levied on them as the demand for these luxury vehicles are on the rise and the carmakers are able to reap huge profits.

 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Rally prompts brokerages to widen reach
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 Good times 																								Mumbai, Jan. 18: A bull rally gives impetus to brokerages to expand their network of branches. Motilal Oswal Securities, a leading institutional and retail broking firm in Mumbai that is affiliated to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), has set up seven branches in the past seven months. It plans to set up another 18 in the next 12 months, almost a four-fold jump from its initial strength.																								We plan to set up a branch wherever there is a regional stock exchange, says Motilal Oswal head-business development Ravi Chadha said.																								Other brokerages, including Kotak Securities, SSKI, Prabhudas Liladher, are also expanding to different towns to increase their clientele.																								The biggest challenge is to find good people, said Chadha. Setting up a branch requires just Rs 10-15 lakh, he said.																								Many of them are using a twin strategy of adding their own branches or setting up franchisees. Motilal Oswal alone has 160 franchisees in addition to its branches.																								The problem with franchisees is that affluent clients prefer to deal with the main brokerages directly. It explains why broking outfits are setting up bases in other cities.																								NSE and BSE are aiding the effort by setting up hubs in other cities and thus reducing transaction expenses.																								Advances in technology help the broking hubs to monitor their branches on a minute-to-minute basis.																								The stock market boom has seen many small players expanding within the city and also to smaller towns where big brokerages have not set up offices.																								Brokerages are also diversifying by offering more services. Bulge bracket brokerages are offering portfolio management services and distributing mutual fund products in addition to servicing retail clients. 																								ASK Raymond James has a division that manages over Rs 100 crore as portfolio management services. Motilal Oswal manages services worth Rs 45 crore and it is still growing.																								Many of these brokerages are making forays in West Asia to tap investor money. Some months ago, a portfolio manager affiliated to a broking outfit held a successful roadshow in Dubai. Many others have since set up bases in Dubai and other Gulf countries. The boom is keeping a lot of market players alive, said a leading broker. A consolidation is yet to take place as the small broking shops have got a fresh lease of life.

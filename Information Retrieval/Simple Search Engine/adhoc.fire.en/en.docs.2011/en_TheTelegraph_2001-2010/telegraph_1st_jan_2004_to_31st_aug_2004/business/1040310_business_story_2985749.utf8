The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Rally comes to a halt
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 9: The stock markets took a break today after two successive rallies that came in the wake of the blockbuster ONGC public offer. 																								Profit-booking was the buzz word as players pressed sales in the cement, oil and steel counters. Infotech stocks felt the heat as the propaganda against outsourcing in the US sent jittery investors on a selling spree. A combination of these factors pulled the sensex down 85 points.																								The bellwether index opened moderately lower at 5923.35, but continuous selling pressure took the key index to a low of 5794.82. It recovered partly to close at 5850.61 against Mondays close of 5935.19, a fall of 84.58 points or 1.43 per cent.																								The BSE technology index plummeted 1.58 per cent. The PSU index, which was a star performer during the past couple of sessions, also lost 1.25 per cent, while the Bankex lost 0.44 per cent. Brokers feel foreign institutional investors have slowed down their purchases after the huge investments in the public offers.																								Infosys, Reliance, Grasim, L amp;T, ONGC and HLL registered sharp losses. While Infosys dipped by Rs 137.85 to Rs 4,970.30, Wipro dropped nearly 1 per cent. However, Dr Reddys and Ranbaxy were among the few gainers. The volume of business was higher at Rs 2,845.55 crore from Rs 2,666.91 crore on Monday. SBI was the top-traded share with the highest turnover of Rs 247.78 crore followed by Tisco at Rs 235.89 crore and Satyam at Rs 234.31 crore.																								Meanwhile, the ONGC public offer received cumulative bids 5.01 times the offer size at the end of the fourth day. Bids for 71.54 crore shares were placed against 14.26 crore on offer. 																								Petronets initial public offering was oversubscribed 3.29 times at the end of the bidding process today. The issue received bids for 87.66 crore shares against the offer size of 26.09 crore.

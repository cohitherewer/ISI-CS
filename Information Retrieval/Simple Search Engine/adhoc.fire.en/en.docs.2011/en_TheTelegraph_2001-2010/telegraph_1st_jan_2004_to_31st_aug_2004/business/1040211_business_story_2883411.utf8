 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Stake sales in WBIDC review
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Feb. 10: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) will divest its holding in some firms as part of an equity-investment review.																								Money from the sale will be invested in sectors like information technology, food, food processing and agro-processing. The Bengal government has identified these sectors as strategic areas of investment.																								The corporation, which expects to earn a net profit for the second consecutive year, has started sending notices to companies on its divestment plans. We are taking stock of our investments. We would like to liquidate our holdings on a case-to-case basis and invest in new firms, WBIDC executive director Talleen Kumar said. 																								The last stock-taking  or reappraisal of how the corporation deploys its funds  was done on March 31, 2002. 																								WBIDC has a major stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL), valued at Rs 385 crore, but it has no intention of selling its way out of the company at present.																								The corporation has sunk Rs 31 crore in Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. In Consolidated Fibres, a G.P. Goenka group company, it holds shares worth Rs 8 crore. In Simoco Birla and South-Asian Petrochem (the C. K. Dhanuka-promoted company), its stakes have been valued at Rs 4.76 crore and Rs 9.15 crore, respectively.																								WBIDC has strategic investments in 158 firms, of which nine are large ones. In the remaining 149, it has an exposure of Rs 24.84 crore. The initial stake-sales will be in firms not performing well, sources said.																								The corporation, which has proposals to buy equity in food and food-processing companies like Calypso and Saplings, has started a financial restructuring exercise under which it has decided to securitise assets of Rs 20 crore. CARE has been asked to rate its receivables.																								The reduction in holdings will reduce WBIDCs over-dependence on the governments financial assistance, which has gone down sharply over the past few years. The move will also limit the corporations equity. If the government gives it any money now, it gets added to the current amount, bloating its present equity of Rs 224 crore.

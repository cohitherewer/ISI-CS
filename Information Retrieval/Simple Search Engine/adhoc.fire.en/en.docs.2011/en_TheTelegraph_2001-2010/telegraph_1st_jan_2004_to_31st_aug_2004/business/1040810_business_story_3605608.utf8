The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 HDFC Bank focus on small, medium units
				 	 Puri: Upbeat																								Aug. 9 (PTI): HDFC Bank expects its earnings to grow 25-30 per cent in the next three years.																								We expect our earnings to grow 25-30 per cent in at least three years and the balance-sheet by 20-25 per cent in the same period, HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri told reporters today.																								The private sector bank has identified small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a thrust area for business opportunity, Puri said. It is also working closely with the commodity exchange.																								The managing director said there was no directive from the government on agricultural lending or on interest rates. However, he pointed out that there was an immense potential in this sector.																								With around 80 branches in semi-urban and rural areas, HDFC Bank is witnessing a good growth in class C and D cities. The bank is opening a branch in Latur this week, he added.																								Talking about the banks exposure in the capital market, Puri said, It was within the 5 per cent norm laid down by the Reserve Bank. But we have applied to the RBI for reviewing the limit after it was proposed in the budget that banks with good risk-handling capability and expertise may be allowed to go for higher exposure.																								Meanwhile, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) today defended the recent hike in home-loan rates by 0.25 per cent, saying the increase would not affect the demand for housing loans.																								The home-loan segment can withstand a rise of 1-1.5 per cent in interest rates as there exists a shortage of 90 million houses at present, said Renu Sud Karnad, executive director.

Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, March 19: Bengal will soon get a third tea auction centre with the Tea Board approving such a centre in Jalpaiguri.																								The state currently has two centres  in Calcutta and Siliguri. The Jalpaiguri centre will be the seventh in the country. 																								Nation-wide, there are six auction centres  three in south India (Cochin, Coimbatore and Conoor) and three in north India (Calcutta, Siliguri and Guwahati). 																								We have issued a licence for a third auction centre to the Jalpaiguri tea auction committee. The district magistrate of Jalpaiguri is the chairman of the committee, said R. S. Shukla, deputy chairman of the Tea Board.																								However, the board has a rider for the new auction centre. It should be entirely electronic and there will be no manual trading of tea, Shukla said. The Jalpaiguri auction committee has to set up the centre within a year.																								The committee is keen on an auction centre in Jalpaiguri as the centres in Calcutta and Siliguri cannot handle the whole supply of tea.																								Shukla added that the board was in the process of introducing electronic trading of tea. He was speaking at the 113th annual general meeting of the Calcutta Tea Traders Association (CTTA) today.																								Earlier, we planned to introduce electronic bidding in March. But there has been some problem with the software. We hope to introduce electronic bidding in Guwahati and Coimbatore in April. It will take another six months to launch the system in all the centres. Electronic bidding will bring more transparency in the trade, Shukla added.																								On the state tea committees recommendation of selling the whole produce through auctions, Shukla said the matter is under consideration.																								K. N. Desai, chairman of CTTA, told members that sales at the Calcutta auctions were 28 million kgs more than in 2002. Nearly 133 million kgs of tea was sold at the Calcutta auctions in 2003. 																								With a closing time of 19 days, sellers found it attractive to dispose of large quantities of tea through auctions. We have seen a change in the functioning of auction centres following the Tea (Marketing) Control Order-2003 Desai said.

 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 UTI tax-free bonds on March 31
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 8: The government will offer investors in UTIs seven assured return schemes that are being wound up on March 31, 6.6 per cent tax-free bonds worth Rs 5,000 crore.																								We expect investors will prefer bonds to cash for the seven UTI schemes. The exact amount of cash outgo will depend on how many people opt for it, said U. K. Sinha, joint secretary, capital markets, on the sidelines of an international insurance summit.																								The bonds will be offered as a conversion option to investors of seven schemes  Children Gift Growth Fund of 1986 (CGCF -86), Children Gift Growth Fund of 1999 (CGCF-99), Bhopal Gas Victims MIP 1992 (BGVMIP), monthly income plan of 1998 and 1999 and Rajlakshmi unit plans of 1994 and 1999.																								The payment date for the bonds will be set at March 31, Sinha said, adding budgetary allocation has been made for foreclosing these high assured return schemes.																								The Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI) is coming out with the tax-free bonds. SUUTI, which was saddled with all assured return schemes after the carve-up of the erstwhile UTI, is finding it difficult to sustain the interest rate of 14 per cent and 12 per cent on the two RUP plans over a maximum period of 20 years.																								In another development, the government today said there will be no guaranteed returns on investments in new pension schemes. Stiff penalties will be imposed on fund managers for any mismanagement and a new legislation will be put in place by the end of this year.

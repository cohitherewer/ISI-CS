 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Hind Lever shakes up shampoo pricing plan
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 19: Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) today re-launched Clinic Plus Health Shampoo, discontinuing its recent marketing initiative of buy-one-get-one free and instead offering customers a 20-23 per cent cut in prices.																								The relaunch of Clinic Plus, with its five-in-one benefit formulation and the new reduced price points, is Hindustan Levers second major initiative to offer outstanding consumer value in the category, the company said.																								Clinic Plus 100 ml bottle will now be available for Rs 30 against Rs 37.50. Its 200 ml pack size will be available at Rs 55 against Rs 70 and 300 ml will sport a price tag of Rs 90 against Rs 117.																								It remained silent on its Sunsilk shampoo brand. The new affordable prices have been finalised, following the overwhelming consumer response to HLLs buy-one-get-one free initiative on Clinic Plus and Sunsilk shampoo bottles, which was announced on March 15.																								However, analysts tracking the consumer goods segment are now questioning this strategy of frequent revisions in its pricing formula. It is important to give a consistent and steady signal to the markets rather than vacillating, said Jagdeep Kapoor, managing director at Samsika Marketing Consultants, a firm that advises medium-sized FMCG companies on marketing strategies. The ups and downs in prices move any brand towards commodisation rather than strengthen the brand, Kapoor added.																								Too many changes in the product content and prices trouble the consumer. Hopefully, now there will be stability rather than more changes, Kapoor said.																								When HLL offered the buy-one-get-one free scheme for Sunsilk and Clinic Plus, Procter amp; Gamble only revised its pricing for Pantene shampoo downwards by around 20 per cent.

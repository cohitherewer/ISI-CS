 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: General Insurance Corporation (GIC), the national reinsurer, plans to open a branch in Dubai within the next two months.																								Permission is yet to be taken from the local regulatory authority. We hope to open a branch office in Dubai before March this year as the GIC board has cleared the proposal at its last meeting, said managing director P. B. Ramanujam.																								GIC will initially have to tie up with a local agent to secure reinsurance business.																								The agent will help in marketing, communication, establishing contacts and procuring business. However, the underwriting policy and the final decision of accepting or rejecting a proposal will be in our hands, he added.																								Refusing to divulge the name of the local Dubai agent, Ramanujam said, There is only one popular name which has been suggested to us. However, we have yet to finalise it. 																								General Insurance proposes to do business with the local agency at least for a period of one or two years.																								The managing director said: Dubai and Bahrain is in the forefront of trading and commercial activities. These places hold a lot of potential and good opportunity for us. We will mostly reinsure property risks and not try to venture into liability business. 																								GIC feels it is not advisable to cover liability risks in the first few years as the claims could be huge. 																								This will be GICs first formal foray into the Gulf. At present, there are approximately 40 local and foreign general insurance companies operating in Dubai and Bahrain.																								There are also five to six European reinsurance companies in the region. The reinsurer targets to earn $3-5 million premium in its first year of operations. 																								GIC has a net worth of Rs 2,293 crore and an asset base of Rs 6,557 crore. 																								The premium collection of GIC grew from 5.9 per cent in 2000-01 to 11.4 per cent in financial year 2001-02. It also has a well-balanced portfolio with income from investments at Rs 739 crore.																								The national reinsurer has already procured business from Africa, West Asia, South-East Asia, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia and Bangladesh over the last three to four years. 																								GIC earned a total premium of Rs 750 crore in the last financial year from Asia, Africa and Europe.

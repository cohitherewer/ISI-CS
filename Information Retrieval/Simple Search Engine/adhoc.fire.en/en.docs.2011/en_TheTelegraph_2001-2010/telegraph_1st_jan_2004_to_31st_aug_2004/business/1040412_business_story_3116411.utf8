 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 At your service																								Mumbai, April 11: Bharat Forge Ltd (BFL), the leading Pune-based automobile components company, has decided to focus on passenger car components for its future growth. It has already established itself in the commercial vehicles segment.																								As passenger-car components constitute a large chunk of the global forging market, BFL is planning to focus on components such as chassis and machined diesel engine crankshafts.																								Apart from this, BFL is also evaluating new segments, including small and heavy forgings and heavy-duty crankshafts. It is also tapping new markets in Europe and China.																								For the passenger-car segment, BFL has firmed up expansion plans to tap the existing as well as potential customers. While the company presently has two 6000-tonne press lines to cater to this segment, it is now expanding its small forging capacity by setting up three additional press lines, including one large forging. 																								These expansions would double its passenger-car crankshaft forging capacity to around 3 million crankshafts and also strengthen its heavy crankshaft manufacturing facility. 																								BFL has announced its plans of coming out with a rights issue to part-finance the various expansion plans. The fund requirement is pegged at Rs 350 crore. The companys preliminary offer document filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India says that proceeds of the issue will be used for setting up additional capacities at Mundhwa in Pune and expansion of its forging capacities. It will also be used for setting up new machining facilities.																								BFL is planning to increase both machining and forging capacities in the heavy-duty crankshaft market. It has firmed up plans to set up a capacity totalling to 2-lakh machined heavy crankshafts.																								The forging major was in news last fiscal when it announced the acquisition of the German operations of Carl Dan Peddinghaus (CDP), in an asset purchase deal put at around euro 29 million. 																								The acquisition, which was done through its wholly owned subsidiary, CDPBF, made BFL one of the largest forging conglomerates in the world. 																								While the domestic market is still the largest contributor to the companys topline growth, BFL has increased its revenues from Europe, China and Australia from 8 per cent in fiscal 2002 to 29 per cent for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003.																								In pursuing the inorganic mode for growth, BFL has said that it would look out for companies with complementary product offerings, which can make its portfolio more comprehensive and also lead to cross-selling opportunities apart from those that have a good customer base.

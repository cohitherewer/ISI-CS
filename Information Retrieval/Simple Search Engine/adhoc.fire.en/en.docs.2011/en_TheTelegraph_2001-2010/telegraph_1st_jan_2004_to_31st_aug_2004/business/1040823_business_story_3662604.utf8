 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 UTIMFs overseas fund in October
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 22: UTI Mutual Fund, the largest mutual fund in the country, will launch its first overseas fund in a month-and-a-half. It will file the prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) within a week.																								It will take another four to six weeks for us to launch our first overseas fund. We will file the prospectus with Sebi in another one week and hope to receive the approval within three weeks after that, said A. K. Sridhar, chief investment officer, UTI Mutual Fund. 																								UTIMF had signed an exclusive agreement with State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), the worlds largest institutional asset manager. SSgA will act as the investment adviser for the overseas investments by the fund. 																								Explaining as to why it took UTIMF longer than initially expected to introduce the fund, Sridhar said launching of an overseas fund involves complex issues such as trading on multiple stock exchanges, appointing custodians and other global and regional factors that delay the process.																								The maximum limit for investment by mutual funds in overseas capital and debt markets is fixed according to Sebi guidelines. Currently, this limit is 10 per cent of net assets of each mutual fund subject to a ceiling of $50 million.																								Recently, UTIMF chairman M. Damodaran said UTI Asset Management Company is planning a holding company to exploit synergies among associate companies. The holding company will have under its fold the UTI Mutual Fund and all other associate companies of UTI.																								Sridhar explained that the concept of a holding company is to generate value if and when the company plans to divest its stake. The idea is to have an independent professionally-run body against other private mutual funds whereby, sometimes the AMC dictates terms to the trustee instead of the other way round, since in certain cases the AMCs stake is superior to that of the trustee.

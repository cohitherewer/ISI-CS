 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 RBI curbs on Mumbai co-op bank
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 9: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today clamped curbs on South Indian Co-operative Bank weeks after it slapped a moratorium on Global Trust Bank (GTB).																								The Mumbai-based bank has been stopped from granting or renewing loans, making investments, borrowing money and accepting fresh deposits without prior RBI nod. It also cannot sell, transfer or dispose of properties and assets.																								Withdrawals have been capped at Rs 10,000 in savings or current or any other type of accounts. The restrictions have been imposed under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI said.																								Depositors alarmed by reports of deepening losses and a bad-loan spurt had joined a money-withdrawal scramble that began on Sunday and did not ease until early today.																								Chairman Raghavan Sarathy said depositors have pulled out close to Rs 6 crore over the past three days, though he insisted there was no liquidity crunch. This was evident from the fact that all depositors were paid off.

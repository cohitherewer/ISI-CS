 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Tough times New Delhi, Aug. 6: Steel  prices will be heading northwards again  on top of the  increase earlier this week unless the government slashes  customs duties or coerces steelmakers to reduce rates.																								A gap between global and domestic steel rates and rising iron ore prices means that steel companies will seek another increase within the next four to six weeks.																								Steelmakers say while prices are around $740 a tonne in the US and around $630 a tonne in Europe (that is about Rs 28,000-32,000 per tonne), local rates arebetween Rs 25,000 and Rs 26,000 per tonne.																								If customs duties and other costs are taken into account, then the landed cost of imported steel here works out to about Rs 34,000-36,000 a tonne.																								Rising steel prices mean higher costs all around as the commodity is a basic component in all manufacturing and construction activities. 																								Earlier this year, Punjab steel foundries had protested strongly against price rises and had forced the government to exert pressure on big companies like Tata Steel, SAIL, Essar, Ispat and Jindal to either reduce or hold on to their prices.																								Steelmakers say hikes are justified as price of raw materials have gone up by multiples of 100 per cent in the past year. The Indian Steel Alliance, a group of all the big producers, says the cost of coke has gone up 300 per cent, iron pellets 200 per cent and sea freight by 300 per cent. 																								However, steel users complain that against an increase of 30-35 per cent globally, the comparable rise in prices in India stood at over 100 per cent over the last year and a half.

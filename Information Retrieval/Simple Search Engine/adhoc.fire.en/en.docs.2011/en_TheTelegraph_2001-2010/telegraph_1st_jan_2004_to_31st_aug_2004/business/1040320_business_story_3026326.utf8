 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Accel cashes in on new outsourcing opportunity
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, March 19: The Chennai-based Accel Icim Systems and Services has made a foray into warranty outsourcing and has grabbed contracts from 10 companies so far.																								Companies are increasingly exploring new avenues in outsourcing to raise revenue inflow.																								Speaking on the business strategies, president and chief operating officer S. V. Sriram said, Warranty outsourcing involves taking care of the entire after-sales and support activities of an organisation. Many multinationals sell their products in India through channel partners and distributors, but are averse to making investments in after-sales activities. It is this market that we are catering to.																								The Rs 200-crore company already serves established firms like Seagate, Lexmark, Epson, Sony Ericsson and Siemens. It is also the authorised service provider for Taiwanese cellphone major BenQ.																								The domestic warranty outsourcing market is estimated at $100 million and is dominated by regional players. The global market is around $2 billion. We have a 2 per cent market share in India, said Sriram. Accel is present in 28 cities in the country.																								The company has recently entered into an agreement with the Singapore-based Frontline Technologies for investing $7.6 million in Accels operations.																								Of the total investment, $4.4 million will be used to expand the IT and BPO businesses, said Sriram. The remaining will be used to purchase shares from prior investors.

 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Team to study quake-cover kitty
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Heal the Cracks 																								New Delhi, June 13: The General Insurance Council, a body constituting the heads of both public and private sector general insurance companies, has formed a working group to study the feasibility of an earthquake pool.																								The working group will collect information and data to examine the feasibility of forming this pool as demanded by the general insurers. However, a decision will be taken only after studying and analysing the finer details, said C. . S. Shastri, who is designated as the chairperson of this group.																								The working group is likely to have five members. While two of them will be from the Loss Prevention Association, two others will join from the tariff advisory committee. A private insurer is also supposed to be a member of the group.																								The discussion about creation of an earthquake insurance cap will be on the lines of the terrorism pool which offers cover against terrorism for a maximum of Rs 200 crore per cover.																								General insurers say that exposure to earthquake claims is too large, unquantifiable and unmanageable. The insurance industry, which is still in its nascent stage of development, wants to play safe by being able to calculate their total risk burden.																								General Insurance Corporation (GIC) managing director P. B. Ramanujam says insurers are hesitant to provide adequate cover in the absence of any reinsurer willing to reinsure 100 per cent of the risks.																								However, with earthquake insurance forming a part of the tariff-line business, no insurer can virtually refuse insurance cover. 																								As a result, General Insurance Corporation feels pressured as it has to mandatorily bear the burden of the domestic industry.																								Former IRDA chairman . Rangachary had earlier called for the establishment of an insurance pool to combat natural disasters and a tax-free catastrophe reserve for easy availability of finances to meet such contingencies.																								According to the World Bank, natural disasters have cost India as much as $13.8 billion during 1996-2001, up from $13.4 billion during 1981-95 and eroded 2 per cent of the gross domestic product and 12 per cent of government revenues. 																								Of the 31 states in India, 22 are regarded as being particularly disaster-prone, World Bank officials say.																								Moreover, about 55 per cent of the countrys land is vulnerable to earthquakes, 8 per cent to cyclones and 5 per cent to floods.

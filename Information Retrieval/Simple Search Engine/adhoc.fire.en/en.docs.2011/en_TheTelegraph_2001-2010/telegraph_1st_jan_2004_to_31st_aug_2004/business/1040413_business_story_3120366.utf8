 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Canon to spend more on research
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Mitarai: Focussed																								Shanghai, April 12: Canon has raised its research and development (R amp;D) budget from $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion to keep ahead of its rivals in high-tech products. However, Chinese counterfeit products are a major cause of concern for the company.																								Canon chief executive and president Fujio Mitarai said the company would now spend as much as 10 per cent of its sales revenue on R amp;D, up from 8 per cent in 2003.																								The Japanese camera and digital office equipment giants emphasis on R amp;D has enabled it to obtain 1,992 US patents in 2003, second only to IBM. Canon is followed by Hitachi, Matsushito Elec, H-P, Micron Tech, Intel, Philips, Samsung and Sony in the worlds top-10 list.																								Mitarai said Canon was determined to protect its intellectual properties and would not allow other companies to infringe on its product patents. It is unfortunate that in some areas the Canon brand is being used on counterfeit products. The poor quality of these products damages the trust of our customers, he said.																								Counterfeit consumable products such as ink cartridges are also proving to be a major menace. 																								In 2003, the company had lost around $20 million in sales on this account, according to senior Canon executives. There were also mass consumer complaints about Canon machines getting damaged by the use of poor quality counterfeit cartridges and toners.																								Mitarai announced at the four-day Canon expo here that the company would step up its anti-counterfeit campaign and would seek the support of the Chinese authorities to stamp out the menace. Over 350 raids were carried out worldwide against producers of counterfeit Canon products in 2003. Of these, 243 culprits were nabbed in China alone, while India accounted for 27. The US and Europe registered 65 such cases.																								As part of its anti-counterfeit campaign, Canon is developing more sophisticated holograms. The company also plans to develop more cost-effective consumables so that buyers are not swayed by low-cost fake batteries and ink cartridges.																								Mitarai, who took over the reins of the company in 1995, is rated as one of the best business managers in Japan. He ran the companys operations in the US for 23 years before returning to Tokyo.																								Under his leadership, Canon has been developing innovative technologies for new products.																								Canon plans to launch over 100 products in Asia this year, some of which were on display at the expo.																								Over 10 products will be launched in India by the end of this month. These include digital cameras of the IXUS series priced between Rs 14,000 and Rs 30,000, MV series of video camcorders at Rs 40,000-99,000 price range and i 990 series of printers for Rs 15,000-20,000.

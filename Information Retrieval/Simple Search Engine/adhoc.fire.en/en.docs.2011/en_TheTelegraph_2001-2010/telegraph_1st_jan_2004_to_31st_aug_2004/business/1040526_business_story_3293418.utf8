 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Sayeed pulls plug on power act review
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sayeed: Shock wave																								New Delhi, May 25: Union power minister P. M. Sayeed today ruled out any review of the Electricity Act.																								Some feel this could lead to new friction between the Congress and Left parties. 																								Sayeed who assumed office today, said: There is no need to review the Electricity Act. The act permits subsidy to different segments of consumers in a transparent manner to be provided through budgetary support by the state governments.																								The Left parties were disappointed by the power ministers comment. This cannot be accepted. But we hope it can be resolved since the Congress had taken up the issue of subsidy when they were sitting in the Opposition. The tax waivers for the private sector power generators had led to a disparity and they had maintained that there is need for supporting the state electricity boards since there is no level playing field, said Nilotpal Basu, CPI (M) member in Parliament. 																								He said the issue would be taken up with the Congress at future meetings to discuss the Common Minimum Programme, which is due this week.																								Sayeed has also ruled out the reorganisation of National Thermal Power Corporation, which was proposed by a committee set up by the NDA government. 																								When asked if the new government would follow the same policy in generation, distribution and transmission that was pursued by the previous government, Sayeed said, We dont want to follow the same way and face the same plight.																								However, the minister promised to carry forward the reforms that were started by the Congress government and promised speedy implementation of the Electricity Act 2003. 																								The minister said the governments top priority would be rural electrification and power reforms. 																								Extensive rural electrification programmes will be put in place. Currently 56 per cent of rural households in the country do not have access to electricity said Sayeed.																								Commenting on the future of Dabhol Power company, the minister said the committee set up by the previous government will be asked to expedite the blueprint for the final solution of the issue.

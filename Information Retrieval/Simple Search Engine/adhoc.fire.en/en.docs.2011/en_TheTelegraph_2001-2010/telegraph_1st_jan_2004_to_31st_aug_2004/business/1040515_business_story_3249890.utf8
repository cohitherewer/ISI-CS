 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Crude price at 21-year high
																								London, May 14 (Reuters): Oil prices vaulted to a 21-year high on Friday on fears that an attack on West Asia oil facilities may stress world fuel supplies already eroded by heady demand growth in China and the US.																								US light crude touched $41.50 a barrel, an all-time high in the 21-year history of the New York Mercantile Exchange contract. London Brent stood 34 cents higher at $38.83 a barrel.																								Warnings from a senior Russian official that oil exports from the worlds second biggest exporter have hit a ceiling after many years of growth underlined the strain on global supply.																								Realistically, the capacity of suppliers does not today meet growing demand in places such as China or India. And you have to take into account the state of affairs in Iraq, said Semyon Vainshtok, head of Russias oil pipeline monopoly.																								Economic expansion in China, bolstered by renewed US growth, has placed world supplies under increasing strain, leaving the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), bar top producer Saudi Arabia, pumping almost flat out to meet demand. 																								Oils price surge has alarmed consuming nations worried that economic growth could suffer. So far the fears appear to have proved unfounded.																								Allowing for inflation, prices are about half those during the oil price shock that followed the 1979 Iranian revolution. Crude averaged $78 a barrel during 1980 when adjusted for inflation to 2002 prices, according to oil major BP. Crude in money-of-the-day averaged $35.69 a barrel in 1980, BP said.																								Apparently $40 crude isnt such a big deal after all, because no one seems to care in terms of consumption, said Katherine Spector, analyst at JP Morgan in New York.																								A lack of supply infrastructure to cope with rising energy demand has done much to create the conditions for a price spike that has added 27 per cent to the cost of crude this year.																								Transnefts Vainshtok said Russian exports, dominant in non-Opec supply growth over the last five years, could go no higher without government permission for new export routes.																								We are not meeting the demand of our oil companies ... and we cannot solve the problem without building new pipelines, Vainshtok said.																								In the United States refineries are struggling to make enough of new green grades fuel grades ahead of peak US summer holiday driving demand.																								US gasoline demand, about 45 per cent of world gasoline consumption, is booming at more than 3 per cent this year because of the growing numbers of low-mileage-per-gallon sports utility vehicles on Americas highways. Runaway Chinese consumption has sucked away supplies from other regions and eroded Asias cushion of spare refining capacity. More than 1,000 new cars hit the roads of Chinese capital Beijing each day as vehicle ownership widens.																								Concern that Islamic militants could target oil infrastructure in West Asia has steepened oils surge.

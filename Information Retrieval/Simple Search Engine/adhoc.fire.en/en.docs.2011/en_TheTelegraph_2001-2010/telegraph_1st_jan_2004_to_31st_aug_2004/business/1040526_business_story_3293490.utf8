New Delhi, May 25: The Indian unit of automaker DaimlerChrysler AG will take another seven months to complete the feasibility study for introducing Actros, a 40-tonne multi-axle truck, in the country. By December, we expect to be in a position to decide on whether to launch this commercial vehicle, said Suhas Kadlaskar, finance director at DaimlerChryslers Indian unit.																								We are doing a feasibility study and carrying out homologation tests at the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), he said. The pricing of Actros would be decided at a later stage.																								DaimlerChrysler, the worlds biggest commercial vehicle manufacturer, has sold around 2.6 lakh units of Actros trucks and tractor trailers ever since its global launch in 1996.																								The Volvo experience has shown that there is a demand for higher-end buses and trucks, he said. Money has been never an issue in this country. It was always there, Kadlaskar said. However, a change in attitude has helped us market our products and made us all the more bullish on the country, he added.																								DaimlerChrysler India, which assembles the C, E and S-class Mercedes Benz sedans at a plant in Pune, today launched the 270 CDI sedan sporting a sticker price of Rs 38.45 lakh and powered by a 2.6-litre diesel engine.																								Kadlaskar said the automaker expects to sell around 800 units of E-class sedans in 2004, up from 660 units sold in the past year.

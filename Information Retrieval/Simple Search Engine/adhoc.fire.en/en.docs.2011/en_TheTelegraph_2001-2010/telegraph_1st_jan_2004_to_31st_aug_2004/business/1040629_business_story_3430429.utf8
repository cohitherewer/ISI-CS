 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Tax-breaks blip on TV screen
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 28: Television makers are seeking tax breaks in the budget and have demanded a composite value-added tax (VAT) of 17 per cent by combining central and state taxes.																								 We hope that the government will not shelve the introduction of VAT across all the states effective from April 1, 2005, says Suresh Khanna, secretary general of the Consumer Electronics Television Manufacturers Association (Cetma).																								The association says 17 per cent VAT will put India at par with countries such as European Union, China, Nepal and Bangladesh.																								At present, there is a Cenvat of 16 per cent on almost all consumer-electronic products. In addition, state governments charge sales tax and other taxes. There was a proposal to introduce state VAT with effect from April 1, 2003 but it was shelved.																								The growth of the consumer-electronics industry has been hampered due to high prices of consumer-electronic products in the country. The domestic market for CTV is only 8 million sets and exports less than 1 million sets. Compared to this, Chinas domestic market for CTV is 40 million sets and exports of CTV sets are more than 15 million, says Cetma.																								Other demands include abolition of central sales tax and reduction of customs duty on consumer-electronic products and its inputs.																								Industry officials claim that high customs duty on critical components such as colour picture tubes, glass parts, tape deck mechanism at peak rate of 20 per cent only increases the overall price of the product.																								We recommend that customs duty on all consumer-electronic products and its inputs be brought down to 10 per cent in this years budget, the association says.																								There is also a demand to bring down customs duty on other raw materials to zero per cent. At present, duties on plastics, aluminium, copper, steel, lead and zinc vary between 10-20 per cent.

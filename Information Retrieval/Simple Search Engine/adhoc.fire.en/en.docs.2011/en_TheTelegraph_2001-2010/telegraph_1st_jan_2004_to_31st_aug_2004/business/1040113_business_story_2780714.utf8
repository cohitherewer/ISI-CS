 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Stocks recoil on poll jitters
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 12: Bourses turned queasy and snapped the three-day winning streak today on fresh sell-off by domestic financial institutions and profit booking by operators. 																								The sensex headed southwards on reports that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee wanted the process of general elections to be completed by April. If that happens, the country would vote six months before schedule.																								A sudden tinge of nervousness appeared immediately after the announcement, although the markets knew that the general elections were being advanced, a Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) broker said.																								The markets were ripe for a correction, said a fund manager. The markets have seen a run-up as third-quarter figures for many companies have surpassed expectations.																								Snapping the three-session gaining streak, the BSE benchmark 30-share index which opened sharply up at 6152.22, later turned weak and gradually moved downwards to the days low at 6037.30 before ending at 6067.76 from last Fridays close of 6119.59, netting a fall of 51.83 or 0.85 per cent. The overall market trend was negative. Losers outnumbered gainers by over two to one in a trading volume of 20.6 crore shares compared with Fridays 27 crore.																								The BSE levying special margins on 135 stocks in the range of 10-25 per cent today also kept sentiments low. Most of the margins were on purchases. It was done mainly to cool the bull spirits reigning in Dalal Street. 																								Market analysts were divided on whether the sentiments will revive tomorrow. Markets are betting that more sops are on the way, some of which may be towards pepping up market sentiments further, said an analyst. It could come with some changes in the derivatives segment, the analyst said.

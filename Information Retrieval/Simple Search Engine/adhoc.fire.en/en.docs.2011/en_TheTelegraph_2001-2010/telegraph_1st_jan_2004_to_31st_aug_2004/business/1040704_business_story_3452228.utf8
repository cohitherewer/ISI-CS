The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Companies Act to be simpler
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Union minister of state for company affairs Prem Chand Gupta (left) in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, July 3: The Companies Act-1956 will be streamlined and a proper monitoring system put in place to protect the interest of small investors. 																								The Companies Act has 700 provisions. However, all 700 are not required in the current scenario. This is putting unnecessary pressure on the registrar of companies (RoC). Some of the provisions are defunct and do not hold any meaning. We would like to bring down the number to below 300, said Prem Chand Gupta, Union minister of state (independent charge) for company affairs.																								Gupta was in the city to address a seminar on corporate governance organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce. 																								His ministry will prepare a concept paper by the end of this month, which will then be circulated among the chambers and other professional bodies. Based on their suggestions the department will come out with the amended Companies Act. It will be done within the shortest possible time, he added.																								The registrars across the country receive around 30 million documents every year as part of the return filing process. These documents have to be kept for five years, he said.																								The ministry also plans to put in place a system of filing returns online. Information about a particular company will be available online.																								The minister assured that the United Progressive Alliance government would try to protect the interest of small investors who have been duped in the last two stock market scams.																								The registrar will keep an eye on the reasons why a particular company wants to increase its authorised capital. We will keep a close watch on the companies. Auditors will have to be alert too, Gupta said.																								Gupta said the time taken by the companies to wind up now  a minimum of two to three years  should be brought down to six to eight months, he said.																								The simplified exit scheme for defunct companies had been closed down on March 31, 2004. However, we will extend it for some time. After that the government will take a tough action against defunct companies who are not keen to strike off their names from RoC, Gupta said.

 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Alarm at sugar price spike
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: Sugar prices have shot up by nearly Rs 200 a quintal in the space of a month.																								The spike in what is considered a politically sensitive commodity  both for farmers who grow cane and have long been demanding higher prices as well as urban consumers  has sent alarm bells ringing in Krishi Bhawan.																								Wholesale prices have gone up from about Rs 1,200 a quintal at the beginning of January to about Rs 1,390 at present, an increase of about 16 per cent in 40 days. The rise looks even sharper when compared with mid-December, when prices ruled at Rs 1,175 a quintal, registering a rise of nearly 20 per cent in two months.																								For the ruling coalition, the price rise represents both an opportunity as well as a danger, said a top official. Cane farmers in the north have been angry with the NDA and Samajwadi Party for not being able to get the sugar mills to release payment arrears due to them. Several bailout packages meant for the sugar sector announced late last year did not really help as hardly any money flowed to the farmers. 																								With the price rise, however, sugar mills that are raking in a windfall are expected to clear dues running into several thousands of crores. 																								This is expected to result in a political bonanza for both NDA, which rules at the Centre, as well as Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, which rules at the state level and has a strong base in the sugar belt of western Uttar Pradesh. Happy farmers may join the feel-good chorus that the ruling coalition has been promoting. 																								However, the flip side is that there will be an impact on retail prices which is expected after 15 days to three, said an official.																								The spurt itself is being attributed to two factors: local punters on the stock market shifting to the commodities market and the expectations of a poorer sugar output during 2003-04. 																								The punting has become heavy after it was realised that low rainfall and pest menaces in sugar-growing districts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu could impact sugar output badly.																								Industry analysts have already started revising downwards sugar output expectations. It is expected to go down to about 160 lakh tonnes from 201 lakh tonnes in 2002-03.

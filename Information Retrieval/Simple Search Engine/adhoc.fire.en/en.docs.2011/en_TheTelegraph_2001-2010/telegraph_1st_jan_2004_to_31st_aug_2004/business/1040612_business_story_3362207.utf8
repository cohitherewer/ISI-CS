 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Bank bonds tied to core projects
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 11: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today allowed banks to float bonds of more than five years provided they have already funded core sector projects. Money raised this way will have to meet the cash reserve ratio or statutory liquidity ratio requirements.																								The central bank had earlier said that there was a need to allow banks to raise longterm resources in a way that helps them meet lending commitments and reduces asset-liability mismatches in the long term. 																								Accordingly, in the annual policy announced last month, the central bank said banks will be allowed to raise long-term bonds with a minimum maturity of five years to the extent of their exposure of residual maturity of more than five years to the infrastructure sector.																								While the long-term bonds will be fully paid, redeemable, unsecured, it should be denominated in rupees, the RBI in a notification.																								While the minimum maturity period of the long-term bonds will be five years, the total amount of long-term bonds issued will not be more than the banks exposure of residual maturity of more than five years to the infrastructure sector at the time of issuing the bonds.																								Moreover, these bonds should be issued in plain vanilla form without call or put option. Though the bonds may be issued with a fixed or floating rate of interest, the latter will be referenced to market-determined benchmark rates. 																								The bonds can be issued if the banks cover infrastructure projects related to roads, including toll road, bridges, railways, ports, airports, inland waterway, water supply, irrigation and water treatment system.

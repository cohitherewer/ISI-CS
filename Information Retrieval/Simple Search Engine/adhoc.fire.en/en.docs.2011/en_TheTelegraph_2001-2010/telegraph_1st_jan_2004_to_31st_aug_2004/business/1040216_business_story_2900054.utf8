		 Monday, February 16, 2004  Q amp;A				 The eternal wait
																																																																																													I had three deposits with Duncan Industries, aggregating Rs 1.4 lakh, which matured between October 2002 and May 2003. In July 2002, I received a letter from the company saying that repayment of fixed deposits had been deferred and would start from June 2003. However, I havent received anything so far, and now wonder whether Ill ever get my money back. I am an old woman who has to look after a physically and mentally retarded son. Could you help?																																																																													Bandana Bhadra, Calcutta
																																																																																													We forwarded your appeal to G. P. Goenka, chairman of Duncan Industries. He said the repayment of fixed deposits could not start due to financial difficulties. Yet, we have in the past paid off people in distress, and would certainly consider the case of Mrs Bhadra, Goenka said. The next tranche of out of turn repayment is likely to take place in March, and Goenka assured that when it happens, his company would certainly pay back a part of your deposits.																																					On behalf of better half																																																																																															My son, who lives in Delhi now, had invested in a post office monthly income plan along with me. Until recently, the post office allowed my husband to collect the interest, but now insists that I personally collect it. I am 60 and suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis in stomach. Being physically challenged, is there a way my husband could collect the interest for me?																																																																													Dipti Mukherjee, Jamshedpur
																																																																																													Its indeed possible to have an agent collect the interest for you, but for a limited period only. For a permanent solution, you should open a savings bank account in the same post office, and have the interest transferred there. All you need to do is issue a standing instruction to the post office to do so. After the interest has been credited to your savings bank account, you could draw a cheque and have your husband collect the money from the post office.																																					Tax rules vary																																																																																															We received a large number of queries seeking clarity on tax deduction at source on withdrawals from the National Savings Scheme (NSS). There were two variants of NSS  NSS 87 and NSS 92. The National Savings Organisation has clarified that the post office could deduct tax on withdrawals from NSS 87, but there is no provision whatsoever for TDS on withdrawals from NSS 92. One could claim refund of the tax deducted at source on withdrawals from NSS 87 (if the income from the scheme is not taxable) by filing income tax return.

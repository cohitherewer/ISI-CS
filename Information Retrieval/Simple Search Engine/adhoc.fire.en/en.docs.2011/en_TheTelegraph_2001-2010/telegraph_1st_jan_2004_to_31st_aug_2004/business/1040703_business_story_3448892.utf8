 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Export growth target set at 16%
																								New Delhi, July 2 (PTI): The government today set the target for growth in exports during 2004-05 at 16 per cent against 12 per cent in the last two years. It aims to boost exports of merchandise goods to $150 billion by 2010.																								The 16 per cent growth would translate into exports of $73.4 billion, an official release said here.																								Indian exports had crossed $50 billion-mark in 2001-02 and $60 billion-mark in 2002-03.																								With the emerging international trading scenario, renewed efforts to promote exports and expanding opportunities of Indian goods, the target for growth of merchandise exports for 2004-05 appears to be well within reach, it said.																								Earlier, commerce secretary Dipak Chatterjee had held a meeting with representatives of various export promotion councils, commodity boards and other bodies for fixing the annual export target and drawing the action plan for 2004-05.																								The Federation of Indian Export Organisations, however, said a 16 per cent growth was not enough for the country to grab at least 1 per cent of world-trade.

 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Levi Strauss sews up plan to source more
 VIVEK NAIR				 	 SIZE MATTERS																								Mumbai, May 2: Levi Strauss, US-based makers of the popular Levis jeans, is looking at expanding its outsourcing portfolio from India.																								Sources said the apparel major may soon include semi-formals in its current portfolio comprising denim and casual clothing.																								Industry analysts said a team of two officials visited the city to explore the possibility of sourcing semi-formals, which may include trousers, blazers and party suits.																								The team had also visited Raymond Ltd, a worsted suitings and apparel major. Speaking to The Telegraph, a senior Raymond official said the company may initially source small quantities of semi-formals from the country and that the quantity may go up over the next few years.																								Levi Strauss products include Levis, Dockers and Levi Strauss Signature brands. The company is spread across three geographic divisions, including the Americas, Europe, West Asia and Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.																								Dockers is now a major brand in the khaki trousers category and the Signature brand, launched last year, includes a collection of denim and non-denim pants, shirts, skirts and jackets.																								Sources said the recent interest shown by majors like Levis indicates the prominent role India is set to play in the global textile scenario with the disbanding of quotas early next year. 																								Global buyers like Wal-Mart, Target and JC Penney have indicated their desire to step up sourcing from India. Availability of raw materials, well-integrated operations in the textile chain, skilled personnel and competitive costs will attract international players.																								In a bid to capture the vast potential in the post-quota era, Raymond is in the middle of a Rs 200-crore expansion programme to set up two manufacturing units for apparel and denim wear and expand the capacity of its existing denim units. The company is also focusing on a superior technology at its plants in addition to vertically integrated operations  a move towards creating a base for global markets.																								An official said many global players were surprised at the superior technological processes deployed in its units and the quality of garments produced here.

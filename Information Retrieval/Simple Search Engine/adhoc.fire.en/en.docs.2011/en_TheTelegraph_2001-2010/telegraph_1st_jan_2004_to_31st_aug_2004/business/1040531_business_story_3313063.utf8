 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Pan-Asian dimension to flight of foreign funds
 SATISH JOHN 																								Mumbai, May 30: Foreign funds have not been selling in India alone, but elsewhere in Asia as well. Having dumped Indian shares worth $3.8 billion so far this month, they have scaled down investments in other parts of Asia. 																								This is a break from the past 12 months when foreign institutions mopped up shares worth $10 billion in India. Until the last few days of May, they sold stocks valued at a whopping Rs 3,436 crore ($780 million). This is the first time that foreigners have taken a bearish view of the Indian equity market. Last year, they were big believers in the Indian economy, investing Rs 45,000 crore ($10 billion). This calendar year, they have pumped in Rs 16,016 crore ($3.5 billion), and now own a fifth of Indias leading firms. 																								Only in Thailand have foreign investors been selling for the past nine months. According to UBS Investment Research, outflows from Hong Kong and China slowed down in May. In Taiwan, foreign investors have sold nearly $2,671 million and in Malaysia, they pulled out $3,782 million from stocks this month. In Singapore, they have sucked out of $60 million.																								Its not India alone that is bearing the brunt. While the surprise election results may have played a role in India, foreigners are now waiting for the budget before deciding on the future course, an analyst said.

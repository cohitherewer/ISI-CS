 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ford India managing director David Friedman unveils Endeavour in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: Ford India has set a 45 per cent growth target for the current financial year which, if achieved, will raise the sales of Ikon from 18,500 units to over 27,000 units.																								The company has also set a target of exporting over 24,000 Ikons to countries like Mexico and South Africa.																								According to Ford India managing director David Friedman, Ikon has a complete range in the mid-sized car segment to suit the needs of customers.																								This is the reason why we are always ahead of the industry growth rate every year, he said.																								Friedman said Ford has no plans of increasing the prices of Ikon, its best selling car, despite hike in steel prices. The company was making best efforts to control costs by achieving economies of scale. Starting this month, Ford had started the second shift to cater to increasing demand. 																								According to Friedman, the companys constant endeavour to increase the localisation content has helped Ford to keep costs under control. At present, Ikon has a localisation level of around 90 per cent. This itself gives customers a great level of satisfaction, he said.																								Last week, Ford India had introduced a new line up of Ikons with a starting price tag of Rs 4.56 lakh.																								With new additions, a mid-sized car is now available at the price of a small car. We expect a large volume sales among customers who are currently having small cars, he said.																								The car major recently introduced its premium sports-utility vehicle (SUV) Ford Endeavour in India. Altogether 1300 units of Endeavour have already been sold and, according to Friedman, the company has a 45 per cent market share in the countrys SUV segment.																								Friedman said the company is looking at various segments to introduce new models. He did not even rule out the possibility of bringing in a small car.

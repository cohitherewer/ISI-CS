 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Ficci floats 5-year plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 5: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) today unveiled its economic agenda for the next five years.																								With elections round the corner, we hope that many of our suggestions will be included in the manifestos of political parties. This will help us pursue our agenda once the new government is formed, Ficci president Y. K. Modi said.																								According to the chamber, a 10-per cent gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be achieved in 2006-07 and will reach 11.1 per cent in 2008-09.																								An annual average 10 per cent growth in GDP in the next five years will more than double the growth rate of per capita income in real terms. This will help reduce poverty levels by 10-15 percentage points, close to 10 per cent levels, said Modi.																								Ficci feels that positive public sector savings and larger household savings from higher per capita income should be encouraged to boost savings rate. Innovative instruments have to be introduced to mop up these savings, said Modi.																								On employment generation, the chamber said a higher GDP growth and labour reforms will help add 6 crore jobs in the next five years and reduce unemployment levels from 9.2 per cent in 2002 to 2.9 per cent in 2009.																								The chamber has suggested allowing industry to replace non-performers and amend the Contract Labour (Regulation amp; Abolition) Act, 1970.																								Introduction of value-added tax (Vat) should be expedited so that the country can become a single market.																								The chamber has also suggested an alternative model for divestment. According to the chamber, the government may consider prior selling of a controlling stake to a strategic investor, which could then be followed by a public offer.																								The chamber has also suggested making tourism a concurrent subject which would enable rationalisation of the current high tax structure. The other priority areas are education, housing and urban development, infrastructure, environment, agriculture and agro-processing, health and governance and government reforms.

 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 ONGC bets on new find
 S. P. S. PANNU 																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is pinning high hopes on its Lapligaon oilfield in Assam where it expects the crude oil output to go up from 250 million tonnes per day to anywhere between 400 to 500 tonnes per day in the next two years.																								ONGC director (exploration) Y. B. Sinha told The Telegraph today that the field was turning out to be a decent mid-sized one and ONGC plans to drill more wells to step up the crude output. The field is expected to eventually produce around 2,500 barrels of oil a day. 																								Oil has been struck in the east Lakhi Bari field and the single well is producing 25 tonnes per day. 																								Sinha said the Panidihing field would soon be going back on stream as the problems related to the heavy oil that was found there have been resolved and it would start producing 100 tonnes per day. 																								These fresh finds being developed by ONGC are expected to come as a short in the arm for the Assam hydrocarbon sector as crude oil output in the state has been stagnating at 5 million tonnes per annum from its ageing fields. 																								However, the law and order situation in the state continues to trouble the oil companies and frequent bandh calls also disrupt production.

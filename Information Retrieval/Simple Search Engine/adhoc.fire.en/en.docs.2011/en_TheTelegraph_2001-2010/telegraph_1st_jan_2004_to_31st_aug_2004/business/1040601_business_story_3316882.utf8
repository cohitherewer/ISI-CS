The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Steel prices reverse route, hit the skids after two years
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA About turn Calcutta, May 31: Steel prices, which had shot through the roof just a few months back until a government intervention cooled it, have plunged dramatically over the past week as uncertainty over the economy deepens.																								In a U-turn from the uninterrupted upswing over the past two years, prices have fallen across all categories, but the decline has been more pronounced in long-steel items.																								Industry sources say semi-finished (semis) and construction-grade steel products have become cheaper by Rs 2500-3000 per tonne over the past few days.																								The sudden fall has taken everybody in the industry by surprise because the reasons are unknown. But everyday, the prices are falling by a few hundred rupees across all product categories, they added.																								Many in the industry are struggling to explain the decline, but a large section reckons it is because of fears that many large core sector projects launched by the previous government may be halted in their tracks. Most of these plans, like highways, require steel.																								Billets, which were beyond our reach only a couple of weeks back, are now selling at Rs 3000 less per tonne. While this will benefit re-rollers, producers like Steel Authority of India (SAIL) face losses, sources said.																								A senior SAIL executive, however, said the company does not see any problem arising out of falling prices of billet and pencil ingots in the market. There is still heavy demand for our products and whatever we are producing, is being sold out, he added.																								Steel Authority of Indias plants in Durgapur and Bhilai are the major makers of billets. 																								In recent months, re-rollers had been railing against the rising price of billets. But now, they have cooled off and the re-rollers are, at least for sometime, heaving a sigh of relief.																								The SAIL official said though hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel prices have not trod water, continued weakness in long products could depress flat steel rates.																								The fall in prices of semis, like billets and pencil ingots, has spilled over to products like TMT bars and angles, which have been going for less over the past three days.																								Sources say the local wholesale steel and iron markets reeled under a fall in demand from stockists fearing a tail-off in construction activity and road projects. 																								Stockists reduced offtake due to slowdown and the situation may continue for another week or so, until the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government settles down, they added.																								The SAIL official shrugged off the slide as a temporary phenomenon, saying there was little to suggest that the decline in steel prices will be a long-term trend. 																								The first-quarter weakness is something that happens every year, but once economic activity picks up in the subsequent months, prices have been seen to rise steadily, he said.

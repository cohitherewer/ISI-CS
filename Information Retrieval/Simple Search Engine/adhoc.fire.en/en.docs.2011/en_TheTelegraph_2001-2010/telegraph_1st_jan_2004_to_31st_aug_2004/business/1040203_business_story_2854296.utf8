 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ambani: Focus on efficiency 																								Mumbai, Feb. 2: Key players in the gas sector today called for more reforms and a regulatory system aimed at efficiency.																								Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said Indias quest for energy would give rise to new economic and strategic challenges. 																								He was speaking at the second Asia Gas Buyers Summit organised by Gail India Limited and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) here today.																								While the challenge here would be to deliver energy at competitive costs to the final consumer, it is gas that presents an irresistible option in this context, he said.																								Ambani, whose company was successful in discovering gas reserves in the Krishna-Godavari basin, called for a regulatory system aimed at efficiency through a competitive supply of gas. According to him, such a reform should proceed in parallel with electricity sector reforms.																								Gail chairman and managing director Proshanto Banerjee said an investment of about $10-11 billion in the gas sector was expected in the next 5-7 years. 																								Putting a regulatory mechanism in place to facilitate market growth apart from development and optimal utilisation of gas transmission infrastructure will be key factors under consideration, he added.																								A major shift from oil and gas in the energy mix is in the offing, Ambani said. 																								He pointed out that from a supply standpoint, the centre of gravity of world energy will shift from West Asia to Russia, central and southeast Asia. On the other hand, from a demand standpoint, the focus will now shift from North America to India and China.																								More gas discoveries are expected in Bangladesh, Myanmar and India. Apart from gas, the coal basins of India and China hold promises of coal bed methane reserves.																								With India projected to become the third largest economy in the next 30-50 years, the Reliance Industries chief said this will make the country one of the largest energy markets in the world. 																								India, whose current energy consumption is around 315 million tonnes of oil equivalent, should be targeting an energy demand of over 2,000 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2020.																								Speaking on the occasion, Union petroleum and natural gas minister Ram Naik said the role of gas in the countrys energy scene, limited by restricted supplies till now, is set to increase at a faster pace.																								He added that the share of gas is projected to increase from the current level of 7 per cent to 20 per cent in the energy basket by 2024-25. 																								LNG projects, new discoveries in Indian basins and offshore supplies along with the development of a national gas pipeline grid is expected to fuel the rapid growth of the natural gas market.

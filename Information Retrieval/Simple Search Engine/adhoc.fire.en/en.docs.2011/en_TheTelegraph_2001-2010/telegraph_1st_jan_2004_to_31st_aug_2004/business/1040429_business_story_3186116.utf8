 SATISH JOHN				 	 Munjee: Looking ahead																								Mumbai, April 28: IDFCs recent loss could well be the gain for Indian cities. 																								Nasser Munjee, the former CEO and managing director of Infrastructure Development Finance Company, is on a two-month sabbatical as he contemplates his future.																								Brushing away questions on whether he jumped the gun by putting in his papers at IDFC along with other senior directors, Munjee says there was a systematic plan on the merger of State Bank with IDFC. After the resignations created a furore, the finance ministry and SBI have denied any such plan. 																								Of course, they were serious, he ripostes. 																								The IDFC we built from scratch, has changed, he rues. And he isnt sure whether the senior executives at IDFC who took back their resignations later would continue for long. 																								The criticism that IDFC was not a pro-active lender makes him bristle. What were the banks doing? Ill challenge whoever says that I was very conservative in lending money to infrastructure projects. Let them sit across the table and tell me what I should have done that I did not do, he argues. For some of the banks, the largest chunk of income comes from treasury operations, Munjee points out. However, 90 per cent of IDFCs income was lending to infrastructure projects, he contends.																								Munjee (52), who has spent 26 years in corporate boardrooms, is using the time to reflect and take life easy. The big question on Munjees mind is whether he should pursue a corporate career at all.																								He is mulling the option of running an infrastructure consultancy firm, an area in which he is well versed after captaining IDFC since the inception of the institution. It was IDFC that charted the revenue sharing methodology for telecom companies, which has been a huge success story. 																								He expects similar stories to emerge in power  again an idea emanating from IDFC that power generating companies should be given opportunities to distribute power directly to consumers instead of selling to loss-making state electricity boards. 																								Why do you think the Reliance group and the Tatas are putting up huge power plants in Uttar Pradesh, he asks. Its simply because they can distribute what they generate. As the country deregulates in sectors like airports, ports and logistics, even these sectors could well see a lot of growth. Theres so much work that can be done in infrastructure, Munjee says. 																								Munjees next call could well be to look at cities, urban development or the development of hill towns. I have done work on Mumbai under the aegis of Bombay Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry and also in Goa.																								There are huge gaps in India Shining. Tell me, which city is shining? Its a disgrace. Urban transport, sanitation etc. We cannot give people more than four hours of water supply, he said. Where are our town planners today? Who is designing our cities? Look at Shanghai. Its an incredible transformation of living conditions. It took nearly $40 billion of investment in Shanghai, to act as a catalyst. You must create jobs around cluster cities. Whats San Francisco without the Bay bridge. Look at Express highway (Mumbai-Pune). The surrounding area around the roads are barren, he says.																								Growth could be 20 per cent, year on year, says Munjee who feels that special economic zones, not the export zones the government has planned, is the way forward.																								Why cant government be proactive? Every country has transformed its cities. Somebody has to break this complacence, he feels. He could well be the man suited for the job, with his background and competence, friends close to him say. 																								Mumbai is still 60 per cent slums. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta can do a lot to generate employment. They provide phenomenal markets, he adds. The old paradigm that India is a agricultural country will just not do, as the unemployed migrate to cities for jobs.

 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Reductions drag down markets
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 23: Steel stocks tanked 2-8 per cent on the bourses today on fears that price cuts will hit their bottomlines.																								Yesterday, Tata Steel (Tisco) had slashed prices by Rs 2,000 per tonne. Essar Steel, Jindal Vijaynagar Steel and SAIL followed suit today.																								The setback in the steel counters pulled down the sensex by 31 points. Standard amp; Poors revised positive outlook on Indias long-term foreign currency rating could not cheer things up.																								Tisco lost Rs 14.55 or 5.6 per cent to Rs 245.15. SAIL plummeted by Rs 2.85 or 7 per cent to Rs 37.50 and Jindal Iron and Steel Company declined by over 4 per cent or Rs 11.35 to Rs 238.40.																								The sensex opened steady at 5064.42 and later fluctuated in a range of 5080.22 and 5022.29 before ending the day at 5033.69 against last Fridays close of 5064.66, a net loss of 30.97 points or 0.61 per cent.																								Analysts, who were caught unawares by Tiscos move, feel the markets are likely to extend their bearish call to steel shares over the next few days. Most of these shares have seen a substantial run-up in their values due to firm product prices and robust domestic and overseas demand. 																								SAIL posted a net profit of Rs 2510 crore in 2003-04 .																								However, some feel that the share prices of Tata Steel and SAIL may recover from their present levels as the price reductions would not have a major bearing on their margins.

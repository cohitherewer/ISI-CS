 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 PTC to ink purchase deals with captive units
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 25: Power Trading Corporation of India is in talks with a number of captive units to purchase power even as it has signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with a number of domestic and foreign generators.																								We are in talks with a number of captive plants for buying 5,0007,000 MW of power at different time and a number of them have already responded, chairman and managing director Tantra Narayan Thakur said here today.																								Thakur, who was in the city to announce the companys initial public offer (IPO), said it was estimated that at least 10,000 MW of surplus power was available with captive units at various points.																								We have received responses from about 80 to 100 such units and are planning to start negotiating the rates. Initially, we will hold talks for a minimum capacity of 50 MW till a clear picture emerges. Then we can come out with a fixed rate, he said.																								Thakur said domestic captive units were generating about 25,000 MW of power, of which 10,000 MW remained unused. Prior to the Electricity Act 2003, it was difficult to purchase power from these units for trading as it required the respective state governments permission, he added.																								Commenting on the MoUs, Thakur said they had entered into power purchase agreements for about 3,000 MW with upcoming independent companies, including Australian firm Snowy Mountain Engineering Company for 715 MW in Nepal.																								Power Trading Corporation will sell shares through the 100 per cent book-building method at a price band of Rs 14-16 per share of the face value of Rs 10. The IPO opens on March 1 and closes on March 8.

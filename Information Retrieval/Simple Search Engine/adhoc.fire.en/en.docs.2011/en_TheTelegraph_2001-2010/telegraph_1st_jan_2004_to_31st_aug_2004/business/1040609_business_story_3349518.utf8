 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Coking coal crunch crimps steel output
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Metal misery 																								Calcutta, June 8: A severe scarcity of coking coal has hit the domestic steel industry, resulting in a sharp drop in production, particularly in public sector companies, during the first two months of the current financial year.																								Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) have suffered losses of over 12 per cent in production in April-May compared with their performance in the year-ago period.																								SAIL, which bounced back into the black with a record profit in 2003-04, has suffered a production loss of over 13 per cent at 1.47 million tonnes compared with 1.66 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year.																								Among the four SAIL plants, the biggest loser is Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP), whose production has gone down to 5.53 lakh tonnes in April-May compared with 6.71 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period.																								Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP), which also makes long products, has suffered a production loss of about 30,000 tonnes  from 2.59 lakh tonnes in April-May 2003 to 2.3 lakh tonnes in the first two months this financial year.																								Only Bokaro Steel Plant, which primarily makes flat products, posted a marginal growth of 4.92 lakh tonnes against 4.84 lakh tonnes in the first two months last year.																								Industry sources said the production performance in June is equally disheartening with the coal crisis far from being resolved.																								RINL has also suffered a 19 per cent loss in hot metal production in April-May at 5.85 lakh tonnes against 6.97 lakh tonnes in April-May 2003.																								The liquid steel production, however, remained at 5.6 lakh tonnes compared with 5.76 lakh tonnes in the corresponding period last year.																								The coal crisis has come at a time when both public sector companies are poised for good growth because of a strong demand, an industry analyst said.																								Both companies, which are on the lookout for coal mines abroad, expect the coal crisis to blow over by the end of next month.																								Meanwhile, SAIL has enlisted a private producer to convert iron ore into sponge iron. It is also make up for the fall in output by using coal dust and coal tar as alternative fuels. RINL, too, is trying these strategies, albeit on a reduced scale, to carry on production.																								Various private players like Usha Steel Ltd are forced to either drastically reduce production or shut down the factories due to the crisis.																								An industry-level delegation is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to press for a system under which the Indias iron ore can be swapped for foreign coking coal.

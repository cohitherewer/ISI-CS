 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 New Intel chips for cellphones
																								San Francisco, April 12 (Reuters): Intel Corp, the worlds biggest maker of microchips, is freshening up its money-losing communications business with a new set of chips for cellphones, days ahead of its quarterly earnings report.																								The Santa Clara, California-based company plans to introduce chips that will allow video conferencing on mobile phones and DVD-quality video playback on handheld devices. The new chips aim to inject some life into Intels communications business, which lost $858 million last year.																								Intel combined its communications and data networking businesses last year after failing to gain traction in the fiercely competitive mobile phone chip business. Texas Instruments Inc is the largest supplier of cellphone chips.																								Intel executives have blamed the units losses partly on the slower-than-expected roll-out of speedy wireless data connections, as well as the video and messaging services that take advantage of that speed.																								Advances in wireless broadband demand a new kind of wireless device, said Sean Maloney, the Intel executive vice-president who last year took command of the companys newly combined communications group, in a statement. 																								Analysts have turned more optimistic on Intels first-quarter results, but for an altogether different reason. Dell Inc, Intels biggest customer, last week tacked on another $200 million to its quarterly revenue forecast in response to strong demand for data-serving business computers and storage systems. 																								We believe that Dells comments support our positive stance on Intel, as Dells improved outlook implies signs of an improved (information technology) spending environment  an important element to our favourable rating on Intel, wrote Prudential Equity Group analyst Mark Lipacis in a recent note to clients.

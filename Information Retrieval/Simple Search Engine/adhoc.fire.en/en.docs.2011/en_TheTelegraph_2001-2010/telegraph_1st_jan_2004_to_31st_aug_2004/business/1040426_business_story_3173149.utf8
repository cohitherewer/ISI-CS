 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Rupee rise drives up Santro prices
																								Bangalore, April 25 (PTI): Hyundai Motor India Ltd will raise the prices of its flagship model, Santro, next month as the input costs have increased due to the appreciation of the rupee in recent times. 																								The prices of steel have risen 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent due to appreciation of the rupee. We may increase the prices from May, Hyundai Motor India president B. V. R. Subbu told newspersons here on Saturday at the launch of Hyundais luxury sedan, Elantra.																								He said prices of Accent have already been increased recently taking into account the rupee appreciation, which the company has pegged at 44 to a dollar.																								Hyundai would be completing its plant expansion by July to manufacture 2.5 lakh units of cars, up from the existing capacity, Subbu said.																								We are aiming at a production level of 2.1 lakh units, of which 72,000 cars are for the export market compared with last financial years (2003-04) production of 1.72 lakh units, including 42,000 units which were exported, he said.																								The 1.72 lakh units production last fiscal, was a 53 per cent jump over 1.12 lakh units produced in 2002-03.																								Subbu said Hyundai will produce 12,500 cars per month between April to July and later ramp up the production to 21,000 units every month.																								He said the company is aiming to launch Getz, a car positioned between Santro and Accent, in July which will make Hyundai have a complete range of cars for the domestic market.

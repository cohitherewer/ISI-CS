 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 UB plans no-frills domestic airline
				 	 Mallya: High hopes																								New Delhi, June 25 (PTI): Competition in the domestic aviation sector has touched the skies with liquor major UB group being the latest entrant. The group said it would launch a low-cost airline by the end of this year with eight Airbus aircraft.																								The UB group, known for its Kingfisher brand of beer, plans to make an initial investment of Rs 150 crore to launch the carrier with a countrywide reach, group chief Vijay Mallya told reporters after an hour-long meeting with civil aviation minister Praful Patel here today.																								We may file for a scheduled operator licence next week, Mallya said, adding the group already has a licence to fly smaller aircraft as a non-scheduled operator. He said the eight aircraft would be inducted in phases and the airline would be headquartered in Bangalore.																								Though we will be filing the application stating that we would operate eight A-320s, we are also evaluating other options, said Mallya, a Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka.																								The proposed airline would also operate on major trunk routes. It will be a low-cost, no-frills airline, but a great experience, he said.																								The launch of this carrier would give a tough competition to other scheduled domestic carriers like the Indian Airlines, Jet Airways and Air Sahara.																								We have been planning this airline way in advance and these discussions (with the minister) were meant to chalk out the modalities, he said.																								Mallya said the equity of the airline would be Rs 30 crore in accordance with the prevailing requirements for launching a national carrier and getting a scheduled operator licence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Call to spot other growth roots
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Lahiri in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture. 																								Calcutta, July 24: The country should gradually reduce its dependence on agriculture to maintain a 7-8 per cent growth rate, Ashok Lahiri, chief economic adviser to the Union ministry of finance, said here today.																								Addressing the members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, Lahiri said the share of agriculture in the gross domestic product of countries like Malaysia and Thailand is only 10 per cent whereas it is still 24 per cent in India.																								This should come down, he said and drew attention to the fact that the sector had not performed satisfactorily and, except for the period between 2001 and 2003, the average annual agricultural growth has been less than 3 per cent.																								Lahiri said the 7-8 per cent growth target set in the budget is conservative but realistic.																								The GDP growth target is realistic if we look into the previous growth patterns achieved by the country during the last few years, Lahiri said.																								According to Lahiri, the previous government of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had set a growth target of 8-10 per cent but in reality actual growth had been somewhere around 6 per cent.																								Although almost two-third of the countrys population is engaged in agriculture, Lahiri said the average growth in this sector for the last 50 years had been just around 3 per cent.																								He said the focus of the Union government will be on infrastructure development and implementation of policies.																								In Japan, it takes two years to plan a policy and 11 days to implement but in India it takes 11 days to plan a policy and 17 years for implementation. 																								Commenting on this years budget, Lahiri said service tax, education cess and the levy on securities transaction should help to generate more revenues.																								Reacting to a point raised by ICC president Anup Singh on education cess, Lahiri said the government will make proper use of the funds generated through the 2 per cent levy.

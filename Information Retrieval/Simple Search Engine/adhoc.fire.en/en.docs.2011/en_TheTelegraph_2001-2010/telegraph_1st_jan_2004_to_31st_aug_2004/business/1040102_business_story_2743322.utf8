 ANIEK PAUL																								Calcutta, Jan. 1: The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has cautioned day traders that its too risky to wait till the last five minutes to square off open positions.																								Heavy traffic in the last ten minutes of trading is slowing down the bourses screen-based platform, admits NSE deputy managing director Chitra Ramkrishna.																								In the stampede at the close of the trading session, order-matching  as execution of trades is called in technical parlance  could take up to five seconds, whereas normally it doesnt take more than a second. And as a consequence, a large number of orders do not get executed before the exchange closes.																								Day traders, or those who play on price movements without taking delivery of stocks, would typically wait till the last few minutes to square off their positions in the hope of getting the best deal. But of late, many have lost heavily for not being able to transmit orders.																								The bourse admits its difficult to cope with the peak-peak traffic in the last 10 minutes. It happens in all exchanges across the world. The surge that we witness in the last ten minutes is bound to slow down the system.																								We are trying our best to maintain normal performance through the entire session, but its best not to wait for the last 10 minutes  its too risky, Ramkrishna said.																								In the last couple of weeks, the NSE has had problems with settlement as well. Brokers complained that the sharp rise in trading volume had delayed pay-outs  or the disbursal of stocks and cash by the exchange. But Ramkrishna differed.																								She said pay-out was late on a couple of days only, and it wasnt due to technical problems at the NSE. Its incorrect to blame the NSE alone. Settlement involves 12 banks and two depositories. There were delays at various levels, and this had a cascading effect.																								The countrys largest exchange, however, is upgrading its technology platform to cope with mounting volumes. The other intermediaries  the clearing banks and depositories  too were fast scaling up their technical capacity to handle volumes, Ramkrishna added.

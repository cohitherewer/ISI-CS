 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Gail sniffs large gas reserves off Digha
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, April 18: Gail and Gazprom are set to start a 3D seismic study in the Bengal basin, 200 km off the Digha coast in Midnapore, after the first phase of exploration showed strong possibility of sizeable gas reserves.																								Sources say the first phase of the study has been very positive, prompting the combine to step up investments in carrying out further studies. Data available so far point to the possibility of big gas reserves. 																								The consortium has hired a seismic vessel from Russian firm SMNG to carry out the second phase of their study. It has been sent to Visakhapatnam for naval clearance, expected to come through any time now.																								Sources said the consortium partners have been enthused by a positive assessment from US consulting firm Petrotel. After the 3D seismic study, we can determine the availability of gas in the area and whether the production there will be viable, they added.																								Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has struck gas in the Contai onshore block but senior officials concluded it might be uneconomic to produce at this level. The company is, however, ready to drill in the same area to find out if the project will be viable. The countrys largest profit-making company will kick off its off-shore oil hunt off Sunderbans in October.																								While ONGC has not been lucky enough in the Bengal basin, Gail is likely to be more fortunate off Digha.																								A Gail official said a major gas find would have a big impact on the industrial profile of the region. Industrial growth in the Haldia and Calcutta will be boosted if commercially viable gas is found off Digha coast.

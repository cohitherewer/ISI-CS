 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Twin code for ports in east still adrift
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Calcutta amp; Haldia ports: Its a number game																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: The shipping ministrys request for two separate customs code numbers for the Calcutta port and the Haldia dock complex on the same lines as the two terminals at Jawaharlal Nehru port (JNPT) has fallen on deaf ears. Such an arrangement would ensure a smoother flow of cargo in the eastern ports, but the customs authorities are not willing to play ball.																								The customs authorities have taken the stand that each port in the country can have only one code number. And since Haldia forms part of the Calcutta port, it cannot be given a separate number and has to be included under the Calcutta code.																								However, the shipping ministry has pointed out that at the port near Mumbai, there are two separate customs code numbers for the JNPT terminal and the Nhava Shiva terminal operated by P amp; .																								The shipping ministrys argument clearly is that sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If JNPT can have two codes, so can Calcutta and Haldia. 																								Senior officials say both the Calcutta port and JNPT are under the administrative control of the shipping ministry. And if the shipping ministry is judging them by the same yardstick, why shouldnt the customs authorities do likewise?																								Sources disclose that shipping secretary D. T Joseph had discussed the issue with the revenue secretary and the matter was expected to be sorted out. However, nothing has come through. The shipping ministry now plans to take up the issue again with their finance ministry counterparts. 																								The particulars about consignments landing at Haldia have to be sought from Calcutta and the traders have to shuttle between the two ports, which wastes time and also increases the red tape involved. 																								The clearance of cargo slows down and this has a cascading effect down the line. The efficiency of the port declines and ships coming into Haldia have to be held up for a longer time.																								If Haldia gets a separate code, it would be much easier and quicker to trace the movement of containers that arrive at the port, which would be listed separately.

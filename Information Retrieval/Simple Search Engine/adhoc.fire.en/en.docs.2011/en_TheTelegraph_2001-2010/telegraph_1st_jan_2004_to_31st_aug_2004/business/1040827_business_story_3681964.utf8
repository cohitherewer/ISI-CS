 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Lodha opens new front in battle with Birlas
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Priyamvada: Her word																								Calcutta, Aug. 26: Rajendra Singh Lodhas lawyers have filed a 1992 document in which Priyamvada Birla is believed to have recorded that her husband, M. P. Birla, died intestate  without drawing up a will.																								Sources close to Lodha say this could prove to be a compelling piece of evidence for the chartered accountant as he questions the legal validity of the joint will Birlas have produced to argue that the couple wanted their assets to go to charity.																								The document dates back to 1992, where Priyamvada clearly mentions that her husband died intestate. It will be used to challenge the joint wills and counter the Birlas claim that she made the will under the influence of Lodha, said a source, adding Lodha came close to the MP Birla group only in the mid-90s. 																								Lodha has also lined up an arsenal of other documents letters and applications written by Priyamvada in various stages of her life. These will be produced in hearings, opening new fronts in his battle with the Birlas over the inheritance of MP Birla group assets, the source said. The case comes up for hearing on August 30 and September 1. For now, the battle is over two probate petitions  one by Lodha and the other by Birlas  and a plea that aims to have caveats filed by the Birlas quashed. There is also a Birla application seeking to rope in two new executors for the 1982 will. 																								It seems that the Lodha camp is in no hurry. This suits Lodha as he will retain control over the MP Birla group. But the Birlas surely want a speedy decision or a temporary order restricting Lodhas control over the assets, observed a legal expert. 																								Khaitan amp; Co, Birlas solicitor, has denied having sought a receiver to look after properties of the MP Birla group.

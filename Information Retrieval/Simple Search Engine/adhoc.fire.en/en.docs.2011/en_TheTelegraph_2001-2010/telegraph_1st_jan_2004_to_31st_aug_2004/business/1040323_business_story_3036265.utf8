 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Bharti-Changi team to bid for airports
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mittal: Aiming high																								New Delhi, March 22 : Telecom giant Bharti Enterprises today announced the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with Singapores Changi Airport to bid for the development and management of Delhi and Mumbai airports. 																								The consortium, a press release issued here said, will work towards the successful bidding and picking up of equity in the airport privatisation initiative undertaken by the government of India.																								Changi Airport is indirectly owned by the Singapore government. Singtel, another Singapore-based firm in which the island nations government has a stake, owns 28 per cent equity in Bharti Telecommunications.																								Interestingly, Singapore International Airlines had bid to set up an airport near Bangalore in collaboration with the Tata group in the 1990s but were thwarted by Opposition lawmakers who raised a plethora of concerns including security issues. 																								However, rules for setting up greenfield airports as well as taking over the management of existing airports in India have changed since then and Singaporeans second coming may well prove more successful. 																								The government is planning to spin off the two major airports into corporations and sell 74 per cent stakes in them to private firms who will bring in investments to upgrade them to world standards. 																								State-run Airports Authority of India will hold the balance 26 per cent, continue running air traffic control and be responsible for airport security.																								Last month, the government had invited preliminary bids for the stakes to be submitted by June 4. Government officials say they expect the airport privatisation to be completed by end-August. Officials said they expect bidders to be able to bring in at least Rs 2,500 crore in investments to upgrade the two airports. 																								Changi Airport, ranked among the best in the world, handled about 25 million passengers last year and has 70 airlines operating more than 3,250 weekly scheduled flights. 																								Bharti is a leading telecom service provider and boasts of some 6.8 million customers.																								Besides the Bharti-Changi consortium others are also believed to be in the race. 																								Industry sources said several global airport management companies, including those running Frankfurt, Heathrow, Vancouver, Kuala Lumpur and Schipol, may join domestic leaders like the Tata group, Aditya Birla group, L amp;T, Hero Honda and realty experts Unitech to bid for Delhi and Mumbai airports.

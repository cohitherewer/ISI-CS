 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Plan to cut demat costs
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 27: An internal group set up by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has recommended changes that could bring down the cost of a demat account.																								The group has suggested that transaction charges should be levied on a small investor on an ad-valorem basis only, instead of the present system of a flat fee structure. 																								The panel has also recommended that since companies have derived largest benefits from dematerialisation, they may be advised to pay a one-time fee to the depository concerned at 0.1 per cent of its market capitalisation. This suggestion, if implemented, could lead to a complete elimination of custody charges to be paid by a retail investor. The panel also said account maintenance and demat charges should not be levied on small investors at all by depository participants. 																								Moreover, as long as the investor is under the demat environment and desires to shift his account from one depository participant to another (owing to some perceived advantages), the investor may be permitted to close his account without any transaction charges or other incidental charges, as being levied currently. The group called upon depositories to give a one-time exemption from account closing fee for switchover from one entity to other. 																								It said while depository participants charge under various heads, there is no uniformity across the entities and certain heads are excessively charged during few occasions. Therefore, there is a need to rationalise this structure, it added.																								With the method of charging depository participants on transactions changing to a flat fee structure, it was largely averred that small investors are overcharged. It was also felt that the charges are beyond the bearable capacity for a few classes of investors. The panel said this system is tilted in favour of affluent and institutional investors who trade in large quantities.																								Custody charges are levied irrespective of the value of shares in custody. As a result, while the value of shares may be getting eroded, investors are required to pay custody charges that at times exceed the value of shares held in custody. Thus the charges paid as percentage of value of their holding is high.

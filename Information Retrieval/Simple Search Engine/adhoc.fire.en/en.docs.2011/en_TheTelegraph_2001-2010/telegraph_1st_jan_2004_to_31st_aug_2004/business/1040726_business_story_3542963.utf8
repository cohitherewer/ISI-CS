 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Last lunge for trade truce in Geneva
 Ploughing through 																								Geneva, July 25 (Reuters): The World Trade Organisation (WTO) makes a final push this week to revive stalled free trade talks, aware a fresh failure could postpone for years any lowering of global barriers to commerce.																								From Tuesday, several trade ministers will join their diplomats in Geneva for a last ditch session of the WTOs executive General Council, which aims for a pact on key areas of the WTO negotiations, known as the Doha Round.																								The blueprint, a first draft of which has triggered fierce criticism from all sides, lays down parameters for future detailed negotiations in farm and goods trade, services and the planned harmonisation of customs practices to curb corruption.																								Success would let work continue during the coming months when the US administration will be distracted by presidential elections and the European Union ushers in a new leadership for its executive body.																								But a further setback, along the lines of the stunning collapse of a ministerial conference last September in Cancun, Mexico, which had been aiming for the same sort of deal, could completely derail the round, with no guarantee momentum would ever return, trade officials say.																								Nobodys vital interests will be put at risk by the deal we are seeking, but everybody will suffer if we do not get it, WTO chief Supachai Panitchpakdi has warned.																								Trade diplomats have been locked in days of negotiations in the run-up to the council meeting, which is due to end by Friday. WTO officials say the deadline cannot be extended.																								The Doha Round, launched in the Qatari capital in late 2001 in the hope of steadying a world economy reeling from the September 11 suicide plane attacks in the US that year, would give a multi-billion dollar boost to global commerce and lift millions out of poverty, according to the World Bank.																								But it has been dogged from the outset by deep differences between rich and poor states, particularly over agriculture, long the most politically sensitive area of trade diplomacy.																								Developing countries and efficient farms goods exporters such as Australia are demanding the July pact commit the richer states to deep and effective cuts in agricultural subsidies which they say deny them markets.																								The current draft, drawn up by Supachai and General Council chairman Shotaro Oshima of Japan, includes the total elimination of farm export subsidies, but is vaguer on other aspects of farm support, particularly on US programmes, critics say.																								This alleged imbalance has sparked the ire of the European Union, the biggest user of direct export subsidies, with France being particularly vocal in demanding a redraft.																								Developing countries say the farm text is still too soft on the rich countries and, in particular, gives them too much leeway to protect whole areas of their agribusiness from sweeping cuts in import tariffs.Nath leaves for meet																								PTI adds: Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath today left for Geneva to participate in the WTO talks on the draft framework for further negotiations in the Doha round. 																								The minister will hold talks with his counterparts from G-20, G-90 and other member countries on the draft for further negotiations in the Doha round, which has been proposed by the General Council.																								Nath held wide-ranging talks with political parties, trade union leaders on the WTO-related issues in the context of the draft before leaving.

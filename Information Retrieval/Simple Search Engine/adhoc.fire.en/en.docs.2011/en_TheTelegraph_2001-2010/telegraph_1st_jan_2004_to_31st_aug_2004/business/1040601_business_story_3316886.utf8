 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 31: The communications ministry wants the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to keep in mind the governments policy to introduce fourth-generation (4G) technology while discussing spectrum issues.																								Trai will soon be informed about the ministrys decision. Communications and information technology minister Dayanidhi Maran has already spelt out his governments commitment to introduce 4G technology.																								Trai today released a consultation paper on efficient utilisation, spectrum allocation, and spectrum pricing. The recommendations are based on 3G technology.																								The regulator asked cellular operators to make efficient use of spectrum due to its limited availability, while suggesting the need to evolve an allocation procedure that holds out technical and pricing incentives.																								The regulator also pointed out that the present cellular networks should improve spectrum utilisation efficiency. This paper has its genesis in the unified licence policy wherein Trai feels the spectrum allocation policy should be distinct from licensing of services.																								The paper discusses the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) methodology for assessing future requirement of spectrum. It lists the options available to gauge technical efficiency, create pricing incentives and encourage re-farming, which is a process of redeploying spectrum from existing users and re-allocating to others. The paper also discusses spectrum surrender, besides mergers and acquisitions. 																								Cellular operators have been allocated spectrum varying from 2 X 2.5 megahertz (MHz) to 2 X 10 MHz. International experience suggests that a greater amount of spectrum has been allocated in other countries.

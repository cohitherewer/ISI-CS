 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Intel chips to end battle for the remote
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 22: The ugly battle for the remote control in homes may just be over.																								Mom, dad and kids can stop fighting each other to watch their favourite soap, soccer match, must-watch movie and music channel simultaneously.																								All thats thanks to Intel, which today introduced two express chipsets  915 G/P and 925X, codenamed Grantsdale and Alderwood  to usher in a range of audio, video and other capabilities found previously only on speciality PCs.																								With these chipsets fitted on to a personal computer and a digital adapter at Rs 3000-6000, consumers can hook on to a TV, computer, laptop, palm top and music system without ugly looking wires scattered around rooms.																								Says Jayant Murty, Intel Indias marketing director, Your wife can watch her favourite serial on the TV; your daughter can watch her favourite movie on the PC; your son can swing to the latest music album on the music system and you can watch your soccer or cricket on your laptop or palm top simultaneously without having to compromise on the quality of audio, video and graphics. 																								Intel aims to offer enhanced digital music, photos, videos and games on PCs and other devices in and around the house. It will also help to drive new applications to boost office productivity, such as simultaneously using multiple monitors with just one PC to work on and track several projects.																								The Express chip sets have a system that enables them to utilise the bandwidth to the maximum capability. 																								The increased bandwidth, coupled with the multitasking of hyper-threading technology, optimises playback and simultaneous recording of high-density video content, allowing a user with a high-density TV turner and appropriate software to watch a movie while recording a television program on a PC.

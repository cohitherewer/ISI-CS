 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Aiwa eyes Rs 100-cr turnover
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 26: Aiwa India has set a target of Rs 100-crore turnover this fiscal on the back of a slew of launches in the personal audio range and a greater penetration in the market.																								Aiwa, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony India, today launched 22 products, including headphone stereos and portable CD and audio players, priced between Rs 690 and Rs 8,990. Prices are crashing. But we will take suitable steps to be competitive, said Prasun Banerjee, divisional head, Aiwa.																								At present, the company is neither looking at a brand nor a price war with other players, he said. At the moment, we just want to create a brand thrust and awareness for ourselves. We are not competing against anybody, he added. 																								While its key competitor in India is Philips, other consumer electronic majors like LG, Samsung, Panasonic and Videocon have managed to garner some market share in the audio segment.																								Aiwas current products include DVD and VCD mini hi-fi systems and DVD players, all of which are imported from Japan. Promoting itself as a brand focused on the youth, it is all set to launch home theatres and MP3 players in a few months.																								Aiwa hopes to contribute 10 per cent to Sony Indias turnover. It plans to spend nearly 10-15 per cent of its annual turnover on advertising and promotional activities. 																								Aiwa, which had exited the Indian market after its unsuccessful tie-up with Baron Electronics in 1998, re-entered the country in October 2003 after being bought over globally by Sony Corp in 2002.

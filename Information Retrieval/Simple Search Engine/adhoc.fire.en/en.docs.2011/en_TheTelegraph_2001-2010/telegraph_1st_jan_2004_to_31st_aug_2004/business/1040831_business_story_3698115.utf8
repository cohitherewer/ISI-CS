 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Trade agreement with Thailand to reap an early harvest
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: If you love imported cars, caviar on toast and crabs with your nasi goreng at your favourite Thai food joint, prepare for a feast of cheap goodies.																								India and Thailand today signed a landmark agreement to eliminate tariffs on 82 items traded between the two countries.																								The goods that figure on this fast track for zero customs duty include auto parts such as gear boxes, television picture tubes, refrigerators, fans, computers and wrist watches.																								Agricultural goods such as wheat, mangoes, grapes and marine products such as salmon, sardines, mackerel and crab have also been included in the list.																								Petrochemicals, such as polypropylene and polyethylene in their primary form, are other major commodity groups on the trade list.																								The protocol for this early harvest scheme, inked by commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath and his Thai counterpart Watana Muangsook, will come into effect from September 1 and forms part of the framework agreement for establishing a free-trade area (FTA) between the two countries by 2010.																								Under the early harvest, the two countries will slash tariffs on these 82 items by 50 per cent from September 1, 2004 and by 75 per cent from September 2005. The customs duty will be reduced to nil on September 1, 2006.																								The early harvest scheme marks the implementation of first phase of the FTA wherein tariffs are reduced on select items. From 2006, both countries will have a duty-free trade regime on 82 items. The second phase of FTA will begin after that for both sides in order to have a free-trade area in place by 2010.																								According to the time-table agreed between the two countries, negotiations for FTA in goods have to be concluded by March 2005 and for services and investment by January, 2006. The framework for establishing FTA was signed on October 9, 2003.																								After the signing ceremony, Kamal Nath admitted that some industry groups harboured fears of the move towards free trade. But, he said, these were unfounded. In the long run, the move towards free trade represents a win-win situation for all, he added.																								However, Indian industry, particularly the automobile sector, is worried over the reduction in tariffs as Japanese manufacturers, who have a base in Thailand, will be able to source their products from there and give local car makers a run for their money.																								Similarly, television manufacturers such as Sony, which also have large manufacturing facilities in Thailand, can use them to import their products from there rather than assemble them here, creating competition for the Korean giants like Samsung and LG.																								Nath, however, said the government was moving towards inverted duty structure as in several other countries, since it was conscious of the high input costs faced by the Indian industry. In the long run, industry would become more competitive and the consumer would benefit.																								He said signing of the protocol marked a historic landmark in Indias look east policy and the agreement would help in increasing the formation of joint ventures and investments in both countries.																								We believe that the agreement would stimulate trade and help in doubling the bilateral trade from the present level of $1.5 billion in the next few years, he said.																								According to the rules of origin, which were finalised during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Bangkok visit last month, there will be provision for 40 per cent value addition at four digit level.																								Also there are special norms for 25 select products on which India had concerns to ensure that goods are not diverted from third countries like China with whom Thailand has a FTA.																								Watana Muangsook also said there were apprehensions by some industrialists on both sides but the agreement was a win-win for both countries as it would make industry more competitive and the consumers would get better products.																								We will commit to work towards the successful conclusion of the India-Thailand FTA in order to further strengthen and deepen the already close and cordial economic relations between our two countries, he added.

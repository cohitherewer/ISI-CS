 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 Heavy drag on growth engine
Laloo Prasad Yadavs railway budget is long on populism and short on economic reality. India needs to prepare for an integrated logistics system with other modes of transport. The railways are now competing with air travel in addition to roadways for both passengers and freight. Coming on the heels of the Rakesh Mohan Committee Report on the railways, Yadav had a golden opportunity to give early signals of a modernised system.Perhaps the one factor that permitted him to leave tariffs untouched was the buoyancy in revenues, which has been achieved due to a relatively high GDP growth during the year. Not touching non-premium passenger fares and leaving freight rates as they are, constrains revenue growth that the railways so desperately need. Freight earnings are projected at a mere Rs 645 crore more than last year at Rs 28,745 crore which will account for increases through the normal growth processes. The railways have huge uneconomic project backlogs that were created with no economic logic but social concern. We continue to add to this rather than consolidate losses and ensure sustainability of the railways in the long run. Another 32 new trains, 18 new lines The emphasis should now be on the three Ss  safety, signalling and speed. Relatively small investments (in relation to huge new projects) in signalling systems would enhance safety, increase frequency and speed. Underinvestment in the railways, extensive and expansive approaches for action rather than intensive and clustered approaches, a refusal to reconnect to other modes of transport, thus creating an integrated transport logistics for the country as a whole, are all elements of a rehash of old techniques of action. Have we ever fixed new problems with old approaches? Commercialisation of the railways, bringing in private service delivery from operations to maintenance to catering to station management, exploiting the real estate wealth, new approaches to infrastructure investment and management as opposed to operating stock operating trains and the relative roles of the private and public sectors for both are now crucial elements of the debate for the future. Have we seen any of this in the railways plan of action? Perhaps it is in the fine print to be passed over lightly. Unfortunately, that is the real story. The sooner we begin to put the horse before the cart, the sooner will we begin to make some progress.(Nasser Munjee is the former MD of IDFC and a member of the expert group on Indian Railways)

 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Reforms to stay: India Inc 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 11: India Inc reckons that reforms will stay on course no matter which coalition storms to power at Raisina Hill  as long as it is stable. Industry barons reacted with equanimity to the prospect of a non-NDA coalition emerging at the Centre and felt that no matter which dispensation came to power, reforms would not be nixed.																								Irrespective of the final complexion of the government that comes to power, there is no looking back on the reforms agenda. Today, all Asian markets have crashed 5 per cent and this has had an impact on Indian markets as well. Even if there is a hung Parliament for a short span of time, the Indian economy is strong and resilient enough to get over the hump, said . Srinivasan, director-general (designate), Confederation of Indian Industry.																								Reacting to the results of the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, where the TDP (a key ally of the ruling NDA at the Centre) has lost, Amit Mitra, secretary-general of Ficci, said, The message is clear. Economic reforms in the services and the infotech sectors should be also implemented in agriculture, food processing and rural industries.																								He said water in the Rayalseema region should have been used to create food processing industries and chemical clusters were needed in the state.																								Mitra said, The setback to the TDP in the polls does not mean that the electorate is against knowledge-based industries. But such initiatives should continue along with rural development quot;.																								There were a few, however, who felt the NDA ought to return to power. Bajaj Auto CMD Rahul Bajaj said the choice was very simple. We would prefer the NDA to come back because of the good experience that the corporate sector has had with the reforms process. However, even if the NDA does not come back, it will not stall reforms in any way. But there are chances that it might slow down overall privatisation and labour reforms.																								Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD of Biocon India, said, No matter which party assumes the wheel it will only steer the reforms initiative forward. There is no way one could even think of meddling with it. We need to have a can-do-it attitude.																								Some are apprehensive about the possibility of the third front coming to power. Adi B. Godrej, chairman of the Godrej Group, said, If any coalition takes the support of parties who are not in favour of the reform process, then the little beginning will further see a slowdown.

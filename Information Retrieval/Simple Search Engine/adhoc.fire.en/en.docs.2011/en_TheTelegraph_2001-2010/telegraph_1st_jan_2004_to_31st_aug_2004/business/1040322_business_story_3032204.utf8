 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Storm over new Andaman port
 S. P. S. PANNU Veneer of calm 																								New Delhi, March 21: The shipping ministry is toying with the idea of establishing a transhipment port at Great Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal. It is reliably learnt that the issue was discussed at a high-level meeting recently.																								Sources say it was decided that the feasibility of the project could be examined after the Andaman and Nicobar Island administration obtains clearances from the defence ministry.																								However, it could be tough to get these clearances as the Andaman Islands also form the base of the countrys only tri-services command and is considered strategic from the countrys defence standpoint. Contingents of the navy, air force and army are stationed on the Andaman islands under a unified command on the lines of the US.																								Around 42 per cent of the world trade is routed via the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with China and Japan alone accounting for over $300 billion. At present, Singapore is the hub for international shipping in the area. Even Indian cargoes are often transhipped through Singapore as the big mother ships find it quicker to dock and turn around for the port. The shipping ministry sees scope for attracting part of this business to an Indian port.																								However, the Indian defence establishment is not comfortable with the entry of foreign vessels around the Andamans. It has, in fact, been opposing the entry of foreign companies for oil exploration in the offshore area of the Andaman Islands. The Indian Navy is of the view that any oil exploration in these waters should be taken up by ONGC and senior officials should be present on the oil rigs. 																								It made it clear to the national oil companies that the permission of the navy would have to be taken before any foreign vessel was hired by them for undertaking drilling in the area.																								In fact, an oil exploration block was put up for auction in the latest round through international bidding only after petroleum minister Ram Naik had discussions with defence minister George Fernandes.

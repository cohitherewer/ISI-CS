 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Air France-KLM merger set for takeoff
				 	 Ready to touch the sky																								Brussels, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Air France, nearly grounded in a miss with bankruptcy a decade ago, was cleared by Brussels and Washington on Wednesday to take over Dutch KLM and create the worlds highest-flying airlines group by revenue.																								The airlines agreed to give up take-off and landing slots on flights involving three continents, allaying European Commission competition concerns about what it called the first real merger in the European airline industry.																								Air France is spearheading a move toward consolidation in Europes crowded airline sector, hoping to tap economies of scale and expand as the European Union prepares to grow from 15 to 25 nations in May. 																								The new Air France-KLM combination will move ahead of Japan Airlines System Corp as the largest airlines group by revenue and rank third behind AMR Corps American Airlines and UAL Corps United Airlines in passenger traffic. The new carrier will give up 94 single slots daily with each round trip accounting for four slots, two each for landing and arrival.																								This will enable rival airlines to start a service where competition would have been eliminated or significantly reduced, the Commission said.																								Air France shares rose 1.79 per cent to 15.39 on Wednesday, while KLM ended up 1.02 per cent at 16.89, its highest finish since May 2002. 																								The chief executives of the two airlines, who sources said had to give up more slots than they wanted, took solace in the fact that they retained all of their routes. Neither party has been required to give up any routes or frequencies, Air Frances Jean-Cyril Spinetta and KLMs Leo van Wijk said in a joint statement.																								The companies may have to give up some frequencies  the number of flights between airports  to make room for the 31 new round trips envisioned by Brussels for competitors. 																								The airlines will give up slots on international routes between Amsterdam and New York, Paris and Detroit, Amsterdam and Atlanta, Paris and Lagos and Amsterdam and Lagos. 																								They will also give up slots between Amsterdam and Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Rome, Milan, Venice and Bologna. Some airports, like Lagos, are less congested than European airports and not part of the settlement. 																								The US, which worked closely with the Commission, said after Brussels acted that it would not oppose the deal. 																								The approval comes a decade after Air France nearly went bankrupt, staying alive only because it won permission from the Commission to receive 20 billion French francs  about 3 billion ($3.84 billion)  in aid from the French government.

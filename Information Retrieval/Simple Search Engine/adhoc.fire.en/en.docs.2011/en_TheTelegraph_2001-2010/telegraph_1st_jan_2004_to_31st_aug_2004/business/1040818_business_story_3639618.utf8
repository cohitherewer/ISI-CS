 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Petro duty cuts to be unveiled today
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: Finance minister P. Chidambaram is expected to announce in Parliament tomorrow a reduction in the excise and customs duties on petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene to give consumers and oil companies a cushion against the burden of soaring international crude prices. 																								The duty cuts are likely to range from 2 to 5 per cent.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters here today that Chidambaram would make a statement in the House on the duty cuts. The oil companies were keen to raise the prices of petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre on August 15 but the government had asked them to stick to existing rates as it could trigger a political backlash. 																								However, since the Indian basket of crude imports has touched a 21-year high of $42 per barrel, the only way of relieving pressure on the consumers and oil companies was to scale down excise and customs duties, which form a significant proportion of the retail price. 																								At present, the retail selling prices of petrol and diesel include a 20 per cent customs duty which together with a notional ocean freight works out to Rs 2 to 3 per litre. Since neither of these fuels is imported, this is a notional cost built into the price. In addition, the excise duty works out to over Rs 12 per litre on petrol and around Rs 3.50 per litre on diesel. 																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had held crucial meetings yesterday with Chidamabram and petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to resolve the issue.

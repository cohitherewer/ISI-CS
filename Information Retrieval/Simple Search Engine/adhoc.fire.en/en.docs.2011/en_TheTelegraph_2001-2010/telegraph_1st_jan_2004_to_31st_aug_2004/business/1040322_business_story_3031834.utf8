Indian investors can now invest in international mutual funds. Standard Chartered Bank has launched GlobeInvest, the one-stop platform for investment opportunities in international mutual funds like Franklin Templeton, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch among others. 																								The decision to launch GlobeInvest has been prompted by finance minister Jaswant Singhs recent announcement that Indian nationals can invest $25,000 abroad. Initially the bank is providing investment opportunities in five to six international mutual funds. But the number will be increased to 20.																								GlobeInvest brings Standard Chartereds expertise in evaluating international mutual funds across various geographies and multiple asset classes like equity, fixed income, gold and real estate. The investor has access to every investment opportunity through GlobeInvest  which also gives him a single view of all his international investments.																								The bank will provide an opportunity to the investor to hunt for exciting new investment destinations like China, as well as lower the risk of their Indian portfolios by investing in mature, less volatile OECD markets.																								Interest rates in most OECD countries are lower than comparable Indian risk-free rates. The net yield on short-term deposits to the investor is much less than a comparable Indian deposit.																								Unlike current international investment offerings, which are focusing on short-term deposits, GlobeInvest will focus on international mutual funds which will give a better return to the investor. We feel that international mutual funds present a much better proposition to the investor today, says Vishnu Ramachandran, regional head, consumer banking, Standard Chartered Bank.																								He added that the international fund managers would help the investors cherry pick the best mutual funds. We will help the investor identify the most tax-friendly funds, he said.					 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

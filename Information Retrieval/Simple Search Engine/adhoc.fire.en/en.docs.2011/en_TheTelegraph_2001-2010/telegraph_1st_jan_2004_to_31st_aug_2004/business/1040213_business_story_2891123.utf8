 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Bengal toys with toy park expansion plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 12: The Bengal government has decided to start work on the second phase of the toy park at Salt Lake soon. The response to the first phase of the park has been quite encouraging.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will formally inaugurate the toy park on Saturday. Work on the second phase will begin within 90 days from that day.																								Bhattacharjee is also in talks with China to encourage toy manufacturers of that country to set up shop at the toy park.																								The toy park at Salt Lake is spread over 2.28 acres. Twenty-four modules in a six-storeyed standard design factory (SDF), with a total built-up area of 78,768 square feet, has been constructed and booked in the first phase. 																								Each module offers an area of 3,282 square feet. There is also a three-storeyed common facility building within the park. About 17 entrepreneurs have already booked space.																								In the second phase, another SDF along with a childrens park will be constructed.																								The park is promoted by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. ICICI-West Bengal Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (ICICI-Winfra), a joint venture between ICICI Bank and WBIDC, has been appointed as the project management consultant.																								The toy business has an estimated current annual turnover of $73 billion. This is likely to grow to $125 billion by 2008. 																								The current market size of toys in India is Rs 450 crore. The vast potential of the sector and its labour-intensive nature has encouraged the state to actively promote the toy park, which is based on the concept of competitive industry cluster.																								Industry sources feel the state offers the right environment for the development of this nascent industry. 																								The key advantages are a large market with significant purchasing power within the state. Moreover, the strategic location of the state acts as a gateway to Southeast Asia.																								The state government is also coming up with four other parks  for food, rubber, foundry and apparel.																								Work on the food park is in advanced stages. Talks on the rubber and foundry parks are also at an advanced stage.

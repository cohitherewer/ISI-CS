It also allows the policyholder to decrease the premium contribution subject to a minimum of Rs 60,000 per annum and also offers guaranteed benefits as bonus units at specific intervals.																								 ABN Amro Mutual Fund has debuted with an equity, monthly income, flexi-debt and floating rate fund. The units will be available at a face value of Rs 10 plus additional loads. The offer will remain open till September 3.																								 Standard Chartered Mutual has launched the All Seasons Bond Fund, a fund-of-fund that will invest in the debt funds of the AMC.

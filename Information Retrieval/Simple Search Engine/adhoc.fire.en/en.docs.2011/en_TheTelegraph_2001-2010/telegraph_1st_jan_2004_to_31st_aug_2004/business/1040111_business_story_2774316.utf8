 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Luxury brands to fuel Ford earnings
 JUSTIN HYDE 																								Detroit, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Ford Motor expects stronger earnings this year, with improvements from its luxury brands and European arm, but its shares fell as the outlook was below some analysts expectations. 																								Ford forecast profit of $1.20 to $1.30 per share this year, or pretax profit of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion excluding one-time items of about $300 million. Analysts expect Ford to earn $1.27 a share in 2004 with a range of 90 cents to $1.50 a share. 																								Shares of Ford closed down 3.2 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange . The shares had been trading around an 18-month high, as investors bid up automakers shares on an improving economy. 																								The run-up had caused a few analysts to warn that the shares were ripe for profit-taking as investors expectations rose too high. 																								But Ford chairman and chief executive Bill Ford Jr. said on Friday that the company preferred to underpromise and overdeliver.

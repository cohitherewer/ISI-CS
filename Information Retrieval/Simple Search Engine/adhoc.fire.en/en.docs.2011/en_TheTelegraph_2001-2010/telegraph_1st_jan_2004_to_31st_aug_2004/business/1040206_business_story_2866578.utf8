 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Upbeat forecast for handset firms
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 5: The global mobile handset market continues to beat expectations and could exceed 510 million units in 2003, according to Gartner Inc.																								The estimate is based on manufacturers shipments to the distribution channel in the fourth quarter of 2003, Gartner said.																								In emerging markets like China, India, Russia and Brazil, sales surpassed expectations due to availability of low-cost phones and aggressive strategies by operators to win subscribers. 																								In India, a stronger-than-expected demand resulted in at least 18 million handsets being sold in 2003. 																								In 2004, the emerging markets will play an increasingly important role and we expect manufacturers to continue developing low-cost products specifically for these markets, Gartner said.																								The year 2003 was phenomenal for the mobile phone industry, with an average growth rate of nearly 20 per cent, said Ben Wood, principal analyst with the mobile communications group for Gartner in Europe. 																								SARS had a significant effect on sales in Asia/Pacific during the second quarter, but sales picked up remarkably in the last two quarters, Gartner said.																								Sales exceeded expectations around the world, the premier research agency added. Mature markets, including the US, Western Europe and Japan, saw a surge in replacement sales.

 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Cipla, Marico join bonus brigade 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Packing a punch																								Mumbai, April 21: Pharmaceuticals company Cipla and FMCG major Marico Industries have both secured shareholders approval to issue bonus and split shares, respectively. 																								Joining the melee of companies issuing bonus shares was a surprise entrant  Goodlass Nerolac  the automobile paints major. Goodlass Nerolac is a subsidiary of Japanese paints major Kansai Paints. 																								Cipla and Marico have posted impressive results taking their shares to new highs on the bourses. 																								Marico wants to issue one bonus share for every share held, while Cipla had sought approval for a split in the face value of Rs 10 per share to five shares with a face value of Rs 2 each. 																								At Maricos meet, chairman Harsh Mariwala exuded confidence on the outlook of the company. Marico, the owner of Parachute and Saffola brands, has bucked trends in the industry which is witnessing profit margins eroding for many players as they implement price rationalisation in many products. 																								Cipla chairman Yusuf K Hamied was conservative in his outlook. He forecast a growth of 10 per cent for Cipla while talking to analysts after the meeting.																								Cipla has reported an impressive 118 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 101.74 crore for the fourth quarter against Rs 46.73 crore for the same period last year. 																								The performance sent ripples through the Cipla counter and the share price gained 4.6 per cent to Rs 1,308. 																								Net sales for the quarter has increased to Rs 599.38 crore from Rs 388.15 crore in the same period last year. 																								The chairman said that the last quarter of 2002-03 has been exceptionally poor. 																								Marico, analysts feel, is benefiting from its competitor Hindustan Lever fight to protect its market share in shampoo, detergents and toothpastes. 																								Marico has reported a net profit of Rs 16.33 crore for the quarter ended March 31 against Rs 15.08 crore a year ago. 																								FMCG majors Hindustan Lever, Procter amp; Gamble and Colgate are distracted by a battle being waged in the detergent, shampoo and toothpaste segments where Marico is not a player. 																								The company has informed the exchanges that the board will meet on April 30 to decide on a bonus issue. 																								Meanwhile, shares of Goodlass Nerolac vaulted 14 per cent to Rs 535.90 after it announced plans for a bonus issue.

 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Real-time settlement takes off
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 26: A real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system for banks was launched today to minimise settlement risks. The system will settle individual payments in real-time in the account books of the central bank. 																								This system will be widely used for high-value inter-bank settlements, risk control measures, faster and efficient settlement of liabilities and better customer services for the ultimate users in the value chain, a senior banker explained.																								RTGS is expected to expedite the integrated payment and settlement system in the country.																								After a two-month trial period, the Reserve Bank of India today commenced the live operations of the system and allowed only inter-bank transactions for the time being.																								The trial run was done in co-operation with four other banks, the RBI said.																								Customer-related transfers will be enabled in due course and after two weeks, other banks and primary dealers will join the system in a phased manner, the central bank said. 																								Eligible partners would join the system after a week, depending on their technical and other preparedness, RBI added. It expected all the participants to join the system in three months.																								Acknowledging the fact that the new system would take some time for assimilation, the RBI said during this period as a measure of abundant caution, the system, the policies, procedures, security and other aspects would be reviewed by an external group of experts.																								For the time being, inter-bank transactions are being put through and customer-related transfers will be enabled in due course. After about two weeks, other banks/primary dealers will join the system in a phased manner. Depending on their full technical and other preparedness, eligible participants will join the system after a week.

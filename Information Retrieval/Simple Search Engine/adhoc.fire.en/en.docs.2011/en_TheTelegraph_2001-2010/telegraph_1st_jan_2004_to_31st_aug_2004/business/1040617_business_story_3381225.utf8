 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Ficci seeks tax-rate parity
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 16: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) today called for a unification of corporate and income tax rates to spur industry growth.																								The peak rate at present is 30 per cent for income tax and 35 per cent for corporate tax, although the latter is laced with a surcharge of 2.5 per cent. Foreign companies pay 40 per cent.																								In its pre-budget memorandum presented to the government today, the apex industry chamber also demanded the re-introduction of investment allowance and accelerated depreciation to stimulate investment in the corporate sector. 																								It also wants restoration of tax exemption for the interest paid on foreign currency loans. This would help industrial units at home raise loans from foreign sources at competitive rates. 																								Foreign loans constitute an important source of funds for domestic industrial units, both for financing import of capital goods, raw materials and raising funds for embarking on expansion.																								The chamber also feels that double and multiple taxation elements in dividend distribution tax should be avoided. The amount of dividend taxed should be excluded from additional income tax, when it is distributed again by another firm, says the pre-budget memorandum.																								Other recommendations include encouraging investment in equities and the infrastructure sector (especially those having a long gestation period by providing fiscal incentives) and making mergers and acquisitions more tax-friendly.																								The chamber has reiterated the need for implementation of value-added tax (VAT). Focus should be on having a national VAT which should also cover services with set-offs for taxes paid. This will help boost indirect tax revenues, says the memorandum.																								Seeking a three-tier structure of import duty, the industry suggests lowest duty on raw materials, slightly higher on intermediaries and highest on finished goods.																								The chamber has also urged the government to remove the confusion over taxation of business process outsourcing (BPO) units, which have a strong employment generation potential. At present, a tax waiver is allowed only for auxiliary business. There should be no distinction between core and non-core activities. If the transaction between the foreign company and the captive provider in India (which constitutes its permanent establishment) is at an arms length, no profit should be attributed to hit and, hence, no tax imposed, says the chamber.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 India Inc welcomes Reddys growth menu
 OUR BUREAUX																								Delhi/Calcutta, May 18: India Inc today hailed the Reserve Bank of Indias slack season credit policy. It termed the central banks move to increase the external commercial borrowing limit to $500 million as progressive. 																								The industry also welcomed the flow of credit to agriculture and the gold card scheme for creditworthy exporters.																								CII president Anand Mahindra said: We welcome the rigour and judgement that is apparent in the monetary policy statement. While GDP growth is expected to continue to be robust, there could be some concerns on the inflation rate due to rising oil prices as well as excessive domestic liquidity.																								Ficci president Y. K. Modi said efforts would have to be made to enhance the growth rate to 8 per cent.																								Regarding prime lending rates, which according to the RBI was expected to fall by 0.25-2.0 per cent, Ficci was of the view that there was scope for further reduction. Bajaj Auto CMD Rahul Bajaj said: There is no dramatic change in the credit policy. Things seem to be at ease.																								Godrej group chairman Adi B. Godrej said, The credit policy does not have much change and is relatively neutral. A 5 per cent rate of inflation is a reasonable expectation. While it is good that the RBI has increased the limit of ECB, I would suggest that the government should not put any control on ECBs because we already have a strong forex reserve.																								Rajan Verma, chief financial officer of Dabur India, said, Raising the ECB limit to $500 million is a positive development and will help companies raise foreign currency loans. 																								Echoing similar sentiments, Ballarpur Industries finance director B. Hariharan said: The raising of the ECB limit is a progressive development. The rupee should also appreciate. Then it will be beneficial for the borrower to service that debt. 																								The banks termed the RBIs projection of a 5 per cent inflation rate for 2004-05 as realistic.																								H. . Sinor, CEO, Indian Banks Association, said: It is a good policy. The 5 per cent inflation rate is rather realistic and should not be hyped.																								Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said: Inflation rate is a worldwide concern because of rising oil prices. However, Indian business fundamentals are far too strong. Growth opportunities here will far outweigh the inflationary effect. 																								Kalpana Morparia, executive director of ICICI Bank, welcomed the RBIs move to allow banks to raise bonds for financing the infrastructure sector. Allahabad Bank CMD O. N. Singh said, The RBI governor has tried to bring in more flexibility in the operations of the Indian banking system.																								Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Biswadip Gupta said: The emphasis given to further improve the credit delivery systems should be noted. The industry feels this has been a growing concern than the cost of funds, which has resulted in skewed credit flows to different sectors.However, N. R. Goenka, president of Bharat Chamber of Commerce, regretted that the policy gives no indication of the important issue of reduction of interest rate on export credit, with a view to providing level playing field to Indian exporters.

 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 High hopes for Saarc trade pact
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 31: With the 12th Saarc summit less than a week away, industry associations are convinced that this time the Saarc Free Trade agreement (Safta) will come through.																								We are very positive and optimistic of signing Safta this time. It is only through this agreement that bilateral trade agreement with Pakistan can happen. One should also remember that only when trade and economics work together, it will lead to lowering terrorism as well, said Y. K. Modi, president-elect, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								There is support for business across the board. Also, the earlier perception of Pakistan being a road-block to Safta has now changed. Today, the atmospherics between India and Pakistan are at new levels, he said.

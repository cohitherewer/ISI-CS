 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Hungry market laps up new ICICI Bank shares in hours
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 2: The public offering of ICICI Bank Limited was over-subscribed by more than 1.3 times on its first bidding day. The issue generated cumulative bids of 15.58 crore shares against 11.96 crore on offer, according to the Bombay Stock Exchange.																								ICICI Banks issue, billed as the largest offering by the private sector in recent times, attracted investors despite the recent spate of mega offerings that raised over Rs 13,000 crore.																								Though investment banking analysts were not available for comment, sources associated with the deal said most of the bids were from institutions and they were in the range of Rs 260-275 per share. 																								ICICI Bank is offering the shares at a price band of Rs 255-295 per share. The issue was nearly fully subscribed in around an hour after it opened, a source said.																								The issue aims to raise Rs 3,050 crore from the market. It also has a green shoe option of Rs 450 crore. The bidding process will close on April 7. Up to 50 per cent of the issue is available for institutional buyers on a discretionary basis. At least 25 per cent of the issue will be available for retail investors and a similar amount for non-institutional bidders.																								Institutional investors had expressed keen interest in the offering due to the strong fundamentals of ICICI Bank, which has made rapid strides in retail credit in the past few years, sources added.																								In an attempt to attract investors, the bank has hit upon an investment protection mechanism and it has also granted retail investors the option of part payment while applying for the shares. 																								Sources said the bank would receive a good response from its huge customer base, which is over 10 million at present. The bank is promoting the issue through its various delivery channels, including ATMs.																								To ensure that any temporary volatility does not affect shareholders, ICICI Bank had appointed DSP Merrill Lynch as the stabilising agent. The latter will look into the aspect of price stabilisation, post listing. Moreover, investors who will be allotted shares from this offer would also be receiving dividends.																								The public offering is being made to fund its aggressive plans in retailing and insurance. The proceeds will also help in the banks increasing international presence.Issue price																								PTI adds: ICICI Bank will use the proceeds from the green shoe option to prevent any decline in market price of shares below the issue price, a senior official of the bank said today.																								Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which held about 8 per cent stake in ICICI Bank, has agreed to lend its shares for a month if required for the price stabilisation mechanism. 																								The bank will, however, not use the fund if prices remain above the issue price, the official said.																								The banks capital adequacy ratio will increase to 16-17 per cent from the present 11.3 per cent and its net worth to Rs 11,500 crore after the public issue. The paid-up capital, which is at present Rs 615 crore, would rise to Rs 735-753 crore depending on the price band.

 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Clamour for duty cut on oil imports
 S. P. S. PANNU Slippery issue 																								New Delhi, May 21: The ministry of petroleum and natural gas is banking on the finance ministry to reduce the customs and excise duties on crude and petroleum products to make it easier for public sector oil companies to cushion consumers from soaring international crude prices.																								Petroleum ministry officials feel that the ad valorem nature of these duties should be replaced with a quantity-specific system prevalent in the US and Japan. Senior oil company executives told The Telegraph that the situation is fast reaching a crisis point and there is an urgent need to rationalise the duty structure.																								While petrol is selling at Rs 33.71 per litre in Delhi, around Rs 15 of this is accounted for by central government levies, while another Rs 6 goes to the state government as sales tax. In the case of diesel, taxes comprise 50 per cent of Rs 21.74 per litre. Therefore, in the absence of taxes, petrol would cost less than Rs 15 per litre and diesel less than Rs 11 per litre. 																								The petroleum sector contributes close to 30 per cent of the total tax collections of the Union budget. In a country that is notorious for tax evasion, the transparent accounting of the public sector oil companies provides a reliable source of revenue for the government. The finance ministry has, therefore been reluctant to give up these easy pickings as it helps to reduce the runaway fiscal deficit. 																								The fund-starved state governments also levy a hefty sales tax on petroleum products which is again passed on to the consumer.																								The ad valorem nature of these duties is a double whammy that makes a bad situation worse. When crude prices increase from $30 to $37 per barrel, the customs duty of 10 per cent based on the value of imports also goes up proportionately. 																								The oil companies have to pay more for the oil and shell out additional money for duty as well. Similarly, when the price of petrol or diesel is increased, the excise duty, based on the price of the product, also shoots up and the consumer has to pay even more.																								The petroleum ministry has made out a strong case for introducing customs and excise duties on the quantity of goods imported or produced. This ensures that the government gets a fixed amount of revenue and does not put an extra burden on the oil companies or consumers when crude prices go up. This system is followed in advanced countries.

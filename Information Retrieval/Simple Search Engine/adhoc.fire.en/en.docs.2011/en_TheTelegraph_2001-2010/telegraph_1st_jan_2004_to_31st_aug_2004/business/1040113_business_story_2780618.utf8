The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Gail, ONGC flotation dates to be set soon
																								Hyderabad, Jan. 12 (PTI): The government today said the decision on the timing of Gail and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) public issues would be clear by the middle of February, while exuding confidence that both the issues would be completed in this fiscal.																								By mid-February, other residual stake sales would have gone through. We would know the market conditions, disinvestment and IT minister Arun Shourie said on the sidelines of the Asian IT ministers summit here. The government has lined up public offers for sale of residual stake in IBP, IPCL and CMC, besides a public float for the Dredging Corporation.																								To a query whether the allotment of shares to retail investors in these two IPOs would be done in the same manner as was done in Maruti, he said No decision has been taken as yet. It will only be decided when we see the response.																								In Maruti, the proportion of sale to retail and small investors, institutional investors, as well as the cut-off price and discount were decided just two hours before I announced them in a conference from Thailand. The CCD had decided that the finance minister and I should settle it at the end, he said.

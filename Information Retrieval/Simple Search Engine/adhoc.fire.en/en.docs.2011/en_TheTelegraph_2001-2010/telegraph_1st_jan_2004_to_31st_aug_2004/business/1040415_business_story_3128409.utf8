 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Oman deal unites Indian Oil, amp;T
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, April 14: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has joined hands with engineering and construction major, amp;T, to bid for two major pipeline projects in Oman and Sudan.																								The IOC- amp;T combine has already been pre-qualified for the Mina Al Fahal to Sohar crude oil pipeline of the Oman Gas Company and a formal bid was submitted for the project last month.																								Similarly, the Indian combine has also been pre-qualified for the Melut basin oil development project in Sudan that entails the laying of a 1,400-km long crude oil pipeline. IOC has offered to set up pumping facilities and optic-fibre cables to maintain independent communications to run the pipeline with data access and telecommunication facilities along with a marine oil terminal as part of the project.																								Sudanese engineers were in India recently on a training course with the IOC pipeline division and have given a positive feedback to their authorities about IOCs technical knowhow and managerial abilities. 																								A second batch of engineers will be arriving soon as a follow up exercise to upgrade the technical skills of Sudanese engineers. ONGC-Videsh is also operating in Sudan and business between the two countries in the oil sector is expected to grow further.																								IOC is currently executing eight major pipeline projects in India worth 2,500 crore. These include the 330-km long Paradip-Haldia crude oil pipeline project with crude handling facilities at Paradip. The Chennai-Trichy-Madurai pipeline project, the Koyali-Dahej project and the conversion of the Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline from a petroleum product pipeline to crude oil service are some of the other projects under execution.																								IOC is currently running a network of 7,575 km of pipeline with a capacity of 56.85 million tonnes per annum.

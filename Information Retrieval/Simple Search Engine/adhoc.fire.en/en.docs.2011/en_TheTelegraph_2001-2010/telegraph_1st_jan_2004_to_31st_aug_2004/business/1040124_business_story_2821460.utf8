				 Sebi clears the air, investors feel relieved 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
				 	 Bajpai: Stitch in time
																								Mumbai, Jan. 23: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today ruled that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will have to phase out participatory notes issued to unregulated entities in five years. 
																								To facilitate the process of transition, derivative instruments already issued and outstanding against unregulated entities would not be required to be terminated immediately, Sebi said.
																								In a twin-pronged move, Sebi also banned further accretion in the proceeds of participatory notes from unregulated foreign institutional entities from February 3.
																								Sebi, however, reiterated that there is no change in its policy of FII investments in India except by way of strengthening the know your client regime.
																								This is felt necessary in the interest of the efficacy of the market, Sebi said. Participatory notes against underlying Indian securities can be issued only to regulated entities and further transfers, if any, of these instruments can be made to other regulated entities only, it said.
																								FIIs are required to ensure that there is no further downstream issuance of such derivative instruments.
																								Sebi would need to be in a position to ascertain, if circumstances so warrant, details of the ultimate investors investing through participatory notes, in the Indian market. Therefore, FIIs issuing such derivative instruments are required to exercise due diligence and maintain complete details of the investors, based on the know your client principles.
																								Investors were happy as it removed the uncertainty clouding the markets on the future of participatory notes. Our worst fears of a ban has been put to rest, an investor said.
																								Of late, certain investor associations have been pointing at the unregulated growth of participatory notes through the foreign investment route. Sebi, while strictly enforcing the know your client principle among local stockbrokers, has been dithering on applying the same principle for foreign investors.
																								A record sum of Rs 24,881 crore has flowed into the stock markets through participatory notes till November 30. Most of the money has come after May, when the markets perked up on foreign investment support that saw the sensex gaining 74 per cent in April-December. This is a cause of concern for many.

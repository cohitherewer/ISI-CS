 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 New Coke boss to be named soon
																								Omaha, May 2 (Reuters): Coca-Cola Company will have a new chief executive soon, Warren Buffett said on Saturday. 																								Buffett, through Berkshire, is the largest shareholder of the worlds largest soft drink maker and a key member on its board of directors. The search for a replacement to retiring Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive Douglas Daft has entered a third month, making some investors jittery.																								That will be resolved fairly soon, Buffett said in an interview with Reuters at the annual meeting, which has attracted as many as 20,000 to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. He declined to give a more precise time frame. 																								Buffett also responded to critics  the California pension fund Calpers and shareholder advisory group ISS  who argued for withholding votes for him on the Coke board because ice cream chain Dairy Queen and food distributor McLane do business with the soft drink company.

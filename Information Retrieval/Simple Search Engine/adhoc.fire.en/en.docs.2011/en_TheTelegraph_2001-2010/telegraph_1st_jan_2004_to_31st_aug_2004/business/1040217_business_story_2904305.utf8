 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 FDC joins the drug firms bonus party
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 16: Pharmaceuticals company FDC Ltd is mulling a bonus. The company board will meet on February 24 to decide on the issue, a letter to the Bombay Stock Exchange said.																								With this announcement, the company joins the drugs duo  Wockhardt and Alembic  which announced bonus issues last week.																								The announcement drove the FDC share price up 9.96 per cent from Rs 89.80 to Rs 98.75.																								Analysts feel the recent trend to issue bonuses by pharma companies have a special significance. While the sector is doing well, it is believed that many of the companies are lining up equity stakes for strategic investors. 																								Probably the bonus announcements are an attempt to increase equity and give comfortable stakes to the existing investors. This is an ideal foil for dilution in equity later by inducting a strategic investor through the preferential investment route. 																								However, this is yet to be confirmed by the managements of these companies.																								Last week, Wockhardt cheered its shareholders by announcing a bonus share for every two held and a stock split from a face value of Rs 10 to Rs 5.																								Alembic Ltd, another pharmaceuticals company, was more generous when it announced two bonus shares for every Alembic share.																								The recent announcements by Indian pharmaceuticals companies have brought back interest in the sector, say analysts.

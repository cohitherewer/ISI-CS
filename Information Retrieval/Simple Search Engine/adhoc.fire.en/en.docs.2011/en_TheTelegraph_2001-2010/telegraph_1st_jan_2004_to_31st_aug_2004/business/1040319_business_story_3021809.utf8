 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Bata shows the door to laggards
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 18: Bata India Ltd is getting tough with employees who are non-performers.																								The shoe major has terminated the service of five of its junior managerial staff as they were not performing according to the standards set by the company. The decision to terminate the service was taken by the management on Tuesday.																								Its unfortunate that we had to part ways with the employees in question at the Batanagar factory. It has been a tough decision for us. We had lost confidence in their performance and could not see any improvement in future, the company said in a release.																								In view of the challenging task ahead of us in trying to bring back the factory to an acceptable performance level, we, at this point of time, expect all our employees to work together for the benefit of the company, which will secure the future of all our employees, it added.																								The Batanagar factory employs 4,500 people out of which 680 are managerial staff.																								The official spokesperson for the firm said these five employees were already on warning. After the management announced their decision, five of them started picketing outside the factory at around 11 am. But no untoward incident was reported, the spokesperson said.

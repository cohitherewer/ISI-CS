 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Tax axe hangs on NRI money
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Money matters																								Mumbai, May 24: An internal group of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that interest income from non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits be made taxable on the lines of domestic deposits.																								The group has taken note that international liabilities of banks are now nearly double their global assets. It has suggested that the Non-Resident (External) (NRE) savings deposit interest rate be delinked from domestic savings deposit rate and have a ceiling of one-month Libor/Swap rates on dollar deposits.																								Its other suggestions include deregulating the present ceiling on interest for export credit. This would ensure better availability of export credit in foreign currency.																								The RBI had constituted an internal group to comprehensively review the status of external liabilities of scheduled commercial banks and examine various policy issues arising from these.																								The group emphasised that external liabilities of banks need to be seen in the overall context of external debt. Though the non-debt creating remittances have been consistently accounting for a dominant component of NRI inflows, deposits have substantially increased their share in total external debt recently, it said.																								Total non-resident deposits rose from Rs 64,908 crore in March 1997 to Rs 154,964 crore on March 19, 2004.																								NRI deposits pose potential problems for policymakers in times of crises, when they display a high degree of volatility irrespective of maturity constraints, the group said, adding that consistent with the overall debt management policy, efforts should be made to limit exposure to non-resident deposits.																								Non-resident deposit schemes were introduced at various stages in the past to attract foreign exchange funds by offering tax benefits, higher interest rates and exchange cover. The report explained that while NRI deposit inflows have grown over the years, there is no need to bestow tax benefits on them due to the countrys comfortable forex position.																								On export credit, the group said though the present interest rate ceiling of Libor + 75 basis points on export credit in foreign currency is intended to help small exporters, banks are finding it difficult to lend at these rates as these have high transaction costs. Many banks are reported to have levied additional service charges to cover their transaction costs for these advances.																								Since banks are permitted to access overseas lines of credit without limit for on-lending to exporters, a removal of the interest rate cap will lead to a quantum jump in pre-shipment credit in foreign currency (PCFC) as well as in overseas borrowings by banks as this will give them an attractive spread.

 With interest rates set to rise, should you switch to a fixed-rate home loan? Satish John helps you out																								We make a living of what we get, but we make a life by what we give.																								The observation by Winston Churchill, UKs wartime Prime Minister, might have been made in a different context, but the truism has acquired a new meaning for 40-year-old Pankaj Modi.																								Life has just begun anew. Over the past two years, he has managed to shave off 30 months from his 180-month loan purely by taking a floating rate loan that kept declining and benefiting him immensely.																								His gut feeling and growing financial commitments have forced him to do a rethink. This middle class, middle-level executive is keen to tie up all the financial loose ends that may arise in the coming years. He is not worried about will happen in a couple of years, but rather about the interest rate scenario by 2010-15. It is tough to predict anything about the long term. He is in good company: even the experts cannot take a call.																								As Woody Dorsey, author of the famous book Behavioural Trading, said: Every extreme is reversed. History is a changing narrative composed of phases, movements, or eras, which always have corresponding ideological paradigms.																								Pankaj owes money to the bank. Having taken a decision to buy his own apartment, he borrowed from a private bank in June 2002 when interest rates were softening. He now wants to cut the odds of interest rates hardening by converting it into a fixed rate loan. His loan for a 15-year tenure in June 2002 at 11.5 per cent interest, declined in two months to 11 per cent.																								A series of rate cuts saw Pankajs loan scraping single digit levels at 9.75 per cent, which meant that he had to pay equated monthly instalments (EMIs) for only 150 months. He had shaved off 30 months from the original loan period. When the same bank offered him, a lower interest rate of 7.75 per cent (floating) for 150 months, Pankaj grabbed the offer.																								Now, he is afraid that the rates will move northwards. One of his pals, who recently bought a house insisted on a fixed interest rate loan and got it.																								Officials at HDFC confirm they can sense a trend where borrowers are increasingly veering towards a fixed rate loan. If some months ago 90 per cent of the borrowers opted for a floating rate loan, it is now down to 75 per cent, industry circles say.																								Obviously, many bankers are wary to offer fixed rate loans as their risks rise manifold of interest rates rise sharply. They would prefer borrowers to opt for floating as they can always hike existing lending rates when interest rates rise all around.																								Pankaj knows that his banker may persuade him against switching over to fixed rate loans from floating. But as the Oracle of Omaha said once, quot;Dont ask the barber whether you need a haircut. quot; He may have to pay a one-time 2 per cent penalty. That is the short-term pain he has to endure for a future with less worries.																								RBI governor Y V Reddy has indicated that authorities may need to revisit their monetary policy stance if global rates rise too fast. All eyes are on the US Federal Reserve, as the rate setting meeting by the US Central Bank is scheduled for June 30.																								R. K. Bakshi, deputy general manager at Bank of India, is among the few bankers who say it makes sense for borrowers to opt for a fixed rate loan.																								But he insists that there are pitfalls. Many foreign banks offer fixed rate loans valid only for three to five years. Its as good or bad as a floating rate loan. Read the fineprint closely as clauses like a hefty penalty for prepayment, or fixed rate loans for short term loans may make borrowers writhe in agony.																								Last heard, Pankaj is treading softly and will take a call soon. My guess is he would opt for a fixed rate loan, as he is willing to pay a small premium to avoid nasty surprises later.

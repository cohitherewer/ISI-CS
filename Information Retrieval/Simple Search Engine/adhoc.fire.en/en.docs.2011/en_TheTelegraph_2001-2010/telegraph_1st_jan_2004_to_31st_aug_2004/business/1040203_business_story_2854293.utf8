 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 2: Simplex Concrete Piles, an infrastructure company headquartered in Calcutta, hopes to book Rs 1,500 crore in revenues over the next two-and-a-half years.																								We are riding the boom in the infrastructure sector and have orders worth Rs 1,500 crore in the pipeline. These projects would be executed over the next two-and-a-half years, said Amitabh Mundra, a director of Simplex.																								The company hopes to register an income of Rs 650-700 crore and post a profit of Rs 13-14 crore this fiscal. However, as profit margins are rising, Simplex sees the net profit margin going up to 5-6 per cent over the next financial year. The company has a paid up equity of Rs 7.3 crore. Its earning this year would result in a profit per share of Rs 20 or thereabouts.																								Simplex is executing a huge project for Sterlite in Orissa, where the latter is setting up an alumina smelter. 																								The order value, Mundhra said, was Rs 125 crore.

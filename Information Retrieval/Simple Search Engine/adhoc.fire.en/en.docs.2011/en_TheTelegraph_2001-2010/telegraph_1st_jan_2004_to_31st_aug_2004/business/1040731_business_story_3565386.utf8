 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Deal eludes trade rivals
																								Geneva, July 30 (Agencies): Negotiators tried to thrash out a new global commerce deal on Friday but the head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said the chances for success were finely balanced. India, however, rejected the blueprint, which, it argued, failed to address its concerns, particularly on agriculture.																								Several nations said they opposed parts of a latest draft as the WTO tries to craft a text that would lower the huge subsidies rich nations pay their farmers as well as liberalise the trade in manufactured goods and in services markets.																								Negotiators want to avoid the repeat of a collapse of world trade talks in Cancun last year as this could delay trade liberalisation for years. In a sign of the tough talking going on, a midnight Friday deadline slipped to Saturday.																								A number of delegations saw improvements, but I have to admit it hangs in the balance, WTO chief Supachai Panitchpakdi said, toning down earlier statements he was optimistic a deal could be struck in the next 24 hours. He said key issues remained in how to resolve differences over reducing subsidies to farmers and in bringing down tariffs on manufactured goods.																								Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath, who arrived in Bangkok this afternoon to participate in the bilateral talks on the Indo-Thai free trade agreement, is rushing back to Geneva to explore if a new draft acceptable to both developing and developed countries could be cobbled together. The minister said the new text was not acceptable. With no agreement in sight among the major players, the WTO general council meeting is expected to spill over to next few days.																								My sense is that delegations are willing to stay engaged and would like to see a deal, Panitchpakdi said. The Japanese official who heads the WTOs main-decision making body, the General Council, also informed delegates of the new Saturday deadline. Trade ministers of the G20 and NG5 group of countries have urged Kamal Nath to return to Geneva to break the deadlock in the WTO talks.

 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Banks to finance tea exit schemes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 10: Banks will provide funds to tea companies for voluntary retirement schemes or other such measures that will help improve their productivity as part of the revival package announced by the Indian Banks Association today.																								Revival packages for large tea growers and manufacturers would be considered on a case-to-case basis, depending on merit. The position of accounts as on December 31, 2003 may be considered. Irregular outstandings in term/working capital loan accounts as on December 31, 2003 may be converted into a special tea term loan (STTL).																								The IBA worked out the package following Union finance minister Jaswant Singhs announcement of a revival package in the interim budget for 2004-05.																								The industry is extremely upbeat. They will now get the long-awaited financial relief measures. The banks have already started reacting, said C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association.																								The repayment of STTL may be allowed over a period of five to seven years, including a moratorium of one year based on the cash flow projection.																								Interest on STTL may be charged at the benchmark rate of the bank. The benchmark rate varies between 10.5 to 11 per cent.																								Banks may also examine the feasibility of converting rupee loans, including structured ones, into foreign currency loans to pass on the benefits of lower interest rates to the borrowers.																								Banks may consider a fresh working capital limit based on the assessment of requirements. Interest on fresh working capital would be in keeping with the pricing policy of the bank. In cases where the asset cover is insufficient, banks may seek additional collateral security from the borrowers.																								The tea industry has been going through a bad patch since 1998 on account of a drastic decline in tea prices, both in the domestic and international markets.																								The problems were triggered off by a glut in production in 1998 and the depressed conditions continued till the end of 2003.																								The prices are now looking up and the industry sees the trend as a turn around and they expect the market conditions to remain favourable in the coming years.																								The IBA has announced this package so that they can take advantage of the present favourable conditions, a Calcutta-based banker said.

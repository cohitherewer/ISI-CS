 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 10: State Bank of Saurashtra has posted a 92 per cent rise in net profit for the year ended March 31, 2004 at Rs 177.39 crore compared with Rs 92.52 crore in the year-ago period.																								While the bank has declared a dividend of 10 per cent for the year, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) came down by Rs 153.91 crore to Rs 200.43 crore, a drop of over 43 per cent. 																								Even as the ratio of gross NPA to total advances has been brought down to 3.68 per cent from 7.32 per cent last year, State Bank of Saurashtra is one of the few domestic banks whose net NPA is nil.																								According to managing director S. K. Singh, operating profit of the bank also increased to Rs 452.76 crore from Rs 286.63 crore. Even if the gains from treasury profit are excluded, the operating profit records a rise of 44 per cent.																								The bank is now focusing on retail banking where it is confident of better spreads. The current plan is to double growth in this segment from Rs 210 crore to over Rs 450 crore.																								While the bank will focus on small and medium enterprises, it also plans to leverage synergies with the State Bank group and cross-sell various products.																								Bank officials said this year they are targeting a cash recovery of Rs 60 crore. This is part of a plan to remove NPAs worth over Rs 160 crore. A portion of such loans could be sold to Asset Reconstruction Company India Ltd (ARCIL), they added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Profit hunters prick stock-price balloon
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 15: Stocks went into a tailspin today, leaving the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) sensex tottering 130 points below the level it finished on Wednesday. The losses, one of the sharpest since the 30-share index topped 6000, was triggered by a scramble to make profits on stocks that are quoting at sky-high prices.																								That combined with stepped-up sales by foreign funds, which have over the past week been offloading shares and not merely buying them, to make money on their stock-basket. The other downer was the raft of measures that Sebi has initiated to stem possible irregularities by sub-brokers. Operators squirm at the hint of more disclosures.																								The decision to defer the hike in foreign direct investment (FDI) in telecom sector was another letdown for the markets, which expected a favourable decision. The rider that foreign investment would include institutional (portfolio) fund infusions also hit sentiment.																								This has to happen. It is simple tired bull liquidation. There has to be a correction, said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. The sensex closed 130.20 points, or 2.10 per cent, lower at 6063.91; nifty shed 37.70 points, or 1.90 per cent, at 1944.45. It was the swiftness of the decline that caught many by surprise. It came suddenly, in the last hour of trading. 																								Private banks, in which the government set foreign stake cap at 74 per cent, were among the best performers. HDFC Bank, UTI Bank, Federal Bank and others showed sharp gains.

 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 NTPC sets ball rolling for maiden stock offer
																								New Delhi, May 9: (PTI) National Thermal Power Corporation has picked three renowned merchant bankers, including Kotak Mahindra and ICICI Securities, as lead-managers for its forthcoming initial public offering likely to hit the market in August.																								The power major has appointed Enam Financials as the third joint lead manager-cum-book runner.																								NTPC plans to sell 5 per cent of its equity through shares with a face-value of Rs 400 crore. The issue will be priced at a premium to account for the substantial reserves the corporation has built up over the years.																								Twelve merchant bankers, including HSBC, IDBI, UTI, DSP Merrill Lynch and J. M. Morgan Stanley had shown interest. Details about the fee being offered to bankers are not available, but sources say the rates are competitive.																								Transaction fees for such deals had fallen to an all-time low in ONGC and Gail public offers in March. Merchant bankers quoted as low as 0.075 per cent and 0.134 per cent respectively for the twin issues. 																								NTPC secured government approval for the public float, to be carried in one or more phases, earlier this year. It has approached Sebi for a waiver of the listing norms which require that at least 10 per cent of the equity must be in the hands of investors. Merchant bankers would now draw up the draft red-herring prospectus, expected to be filed with Sebi next month.																								Money raised from the offer will help the company fund its plan to triple generation capacity to 56,000 MW by 2017.

				 Microsoft profit down 17%

 REED STEVENSON
																								Seattle, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp, the worlds largest software maker, said on Thursday its quarterly profit fell 17 per cent due to a change in its stock compensation plan, but it raised its revenue outlook based on stronger personal computer demand.
																								Microsoft reported a net profit of $1.55 billion, or 14 cents per share, for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, compared with a profit of $1.87 billion, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Both included the cost of stock-based compensation.
																								Revenue rose 19 per cent to hit a record $10.15 billion as more customers signed up for one-time software licences for Windows, Office and Server products, rather than the longer-term corporate contracts that Microsoft has encouraged.
																								But shares in the company initially fell nearly 3 per cent in after-hours trading as investors focused on the resulting larger-than-expected drop in unearned revenue, but later recovered to $27.80.
																								The fall in unearned revenue reflected a slower take-up of the longer-term software deals that have been seen as key to stabilising Microsofts sales.
																								We solidly outperformed on revenues, expenses, and earnings per share, and we feel good about where we ended the quarter on unearned (revenue), Microsoft chief financial officer John Connors told a conference call.
																								Excluding stock-based compensation expense of 20 cents per share, and other charges, Connors said that Microsoft had a profit of 34 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter.
																								The year-ago quarters earnings of 17 cents per share included 7 cents per share of stock-based compensation expense.
																								Analysts had been expecting a profit of 30 cents on revenue of $9.74 billion, based on the average of forecasts compiled by Reuters Research, a unit of Reuters Group Plc.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: Individual telecom consumers may no longer have to approach the telecom regulator for redressal of their grievances through a consumer forum but can directly approach an Ombudsman to be appointed soon. 																								Currently, there is no system in place in Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to redress individual consumer complaints (which are to be addressed by consumer courts) or disputes between service providers and group of consumers, which are to be addressed by Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). 																								Trai receives complaints from the general public both pertaining to the problems of individuals as well as of generic nature. The Trai Act does not explicitly fix the responsibility to redress consumer grievances.																								The Act, however, provides that Trai shall lay down standards of quality of service to be provided by the service providers and ensure the quality of service and conduct the periodical survey of such service provided by the service providers so as to protect interest of the consumers. 																								It is, therefore, evident that, there is a need to establish an internal mechanism like in other sectors such as insurance and banking, to deal with individual consumer grievances. One way of doing this is through establishment of an office of ombudsman for the telecom sector, said a senior Trai official. 																								The consultation paper released today addresses this matter and raises certain issues for discussion and examination of the relevant steps that may be considered in this regard.																								The regulator today issued a consultation paper on Establishment of the office of Ombudsman in the Telecommunication Sector to provide the necessary platform to discuss this important issue and to enable it to make significant improvement in the orderly growth of telecommunication sector, taking account of the interests of both service providers as well as consumers of telecom services. 																								The National Telecom Policy of 1994 recognised the need for private investment and the association of the private sector to bridge the resource gap as also to meet the rapidly growing demand for telecom service.																								The policy also recognised that in order to implement the new telecom policy, suitable arrangements would have to be made to protect and promote the interests of consumers and ensure fair competition.

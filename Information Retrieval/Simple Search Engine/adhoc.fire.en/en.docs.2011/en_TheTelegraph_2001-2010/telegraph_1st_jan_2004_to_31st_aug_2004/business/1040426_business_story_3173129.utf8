 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Calcutta, April 25: The rural poor are yet to get a taste of the feel-good factor by accessing cheap funds to meet their basic necessities.																								Non-government organisations (NGOs) working as micro-finance institutions to provide employment and supplementary income to rural people, including farmers and women entrepreneurs, are able to provide funds at not less than 17.5-18 per cent.																								These people are willing to pay much more as there is no additional source of funds for them, said Chandra Sekhar Ghosh, executive director of Bandhan, a Calcutta-based non-government micro-finance institution.																								Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) is the sole funding agency for the micro-finance institutions. 																								Sidbi provides refinance to these NGOs at 11.5 per cent, which in turn lend to the actual beneficiaries at 17.5-18 per cent after keeping a 6-7 per cent spread for sustaining their outfits.																								Sidbi has a corpus of about Rs 100 crore for refinancing to these institutions. Sidbi also advances funds for capacity building by the institutions to train volunteers, entrepreneurs and also technical trainers of NGOs, said Saneesh Singh, assistant general manager of Sidbi in Calcutta.																								On the other hand, banks and private finance companies compete with one another for lending funds at as low as nil interest for buying cars and travelling abroad, 7.5 per cent for buying houses and 10-11 per cent for personal loans.																								In Bengal, NGOs focusing primarily on micro-level finance include Vivekananada Seva Kendra working primarily in South 24-Parganas and Village Welfare Society in Hooghly and Howrah districts. 																								Bandhan has tied up with Asha, a Bangladesh-based micro-finance institution promoted by Md Shafiqual Haque Chowdhury and doing outstanding work in motivating and facilitating employment by women and other rural people in Bangladesh.																								Bandhan, which started functioning in 2001, has so far funded nearly Rs 2 crore to around 10,000 rural people in Howrah, North 24 Parganas, Nadia and East Midnapore. It has recorded 100 per cent recovery.

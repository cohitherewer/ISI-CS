 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, March 22: Lupin Ltd today announced its entry into the Rs 5,000-crore domestic herbal medicines market with the launch of nine products in therapeutic areas, including diabetes, paediatrics, pain management and gynaecology.																								While the company will roll out these products in 300 cities in the next fortnight, it plans to extend to 500 cities shortly. The pharma major is eyeing around 10 per cent market share in three years.																								Initially, Lupin will market these products through the ethical or the prescription route. It will later target the over-the-counter (OTC) segment and the export market, estimated to be around $60 billion. 																								Ethical products currently constitute 50 per cent of the domestic market, with the remaining being accounted for by the over-the-counter category.																								Lupin managing director Kamal Sharma said apart from having minimal side effects, herbals are also associated with having a holistic approach to healing. It also has remedies for those ailments that cannot be cured by allopathy.																								The herbal medicines market has been growing by about 3.5 times that of allopathy and the company intended to take advantage of it.																								Sharma said in the herbal segment, Lupin could not only leverage its research and development expertise, but also have a good product pipeline.																								Ajey Kumar, vice-president, herbal business, said Lupin had surveyed 50 cities in the country using various parameters, including overall market size, rate at which the market is growing and presence of unmet needs from allopathy. 																								We have identified 24 categories, he said. Lupin will rely on its field force and 2,400 distributors to attain a national footprint, he added.																								The products launched include Pmensa, used for symptomatic relief in premenstrual syndrome, UlsaTon, an anti-ulcerant and antacid, HerboHep, DeepAct, ConstiVac, RespiNova, AptiKid, Iqmem and RespiKid.

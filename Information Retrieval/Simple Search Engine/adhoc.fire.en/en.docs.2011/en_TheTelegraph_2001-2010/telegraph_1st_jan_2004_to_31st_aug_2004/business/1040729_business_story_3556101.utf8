 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Birla will case begins, next date August 25
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 28: A packed courtroom, a battery of lawyers streaming in, arguments and counter-arguments, but finally only a fresh date for hearing.																								Plenty of action marked the proceedings in Room No 7 of Calcutta High Court today as the legal battle between the Birla family and chartered accountant Rajendra Singh Lodha started before Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta. Lodhas petition to discharge the caveats filed by four members of the Birla family  Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad and Yashovardhan  came up for hearing. 																								Justice Banerjee, after hearing the petition filed by Lodha and the arguments of both sides, asked the lawyers representing the Birlas to file their affidavits in opposition to the petition in two weeks. Setting the next date for hearing on August 25, the judge also instructed Lodhas lawyers to file affidavits in reply in another two weeks thereafter. 																								The court had earlier issued citations to the five caveaters to file affidavits in support of their caveats and the rulebook says the affidavits have to be filed within eight days of the notice. The members of the Birla family are yet to file the affidavits, the deadline for which is July 31. 																								Arguing for Lodha, senior counsel Anindya Mitra said his client was challenging four caveats and not the one filed by Laxmi Bai Newar, the sister of the late M. P. Birla. Satyabrata Mukherjee appeared for the Birla family and said his clients hadnt received a copy of the probate petition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Dockers on edge of Levi Strauss shelf
				 	 Out of stock																								San Francisco, May 12 (Reuters): Levi Strauss amp; Co said on Tuesday it would explore selling its Dockers casual clothing brand to help pay down a heavy debt load as the legendary blue jeans maker struggles to reverse years of slumping sales.																								The San Francisco-based company said selling Dockers, which generates annual revenue of about $1.4 billion, would help it focus on boosting its traditional Levis brand as well as the Levi Strauss Signature clothing line sold in discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp. 																								Its just a sign that Levi needs to shore up its own balance sheet, and this is the one thing in it that represents the jewel in the crown for them, said Jim DAquilla, managing director with the Mercanti Group, a boutique investment bank focusing on the consumer sector. 																								Levi Strauss officials declined to say how much the company expected to raise from selling Dockers as it seeks to reduce a debt load of about $2 billion.																								Bankers said the Dockers brand was likely to fetch between $1 billion and $1.4 billion because it offers strong cash flow and a number of attractive licensing deals.																								Levi Strauss gave no timetable for a sale but said it could take several months. After the announcement, Levi Strauss 12.25 per cent notes maturing in 2012 rose 2.5 cents on the dollar on Tuesday to 92.5 cents on the dollar, up from about 67 cents in late February.																								Chief executive officer Phil Marineau said selling the Dockers brand, which is aimed at young professionals, would help make Levi Strauss a more nimble company as it focuses on its other lines.																								But he said the price would have to be right for the clothing line that helped create a new business casual category and became what the company said was the fastest-growing brand in apparel history within a year of its launch in 1986.Not desperate to sell																								We know what we expect to get from it, Marineau said. This is not sell at any price. In 2003, the Levis brand accounted for 70 per cent of the companys $4.1 billion in net sales, followed by Dockers at 24 per cent and Signature at 6 per cent. Last quarter Dockers had slipped to 19 per cent of net sales as Signature  which was launched last summer  increased its share to 11 per cent. 																								Alexis Gold, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said the proposed sale fit with the companys recent strategy of cutting costs, paying down debt and turning back to its core brands.																								It has been a strong brand for them but it hasnt been their focus, Gold said. Buyers will probably be pretty receptive to a sale. 																								Industry bankers added the auction of Dockers should generate significant interest from some of the countrys largest pants and jeans makers, including VF Corp.

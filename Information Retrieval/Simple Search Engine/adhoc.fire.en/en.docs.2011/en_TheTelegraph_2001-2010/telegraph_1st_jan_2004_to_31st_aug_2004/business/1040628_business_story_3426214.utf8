 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Centre weighs social development cess for firms
 M. RAJENDRANNew Delhi, June 27: The government is considering a proposal to slap a 5-7 per cent social development cess on India Inc in the Union budget next month that will mop up more than Rs 1000 crore.																								The cess is designed to raise funds to enable the United Progressive Alliance government to fulfil the promises it has made in its common minimum programme to promote the underprivileged sections of the society. 																								Companies already pay a corporate tax of 35 per cent and have to bear the burden of a 2.5 per cent surcharge. They have been clamouring for a reduction in the corporate tax to 30 per cent  bringing the tax rate on a par with the peak personal income tax rate  and the removal of the surcharge. 																								Sources say the government is mulling the removal of the surcharge on corporate tax and replacing it with the cess. It will be imposed on the existing corporate tax rate.																								There could be a cess of 5-7 per cent on corporate income tax. There cannot be a cess in addition to the surcharge. That will put too great a burden on them. We are trying to find a balance between surcharge and cess so that the companies contribute to social development since they also stand to benefit from it, said a senior economist who has been associated with the budget deliberations.																								In 2003-04, firms forked out Rs 63,608 crore by way of corporate tax out of the total direct tax collections amounting to Rs 105,049 crore. Corporate tax collections have risen 37.4 per cent in 2003-04 from the previous years Rs 46,281 crore.																								Sources said, The cess will be used to form a corpus called the Social Development Fund (SDF) to help the youth in the underprivileged community. Social economics has been forgotten in the country. The aim is to bring in active participation from the industry while not burdening them with tax. It is bound to benefit them too. 																								The collections from the cess will go into the Consolidated Fund of India with provisions likely to be made to make it non-lapsable. 																								The allocations from this corpus is expected to be made through a special department to be created within the social welfare ministry.																								In its pre-budget memorandum, the Confederation of Indian Industry had favoured the imposition of cess rather than a hike in taxes to raise funds for specific purposes. 																								One of its suggestions was the imposition of a 5 per cent across-the-board cess on passenger fares to create a railway development fund. However, it might not have bargained for the government seizing on that logic to slap a cess on firms.																								The social development cess will not follow the corpus models like the Universal Service Obligation fund for the telecom sector or the road fund cess (collected from petrol and diesel sales in the country) to finance the National Highway Authority of Indias Golden Quadrilateral project. 																								Sources said, We cannot pursue these models since the allocations in these sectors are for industry while the social development cess is proposed to fund schemes and individuals.																								The panchayats and other grass-root-level institutions have the potential to utilise the proceeds from the fund and help it reach the people for whom it is intended. It is important that the underprivileged sections in the rural areas do not get neglected. It is an issue that can be best addressed by the local institutions, sources said.

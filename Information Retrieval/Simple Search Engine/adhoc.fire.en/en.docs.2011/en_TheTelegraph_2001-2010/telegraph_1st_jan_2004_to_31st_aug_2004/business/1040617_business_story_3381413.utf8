 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Franklin plan to beat rate swings
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 16: Franklin Templeton Investments, the largest private sector mutual fund in the country, is launching a plan under its fund of funds (FoF) scheme. The FT India Life Stage Fund of Funds (FTLF), named as the 50s Plus Floating Rate Plan, will mainly invest in floating rate funds with marginal exposure to equity fund.																								President Ravi Mehrotra said, With domestic interest rates unlikely to fall further and given the hardening trend of global interest rates, debt markets in the country have been witnessing volatility in recent months. In this scenario, investors are looking for a product that can work along the lines of a MIP but also offer protection against interest rate volatility. 																								The 50s Plus Floating Rate Plan will invest predominantly in a floating rate fund and cater to this need. While the exposure to our floating rate fund provides a hedge against interest rate volatility, the marginal exposure to our flagship equity funds gives access to the growth potential of equities, he added. 																								The plan opened for subscription today and will continue till June 28. It will be open for ongoing purchase/redemption at net asset value from July 7.																								Talking about the benefits of a fund of funds product, Mehrotra said, The changing nature of financial markets has motivated people towards financial planning. Hence the importance of asset allocation is gaining ground. 																								The FoF simplifies the investment process for investors who want to invest in a range of mutual funds for proper allocation of their assets. 																								Moreover, the inbuilt rebalancing feature of FTLF makes the investment process easier for investors. 																								Usually market movements make an investors steady asset allocation go awry, and frequent rebalancing is cumbersome and inefficient from the tax perspective. 																								The different options in the FoF make it an ideal investment avenue for investors and distributors seeking a one-stop shop solution for all investment needs, he added.																								The new plan will invest its debt component in the long-term plan of Templeton Floating Rate Fund Income Fund and the equity component in Franklin India Bluechip Fund and Templeton India Growth Fund.

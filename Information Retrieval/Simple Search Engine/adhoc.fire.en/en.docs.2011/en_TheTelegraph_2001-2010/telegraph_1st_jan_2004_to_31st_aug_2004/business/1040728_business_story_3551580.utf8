 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 27: The finance ministry plans to leave revenue officials free to do their main job  chase defaulters and tax-dodgers. 																								Tedious back-office jobs in the collection of excise and customs, such as collation of data and auditing information, are likely to be handed over to business information processing outfits.																								We have to collect Rs 1,65,000 crore in excise and customs...we are looking at innovative ways and outsourcing of some activities, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after his meeting with commissioners of excise and customs here today.																								Starting last year, the finance ministry has outsourced back-office jobs like issuing PAN cards to taxpayers to organisations like National Securities Depository Ltd and UTI-ISL. The job of scrutinising accounts is being outsourced to chartered accountants. 																								The minister exhorted revenue officials to come up with innovative ideas and strategies to realise revenues and check leakages due to fraud or corruption, sources said. 																								The government was looking at legislative changes to tone up the indirect tax administration, the minister said but refused to divulge the details.																								Chidambaram said, We need more funds for development and infrastructure .... Unless we raise revenue, we cant fund development.																								Budget estimates for excise collections have been placed at Rs 1,09,199 crore for 2004-05. Customs collections have been estimated at Rs 54,250 crore this fiscal compared with Rs 49,350 crore last year.																								Officials said Chidambaram also urged tax officials to work hard to achieve the target fixed for their zones.																								The finance minister covered issues ranging from revenue targets to improving the image of the department.

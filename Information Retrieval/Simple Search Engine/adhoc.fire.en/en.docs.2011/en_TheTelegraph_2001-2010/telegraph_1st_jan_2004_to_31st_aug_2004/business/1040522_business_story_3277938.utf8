 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Pakistan bargains hard at tea party
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 21: Pakistan will import tea from India only if the prices are on a par with Kenyan tea. The Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) has put forward this rider to the 11-member delegation currently visiting Pakistan.																								The pricing issue has become a major challenge for the Indian tea industry, which wants to send more tea to Pakistan to boost its falling exports.																								C. K. Dhanuka, Indian Tea Association chairman and leader of the delegation, said, Our prices are higher than Kenyan tea by Rs 10 per kg. PTA says it is getting similar quality tea from Kenya at a much cheaper price. So it has asked us to reduce prices.																								Pakistan pays Rs 75 per kg for CTC tea produced in Kenya. But the same quality of Indian tea would cost Rs 85 per kg. 																								The Indian tea industry has decided to approach the new Congress-led government for some export subsidy on tea sent to Pakistan.																								We will discuss among ourselves how to reduce the cost of production so that we can make our prices competitive. Simultaneously, we will approach the new government to provide us some subsidy on tea exported to Pakistan. We do not want to lose the Pakistan tea market, the ITA chairman said.																								The high cost of production is eating into the price realisation of Indian tea. About 60 per cent of the price per kg of tea goes into the cost of production.																								In July 2003, the Indian tea industry had signed a memorandum of understanding with PTA for exporting 10 million kgs of tea in one year.																								In the first nine months, India has been able to export 7 million kgs of tea. 																								We hope to export 9-9.5 million kgs in the whole year. This is almost double the volume that we used to export in the past, said a senior tea industry official.																								In 2003, Pakistans total consumption stood at 148 million kgs of tea. Pakistan imports tea from Bangladesh, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Nepal and India. 																								With a consumption of 1 kg of tea per head, Pakistan has earned the distinction of being the largest tea importing country of the world.																								Kenyan tea constitutes 75 per cent of the total tea imported by the country. Since the Assam CTC matches Kenyan tea, Pakistan had opted to buy at a higher price from India. But the import was not on a regular basis, the industry official said.																								However, Indian tea is also smuggled to Pakistan.

 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Bank of Baroda set to go globe-trotting
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Shenoy: Going places																								Mumbai, June 1: Bank of Baroda (BoB) plans to expand its operations to 30 countries over the next five years. At present, it has overseas operations in 18 countries. The bank follows ICICI Bank and State Bank of India in its efforts to build up a global presence. 																								Indian companies are going abroad in a big way. It is up to the banks to assist these enterprises, chairman and managing director P. S. Shenoy said. The ambitious expansion plan is inspired by the increasing globalisation of India Inc and the gradual move towards capital account convertibility, he said. 																								At present, BoB has 38 branches abroad and hopes to enter Texas by the end of this year. The bank, which has a strong presence in Africa, including Kenya and Zambia, plans to put Tanzania on its map, Shenoy added.																								The bank will set up a representative office in Malaysia and China soon. BoB wants to convert the office in China into a branch once it gets the requisite approvals. 																								We have also surveyed Thailand. We will be present there before the end of this fiscal, Shenoy added. 																								The bank has tied up with National Insurance Company (NIC) to sell general insurance products through its branches. The tieup is aimed at providing value-added services to the customers of the bank.																								For National Insurance Company, which is now the countrys second-largest general insurer, the tieup means faster growth this year. NIC, which aims at becoming the largest general insurer in the country, has tied up with 14 banks for bancassurance. These include Vijaya Bank, Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, State Bank of Mysore among others. 																								NIC chairman and managing director H. S. Wadhwa said during the previous year the company had recorded a growth rate of 20 per cent compared with the average industry growth rate of 3 per cent. NIC has set a premium target of Rs 4,400 crore over Rs 3,417 crore in the previous year.Housing merger																								BoB may merge its housing finance subsidiary, BoB Housing Finance, with itself after buying out the stake held by the National Housing Bank (NHB). A valuation exercise will be conducted for this stake sale, Shenoy said.

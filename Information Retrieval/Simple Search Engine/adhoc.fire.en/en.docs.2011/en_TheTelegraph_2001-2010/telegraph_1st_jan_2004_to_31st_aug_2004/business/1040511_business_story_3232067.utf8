 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 UK card to block off-shoring
 AMIT ROY				 	 NATIONALITY MATTERS																								London, May 10: A trick a day. The anti-India brigade simply will not give up in its efforts to prevent off-shoring to India.																								According to yet another report, firms which save money by off-shoring work to India could lose out in the long run if a relatively small proportion of dissatisfied customers vote with their feet and switch their loyalties and their accounts to rival firms.																								A report based on a survey of 1,000 adults found that UK firms are alienating their customers by moving work to call centres in India and other countries. 																								The survey found that customers were negative towards firms which off-shored work abroad.																								Customers were at least four times more likely to change a supplier if they had contact with a call centre based overseas than those with no direct experience of off-shoring. The report also found that almost half were less interested in sales calls  cold calling as the practice is sometimes termed  which came from outside the UK, and the greatest level of offshore-related defection came from customers of telecoms and insurance firms.																								According to industry analyst ContactBabel, the outfit creating a niche for itself by providing anti-India ammunition, a typical UK bank could save 9.26 million a year in operating costs by replacing 1,000 workers with a similar number in India. But this gain, it argued, would be wiped out if only 0.3 per cent of customers defected in protest.																								As most people in Britain know by now, polls often discover what their sponsors want them to discover. Therefore, a question along the lines, Do you really want to talk to operators in India when this could cause job losses in England? or encapsulating similar sentiment, can be expected to produce expected responses.																								Nevertheless, such research is often dressed up as independent analysis. This is not to say there arent problems with call centres. 																								Steve Morrell, principal analyst at ContactBabel, said today: Most of the UK public are not against the concept of off-shoring and are prepared to give it a try. However, the experience has often been disappointing and has led to considerable numbers of customers defecting to UK-based competitors, which has made a definite and growing dent in profits  exactly the opposite to what these companies are trying to achieve through off-shoring.																								He added: Businesses should not look upon off-shoring as just a cheap alternative to what they are doing already in the UK. Some types of customers are as happy to call off-shore as they are the UK. Others prefer to call offshore only if they have an urgent query and the UK contact centre is closed. Some only ever want to speak to UK agents.																								Morrell also argued that too many firms were alienating their customers because they were using offshore call centres in an unimaginative and cost-obsessed way. If UK businesses do not address the concerns of their customers, the level of customer defection will increase and their profits will decline further, he warned.																								David Fleming, national officer of Amicus, the biggest private sector union, commented: This backs up research that Amicus has done which shows there is a growing gap of trust between customers and companies that go abroad. Management consultants and accountants who peddle the myth that off-shoring benefits the long term future of the economy are risking the brand image of some of Britains biggest and best loved companies. Nobody believes them and companies who buy into the flawed business case for off-shoring do so at their own risk.																								The trade unions are not impressed by the arguments of their own Labour government that nothing can be done to stop globalisation from which Britain benefits indirectly.																								The trade unions have tried different tactics. First, they said (honestly) they were concerned about job losses among their own members. Then, they said their concern was for exploited workers in Third World countries. Then, they said they wanted Indian workers to become trade union members so their rates of pay and conditions of work could be improved to British levels. Now, the tactic seems to be to play the nationalist card and persuade customers to buy British.																								What the trade unions seem unable to accept is that companies, British and American, are keen to off-shore  and the game has moved well beyond call centres  because in most cases Indians are better educated and do the job better. The only thing that is certain is that next week there will be another King Canute-like report, disclosing yet another negative aspect of off-shoring.																								Ronen Sen, who has just left as Indian high commissioner in London, said before departure that he recognised the genuine worries of the trade unions  to them a job lost is a job lost. He said he wanted to engage the unions in constructive talks but so far this has not happened.

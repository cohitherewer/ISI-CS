 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Rasna thirsty for 35% growth 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 26: Rasna, the leader in soft drink concentrate (SDC) business with a 93 per cent market share, is targeting a 35 per cent growth and plans to sell 3 billion glasses during the year.																								The launch of the 0.50 paise non-carbonated cola drink has given a boost to our sales. We expect a growth in demand during the summer. Our target is to sell 3 billion glasses from the present 2 billion, said Rajesh Mehta, AGM, marketing.																								The Rs 225-crore company will focus on expanding its distribution channels to reach out to remote locations. 																								We plan to increase the retail outlets from 11 lakh to 15 lakh, said Mehta. This will help us tap the vast 80 per cent non-SDC drinking market. We are also focussing on promotional activities with a budget of Rs 25 crore.																								The company is planning to expand its manufacturing capacity to meet the rise in demand. It is on the lookout for a suitable location either in the east or the north. Presently, it has five facilities in the west.																								Speaking on the scope of the eastern region for the SDC market, Mehta said that it is contributing 21 per cent to the companys overall sales and is giving a tough competition to the west, which contributes 25 per cent.																								We have over 1,000 stockists in the east and expect a growth between 35 per cent and 40 per cent in the region, he added.

 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Judge opts out of Birla will hearing again
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 19: A Calcutta High Court judge today refused to hear a petition on probating (legally authenticating) the purported mutual wills of Priyamvada Birla and her husband, M. P. Birla. The Birlas moved court for probating the 22-year-old testament.																								It was a replay of the proceedings on July 26  when Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee declined to hear Rajendra Singh Lodhas plea challenging the caveats of four Birla family members against the probate of Priyamvadas will in which she named him as her sole successor.																								Today, Mukherjee did not even take up a supplementary application from G. P. Birla, Kashi Nath Tapuriah and P. K. Khaitan seeking court permission to file photocopies of the mutual wills with the probate petition. The matters have been assigned to acting chief justice Ajay Nath Roy. 																								The joint wills were not registered. There is a concern over the safety of the documents. So, we have requested the court to give us permission to file certified copies of the wills, said . G. Khaitan of Khaitan amp; Co, the solicitor firm for the Birlas. The aim of the application is to eliminate the risk of the original wills being lost, tampered, defaced or damaged. 																								The Birlas have, however, given an undertaking that the originals will be produced if the court required them. They also requested that the documents be kept in safe custody of the registrar of the high court. 																								Debanjan Mandal of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm representing Lodha, has sought to inspect the mutual wills. 																								The Birlas claim that the couple made it clear in the 1982 mutual and concurrent wills that their assets would go to charity after their death. So, there was no point of her making another will and passing on the assets to someone else, Khaitan said today.																								Pratap Chatterjee, Amitesh Banerjee and Dhruba Ghosh stood in for the Birlas; P. K. Roy and Shyam Sarkar represented Lodha.

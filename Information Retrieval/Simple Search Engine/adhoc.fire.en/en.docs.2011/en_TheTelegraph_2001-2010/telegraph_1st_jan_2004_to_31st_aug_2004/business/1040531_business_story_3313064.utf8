The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Indian Oil plans separate wing for petrochemicals 
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 30: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is toying with the idea of creating an independent division to give a push to its petrochemicals business and move up the hydrocarbon value chain. This could result in the creation of a director for petrochemicals at the board level.																								Having lost Indian Petrochemicals Ltd (IPCL) to Reliance in the divestment sweepstakes, IOC is drawing up plans to emerge as a major player in the downstream petrochemicals business.																								However, at the moment, the business development plans for the petrochemicals segment are being handled by oil refinery experts. But the two businesses are quite different. The current view is that with the company poised to take a big leap into the petrochemicals business, it will need specialists to take quick on-the-spot decisions. 																								A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that with huge investments expected to be made in this segment, there should be a director for petrochemicals on the board. The senior-most specialist officer at present is of a general manager rank.																								IOC plans to expand its domestic capacities and make a foray into Iran as well. 																								The company has already started work on its Rs 5,000-crore petrochemicals plant at the Panipat refinery and the Rs 1,200-crore project at the Koyali refinery in Gujarat is proceeding on schedule.																								IOC is also eyeing a stake in a huge petrochemicals plant in Iran and the due diligence exercise for the project has started.																								A senior IOC official said National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran has offered an equity stake in an ongoing olefin project located in Bandar Imam. IOC is interested in picking up a decent stake that would give us board-level participation in the Iranian company, he added.

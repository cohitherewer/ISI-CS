 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Oil majors woes near boiling point
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 25: Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum have sent another SOS to the petroleum ministry saying they are collectively losing Rs 475 crore every fortnight by selling diesel and petrol at existing prices. Action on a war-footing is needed to bail the companies out, they added.																								Since a sharp increase in petrol and diesel prices is not a politically feasible option, it is impossible to ease the pressure on oil companies unless the finance ministry agrees to scale down the high levies imposed by the Centre on crude and petroleum products. Both central and state levies constitute more than 50 per cent of the price of these transport fuels.																								Senior officials feel that petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will have to immediately take up the issue of rationalising the tax structure on petro goods with the finance minister. 																								Given the politically sensitive nature of the petroleum sector, the matter will probably have to go up to the level of the Prime Minister, a senior official said.																								Sources said the oil companies have asked the ministry to find a way out of this impasse as they were plunging headlong into a crisis. 																								The Indian basket of crude imports has jumped from $27 per barrel in January when the prices were last revised to over $37 per barrel in the latest round of purchase. The oil majors have told the ministry that it is impossible for them to absorb this $10-per-barrel jump in the crude price.																								According to sources, Aiyer was in talks with petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi for the major part of the day trying to grapple with the oil price issue and understand the complexities of the hydrocarbon sector. Chaturvedi returned today from Amsterdam where he had gone to attend an international energy agency meeting. 																								Oil companies use good quality Brent crude and the cheaper high-sulphur Gulf crude in the ratio of 45:55 to keep costs low. The public sector oil firms import 70 per cent of the crude requirements, while the remaining is picked up from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India. 																								The oil companies have said with crude comprising as much as 90 per cent of the cost of petroleum products there is little scope for the firms to cut costs when crude prices are soaring. 																								Apart from petrol and diesel, the oil companies, including ONGC and Gail (India) Ltd, are footing the bill for the subsidy on LPG and kerosene.																								Unless international crude prices fall, the Indian oil companies are headed for trouble. 																								With the West beginning to exert pressure on Opec and the fact that US President George Bush cannot afford to see oil prices spinning out of control in an election year, there is some hope that the prices will return to realistic levels. At the moment, all eyes are pinned on the June 3 meeting of the Opec cartel.

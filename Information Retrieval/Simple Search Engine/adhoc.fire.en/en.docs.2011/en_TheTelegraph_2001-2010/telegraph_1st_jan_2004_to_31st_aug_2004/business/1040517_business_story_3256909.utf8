 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Hike not to cool prices: Opec topgun 
																								Algiers, May 16 (AFP): A production increase, upon which the Opec oil cartel looks set to agree this week, would not drive oil prices down from their current record highs, Algerian energy minister Chakib Khelil warned today.																								A possible increase in output following the May 22-24 meeting of the Opec in Amsterdam would not really drive prices down significantly, Khelil said.																								I have always said that Opec has satisfied the needs of the international market and that the price rises on the world market are not at all due to a shortfall in supply, he said.																								The rise in barrel prices is much more linked to geopolitical problems, to speculation, to the rigidity of the US market, to the US fuel refinery and distribution system, he argued.																								It is political tensions and market perceptions of what lies in the weeks and months ahead that are strongly affecting the rise in oil prices, he added. 																								Oil prices skyrocketed last week to record highs of more than $40 a barrel.

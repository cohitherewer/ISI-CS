 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Crude prices rise on Saudi pledge to cut April output 
																								London, March 30 (AFP): Oil prices today rose as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) most influential member Saudi Arabia said the cartel would proceed with its planned output cut.																								But nervousness pervaded the market as other members of the Opec said a cut in production could and should be postponed.																								The price of benchmark Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery rose 26 cents per barrel to $32 in deals here.																								New Yorks reference light sweet crude May contract rose 32 cents to $35.77 in pre-opening electronic trading.																								Opec meets in Vienna tomorrow to decide whether to proceed with its decision to cut production from 24.5 million barrels per day (BPD) to 23.5 million BPD from April 1, as gasoline prices reach record highs in the United States.																								Saudi Arabia, the worlds largest oil exporter, today insisted that the cartel would maintain its planned cut and dismissed suggestions that the high price of gasoline was because of a lack of oil on the world market.																								As far as Saudi Arabia is concerned, April 1 (cut) has been implemented, Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Al-Nuaimi told newspersons in Vienna ahead of tomorrows key meeting.																								However, Saudi Arabia faces opposition from its two main Gulf allies in the cartel, United Arab emirates and Kuwait, for plans to forge ahead with April supply curbs. 																								United Arab Emirates oil minister Obeid Bin Saif Al-Nassiri said Opec had not ruled out delaying its output reduction.																								Emphasising the splits within Opec, Kuwaits energy minister Sheikh Ahmad Fahd Al-Sabah said the grouping should postpone the cut.

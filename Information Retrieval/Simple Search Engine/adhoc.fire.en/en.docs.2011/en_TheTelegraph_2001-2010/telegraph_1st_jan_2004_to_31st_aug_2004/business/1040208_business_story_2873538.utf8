 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Feb. 7: The hospitality and tourism industry are getting together to create an apex forum that will debate issues of mutual interest.																								The move to form the Confederation of Indian Travel and Tourism Industry has been initiated by the Oberoi group of hotels in association with the Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Association of India (FHRAI).																								Oberoi group chairman PRS Oberoi said: The forum will consist of officials from the airline industry, hotels, tour operators, travel agents and even car rental companies. We need a platform to discuss issues of mutual concern. If need be, we will take up issues with the government. You will see something positive hopefully in the next six months.																								Shyam Suri, secretary general of FHRAI, said: Yes, we plan to form such a body. But preparations and negotiations are going on. It is still in early stages.																								Oberoi also plans to construct another five-star hotel in Gurgaon, near Delhi. We want to construct another five-star hotel under the Oberoi brand in Gurgaon (near Delhi), adjacent to The Trident in the 11 acres by Orbit Resorts, he added.																								Refusing to give details on the project, he said: We are still in the planning stage and we may have similar arrangements for the proposed hotel.																								Last month, the Oberoi group of hotels formally launched Sukhbir Singh Badals seven acre property, The Trident, in Gurgaon.																								The group has entered into a 30-year management contract with the owner (son of former chief minister of Punjab, Prakash Singh Badal) to run the 136-room five star hotel in the National Capital Region.

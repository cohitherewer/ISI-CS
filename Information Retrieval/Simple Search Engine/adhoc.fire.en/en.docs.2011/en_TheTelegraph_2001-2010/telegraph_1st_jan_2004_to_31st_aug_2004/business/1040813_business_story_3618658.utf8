Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 12: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) is considering allowing fire insurance companies to set their product prices, after introducing a similar policy in motor risk cover from April 2005.																								It is in line with detariffing the entire general insurance segment, IRDA member (life) and Life Council chairman T. K. Banerjee said. We want to let the market forces decide the prices of the products, said Banerjee.																								Currently, the premium paid for fire insurance is governed by a tariff structure as advised by the Tariff Advisory Committee, similar to that for motor insurance.																								But, after detariffication, the insurance companies would be allowed to price the products freely, although the regulator would be monitoring the price structure to ensure fair play and safeguard consumers interests. 																								Apart from that, IRDA also plans to formulate guidelines to include micro insurance, which covers people below the poverty line. Similar to micro credit from banks, micro insurance is given through self-help groups and NGOs.																								Currently, many self-help groups and NGOs are themselves providing insurance to these people but it is highly localised and the risk is not divided. Thus, if a major calamity hits a particular region, the groups themselves will be affected, making it impossible for them to fulfil their insurance commitments.																								We are not keen on giving them full insurers status. We will have to decide ways to develop micro insurance, said Banerjee.																								Globally, there are three models governing micro insurance  referral, agent partnership and full insurer. IRDA is most keen on the agent-partnership model, whereby these groups take up insurance agencies and market their products. They dictate the type of products required and the insurance companies decide on the pricing and other aspects. In such a model, the groups get a commission on the products and are paid separately for providing administrative support. 																								IRDA also plans to introduce corporate governance rules for the insurance companies on the basic framework of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). But there will be other adjustments based on the peculiarities of the insurance sector.

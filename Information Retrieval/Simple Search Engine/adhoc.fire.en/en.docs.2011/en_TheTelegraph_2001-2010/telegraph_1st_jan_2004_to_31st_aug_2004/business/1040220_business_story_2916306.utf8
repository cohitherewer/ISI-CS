 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Trai to penalise defiant players
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed the cable and broadcasting service providers to strictly adhere to the orders passed by it or face the maximum penalty of Rs 2 lakh per day. The regulator also clarified each aspect of its order passed last month and explained the meaning and steps to be taken as per that order. In case of any violation, Trai may give a direction that the order be followed after examining the matter.																								If the order is still not followed, Trai has the option of filing a complaint before the appropriate courts under section 29 and 30 read with section 34 of the Trai Act, states the regulators directive.																								In a three-page clarification, Trai said the order shall cover, throughout the territory of India, both for CAS and non-CAS areas, charges payable by cable subscribers to cable operator; cable operators to multi-service operators/broadcasters (including their authorised distribution agencies); and multi-service operators to broadcasters (including their authorised distribution agencies).																								The Trai was asked many questions about the role and its authority to pass an order on broadcasting and cable services. Further, a number of questions have been raised in regard to the underlying import of the provisions of the aforesaid order. We have made our position clear and it is for them to follow, said Trai member D. P. S. Seth.																								The regulator has clarified that charges mean and include the charges/tariff rates payable by one party to the other by virtue of the formal/informal agreement prevalent on December 26, 2003. 																								Trai has also said there should not be a reduction in the number of channels shown on December 26, 2003. If, however, due to certain unavoidable reasons, the number of channels is reduced, the charges should also be reduced on a pro-rata basis.

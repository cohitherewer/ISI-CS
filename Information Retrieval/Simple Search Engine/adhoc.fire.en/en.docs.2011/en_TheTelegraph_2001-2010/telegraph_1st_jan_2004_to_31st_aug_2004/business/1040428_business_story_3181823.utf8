The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Bank of Maharashtra mulls overseas foray
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 BoM chief S. C. Basu in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, April 27: Bank of Maharashtra is all set to enter international markets following its success with the Rs 230-crore maiden float.																								The bank has identified the UK and the US markets to start with.																								We are trying to open representative offices in the UK and the US. We have already made the necessary applications. Gradually, we will spread our wings in West Asia, chairman and managing director S. C. Basu said.																								He was speaking at the Banking Conclave  a seminar jointly organised by the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Calcutta.																								Commenting on whether the bank will be able to bring down its non-performing assets (NPAs) below 3 per cent so that it can give dividends to its shareholders, Basu said, We are optimistic. Our audited figures for 2003-04 are not yet out. But the trend shows that the NPA level will come down. As on March 31, 2003, the NPA of the bank was a shade below 5 per cent. 																								The bank plans to bring down NPAs below 1 per cent by 2006-07.																								The bank has kept a target of Rs 50,000 crore business in the current fiscal, up from Rs 38,000 crore in 2003-04. The bank expects to lend Rs 17,000 crore and mop up a deposit of Rs 33,000 crore.																								The bank has identified infrastructure, agriculture, housing finance and retail as the major areas of lending.																								The bank is also planning to add 50 branches to its existing network of 1,300. Basu said, We also have plans to become the corporate agent of a public sector general insurer.																								Earlier, addressing the members of Ficci and ICC, Basu said the banking laws need a complete overhaul for deeper penetration in the market.																								Even now, unorganised sector financiers, excluding mutual funds and NBFCs, meet 30 per cent of the financial requirements in the country. This cannot continue for long. The conservative banking laws should be changed. For example, hypothecation is an old concept. This should be replaced by a more modern customer-friendly product, Basu said.																								Ficci (eastern region) chairman C. K. Dhanuka urged Basu that banks should ideally adopt a debt-equity ratio norm of 2.5:1 for medium-size units to promote entrepreneurs.

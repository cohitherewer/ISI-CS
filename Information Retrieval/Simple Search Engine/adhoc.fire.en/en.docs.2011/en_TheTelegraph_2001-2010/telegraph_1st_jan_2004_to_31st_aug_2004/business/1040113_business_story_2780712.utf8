 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 TCIL plan to increase Hexacom stake nixed
																								New Delhi, Jan. 12 (PTI): The government today rejected a proposal that would allow TCIL to buy Canadian company TIWs stake in Hexacom, the Rajasthan cellular operator in which Shyam Telelink will raise its holding.																								We have not approved TCILs proposal to enhance equity in Hexacom, telecom secretary Vinod Vaish said here. The rejection of TCILs proposal will now pave the way for Shyam Telecom to ramp up its equity in Hexacom to 67.5 per cent from the existing 40 per cent.																								The move is a setback to Bharti Tele-Ventures, which had entered into an agreement with TIW to buy its stake in Hexacom for $22.5 million (Rs 102 crore). Bharti has applied for a unified licence in Rajasthan and was issued a letter of intent last month. 																								While announcing its intention to buy out TIWs stake, the company had also said it wanted to consolidate its stake in Hexacom as and when opportunity comes its way. 																								TIW holds a 27.5 per cent stake in Hexacom, which claims to have over 2.25 lakh GSM cellular subscribers in Rajasthan, and one of the few companies with no debts. 																								TCIL had given the department of telecommunications a white paper listing the options on buying the Canadian firms holding in a manner proportionate to the current equity pattern. 																								Shyam Telecom owns 40 per cent of Hexacom, while TCIL holds 30 per cent.

 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Power Finance dumps maiden offer plan
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, April 9: State-run Power Finance Corporation has shelved its plan to float an initial public offer as the government has asked for a premium for offloading 50 per cent of its holding under a share buyback programme that was to precede the public issue.																								PFC wanted to buy back the governments stake and then extinguish a part of the shares in order to bring down its equity capital from Rs 1,030 crore to Rs 500 crore before floating the IPO. The snag was the governments insistence on a premium for the buyback programme. 																								The buyback programme, advised by the firms consultant J M Morgan Stanley and worth around Rs 500 crore at book value, was designed to boost the firms market value before the IPO. 																								However, the government wants its stock to be valued at current market prices, which will strain the corporations financial resources, said a senior official of the company.																								The finance ministry has not accepted our proposal for the equity buyback programme at face value and so we have decided to shelve our IPO, said the official.																								Finance ministry officials, however, said the decision not to accept the option of buying back its own stock at face value is in line with the governments decision. 																								Last year, in May-June period, when the banking stocks had outpaced the sensex, several state-run firms had offered to buy back the shares from the government at face value.																								The government, however, rejected the offer as the market prices were several times more than the book value.																								Power Finance Corps chairman, A. A. Khan said the plan was to float an IPO two to three months after the share buyback.																								PFCs IPO would have helped the firm raise about Rs 60 crore as capital on reduced equity, he added. He explained the very purpose of raising money from the market would be defeated if the company had to pay a higher price for the shares under the buyback programme.

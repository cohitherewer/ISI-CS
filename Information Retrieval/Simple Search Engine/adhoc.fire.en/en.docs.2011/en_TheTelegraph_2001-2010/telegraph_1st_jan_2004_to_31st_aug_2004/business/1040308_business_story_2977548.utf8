 With bond funds in doldrums, mutuals are busy hawking monthly income plans, says Satish John 																								Sharayu Shroff, a senior citizen, is contemplating her next move. Alongside Sharayu is her daughter Pratiksha. They are at an investor meeting organised by a reputed mutual fund. 																								At stake are her lifetime savings. In the last couple of years, she has virtually escaped unscathed even as interest rates plunged downhill. Bond funds managed by leading mutual funds provided her better returns than what the neighbourhood bank offered.																								Being a savvy investor, she has stayed financially independent. Now she has to take a call on the monthly income plans (MIPs). Should she take a plunge, and invest in such funds?																								MIPs are a totally Indian concept in an industry which otherwise has borrowed heavily from the developed mutual-fund industry in the West.																								They are largely an Indian phenomenon, confirms Nilesh Shah, director and chief investment officer (debt) of Franklin Templeton Investments. Traditionally, MIPs have been an investment choice for people looking for regular income.																								The Shroffs swear by mutual funds. And their trust in them has paid rich dividends so far. Not for long, they fear. Their investment in bond funds may not yield a good return in the present scenario as interest rates have bottomed out, or are close to the bottom. Bond fund holders are expected to eke out almost single-digit returns as against double-digit returns over the last couple of years. 																								Mutual funds, aware of the discontent among investors, are sensing a huge opportunity. A flurry of monthly income plans were launched recently by several mutual fund houses to cater to the new need. 																								MIP is a popular idea. In fact one of the most popular in the industry, says Ved Prakash Chaturvedi, CEO at Tata Mutual Fund. There is a need for the idea to be managed,  he added.																								MIPs are entry-level products for someone who needs a little bit of equity. It is for investors who want a little beyond debt, Chaturvedi said at the launch of the Tata MIP Plus Fund. 																								It is not a short-term product. Its only for investors who have a medium-term outlook, he warned. He is obviously referring to the increased equity content in the MIPs, a calculated risk that may not provide exceptional returns in the short term.																								Says Nilesh, Changing market circumstances throw up new opportunities. With bearish market conditions prevailing for over three years after the tech bubble burst, a lot of investors had bought into fixed income-oriented investments which had resulted in their portfolio being overly skewed towards fixed income instruments. Investors have now started correcting this, taking on a marginal equity exposure through MIPs. This probably is one of the prime reasons for the spurt in MIP launches. 																								However, investors should take a decision after a thorough analysis of their investment needs, risk profile and time horizon, and not get carried away by the trends in the market, he said.																								These are fund managers who know the markets inside out. And they know the risks involved. The equity portion of the MIPs is around 15 per cent of the investment. 																								Chaturvedi says, There are times when we have reduced our equity exposure to nil. In February, last year, we increased our equity exposure. MIP is the most complex product for an asset management firm.																								Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research says the investor should not get into such schemes for the short term. Some of the MIPs with increased equity portion are at best balanced funds. 																								Sharayu has to take a decision soon. Considering the pros and cons....

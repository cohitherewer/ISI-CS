 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 US telecom firms keen to dial India
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 22: Telecom companies in the US that fled the country in the mid-nineties despairing over Indias tough regulatory environment are eager to shovel funds into the country once again.																								There is a renewed interest in India. Based on our discussions with senior executives of US telecom companies, we have indications that those investors are eager to return, said Ambassador David A. Gross, Coordinator for International Communications and Information Policy at the US department of state. 																								Now that the Indian telecom sector has stabilised and there is a well-placed regulatory framework, we expect even those who had left following the uncertain regulatory climate would also want to come back, said Gross.																								In the early nineties, when the telecom sector was thrown open to foreign investment, several US companies had stampeded into the country through alliances. These included US West (in BPL Mumbai), McCaw Cellular Communications Inc, AT amp;T International, Airtouch International (in RPG Chennai), Motorola (with Modicom) Distacom, Century Telephone Enterprises USA and Bell Canada. They were the major players who participated in the first round of bidding after the telecom sector was thrown open to private players. 																								At the time of bidding, two other companies  PCM Partnership and Vanguard Cell Systems  had participated but did not follow up due to the controversy that began in the telecom sector with the government deciding to place a cap on the number of bidders.

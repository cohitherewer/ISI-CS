 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Honda prefers to rely on Civic sense
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Joining the race																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: Honda Siel Cars India Ltd, the Indian unit of Honda Motor Company, plans to launch the popular Civic sedan next year, joining rival Toyota Motor Corp in targeting the lower end of the luxury car segment.																								Toyotas local unit, Toyota Kirloskar Motors, has enjoyed surging sales of its 1.8-litre Corolla model, which is aimed at buyers looking for stylish and powerful cars.																								The Civic would be directly pitted against the Corolla, sources said. The model would be priced around Rs 10 lakh and will also compete with Skoda Autos Octavia and the Hyundai Elantra, they added. 																								Sales in this segment are estimated at about 30,000-35,000 cars a year.																								Globally available in four versions and powered by a 1.7-litre engine, the Civic would strengthen Honda Siels product line, which makes the popular City sedan and the Accord luxury family car. It also imports the fully-built CR-V utility vehicle for sale in the domestic market.																								The Civic sports an SOHC four-cylinder, 127-hp VTEC engine. Moreover, it features a centre console and armrest, CD player, front side airbags and an immobiliser theft-deterrent system.																								Hondas sedans have performed well in the Indian market, which is dominated by small, low-price cars. It will invest about Rs 100 crore in 2004-05 to ramp up volumes and further increase the local content.																								Honda would be hoping to repeat the success of its City sedan, said analysts. The automaker is unable to match the demand-supply chain, which has created a waiting period varying between six to eight weeks.																								The additional manufacturing capacity has also factored in Civics volumes which is why it has required this kind of high investment, quot; sources said. 																								Honda Siel, a joint venture between Honda, which holds a 99 per cent stake, and the Shriram family, has a manufacturing capacity of 30,000 units produced in double shifts.																								In 2003-04, the automaker sold 18,386 units, which drove up its revenues nearly 60 per cent to an estimated Rs 1,600 crore and a net profit of Rs 70 crore.

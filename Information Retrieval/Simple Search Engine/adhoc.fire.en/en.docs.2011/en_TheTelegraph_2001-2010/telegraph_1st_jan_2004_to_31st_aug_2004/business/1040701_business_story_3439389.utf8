 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Caf Coffee Day to go abroad
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 30: Caf Coffee Day plans to open 42 cafes in 21 cities in India and 50 cafes in 10 cities abroad by the end of this year. At present, the company has 158 cafes in 39 Indian cities, which record over 30 million walk-ins annually. Post-expansion, the chain will have 200 cafes in 60 cities. 																								The investment in each of the cafes is between Rs 18 and 25 lakh and that is standard across the company, said Sudipta Sen Gupta, head-marketing, Caf Coffee Day. 																								However, setting up a cafe outside the country can prove less expensive due to lower cost of land, lesser manpower requirement and other factors, added Sen Gupta. The investments will be funded by internal accruals, fuelled by a strong growth in profitability.																								The company is looking at cities in East Europe, West Asia, South East Asia, the Mediterranean, China, Sri Lanka and Nepal to expand. 																								The company hopes to achieve the Rs 100-crore turnover target soon. The company will offer value-added coffees, non-coffee items, food products and merchandise. Food and coffee contribute about 95 per cent of the total turnover, while merchandise items chip in the remaining 5 per cent. 																								The company has been promoting various brands, including Levis, Liril, TVS Scooty, Himalaya Honey, Tanishq and Live-in jeans, through its cafs.

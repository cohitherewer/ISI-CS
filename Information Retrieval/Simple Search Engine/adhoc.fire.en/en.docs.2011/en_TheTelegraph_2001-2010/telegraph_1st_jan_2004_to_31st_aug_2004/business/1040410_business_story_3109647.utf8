 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Jaitley to seek tax holiday for exporters
				 	 Jaitley: Pleading his case																								New Delhi, April 9 (PTI): In a bid to provide some relief to exporters, hit hard by the sharp appreciation in rupee, Union commerce minister Arun Jaitley will meet finance minister Jaswant Singh early next week and seek tax sops, including restoration of income tax exemption.																								The two ministers are expected to meet on Monday, government sources said, adding that Jaitley may seek support for tax exemption for the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme and sops under section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act for income from exports.																								The proposed meeting assumes importance in the wake of the exporting community calling on Jaitley on Thursday to seek the governments support on the ground that withdrawal of tax benefit in tandem with declining dollar was proving detrimental to the exporters interests. Sources, however, indicated that the government was unlikely to take steps to arrest the rise in rupee.																								The Federation of Indian Export Organisation (Fieo), during the meeting with Jaitley, had demanded that the rate of dollar should be fixed for exporters for at least one year and exporters should be provided dollar denominated credit to avoid high interest rate burden.																								Apart from asking the government to take steps to protect the exporting community from the perils of hardening rupee, Fieo also demanded that the move to tax retrospectively the incomes arising out of DEPB should be done away with and tax exemptions be restored under section 80HHC.

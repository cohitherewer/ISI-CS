 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 US economy coming out of pothole
 Recovery path 																								Washington, Aug. 4 (Reuters): US consumer spending in June took its biggest plunge since September 2001 as shoppers shunned car showrooms, but auto sales roared back last month, offering hope the economy was leaving its soft patch behind. 																								Personal spending dropped 0.7 per cent in June after climbing 1 per cent in May, the commerce department said. Adjusted for inflation, spending tumbled 0.9 per cent. 																								By both measures, it was the biggest drop in consumer spending since September 2001, when shoppers retrenched in the wake of the attacks on New York and Washington. 																								However, much of the drop was pinned on autos and strong July sales figures from carmakers supported the view the economy would emerge unscathed from a pothole hit in June. 																								Still, the size of the June spending drop surprised Wall Street, which had been braced for a mild 0.1 per cent decline. 																								Coupled with an upward spiral in oil prices, the report pushed stocks lower. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average closed down nearly 60 points at 10,120.24. 																								In addition, prices for US government bonds rose and the dollar slipped. Investors saw the report, which contained a benign inflation reading, as bolstering the case for only a gradually raising of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. 																								The second quarter was a kind of disappointment and a lot of that has to do higher energy prices. That zapped some of the demand from the economy, said George Mokrzan, chief economist at Huntington Financial Group in Columbus, Ohio. 																								Many economists are confident the economy has already begun working its way out of a spending soft spot, but a renewed rise in oil prices could throw up an economic hurdle. NYMEX crude oil futures hit a record high and closed over $44 a barrel. Sales move up																								Spending on expensive, long-lasting manufactured goods plunged an inflation-adjusted 5.8 per cent in June, after a 3.7 per cent gain a month earlier, with auto sales accounting for most of that drop. 																								Fresh figures from automakers, however, appeared set to give July data a better tone. 																								US sales of North American-made autos in July came in at a robust 14.03 million unit annual rate, a sharp rebound from Junes slack 12 million and well ahead of forecasts near 13 million. Sales of imported vehicles advanced at a 3.18 million pace for a total industry-wide figure of 17.21 million. 																								July might represent one of the largest gains in consumer spending in many months, said Steve Wieting of Citigroup Global Markets. 																								The report on consumer spending showed incomes up a tepid 0.2 per cent in June, a slowdown from Mays 0.6 per cent gain and the smallest advance in over a year. 																								After inflation and taxes, the meagre income gain left consumers no better off than they had been a month earlier. The department said disposable income rose 0.2 per cent, but was unchanged when inflation was taken into account.

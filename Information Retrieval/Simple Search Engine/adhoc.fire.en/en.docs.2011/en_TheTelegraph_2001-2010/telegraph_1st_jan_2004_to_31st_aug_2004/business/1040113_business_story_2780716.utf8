 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 CMIE raises GDP growth forecast 
																								Mumbai, Jan. 12 (PTI): Taking into account the strong performance of the services sector and rebound in the farm sector, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) today revised its projection of the GDP during 2003-04 to 8.2 per cent, much higher than the earlier forecast of 7.4 per cent.																								We believe that the growth in real GDP could be higher than 8.2 per cent for the current fiscal, CMIE said. 																								The services sector, which includes telecom, transport and finance, would contribute handsomely to growth in the current financial year, CMIE said in its monthly (January) review.																								The services sector is expected to grow at 8.3 per cent in 2003-04 as against 7.1 in 2002-03. It grew by 7 per cent in April-September 2003, CMIE said.																								The agriculture sector grew by 4 per cent in the first half of the fiscal and the impact of recovery would be felt in the second half.

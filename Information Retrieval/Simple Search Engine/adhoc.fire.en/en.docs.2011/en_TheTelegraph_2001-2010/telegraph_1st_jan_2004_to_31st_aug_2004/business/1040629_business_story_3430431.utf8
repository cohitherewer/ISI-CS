 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Rs 386-cr Jai Balaji expansion plan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 28: Jai Balaji Sponge Ltd (JBSL) plans to invest over Rs 386 crore to increase production capacity and set up a captive power plant and a ferro alloy unit.																								The JBSL board, which met here today, has approved the proposal of trebling the companys sponge iron and steel making capacity by investing Rs 300 crore.																								Managing director Aditya Jajodia said, The company expects a substantial growth in the coming years due to the current upsurge in the steel industry. We are ready to invest the sum required to achieve this growth rate.																								Jajodia has also said the addition of fresh capacity may be done either through greenfield projects or expanding the current facility in Durgapur. The location for the new unit will be identified shortly, he said.																								The flagship of the Balaji group has also embarked on various projects to strengthen the steel making process and make it most cost and time effective.																								While the company is investing Rs 52 crore to set up a waste gas-based 12 MW captive power plant, it has decided to spend Rs 24 crore on a 15 MVA ferro alloy unit. The company will also invest Rs 10 crore on a coal washery project.																								Jajodia said the company would be able to reduce the cost of production drastically and increase its profit and productivity once these projects are in place.																								As of now, all our investment are in Bengal and we are happy that the state has taken a proactive role to streamline our funds, Jajodia said.																								Most important, JBSL has also decided to diversify into the mining sector for which the investment strategy is currently under preparation.																								Jajodia said the company has proposed to acquire mining rights for both coal and iron ore for captive use.																								Currently, we are purchasing raw materials from the open market at a higher price. The Centre has decided to allow private companies to go into captive coal and iron ore mining. We welcome the decision as this will help reduce our cost of production, Jajodia said.																								JBSL, the first steel company to have hit the capital market last year, has achieved a 117 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 7 crore in 2003-04. The company has registered a turnover of Rs 122 crore last year, a rise of about 48 per cent over the previous years turnover.

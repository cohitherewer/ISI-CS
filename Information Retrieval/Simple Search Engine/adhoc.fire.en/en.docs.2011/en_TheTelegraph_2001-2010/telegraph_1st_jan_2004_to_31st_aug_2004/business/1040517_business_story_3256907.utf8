 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Faster sanctions for debt recast 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Help in time 																								Calcutta, May 16: There is some good news for India Inc. The corporate debt restructuring (CDR) cell led by Industrial Development Bank of India has decided to sanction and implement the debt restructuring packages within 60 days for normal cases and within 90 days for difficult cases.																								Earlier, it was 90 days for all cases across the board.																								Confirming the move, senior IDBI officials said, The eight-member core group of the cell met recently to review the CDR process. It was decided to bring down the time-frame of sanctioning and implementation of the debt restructuring packages so as to help companies.																								The core group comprises chief executives of IDBI, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, the Indian Banks Association, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and executive director of the Reserve Bank of India.																								Officials said, Normal cases are those where the promoter of the company agrees to bring in equity, if required, without any hesitation and lenders too, agree to the promoters demand with some changes here and there.																								But difficult cases are those where even after protracted negotiations neither the promoters nor the lenders come to a point of agreement. In those cases it takes time to work out the package, IDBI officials said.																								A senior Confederation of Indian Industry official said, This will bring a much-needed relief to the corporate sector. Revival of companies whose financial health is not well will be expedited. 																								CDR is a non-statutory voluntary mechanism based on debtor-creditor agreement and inter-creditor agreement and covers only multiple accounts/syndication/consortium of accounts with outstanding exposure of Rs 20 crore and above by banks/institutions. The mechanism is applicable only to standard and sub-standard accounts. 																								However, potentially viable cases of non-performing assets get priority from the CDR cell. In no case, request of any corporate indulging in wilful default is considered under CDR.																								Proposals under CDR generally entail extending repayment period of loans, converting unserviced portion of interest into term loans and reducing the rate of interest on outstanding advances. The CDR cell also asks the promoters to chip in fresh equity.

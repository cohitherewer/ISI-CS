 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Drop in sales forces GM, Ford to revise strategy
 Stepping on gas 																								Detroit, July 3 (Reuters): Double-digit drops in US June auto sales reported by General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. will pressure them to raise profit-eroding incentives to ballistic levels and could also spur costly production cuts, analysts said on Friday. 																								The fall in sales reported on Thursday by Detroits two largest automaker pushed industrywide US auto sales to a nearly six-year low and added to evidence that the economy may not have been as robust as was thought in the second quarter, industry analysts said. 																								With (vehicle) inventory at critical levels, aggressive incentive spending will likely be necessary to maintain planned production schedules, Goldman Sachs analyst Gary Lapidus said in a research note. The automakers would likely implement ballistic incentives before cutting 2004 production, he said. 																								The traditional two-week summer shutdown of Big Three plants in North America will help trim inventories, which are about 25 per cent to 30 per cent above ideal levels, analysts said. 																								Ford will likely have to cut production next year, Lapidus said, but other analysts said both GM and Ford may have to cut production sooner, in the third or fourth quarter. 																								Production cuts have an immediate impact on automakers profits because they book them when vehicles are shipped from factories rather than sold to consumers.																								The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler AG posted a 1 per cent gain in June sales, thanks to strong sales of its new Chrysler 300 sports sedan, but it also has bloated inventories of unsold vehicles. Any increase in incentives by GM and Ford will also press Chrysler to match the offers. 																								Big Three production cuts would hurt earnings at suppliers also, said UBS analyst Rob Hinchliffe. The risk at this point is maybe the suppliers dont make their numbers for the full year, he told Reuters. 																								GM offered in June incentives averaging about $4,091 per vehicle, which includes interest-free loans for terms of up to 5 years on many of its 2004 models, according to Autodata, which tracks industry incentives. Slower growth																								Ford has been offering substantially lower incentives than GM, an average of $3,679 in June, according to Autodata. But Ford will have to narrow the incentive gap with GM as it ramps up production of its top-selling F-Series pickup truck, said Lloyd Hansen, Fords vice-president in charge of incentives and marketing. 																								We have a lot more of them (pickups) to sell ... so we will become more competitive on incentives, Hansen said. 																								GM trimmed its incentives in June, which analysts said contributed to its weak sales last month. Chrysler also cut its incentives, while Ford increased discounts. 																								The sudden drop in car sales added to evidence that spending by US consumers slowed in June. The two largest US retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., warned of weaker-then-expected stores sales for June, but blamed the shortfall on cooler weather. 																								Were looking for a slightly weaker second quarter than we previously had, said Bank One senior economist Peter Glassman. It sort of pushed that growth that we expected toward the second half of the year.																								Other automakers, including Japans Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Volkswagen AG, and Fords Jaguar and Land Rover brands, were also hit by the sudden downturn in June sales. Mitsubishi, which suffered a 48 per cent drop in June sales and has been hit by a scandal in Japan over recalled cars there, offered a longer warranty on its vehicles sold in the United States. Mitsubishi will also offer free routine maintenance, such as oil and filter changes and tire rotation, for three years for cars and SUVs sold over the next two months. 																								With interest rates on the rise, analysts expect more of Mitsubishis type of unique incentive offers as a means of backing away from interest-free loans.

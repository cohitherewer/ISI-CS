The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Tax breaks spark food unit rush
 RAJA GHOSHAL  Thirst for goodies 																								New Delhi, July 11: Palaniappan Chidambarams planned investment commission never had it so easy. 																								A tax holiday announced in this years budget for food industry has seen Pepsi Foods deciding on setting up brand new Frito Lay amp; Tropicana factories here.																								Big-time food processing players like Dabur Foods and Rasna are also planning to make the most of the tax holiday.																								The finance minister has proposed a tax holiday for the agro-processing industry for the next five years, followed by a 25 per cent deduction for the subsequent five years.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Abhiram Seth, Pepsis executive director, said, Yes, we will be putting up new capacity building plants for our Frito Lay business, which primarily makes potato chips. 																								Since the tax holiday will be applicable to new units, the company will definitely think of putting up new plants, as the tax holiday scheme is very attractive, which can lead to building up the much-required scale for the business, said Seth. 																								The tax holiday will also be beneficial for Tropicana  Pepsis juice business. Right now, apart from some tropical foods, concentrates are imported. This move will help us accelerate the capacity building process for our juice business. 																								Simply put, Pepsi, which has already started sourcing its concentrates from indigenous growers, is expected to do more of it with the tax holiday. This will justify a strong backward integration for its juice business. But the cola giants executives remained tight-lipped on the money they would be pumping into these areas. 																								Sources at Dabur India and Dabur Foods said the move will give a major boost to Dabur Foods, which is already in the process of setting up its new plant near Siliguri. 																								Pizuz Khambatta, chairman and managing director, Rasna International, said the tax holiday offered for the agro processed food industry will directly benefit Rasna, as the ingredients for a large chunk of its products are derived from processing fruit products. 																								The announcement of the national horticulture mission is also a beneficial decision for the food processing industry, said Khambatta. 																								Under section 80-IB, 100 per cent tax deduction for the next five years and a 25 percent deduction in the subsequent five years from profits is allowed for undertakings in processing, preservation and packaging of fruits and vegetables. 																								The new provision will come into effect from April 1, 2005 and will apply in relation to assessment year 2006-07. 																								The deduction will be available from the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the undertaking starts such business. 																								According to the provisions of section 80-IB, deduction is only available in respect of profits and gains of undertakings engaged in refining or production of mineral oil, undertakings engaged in developing and building housing projects and those in integrated business of handling, storage and transportation of foodgrains.

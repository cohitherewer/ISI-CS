Globally, GE is a leading player in the mid-market segment and what sets us apart is the capability to take asset and term risk.

It is targeting companies with a turnover of Rs 400 crore in India and South East Asia. Anil Chawla, CEO of GE Commercial Finance, India and South East Asia, said, Mid-market enterprises are going to be key drivers in the countrys growth.

Our estimates show this segment is under funded by as much as 42 per cent and the decision to invest in this segment is designed to bridge this gap.

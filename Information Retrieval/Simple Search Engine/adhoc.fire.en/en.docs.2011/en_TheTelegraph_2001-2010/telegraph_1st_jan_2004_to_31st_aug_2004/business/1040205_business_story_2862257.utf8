 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Bargain hunters help end stock siege
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 4: Bottom-fishing gave sinking markets a thrust upwards, snapping the four-day losing streak that has knocked 6 per cent off the BSE sensex.																								Institutional investors, sensing one of the most tantalising bargains in months, swooped on Dalal Street to make the best of the opportunity and drive up the 30-share index 135.78 points to 5756.76 in a see-saw session.																								Leading the binge were foreign funds, joined later by local mutual funds in the hunt for shares going cheap. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been utilising this opportunity to accumulate stocks, said Navin Roy of Taib Securities, a prominent FII brokerage. The turnaround took most market watchers by surprise. No one expected this kind of a jump. The surge in share prices has been widespread, Roy added. 																								The BSE tech index, which tracks technology shares, rose 3.26 per cent to 1225.02 points, a rise of 3.26 per cent. Broader indices like BSE 100 gained 81.99 points to 2937.70, appreciating by 2.87 per cent, while BSE 500 gained 61.64 points to 2,229, going up by 2.84 per cent.																								The rise in the sensex comes after it swung wildly and shed 6.2 per cent over the last four sessions. There is a lot of lost ground to be covered as the sensex is still down by about 8 per cent from its historic peak scaled in early January. 																								Gainers managed to lead losers by a thin margin of 909 to 849 scrips. The market will continue to be range-bound, said dealers. It will consolidate at current levels before breaking out again.																								Among the gainers today were bike major Hero Honda Motors, car major Maruti Udyog and commercial vehicle major Tata Motors. Tata Motors gained Rs 32.10 to Rs 544.55, Hero Honda added Rs 26.95 to Rs 461.25 and Maruti gained Rs 38.35 to Rs 444.55. Other index heavyweights to gain appreciably were Reliance Industries, gaining Rs 16.55 to Rs 572.45, while State Bank added Rs 20.80 to Rs 590.50.																								Infosys Technologies gained Rs 155.80 to Rs 5,369.35, Tata Steel added Rs 30.05 to its overnight close of Rs 416.10, while Zee Telefilms gained Rs 21.60 to Rs 156.15.																								Among the losers, Grasim declined Rs 21.80 to Rs 1095.10, ITC shed Rs 18.85 to Rs 1001.90 and Wipro lost Rs 10.50 to Rs 1517.65. Electronic notes																								PTI adds: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has asked stock exchanges to prescribe a standard format for electronic contract notes and modify bye-laws to make these notes carrying digital signatures a valid legal document like the physical ones, to avoid duplication.																								The current format for electronic notes prescribed by the exchanges was not in conformity with that for physical contract notes, especially for the pre-printed terms. Hence, members issuing electronic contract notes were also issuing physical notes which amounted to duplication and unnecessary reconciliation between the physical and electronic contract notes, it added.

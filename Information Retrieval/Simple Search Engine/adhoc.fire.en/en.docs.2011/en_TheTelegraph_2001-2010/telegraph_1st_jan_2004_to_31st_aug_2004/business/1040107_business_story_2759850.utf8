 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 PC sales log a million
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi; Jan. 6: Personal computer sales logged a 32 per cent jump as it crossed the 1-million mark with sales zooming to 12.58 lakh units during the first half of 2003-04. 																								MAIT, the apex body of computer hardware manufacturers, has even revised its PC sales growth projection for 2003-04 to 30 per cent from its earlier 20 per cent, forecasting sales during the year at 30 lakh units. 																								The catalysts for the spurt in the PC sales have been identified as recent drop in prices of PCs, increased consumption by telecom, banking, financial services and IT enables service companies.																								According to first half results for the fiscal 2003-04 released by MAIT, the trend of increased PC purchase in smaller towns and cities, witnessed last year continues undiminished. Entry level prices of PCs have dropped to Rs 20,000; notebooks to Rs 50,000; servers to less than Rs 1 lakh. Price drops were also witnessed for inkjet and laser printers.																								Commenting on the findings of the study, MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta said: While the mood in the industry is upbeat today, we are still lagging in terms of volumes required to be internationally competitive. This becomes even more critical when the health of the IT industry and its proliferation is a key indicator of the competitiveness of a nation.																								The assembled PCs, the smaller lesser-known regional brands and unbranded systems, accounted for 57 per cent of the PC sales in first half. In absolute terms, the sales of the assembled brands grew by 57 per cent. 																								The proportion of the assembled PC sales grew from 48 per cent. Indian brands accounted for 20 per cent of the market against 22 per cent share in first half of 2002-03. 																								Although the proportion of the Indian brands declined, the absolute consumption grew 20 per cent.																								The MNC brands registered a fall in their market-share, from 30 per cent in the first half of 2002-03 to 23 per cent, whereas sales grew 1 per cent. The drop in share can be attributed to the cannibalisation of their share by the unorganised sector.

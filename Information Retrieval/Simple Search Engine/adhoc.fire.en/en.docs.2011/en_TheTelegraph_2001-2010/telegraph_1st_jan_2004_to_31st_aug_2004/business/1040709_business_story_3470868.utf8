 Friday, July 09, 2004 Goes to the root of growth
The captains rate Chidambaram highly, lauding him for the way he has blended rural imperatives with industrial priorities. Some feel he has sown the seeds of a boom in the backwaters; others rave about how doors to foreign capital have been opened wide in key areas. The upshot: PC couldnt have re-booted any better.Kumar Mangalam Birla
Aditya Birla group chiefThe finance minister has created an enabling growth environment through the Union Budget for 2004-05 that contains a lot of positives. Apart from the fact that the reform process has continued unabated, the budget has also focussed upon fiscal prudence. Moreover, it has a great human face that can be seen from the stress on universal access to basic education and healthcare. While the selective disinvestment is in line with the governments stated reform policy, the focus on rural sector will have a positive effect on the entire economy.8/10Sanjiv Goenka
VC, RPG EnterprisesThe Union Budget 2004-05 scripts a new strategy for growth of the economy  involving the entire country and all the stakeholders. It does not confine growth to 26 or 27 cities. It is a growth model for the entire country. It emphasises and focuses on the economy, infrastructure, education, power, roads and telecom. The budget has a firm commitment on implementation of value-added tax. It raises foreign direct investment limits on telecom, civil aviation and insurance. Strategically, it is a very good budget. I feel very good about it.9.5/10B. M. Khaitan
Chairman, Williamson MagorIt is a good budget. The finance minister has focused on accelerated growth of agriculture, agro-processing industry and rural infrastructure. He has given duty exemptions to farm equipment, which will boost agricultural production and in turn stimulate the industrial production. He has taken ahead the reforms process rather than stalling it. It is a growth-oriented budget. Raising the capital subsidy from 12 per cent to 15 per cent for the small sector is another good move. Extending customs duty of 5 per cent on imported tea machines will benefit the sector.8/10Percy Siganporia
MD, Tata TeaThe general budget, in terms of continuity, is a well-balanced effort, which continues the current economic agenda with two major initiatives. The nurturing and fostering of rural India  the weaker section of society and the low middle-class have provided a fillip to the growth potential of tea consumption after a lag of six to eight months. The resolve to balance the deficit is exemplary and sets the economy up for the next years budget. Expectations are that the Union budget to be presented in February next year will stimulate better economic activity.7/10Nandan Nilekani
MD, Infosys TechnologiesWe welcome the focus on the social sector and agriculture. Liberalisation has marginalised a large percentage of population from the benefits of an open economy. The focus on child education, basic healthcare and group health insurance is a good move. Education cess is also welcome. The budget lacks the required focus on infrastructure. It stands due to reduced revenue deficit to 2.5 per cent of GDP and a reduction in fiscal deficit. Abolition of excise duty on computers will help education. Overall, it is a good budget considering time constraints.8.5/10Habil Khorakiwala
Chairman, WockhardtP. Chidambaram has done a fine balancing act by addressing the concerns of the Left parties and continuing with liberalisation and reforms. The 2 per cent cess for education is a gigantic leap if implemented properly. He has sent the right signals to the industry and the world at large by raising the foreign direct investment cap in telecom and airports. We are disappointed that the finance minister has provided incentives to research and development in the automobile sector but left out pharmaceuticals. I hope he will make amends for this omission before long.8/10Sunil Bharti Mittal
CMD, Bharti groupThis is a path-breaking and well thought out budget with an eye on infrastructure development. The budget goes deep into the rural areas and touches the lives of most citizens. I am very pleased that there has been a major thrust at growth and development at the grassroots level. This budget is low on rhetoric and high on action and focus for the future. This is what the whole Bharat needed. I am sure the steps announced today like hike in foreign direct investment for telecom will hasten the process of increasing tele-density in the country especially in the rural areas.9/10Priya Paul
Chairperson, Park HotelsAs was expected P. Chidambaram, while presenting the Union Budget for 2004-05, emphasised on the growth of the infrastructure sector and the rural economy. I feel this is important for propelling the future growth of our countrys economy. A Rs 40,000 crore fund from a consortium of banks for funding seaports, airports and tourism with speedy clearance is a great step in the right direction. This will accelerate growth of the hospitality industry, and will help generate more jobs and revenue. Increase of foreign direct investment limit in civil aviation is also a good move.7.5/10P.K. Mittal
Chairman Ispat IndustriesThe reduction of customs duty will make imported steel cheaper while excise duty hike, on the other hand, will make Indian steel more expensive. This reduces the scope of the domestic industry to take advantage of the global buoyancy in steel. Domestic steel producers have been responsible enough not to increase prices in the last four months. Despite this, the government has slashed import duty from 33 per cent to 10 per cent in the last six months. Instead of allowing cheap imports, the government should encourage investment to expand steel making capacity in the country.7/10Shashi Ruia
Chairman, Essar GroupSetting up an inter-institutional lending group for infrastructure project is a welcome decision. The same could be considered for industries like steel, which provide critical inputs to the infrastructure sector. The finance minister has looked after all major aspects barring the requirements of quality steel manufacturers of the country. Rise in excise duty with reduction in customs will merely encourage low quality steel being dumped into the country. This perhaps needs a rethinking in the light of what the domestic steel industry has gone through over the last five years.5/10S.B. Ganguly
Chairman, Exide IndustriesIt is a social budget. The finance minister has focused on education, health, agriculture and employment generation. He wants rapid growth in the rural economy. The minister has tried to implement the common minimum programme of the UPA government. There is not much for the industry and he has not changed too many things as this budget is for six months only. Duty on non-ferrous metal is being brought down from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, which will help the industry. Duty exemptions on research and development in automobile sector is also encouraging.7/10Kiran Mazumdar Shaw
CMD, Biocon IndiaWe could not have asked for a more balanced Union budget. However, the real challenge would be to effectively implement the measures announced across all sectors, which will be a fairly difficult task. The budget focuses on the countrys rural economy and healthcare system. However, it remains to be seen that how allocations given to the respective sectors would be used. The impact on the biotechnology sector is neutral and the benefits are very unclear. There is no real policy statement on the biotechnology sector by the finance minister in this years budget.7.5/10

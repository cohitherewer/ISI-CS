 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Wockhardt plans US subsidiary
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 20: Wockhardt today announced plans of setting up its own sales and marketing outfit in the United States to drive business in the worlds largest pharmaceutical market.																								The US currently accounts for around 10 per cent of the companys overall sales and the plan is to further improve this position by filing abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). It filed six new ANDAs with US Food and Drug Administration last year and plans to file 15 ANDAs this year.																								Wockhardt currently sells four products in the US that include ranitidine, enalapril, bethanecol chloride and captopril apart from bulk drugs. It has an alliance with Ranbaxy Inc, New Jersey.																								We are seeking an exponential growth in our US business over the next few years, Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala said. 																								Towards this end, we are beefing up the research and development, manufacturing, regulatory and legal infrastructure here, and establishing a sales and marketing organisation in the US, the chairman added.

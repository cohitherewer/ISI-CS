SSgA will act as an adviser to UTI Asset Management Company for its overseas investments.

UTI was on the lookout for big institutions since it wanted to be sure of the credibility of the partner before selecting a competent adviser. SSgA provides investment strategies to clients worldwide and has $1.2 trillion in assets under management. We are excited to work with UTI which has the countrys largest retail base. We are sure this is just the beginning of a long and successful relationship, said Vincent Duhamel, chief executive, SSgA Asia.

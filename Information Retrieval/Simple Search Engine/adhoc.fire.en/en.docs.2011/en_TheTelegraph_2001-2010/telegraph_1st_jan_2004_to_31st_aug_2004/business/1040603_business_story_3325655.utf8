 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Airport FDI hits air pocket
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Patel in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, June 2: The civil aviation ministry today said it would slash the level of foreign direct investment allowed in the countrys two main airports  Delhi and Mumbai  from 74 per cent to 49 per cent so that the combined Indian ownership would remain in a majority.																								The ministry also said it wanted to complete multi-billion-dollar deals to buy around 60 new aircraft for the two state-run carriers within this year. It will, however, try to negotiate a lower price with rival manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.																								Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who made the announcements, said the Congress-led government would also come out with an aviation policy by the year-end. He also promised to review the foreign investment level allowed in domestic private carriers and their overseas operations. The previous government had allowed Jet and Sahara to fly short haul to South Asian neighbours like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal.																								The decision on airport investments was announced after Patel held an hour-long meeting with CPI leaders on this issue. The earlier BJP-led government had allowed up to 74 per cent stake in airports despite security objections from the home and defence ministries.																								The government will retain a 26 per cent stake through the state-run Airports Authority of India, while another 25 per cent stake will be held by Indians, including financial institutions.																								The earlier government had decided to allow 74 per cent foreign investment. Our government has decided that a minimum of 51 per cent equity should remain in our hands, Patel said.																								However, analysts said despite this, foreign investors would be owners of the single largest block of shares and would actually control the management of these two airports. This is the reason why we still have some reservations .... there are security issues attached to foreign control, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said. 																								However, most left leaders have accepted the new formula suggested as it leaves room for Indian shareholders to join hands with the government to easily take over control in case of any emergency situations.																								Besides, civil aviation ministry officials said all bidders would be vetted by the countrys two premier intelligence agencies to address concerns about the unsuitability of foreign investors who may buy stakes in these airports.

 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Seeds of hope for farm deal
																								Paris, July 11 (AP): India and five key trade powers today said there was some convergence of ideas on a global framework for a deal after a meeting here, but warned that much more work was needed to get an accord by the July 31 deadline.																								Officials from the US, European Union, India and Australia were speaking after two days of talks in the French capital hosted by Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim.																								The informal meeting was aimed at making progress towards a deal, outlining how import tariffs and subsidies are to be cut in future negotiations on a new trade treaty. We saw enough convergence of ideas that might enable us to come to a result, Amorim said.																								The five, along with other WTO members, see a framework deal by July 31 as essential to keep the Doha round of global trade negotiations on track.

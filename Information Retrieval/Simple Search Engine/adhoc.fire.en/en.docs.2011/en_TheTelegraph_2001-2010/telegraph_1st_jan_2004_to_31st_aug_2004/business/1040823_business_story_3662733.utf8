 VIVEK NAIR 																								Mumbai, Aug. 22: Spaces, the home linen brand of Welspun India, is exploring the possibility of bringing in a reputed international brand to enhance its suite of offerings, apart from a strong retail focus.																								Since its launch in September last year in a market dominated by the unorganised sector on one hand and tough competition from behemoths like Bombay Dyeing on the other, the retail focus of Spaces has been centered around concept corners and shop-in-shops in premium retail outlets and malls. 																								This initiative stemmed from the fact that todays consumers are more demanding than earlier ones, director Deepali Goenka told The Telegraph.																								A consumer knows what he/she wants, she said, while explaining the radical change in the sector over the years. 																								Spaces is now offering a wide range of products in bed and bath linen. These include bed sheets, pillow covers, quilts, towels, bathrobes, tub mats and bathroom accessories. In the living, dining and kitchen linen category, the products include curtains, rugs, table covers and table mats.																								According to Welspun officials, since its launch, the brand has focused on a fashion conscious approach in home furnishing with design co-ordinated theme being a key element of its strategy.																								We are not treating home furnishings as a mere commodity product. We have worked with a lot of care and pay attention to consumer feedback, Goenka said.																								It has concentrated on international design, apart from building up a separate theme at regular intervals. The firm is now targeting around 30 per cent market share in the home furnishings segment.																								 Analysts currently put the size of the bed and bath market at Rs 1,800 crore, growing at over 25 per cent annually.

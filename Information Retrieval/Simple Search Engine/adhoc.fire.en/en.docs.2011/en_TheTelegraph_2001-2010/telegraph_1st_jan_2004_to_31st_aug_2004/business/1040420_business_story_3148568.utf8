																								New Delhi, April 19 (PTI): Banks may approach the government to further strengthen the Securitisation Act, which apparently got diluted with the waiver of a provision requiring defaulters to deposit 75 per cent of the loan amount with the court while appealing against the seizure order.																								We will take it up at the next meeting of the Indian Banks Association and then with the new government, an official of a PSU bank said. While welcoming the Supreme Court judgement upholding the constitutional validity of the Securitisation Act, another banker said, the initial fear psychosis, which was there in the act, would wean away with waiver of section 17(2) by the court.																								The process of recovery would be hit since defaulters are now more free to move courts and there would be roadblocks in the form of frequent judicial intervention to the recovery of NPAs, now at over Rs 1,00,000 crore.																								Another banker said big fish would now be able to buy more time as the act has become toothless with the removal of the punitive section.																								Moreover, the opportunity costs would go up for the needy sectors since banks would hereafter be doubly careful while lending funds to them, he said.																								The bankers also expressed the need for a robust credit information bureau (CIB), which would enable them to track defaulters and credit profile of borrowers before lending.																								With the adoption of new norms for capital impairment stipulating the 90-day norms instead of 180 days for a loan to be declared as NPA, the official said banks would now be more careful since we are dealing with public money.																								Dont blame us (bankers), if the credit-deposit goes down, the banker added.																								With the revival of certain sectors in which they faced maximum problems, bankers said there would be a flush of demand, especially from the small and medium enterprises for their working capital. Having burnt fingers in the past, we will extend the required support but only after a thorough verification of the antecedents of the borrower, they said.																								In this regard, the CIBs role would become more prominent since there could be better information sharing among banks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Curtains go up on mother of maiden offers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 28: Tata Consultancy Services initial public offering will open for bidding tomorrow to raise an estimated Rs 5,000 crore from the primary market.																								The offer  for 5.54 crore shares of Re 1 each at an indicative price band of Rs 775-900  closes on August 5. 																								Roadshows in North America and Europe for Indias biggest-ever maiden flotation have just kicked off. Fifteen per cent of the shares will be given under a greenshoe option. 																								The book-built issue is expected to provide a better price discovery as prospective buyers will bid at the indicative price range through market intermediaries. Investors have heard the TCS story. They like what they heard, said an investment banker close to the issue. 																								Many high-networth investors have been sounded, and efforts to get small investors to buy the shares are on. In brokerage houses, the application forms were being distributed today as excitement about the issue peaked.																								At least 60 per cent of the shares on the block will be allocated on a discretionary basis to qualified institutional buyers and 15 per cent to high-networth investors. Another 25 per cent has been reserved for allocation on a proportionate basis to retail individual bidders.																								Of the 4.99 crore shares on offer, 2.99 crore will go to qualified institutional bidders and around 74.86 lakh to non-institutional bidders or high-networth individuals; 55.45 lakh shares are for staff of TCS and Tata Sons.																								The roadshows in Asian financial capitals are over and TCS teams are heading for Europe and the US, a source said. Market mavens have kept their fingers crossed for Thursday. Many expect it to be oversold on Day One itself, like the public offers that hit the market in March this year. The government had offloaded shares in several state-owned companies in these issues.																								The TCS offer comprises fresh issue of 2.27 crore shares and an offer-for-sale of 3.26 crore shares by Tata Sons, the holding company, and other shareholders of the software major.																								Anticipation in the run-up to the issue has led to a rally in software shares. The fact that the backlash against outsourcing in the West is now more muted, also helped. 																								The company has said proceeds from the IPO will be used to pay a purchase consideration to Tata Sons, which will transfer some assets to the top software firm. The balance would be deployed for general corporate purposes. TCS paid-up capital is Rs 45.55 crore. Its equity capital after the offer would be Rs 47.83 crore.																								TCS shares will be listed on the BSE and NSE. Three prominent investment bankers  J M Morgan Stanley, DSP Merrill Lynch and J P Morgan  are the lead managers helping sell the issue.

 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Banks cold to rise in unsecured loan cap
 VIVEK NAIR Few Takers 																								Mumbai, June 13: The Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) move to relax the existing cap on unsecured loans has evoked a lukewarm response from banks. Last month, the RBI had withdrawn the limit on unsecured exposures to enable bank boards to fix their own loan policies.																								Earlier, the ceiling, including personal and corporate loans, was set at 15 per cent of total advances. The removal of this ceiling has come at a time when personal loans have been growing in excess of 50 per cent due to the stress laid by nearly all the banks on retail advances.																								Despite the RBI move, most of the banks are not considering an upward revision at least over the medium-term. The rationale is simple: even when the 15 per cent ceiling existed, most of the banks were well within the cap.																								Moreover, banks are also stressing more on housing loans within their retail lending portfolio as they are secure in nature and have low non-performing asset (NPA) ratio.																								A senior official associated with retail banking at HDFC Bank said, Unsecured advances such as personal loans were not constrained by the 15 per cent cap. It did not act as an impediment. HDFC Bank had reported a 51 per cent growth in advances at Rs 17,745 crore for the year ended March 31, driven by a 113 per cent growth in retail advances including car, personal and commercial vehicles loans.																								Welcoming the change brought in by the central bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank group head, retail assets, Gaurang Shah said the bank had efficiently managed personal loan disbursals and this category has been growing at around 60 per cent despite the ceiling. Shah said the bank has no plans to raise the 15 per cent cap.																								The bank had recently announced consolidated advances at Rs 4,609 crore with personal loans at Rs 300 crore for the year ended March 31. In 2004-05, Kotak Mahindra Bank is planning to grow retail assets between 30 per cent and 40 per cent with personal loans recording the same growth rates witnessed last year.																								Officials of Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of Baroda also said their shares of unsecured loans were below the 15 per cent cap and there were no plans to raise the ceiling.

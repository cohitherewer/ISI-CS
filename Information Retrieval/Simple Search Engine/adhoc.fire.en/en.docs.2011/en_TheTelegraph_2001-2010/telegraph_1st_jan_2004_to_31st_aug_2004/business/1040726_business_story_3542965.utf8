 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Australian pact secures coal for SAIL
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Fuel for thought 																								Calcutta, July 25: Steel Authority of India (SAIL) last week forged a deal that will help it procure coking coal from Australian mining major Xstrata.																								The agreement, which was signed on July 21, will ensure steady supplies to the steel major at $105 per tonne.																								Industry sources said the Australian company will initially sell five lakh tonnes of Oakycreek hard coking coal by the end of the second quarter of this fiscal. The price is on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.																								The landed price, after taking into account freight charges, will be more than $135 per tonne. In the last couple of months, the freight cost has increased by over 44 per cent. Every tonne of coal imported has a freight element of $32, they added.																								For SAIL, coal imports, which cost Rs 700 crore in 2002-03, could be over 25 per cent dearer this year. Sources have also said the company has been looking to source coal through Glencore, an associate that is one of the leading international trading firms in the energy sector.																								The price at which Xstrata will supply to SAIL does not represent a bad deal, given the current prices in the spot market. Last week, Australian firms raised prices by $10 per tonne to $135, they said. However, Xstratas rate is almost double the long-term price of Australian majors at $57.15.																								The state-owned steel company has been trawling the globe for cheaper feedstock since February this year, when Australias Anglo Coal failed to keep its supply commitment on coking coal. In fact, SAIL had to cut production due to the disruption.																								Sources said the company, which needs to import around eight million tonnes of coal every year, is yet to reach a long-term agreement. Meanwhile, international prices are shooting up, putting an increasingly large financial burden on SAIL.																								Xstrata is billed as the largest thermal-grade coal exporter and one of the worlds four major coking coal producers. With operations in Australia and South Africa, it produces and manages over 70 million tonnes of coal, of which 50 million tonnes come from its mines Down Under.

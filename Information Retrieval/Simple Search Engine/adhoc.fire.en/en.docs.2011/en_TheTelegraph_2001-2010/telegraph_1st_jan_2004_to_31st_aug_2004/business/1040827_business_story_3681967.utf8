 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Hutch betters rivals on prepaid
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: Hutch today followed Reliance Infocomm and AirTel in slashing the local-call and STD rates for its pre-paid customers.																								The tariff offers new and existing pre-paid users to make local calls to any mobile phone at 99 paise per minute and STD calls to any phone in the country at Rs 2.25 per minute.																								Unlike the AirTel and Reliance pre-paid offers announced earlier this week, the new tariff from Hutch will benefit its customers more. The Hutch pre-paid subscriber would be able to call subscribers of even rival networks like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Tata Indicomm, AirTel and Idea (excluding Reliance Infocomm) at the same cost.																								The Reliance and AirTel revised pre-paid offer is limited only to calls made to subscribers of their network.																								Harit Nagpal, chief marketing officer, Hutch said, The new flat rate tariffs will benefit all Hutch and Orange pre-paid users whenever they call any mobile phone (numbers starting with the digit 9) locally or make an STD call to any phone in the country.																								Nagpal, said, We have simplified the pre-paid tariff structure by introducing a flat outgoing rate to any local mobile phone. We are also increasing the affordability of a mobile pre-paid connection when compared to fixed-line rates. This is a good opportunity for fixed-line phone owners to become first-time mobile users. The flat rate for making STD calls, irrespective of the distance, is also a strong incentive for people to consider making calls from a Hutch pre-paid connection over a fixed-line phone. quot;

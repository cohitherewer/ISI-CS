 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Nitish hints at please-all rail budget
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 3: Railway minister Nitish Kumar is making the arithmetic a little easier for finance minister Jaswant Singh: he has indicated that he will not only pay the full dividend for the financial year 2002-03 but also a substantial amount of the deferred payment of the previous years amounting to about Rs 2,780 crore.																								Kumar is looking to provide a slew of benefits to railway passengers if he does indeed get to present a full-scale rail budget  a possibility that looks dim at the moment with the government planning to come out with a vote -on-account to facilitate an early general election.																								The BJP conclave will take a decision on the elections at its meeting in Hyderabad on January 11  but both Singh and Kumar are continuing with their exercise to prepare for full-scale budget presentations.																								The railway budget this year will make everyone happy. We will not only continue with the off-season discount tickets for the higher classes, a few more similar schemes have been planned. The railways have been benefited from the off-season discount schemes, Kumar said.																								Kumar has indicated more customised tariff plans for higher class of travel and the retention of the existing rates for all classes.																								The minister also said that the pre-budget exercise has entered its final phase and will be completed as per schedule.																								Asked whether he would indeed get to present a full rail budget, Kumar said, It is a political decision of the NDA government and all the parties will have to sit together and discuss it. The process of preparing the Railway Budget began as early as September and we have received all the inputs from all the zones and departments.																								Kumar was speaking on the sidelines of a function here today where a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed by the railway ministry, the Gujarat government, Kandla Port Trust and Mundra Construction Company.																								The MoU was signed for a Rs 453 crore gauge conversion project between Gandhidham-Palanpur covering 313 kilometres. Once compeleted, the the distance between Kandla Port Trust and Mundra of Adani Group and Delhi will be reduced by 140 kilometres.																								The project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle to become a company called Kutch Railway Company, with an equity of Rs 200 crore. The balance will be raised through debt.																								The railway ministry will hold 50 per ent of the Rs 200 crore equity in the joint venture. The government of Gujarat will have a 4 per cent stake (Rs 8 crore), Kandla Port Trust 26 per cent (Rs 52 crore) and Mundra Group of Adani Constructions 20 per cent (Rs 40 crore).																								The agreement is part of the initiative to form National Rail Vikas Nigam to connect all major ports with the hinterland to bring down the cost of transportation and also capture the market share in freight that railways has lost to the road sector.																								We expect more state government will come forward for such joint venture projects with private participation. Already, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and West Bengal for the metro project have taken initiative, said Kumar.

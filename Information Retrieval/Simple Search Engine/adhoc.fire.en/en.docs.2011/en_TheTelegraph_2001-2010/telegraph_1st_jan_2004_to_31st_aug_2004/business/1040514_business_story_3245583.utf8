The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Petro twin selloff on slippery ground
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 No pump-priming																								Calcutta, May 13: Public sector oil stocks nosedived today on apprehensions that a Congress-led government at the Centre might rein in the ongoing oil sector reforms.																								While Indian Oil shares dipped by about 10 per cent, Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) stocks have lost 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.																								Other oil companies  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gail (India) Ltd, IBP and Petronet  who took the countrys capital market by storm only two months back, took a severe beating on the bourses following the drubbing of the National Democratic Front at the hustings.																								The Left parties are likely to have a major say in the next government. Since these parties have always been bitter critics of the oil sector reforms, common investors have a reason to be panicky, a former president of the Calcutta Stock Exchange said.																								Former Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who has got the maiden ticket to the Lok Sabha from Jangipur constituency, said, All indiscriminate privatisation of public sector enterprises will be halted.																								Mukherjee has also gone on record saying, If a PSU is run efficiently and makes profit in a competitive environment and not just by doses of subsidies and market manipulations, there is no question of privatising them.																								It is apprehended that the proposed disinvestment of BPCL and HPCL will be blocked mostly to appease the Left allies. Moreover, the government control will continue with the market forces having little role to play in determining domestic oil prices.

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Industrialists and experts at the BCCI meet in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, July 9: Finance minister P. Chidambarams third budget may not have paid much heed to the stock market sentiment and done precious little for the industry, but it has surely stated a new policy stance that may change the future of India.

The budget talks about a change in terms of the policies to be pursued to improve the condition of the poorer sections of the society. The earlier NDA government also wanted to do that but they chose to provide concessions to private investment with the hope of pulling up the poor, said economist Abhirup Sarkar while explaining the political and economic perspective of the budget. According to him, the NDA model failed to deliver the expected results with poor remaining poor and private investment failing to take off. 																								Economist Suman Mukherjee said that the United Progressive Alliance governments budget was prepared in the backdrop of the failure of the Naidu (Chandrababu) model in Andhra Pradesh. He criticised the governments decision to impose across the board cess to mop up funds for education.																								The panelists also put the various tax measures under scanner and did a cost-benefit analysis. A team of tax experts  including Rathin Datta, Rahul Mitra and Somnath Ballav -- from PwC looked at the direct and indirect tax measures adopted in Chidambarams budget.

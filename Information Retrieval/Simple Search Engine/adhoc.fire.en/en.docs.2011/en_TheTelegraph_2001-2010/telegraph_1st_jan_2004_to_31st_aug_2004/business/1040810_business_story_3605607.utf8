The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Auto majors open hatch on a new class of cars
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Aug. 9: Carmakers in India have started blurring the shadow lines that have till now divided the market into niches based on price and features.																								The telescoping is most pronounced in the B and C segments: the upper-end hatchbacks and the low-end mid-sized notchbacks.																								A slew of launches from Hyundai, Fiat, GM and Ford is expected to dice up segmentation concepts about Indias car market.																								The aspirations have changed, forcing a change in the pattern of offerings from the carmakers. Rationalising the segmentation is now clearly based on the consumers preferences, says a Hyundai Motor official.																								The B and C categories  which enjoy the highest margins  will bear the brunt of the rationalisation.																								General Motors recently introduced the Corsa Sail. Fiat India has unveiled the Petra while Hyundai, the countrys second-largest carmaker, is scheduled to roll out the Getz later this month. Ford India is planning to launch the Ikon Flair. All these models are likely to be clubbed in the B-plus segment.																								What is most important is that the price gap between the high-end models in the B segment and the models in the B-plus category will be a few thousand rupees. But the gap in terms of technology and safety features between the two categories will be considerable.																								However, price will be the differentiator between the cars in the B-plus and the C segment with the gap expected to average about Rs 50,000.																								The only major difference between the B-plus and C models is perhaps in the looks. While the B-plus models are mostly hatchbacks, the C category models are notchbacks.																								Carmakers are pretty confident that there will not be cannibalisation of sales between the two product categories because of the heat of competition.																								Says P. Balendran, vice- president of General Motors: We have pioneered the entry into the premium hatchback segment based on the Indian customers need for a small car with premium-class features. And it is not going to compete with the C segment models as a notchback buyer is different from a hatchback customer.																								If a customer can get a better-value car by paying only a few thousand rupees more, why will he go for a poorer version, says a Hyundai dealer who is very optimistic about the massive success of Getz.																								He reckons that the Getz will be priced at Rs 4.75-4.90 lakh while the high-end Santro model is priced at Rs 4.45 lakh. 																								However, the Getz is technologically far superior to the Santro. The Getz will be available with an engine capacity of 1300 cc against 1100 cc in the case of Santro. Fuel consumption is about the same in both the cars.																								The same story is true for the Corsa and the Corsa Sail. The latter is a 1400-cc car priced at Rs 4.59 lakh while the Corsa costs at least Rs 1 lakh more.																								Automobile analysts reckon that the entry level segment, which has been monopolised for decades by the Maruti-800, will come under pressure as the other companies are now trying to position their low-end B segment models into entry-level cars. 																								Peoples preferences are changing very fast. Two decades back, anything other than the old Ambassador was a status symbol. Now, they are looking at comfort, power and financing schemes that will help them make up their minds, they said.

 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Crucial round in court for Birla succession wrangle
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Lodha: Swords drawn																								Calcutta, Aug. 24: The shadowboxing is over and the bell has been sounded for the start of the real legal battle between the countrys first business family and its once-trusted chartered accountant.																								After lining up a battery of lawyers, both the sides  Khaitan amp; Company for the Birla family and Fox amp; Mandal for Rajendra Singh Lodha  are hours away from kicking off the battle over the assets of the MP Birla group in the court of Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta.																								Arun Jaitley will appear for us and he is reaching Calcutta tonight, said a source close to Birla Park.																								While Fox amp; Mandal is signing up a host of legal luminaries in Delhi in anticipation of the case finally reaching the Supreme Court, the Wednesday lineup will include local heavyweights like Anindya Mitra and Pratap Chatterjee.																								Both the sides were keeping the cards close to their chests and there was too much of speculation. The confusion surrounding the case also increased as the Birla family fielded a number of people into the battle. Now it will become clear who is fighting whom and on what basis, said an observer. 																								Lodhas petition seeking discharge of four caveats  filed by K. K. Birla, B. K. Birla, G. P. Birla and Yasovardhan Birla  in connection with his probate petition will come up for hearing before Justice Sengupta. He, however, has not objected to the caveats filed by M. P. Birlas sisters, Laxmi Bai Newar and Radha Bai Mohta. 																								According to the chartered accountant, Priyamvada Birla bequeathed all the assets of the MP Birla group to him  a claim that the Birla family has opposed. Lodha has already moved a petition to authenticate the will. 																								One part of the Birla strategy is to claim that the entire clan is a Hindu Undivided Family in order to pre-empt the possibility of familys wealth going to an outsider; the other stratagem is to move a petition to authenticate the joint wills of Priyamvada Birla and M. P. Birla. 																								These mutual and concurrent wills  made in 1981 and later modified in 1982  have been brought in the public realm, but Lodha has closely guarded the contents of Priyamvada Birlas testament of 1999.

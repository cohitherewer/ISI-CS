 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pawar: Relief rains																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: The scare sparked by the delayed monsoon has blown over: foodgrain output this year will be higher than last years level of 212 million tonnes.																								We will be able to make up for the erratic monsoon performance in July, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told reporters here today. If the rabi output is as expected, overall production could exceed last years level.																								However, the deficient rainfall early in the season means that the prospects do not look too hot for sugarcane production, which has prompted the Centre to try and cobble a special package for sugarcane farmers in consultation with the state governments.																								The package is likely to be ready within a fortnight. I am waiting for proposals from the states concerned, Pawar said.																								The minister said he would be reviewing food prices that have been rising over the past few weeks stoking inflation which has jumped to 7.51 per cent.																								Pawar said the recent rains had improved crop prospects. However, there were still some worries about the situation in western Uttar Pradesh.																								The minister said although delayed rains had blighted sugarcane prospects, sugar stocks were comfortable. He added that next years production would be higher because of the delayed rains this year. 																								The sugarcane plantation acreage has shrunk this year to 37.36 lakh hectares from 46.22 lakh hectares last year.																								Maharashtra and western Uttar Pradesh are the two prime sugarcane producing regions in the country, which have been affected by deficient rains this year. 																								The minister, however, ruled out sugar imports despite a significant fall in production this season. He said sugar availability stood at 254 lakh tonnes against an estimated consumption of 175-180 lakh tonnes. 																								He also ruled out a cut in import duty on sugar and said prices were stable. There is no question of imports at the moment. Production of 138 lakh tonnes and the carryover stocks worth 116 lakh tonnes in the last season are sufficient to meet demand, the minister said.

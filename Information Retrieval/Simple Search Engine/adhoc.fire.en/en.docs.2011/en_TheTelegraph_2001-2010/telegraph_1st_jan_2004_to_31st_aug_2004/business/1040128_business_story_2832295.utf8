 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Identity crisis over for FIIs, markets leap
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 27: The markets roared off the block this tumultuous Tuesday with a 176-point gain in the sensex as jitters over the use of participatory notes eased and the finance ministers optimism gave markets the confidence that last weeks swings were indeed a correction.																								On Friday, Sebi issued a clarification on participatory notes after market hours, allowing foreign investors to invest in India without disclosing their identity.																								The two factors triggered short-covering by local operators amid stepped-up purchases from foreign institutional investors, said Navin Roy of Taib Securities. 																								Todays rally powering the sensex close to 6000 mark  it closed just seven points short  is different from the one in earlier this month. Gains are more visible among the index heavyweights, Roy said, while B 1 and B 2 stocks are no where near the highs it touched when the sensex had touched its historic high. 																								It also proved Union finance minister Jaswant Singhs remarks on the markets right. Last week, the finance minister went on air saying: The sensex is undergoing a correction and it will go up again. I am confident about it. Market analysts were surprised at the statement saying it was the first time that a finance minister was predicting how share prices would move.																								Earlier, finance ministers like Manmohan Singh have wallowed in their ignorance about the stock markets. 																								The 30-share BSE barometer that tracks investor sentiments in the equity market touched an intra-day high of 6005.54, but slid a shade below 6000 when markets closed. The markets are expected to notch up another 100-200 points in the next few days.																								Mirroring the sentiments, the nifty ended the day above 57.15 points or 3.09 per cent at 1904.70. Gainers outnumbered losers by two to one. Dealers, however, felt the gains were more apparent in the values of index heavyweights.																								Foreign investors were also apprehensive that participatory notes from unregulated markets would be banned from next week. As a result, they are making a beeline for such funds before the market regulator officially bans their entry next month.																								Many, however, take the current rise with a pinch of salt. The rollover of derivatives position will take place on Thursday and operators are keen that the margins to be paid will remain affordable. They are therefore pushing these stocks to reach a level close to that in early January.																								Foreign institutional investors have been mopping shares aggressively, having picked up shares worth Rs 555 crore in the first four sessions of last week.																								Local funds were not lagging behind having acquired shares worth Rs 425 crore in the same period.

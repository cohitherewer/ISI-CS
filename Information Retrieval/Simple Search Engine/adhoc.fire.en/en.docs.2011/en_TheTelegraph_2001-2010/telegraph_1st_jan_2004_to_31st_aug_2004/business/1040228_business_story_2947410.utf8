The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Small investors few and far between
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, Feb. 27: The government stake sale offer in six companies, of which five are in the fray currently, has so far bypassed small investors who have preferred to sit on the fence.																								Most of the issues had 25 per cent shares reserved for retail investors. Even these apportioned shares have failed to elicit an enthusiastic response.																								It is lower than expected, a merchant banker said as the IPCL issue drew to a close today without the usual last minute drove of retail investors with their applications.																								Market players appeared confused with the recent shenanigans in the volatile bourses as ministers and bureaucrats waded in to calm the choppy sentiments in the primary market. Small investors have stayed away so far. However, they usually emerge on the fourth and fifth days of an issue, said a merchant banker. 																								There is still time for them to participate in the offers as majority of the small investors enter on the last couple of days before the issue closes, he added. CMC will close on Saturday, whereas IBP will end its tryst with the primary market on Monday.																								Some of the small investors were waiting for refunds from Patni Computers to invest in other public issues. Others, who borrowed from banks to bid for Patni shares, were disappointed as the recent listing of Patni barely covered the interest costs. 																								Brokers allege that the marketing of mega public issues saw merchant bankers concentrating on bulge-bracket investors like foreign institutions, mutual funds and affluent players.

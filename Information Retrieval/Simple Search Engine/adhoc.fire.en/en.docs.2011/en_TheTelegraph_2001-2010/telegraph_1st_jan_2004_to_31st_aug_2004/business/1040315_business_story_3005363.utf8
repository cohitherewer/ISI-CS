 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Power boards asked to plug leaks for loans
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Tall bill 																								Calcutta, March 14: Multilateral funding agencies like the Asian Development Bank, USAID and the World Bank have asked state electricity boards (SEBs) to immediately reduce transmission and distribution (T amp;D) losses and upgrade the systems to secure fresh funds.																								The funding agencies have played a significant role in SEB reforms. They offer lines of credit to Power Finance Corporation, which pass them on to SEBs for specific tasks.																								Multilateral funding agencies are taking a tough stand on the transmission and distribution system of SEBs. They have categorically said the system should be upgraded for getting lines of credit from them, senior Power Finance officials said. The aggregate technical losses of some of the SEBs are as high as 50 per cent.																								They added that SEBs know about the matter and some of them are focusing on 100 per cent metering and putting a check on power theft. However, the problem still persists due to a lack of uniform technical standards of meters and an absence of vendor ratings.																								The funding agencies have helped in upgrading distribution systems in the country, especially in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Orissa.																								The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has also approached the ADB for a Rs 250-crore loan to upgrade its transmission and distribution network.																								The toughest roadblock stalling power sector development has been the poor financial health of SEBs, which is mainly due to a weak performance on the distribution front. Of the total energy generated, only 55 per cent is billed and 41 per cent is realised.																								The gap between average revenue realisation and average cost of supply has been constantly increasing.																								The average cost of supply is Rs 3.04 per unit and the average revenue is Rs 2.12 per unit. Therefore, there is a gap of 92 paise for every unit of power supplied.																								The annual losses of SEBs have reached around Rs 26,000 crore. All these have caused erosion in the volume of internal resources generated by SEBs.																								Huge transmission and distribution losses, largely due to outright theft and unmetered supply have amounted to Rs 20,000 crore annually.SEB drive																								WBSEB, in association with local bodies, has arrested 910 power thieves in the past four months. Around 1,06,225 illegal lines have been disconnected and 2,638 first-hand information reports (FIRs) have been lodged. On an average, seven power thieves are being arrested in WBSEB areas per day.

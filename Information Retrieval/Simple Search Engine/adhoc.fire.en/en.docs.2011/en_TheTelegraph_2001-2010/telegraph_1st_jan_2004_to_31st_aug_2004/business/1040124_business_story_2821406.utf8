				 Cement excise duty cut sought

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: The cement industry has urged the government to slash the excise duty on cement as it was posing an excessive burden on manufacturing units. 
																								In a recent submission to the government on behalf of the cement industry, Ficci has said, Excise alone as a proportion of ex-factory price amounts to anything between 33 per cent and 40 per cent per tonne. The average ex-factory price of cement is in the range of Rs 1,000-1,200 per tonne.
																								The cement industry claims that this tax is much higher than in other countries and affects viability of the industry as the burden cannot be passed on to the consumers. 
																								Statistics reveal that excise rates (16 per cent of the ex-factory price) applicable to other construction items like iron and steel, asbestos cement corrugated sheets, paints and varnishes are also much lower in comparison with cement.
																								Industry representatives say the per capita consumption of cement in the country is among the lowest at around 100 kg in comparison with the world average of 265 Kg, despite Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees commitment to the Golden Quadrilateral project and plans to boost infrastructure and the housing industry. A reduction in the specific excise rate from the present Rs 400 to Rs 200 per tonne is expected to reduce the excise incidence to 16-20 per cent.

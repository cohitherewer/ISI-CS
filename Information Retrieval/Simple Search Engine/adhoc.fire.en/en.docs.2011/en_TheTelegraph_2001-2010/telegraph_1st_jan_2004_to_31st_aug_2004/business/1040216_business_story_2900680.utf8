The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Ford gears up for launch of Fusion 
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 The blend of the  best 																								New Delhi, Feb. 15: Ford India will start manufacturing Fusion vehicles from August.																								The hatchback estate vehicle will, however, be launched in October during the festive season to take advantage of the huge increase in sales normally recorded during this period.																								The firm plans to import the prototype in April from its European manufacturing facilities for indigenisation.																								Officials said the new 1.4-litre Fusion will be priced Rs 6 lakh plus and powered by Sigma series of engines instead of the Rocam engines, now used in the Ikon model.																								Fusion would look like a hatchback version of Ikon along the lines of an estate car, sources said. Ikon is a sedan locally produced by the domestic unit, which is 85 per cent owned by the parent Michigan-based Ford, in Chennai. 																								He said the commercial production of Fusion is scheduled to start in August as it would take around three to four months to design and customise the model to suit Indian conditions and domestic regulations.																								We are pinning our hopes on the Fusion model which is expected to push up sales and turn around Ford Indias fortunes, said the official.																								Ford India currently offers Ikon, the larger Mondeo sedan which is imported as a completely built unit, and the Endeavour sports utility vehicle, but is yet to book profits.																								In 2001-2002, the carmaker has reported a net loss of Rs 60 crore against Rs 101 crore a year ago.																								Vinay Piparsania, vice-president of marketing and sales, had earlier said: We would turn around in 2004-05 with the launch of a new car that would offer the same volume as the Ikon series does. 																								Ford India has also entered into an agreement with Hindustan Motors to manufacture the Rocam engines for the 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre Ikon cars and gear boxes for the automakers other products.																								It exports completely knocked-down kits of the Ikon model to South Africa, Brazil and Mexico. The auto maker along with Hyundai Motor Co and other automakers are exporting cars and parts to make their Indian units viable.																								In the first nine months (April-December) of 2003-04, Ford India has reported sales of 13,915 units and expects sales of another 6,000 units in the remaining three months.																								The automaker also expects a similar number of exports in knocked-down form. In 2002-03, Ford India had reported sales of 14,970 units and exported 28,915 completely knocked-down kits.

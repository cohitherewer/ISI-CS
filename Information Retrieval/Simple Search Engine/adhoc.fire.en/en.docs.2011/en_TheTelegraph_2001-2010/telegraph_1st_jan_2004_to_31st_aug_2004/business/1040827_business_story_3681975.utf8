The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 ISPs in line of fire as users bend rules
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Basic blues																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: The government today cracked down on three leading internet service providers whose leased lines were being used by unscrupulous elements to offer internet telephony.																								The department of telecommunications (DoT) has slapped penalties of Rs 5.52 crore on three internet service providers whose leased lines were being misused by their customers.																								The three ISPs are Dishnet DSL (which is now owned by Videsh Sanchar Nigam), Spectranet Ltd (owned by construction company Punj Lloyd) and Primus Telecommunications India. A penalty of Rs 2.28 crore has been slapped on Dishnet DSL. Spectranet will have to cough up Rs 2.34 crore and Primus Rs 9 lakh.																								Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran has directed the DoT to take action on a monthly basis against service providers or their customers who offer internet telephony (phone calls over the internet) without a valid licence.																								The governments action comes at a time when internet telephony is catching on despite scratchy quality of the call. People who want to make overseas calls find it very cheap to use internet telephony with a call to the US costing about Rs 5 per minute against an average cost of Rs 14 on the normal international long-distance telephony networks.																								We will pay the penalty under protest, said Tilak Sarkar, chief executive officer of Primus Telecommunications Ltd. DoT has taken this step unilaterally. We had informed the DoT about many companies that were violating the terms of their ISP licence. We will make a representation to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.																								The DoTs decision is aimed at curbing the menace of grey internet telephony market and to check the flourishing business of illegal telephone exchanges. 																								Sanjay Diwedi, CEO of Spectranet, said, We absolutely disagree with the amount and the allegation made by the DoT. We repudiate the action taken against us. Our legal team is in touch with officials in the DoT and we have lodged a protest.

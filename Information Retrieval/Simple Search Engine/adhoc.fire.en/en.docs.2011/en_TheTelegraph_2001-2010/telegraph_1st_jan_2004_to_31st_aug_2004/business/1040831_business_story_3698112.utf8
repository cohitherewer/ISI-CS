 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 SBI balm on home-loan rate hike
 OUR BUREAUX				 	 Purwar: Soothing voice																								Mumbai/New Delhi, Aug. 30: State Bank of India, the countrys largest commercial bank, today raised the price of fixed-rate housing loans by 25 to 50 basis points and then tried to underplay the significance of the move with chairman A. K. Purwar insisting that interest rates would remain stable in the short term.																								The bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 8 per cent on home loans of up to five years. 																								The interest rate on the more popular longer tenure of up to 15 years was raised by 50 basis points to 8.75 per cent. Those who seek loans with a tenure between 15 and 20 years will have to pay 9 per cent, against 8.5 per cent earlier.																								The SBI move comes after market leader HDFC raised fixed loan rates with a money market option by 25 basis points from 7.75 per cent to 8 per cent for a 20-year period.																								The SBI rate hike sparked a buzz in the home loan industry with many speculating about the possibility of other big players like ICICI Bank and LIC Housing Finance raising rates as well. Neither chose to show their cards just yet.																								However, the rate rise caused some embarrassment to the government that has been earnestly trying to head off talk of a rising interest rate regime. 																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram and RBI governor Y. V. Reddy have made several statements in the past few weeks underscoring that interest would be stable.																								Purwars statement today on the stability of short-term interest rates was made soon after a meeting with Chidambaram in North Block.																								RBI has not changed its benchmark bank rate from a three-decade low of 6 per cent.																								Last week, Reddy had said: It is our endeavour to make market participants realise this and the system should be accustomed to an interest rate cycle. There can be interest rate cycles within overall stability, which bankers said is a clear signal that interest rates would remain steady, at least for now.Shift to fixed-rate 																								The SBI rate hike comes at a time when canny borrowers of home finance are increasingly exhibiting a penchant for fixed rates loans instead of floating rates that allowed many borrowers to ride the southward drift in interest rates when the going was good.																								Banks are hastily reworking their strategies as interest rates prepare to change course.

 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Dabur anti-cancer pills in US, Europe
 RAJA GHOSHAL  Aiming big 																								New Delhi, July 16: Dabur Pharmaceuticals Ltd (DPL) is aggressively pushing into the markets in the US and Europe to market its anti-cancer drugs. 																								The drug firm is following the same tack as established companies like Ranbaxy and Dr Reddys Laboratories, for whom the US and European market are crucial.																								The one-year-old Dabur Pharmaceuticals Limited, the pharma business of Dabur, which was de-merged into a separate company effective April 1, 2003, is in the process of filing its first abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for the US market. The company has already filed its first technical document for the UK market. 																								Dabur has a two-pronged strategy for entering new markets as well as establish its position in the existing markets. Since, oncology  or cancer-related drugs  is the main focus of the company, DPL is more interested in the large regulated markets of the US and western Europe, which form a sizeable market for anti-cancer drugs. 																								In terms of consolidating its presence in the oncology segment, in the global market, the company is working at the markets of South East Asia, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and CIS countries, said top company officials. 																								DPL has already entered into a strategic alliance with Abott Laboratories, whereby Abott will market DPLs range of anti-cancer formulations throughout the US. Abott is the largest generic injectables supplier in the US and accounts for over 40 per cent of the market. 																								Apart from oncology, DPL has a non-oncology branded generic business in India focusing on therapeutic areas of cardiovascular, diabetes and gynaecology. 																								The overall size of the Indian market for oncology formulations is estimated to be around Rs 225 crore and DPL has about 20 per cent market share. 																								The global market for oncology products can be classified into highly regulated markets of the US, western Europe and Japan, which account for a large share. The less regulated markets include Asia, Africa, CIS and Latin America.

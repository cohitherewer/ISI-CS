The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Firm brews tea auction hub in Dubai
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 2: Contemporary Targett Pvt Limited, the third-largest tea broking house in the country, is keen to set up an auction centre in Dubai. 																								Company chairman Prafull Goradia will be shortly leaving for Dubai to carry out a market survey for the auction centre.																								Talking to The Telegraph, Indian Tea Association (ITA) chairman C. K. Dhanuka said: The association has given the mandate to Contemporary Targett for conducting the survey because they have evinced interest. I personally met Prafull Goradia and discussed the matter.																								Contemporary Targett is willing to set up the auction centre if Indian tea producers assure a business of Rs 100 crore annually, Dhanuka added. 																								This will enable the company to earn Rs 1 crore as brokerage, he said.																								Contemporary Targett is an Indo-British company established in 1976. The company handles 55 million kg of tea worth approximately 40 crore annually. It participates in all the six auction centres and deals with tea from 200 gardens. The company was the first to introduce computers in tea broking.																								All the big names in the domestic tea industry  Tata Tea, Eveready Industries India Limited, Warren Tea, Dhunseri, Duncans and Goodricke  are keen to send tea to Dubai. They have already approached the Tea Board with the proposal so that the board can support the industry in their new venture.																								The decision of the Indian tea producers to set up an auction centre in Dubai has been prompted by the Dubai governments invitation to sell tea through Dubai Tea Trading Centre (DTTC).																								DTTC is being promoted by Dubai Metals and Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai Ports Authority.																								Dhanuka said a separate auction centre in Dubai will be a shot in the arm for the dwindling Indian tea exports.																								Before the blue-print for a separate auction centre unfolded, a three-member team from Dubai led by David Rutlegde, executive director, DMCC, Tariq bin Khalifa of Dubai Ports Authority and Sanjay Sethi of Sherowood had met the Tea Board chairman with their proposal.																								Industry officials said Dubai is a vibrant financial centre and the payment is guaranteed. A separate auction centre will help the Indian tea industry contact buyers in West Asia and North Africa directly and get a better price.																								DTTC will offer the members a range of commercial services to encourage firms to use Dubai as a regional distribution centre for tea, or run other value-added businesses.																								DMCC is working on structuring the Dubai-authored tea initiative to meet the needs of the Indian tea industry.																								Dhanuka said West Asia is emerging as a major importer of Indian tea. 																								In 2003, India exported 42 million kg of tea to West Asia and North Africa and earned a revenue of Rs 397 crore. The unit price realisation was to the tune of Rs 95 per kg. Of this 42 million kg, about 25 million kg went to Dubai.

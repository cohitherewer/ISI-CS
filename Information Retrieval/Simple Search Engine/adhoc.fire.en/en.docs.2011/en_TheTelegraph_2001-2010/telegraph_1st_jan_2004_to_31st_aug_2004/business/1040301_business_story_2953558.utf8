		 Monday, March 01, 2004  Q amp;A				 Proof of age
																																																																																													I am 74 years old and wish to invest in LICs Varishtha Bima Yojana. But I have lost all documents that could establish my age. LIC insists that I produce my matriculation certificate as proof of age. But does that mean people who have never been to school or have no age-proof, cannot invest in the scheme?																																																																													R. Dey, Calcutta
																																																																																													What is the minimum lock-in under Varishtha Bima Yojana?																																																																													B. K. Singh, Calcutta
																																																																																													LIC says people who do not have any document to establish their age must affirm by way of an affidavit their date of birth to invest in Varishtha Bima Yojana. The qualifying age for the scheme is 55 years. The scheme locks up your funds for 15 years, through which it pays a pension. However, you can borrow from LIC up to 75 per cent of the amount invested, three years after you have entered the scheme. LIC could alter the interest rate from time to time  its 10.5 per cent at present.																																					Rebate riddle																																																																																															I earn Rs 67,500 from pension, and Rs 84,250 from fixed deposits and MIPs. Could I claim standard deduction? What is the rate of rebate under section 88? Would interest credited to PPF account be treated as reinvestment and could I claim tax rebate on it?																																																																													S. Dutta, Calcutta
																																																																																													You could claim standard deduction of Rs 30,000 if your employer pays the pension. You could claim tax exemption on your income from fixed deposits under section 80L. Rate of rebate under section 88 will be 15 per cent, and you cannot claim tax rebate on the interest credited to your PPF account.																																					Have patience																																																																																															Im a retired teacher. I havent received the half-yearly interest on US-64 bonds. I had written to UTI several times. Please help.																																																																													P. L. Hisaria, Calcutta
																																																																																													UTI had sent a cheque for Rs 573.25  the half-yearly interest on your US-64 bonds  to an address in Howrah that they had in their records. Though you have stopped living there, the cheque didnt return to UTI. We have given UTI your address in Salt Lake. It will send you a form for a duplicate cheque .																																					Duncan downer																																																																																															We have received a large number of letters seeking help in recovering their fixed deposits with Duncan Industries. We are forwarding these letters to chairman G. P. Goenkas office. The company says it has not emerged from its financial crisis yet, but has plans of repaying depositors in difficult situations.

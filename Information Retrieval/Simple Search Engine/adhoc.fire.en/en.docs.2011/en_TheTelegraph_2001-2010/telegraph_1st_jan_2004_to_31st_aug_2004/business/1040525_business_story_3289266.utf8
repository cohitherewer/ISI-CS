 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Maran gains insight prior to taking charge
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, May 24: Political compulsions may have kept the communications and information technology minister-designate Dayanidhi Maran from assuming office, but the young cabinet minister is already in talks with senior officials to learn about the issues facing the ministry and the sector.																								He was in talks not only with the Congress leaders to sort out the issue of promised portfolios to the DMK, but also met senior officials, including department of telecommunications secretary Nripendra Mishra and department of information technology secretary K. K. Jaswal.																								Maran, who was staying with DMK leader K. Karunanidhi in a hotel till yesterday, moved to the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) guest house at 31, Aurangazeb Road. The two secretaries, along with a few senior officials, met Maran today and explained the issues pending before the communications and information technology ministry.																								On Sunday, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd chairman and managing director R. S. P. Sinha and V. P. Sinha of BSNL met Maran and briefed him about the performance of the two public sector companies.																								Maran was scheduled to assume office today, but the political development and the directive from the DMK leader to the seven ministers not to assume offices has delayed Maran from taking charge at Sanchar Bhawan.																								Sources, who attended the meeting today, said the minister-designate was keen to know about the governments efforts to address the issues related to business process outsourcing (BPO), the mobile market and regulatory aspects in telecom. He also wanted to know the market status of BSNL and MTNL.																								Maran wanted to know about the performance of ITI, the public sector telecom equipment manufacturing arm, and C-DAC.

 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Gail cash for Bengal hunt
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, July 18: Gail (India) Limited and Russian gas major Gazprom will be investing $22 million in their hunt for oil and gas in the deep seas off the Bengal coast.																								Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee told The Telegraph that the geological data and initial survey carried out by the Russian company show a rich potential for hydrocarbons in the block.																								Exploratory drilling is expected to start in November after the monsoon is over. The two joint venture partners have started scouting around for hi-tech drilling rigs for the operation. Gail and Gazprom hold a 50:50 stake in the offshore exploration block.																								If oil or gas is struck in the first well, the investment limit will be raised and the two companies will proceed to drill more in the area.																								While Gail has taken up some exploration blocks with ONGC, it had also chosen to tie up with Gazprom for the offshore block so that it could avail of the latest Russian technology.																								Gail is looking at the eastern region, which is lagging behind the western and northern parts of the country in the hydrocarbon sector in having a big market potential. Since Reliance plans to carry its gas from the K-G basin on the eastern offshore to the north and west, Gail wants to fill the void in the east.																								It also plans to bring gas from the offshore A1 block in Myanmar to India provided the commercial terms are favourable. While ONGC and Gail together hold a 30 per cent stake in the field, the remaining 70 per cent is owned by two South Korean companies.																								The Korean companies have agreed to give Gail the first preference for the gas. The initial strikes in the A1 block have been promising and initial expectations about the block, which is located adjacent to a giant gas field, have been realised.																								Banerjee said further appraisal and additional exploration in the block is scheduled for completion by May 2005. The commercial development plan for the field is expected to be put in place by the third quarter of 2005 and the first commercial flow of the gas will begin in the first quarter of 2007.																								He said Gail was working out a deal with the Korean companies. If it could get the gas at the desired price, the agreement could be firmed up as early as October.

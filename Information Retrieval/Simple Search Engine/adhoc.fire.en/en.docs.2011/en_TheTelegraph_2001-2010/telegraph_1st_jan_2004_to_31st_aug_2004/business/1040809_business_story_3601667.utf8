 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Power sales from east leap
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, Aug. 8: Power sales from the eastern region to other parts of the country have recorded a quantum leap in the first quarter of the current financial year. 																								Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand and Sikkim together sold more than 4,000 million units in April-June 2004. The figure includes the power that went from the northeast to the rest of India through the east. The sales are 52 per cent higher than 2600 million units transmitted in the corresponding period of the previous year.																								In 2003-04, more than 15000 million units of electricity went to other regions from the east. This is 60 per cent more than the volumes in 2002-03.																								Sales from the eastern region in April-June have notched up a higher growth rate of 7 per cent against the 4-5 per cent in the recent past. The blistering pace has been achieved by maximising the existing resources available to power units in the eastern region.																								One of the reasons for the sales surge is a ramp-up in generation, which went up to 75862 million units, a jump of 17.7 per cent over levels recorded in 2002-03. 																								In the first quarter of the current financial year, total generation was 20169 million units, which is 20 per cent more than the level in the corresponding period of 2003-04.																								R.B. Sharma, member-secretary of the Eastern Regional Electricity Board, said: The eastern region has emerged as a power-supply hub because of a variety of reasons. He said this is the only area of the country that has a surplus and is connected to all other regions. Most important, this is a zone with vast reserves of coal, he added.																								The increase in generation and sales to other regions has occurred along with full capacity utilisation of inter-state transmission networks in the eastern region.																								Sharma said open access in transmission has changed the entire complexion of power trading in the country. The concept of open access is based on the philosophy that the assets may be monopolistic in nature but they must be operated in a competitive manner. This, effectively, means that owners of assets in the power sector cannot forbid customers from using them.																								Though the regulations on this issue have been laid down by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, its counterparts in states are yet to streamline the charges for use of transmission systems.

 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Fitch sees slow pace of reforms
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 14: Fitch Ratings today said the pace of economic reforms may slow down as the new government struggled to address social imbalances though it is unlikely to arrest structural economic reforms.																								The global rating agency said far from being a ringing indictment of structural reforms, the National Democratic Alliances defeat is a measure of the extent to which the majority of the population feel untouched by reforms. The reforms have mainly benefited the middle class, Paul Rawkins, Fitch director (sovereign ratings) said in a statement.																								The Congress party had initiated the first wave of reforms in 1991 under the then finance minister, Manmohan Singh, in the aftermath of the balance of payments crisis in early 1990s, the rating agency added.																								Indias sovereign ratings have long been constrained by shortcomings in the fiscal arena as the combined deficit of the Centre and states has rarely been much below 10 per cent of gross domestic product over the past decade.																								Fiscal consolidation figures in manifestos of the National Democratic Alliance and the Congress party and it remains to be seen how a Congress-led coalition would tackle the challenge.																								The Congress party has been a defender of the Kelkar committees recommendations on tax reforms, it added.																								Fitch said raising revenues would be essential if electoral promises by the Congress and its allies of free electricity and rural debt forgiveness are not to undermine state government finances.																								As a sign of the changing times, the Congress has indicated that it is ready to break away from tradition and embrace privatisation, albeit less enthusiastically than the National Democratic Alliance, it said.																								Similarly, although the Congress party has presented a less receptive face to foreign investors in the past, it seems unlikely that it would stand in the way of further global integration of the Indian economy, Fitch said. 																								India has been the beneficiary of global outsourcing and services exports have played an important role in transforming the countrys external finances, it said.

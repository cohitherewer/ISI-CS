The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Ring of reality on feel-good buzz
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 22: The buzz has finally acquired a sheen. When the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government tom-tommed its achievements during five years in office through its India Shining campaign, there were a number of detractors ready to knock a few spots off the government that was trying to whip up a froth of feel-good sentiment.																								But now it finally has won a strong endorsement from India Inc: an incredible 91 per cent of the respondents to a straw poll conducted by the Ficci say that the present economic conditions are moderately to substantially better than the past six months.																								Theres more: almost 82 per cent of the respondents believe that the economy will fare moderately to substantially better in future.																								Almost three-fourth of the respondents assert the current performance of their industries has been moderately to substantially better when compared with the past six months. 																								The upward movement in industrial growth is sustained with the index of industrial production growing 6.2 per cent in December, largely aided by the 6.5 per cent pick-up in the manufacturing sector, says the survey.																								The sectoral analysis shows that the services sector is most upbeat about its current performance, with 88 per cent respondents (6 per cent up from last BCS) saying that they are doing moderately to substantially better compared with the last six months.																								However, business confidence has sagged in the heavy industry with the number of respondents indicating a moderate to substantially better performance dipping from 88 per cent to 73 per cent. This was attributed to the weakened performance of companies belonging to the cement, steel and petroleum sectors which had impacted negatively on their growth.																								On the other hand, the much-improved performance of the light industry from 58 per cent to 70 per cent shows the buoyancy in the economy.																								In terms of expectations of industry performance in the next six months, the services sector again takes the lead, with 85 per cent respondents anticipating a moderately to substantially better performance. The corresponding figures for the heavy and light industries are 75 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively.																								While results show that the firms feel that their current level of performance is better compared with the previous six months, expectations with regard to performance in the coming six months has slightly weakened.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Infotech exports immune to job jab
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 2: Job jingoists across the Atlantic may have whipped up a groundswell of opposition to the way Indias software service stars have been shining with deals that should have stayed there, but the IT industrys loudest voice is sure the boom will endure.																								Nasscom, the industrys association with a finger on the business pulse, says growth in software and services export will be 28 per cent in 2003-04  the year when BPO-baiters of the West galvanised like never before.																								That this will happen in the backdrop of a wave of legislative checks sought to be planted on deals to developing-country firms, makes the feat even more impressive.																								Already, a US bill banning outsourcing of government contracts to Indian companies is staring it in the face, but an unfazed Nasscom says the industry will generate revenues of Rs 55,510 crore ($12 billion) against Rs 46,100 crore ($9.5 billion) in 2002-03.																								India has been at the forefront of the outsourcing revolution globally, becoming the most preferred destination for businesses worldwide to meet outsourcing needs, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said at the Nasscom 2004; India Leadership Forum, today.																								Thanks to the recent reduction in customs and excise duty on PCs, Karnik expects the domestic IT market to grow by more than 11 per cent in 2003-04 to $7.4 billion. Domestic sales should rise 15 per cent over three to five years. The $560 million expected to be poured into e-governance will fuel this growth.																								Karnik cited a study conducted by his organisation to argue that exports will zoom due to cost advantages. Factors such as innovation, quality, productivity, total cost of ownership, suitability and customisation are helping India retain its lead in the global IT industry.																								The share of the North American market will continue to be large, accounting for 69 per cent of the Indian software and service exports, he said. The share of European and Asia-Pacific markets in total exports from India, continues to show reasonable growth.																								Banking, financial services and insurance continues to be the largest vertical, garnering 39 per cent of software and service exports. Among the sectors with big potential will be retail, manufacturing, healthcare and telecom services. The Nasscom president said it would emerge as sunrise verticals.

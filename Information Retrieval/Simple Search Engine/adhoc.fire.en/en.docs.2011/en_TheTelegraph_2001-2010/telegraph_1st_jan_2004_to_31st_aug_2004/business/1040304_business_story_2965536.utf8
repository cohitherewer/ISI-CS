 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Pricing reflects confidence
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 3: The aggressive pricing for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporations (ONGC) offer took market analysts by surprise. Going by the modest floor prices for the earlier government stake sale offers, brokers had expected the price band to be fixed at Rs 640-685.																								Its a brilliant move by disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, considering that four issues, except Gail, were priced at modest levels, said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investor Services.																								Its a clear message to foreign investors that this is not a bargain sale, Kejriwal added. 																								Merchant bankers are optimistic that foreign investors will scoop up the shares even for Rs 750 apiece. The quota for foreign investors is pegged at 50 per cent of the offer, which amounts to around 7.20 crore shares. ONGC is currently thinly traded with a floating stock of around 4 per cent on the bourses. Around 10 per cent stake is held by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Gail. The government owns the balance shares.																								The pricing will also ensure that the market remains buoyant, said analysts. 																								It is expected that after the issue, the MSCI index will incorporate the stock, giving it an attractive weightage. Already, it forms a part of the 30-share BSE index and enjoys the highest market capitalisation.																								The stock sale will prune the governments stake in the company to 74 per cent from 84 per cent.																								The government set a band of Rs 680-Rs 750 a share, which is almost close to Wednesdays closing price of Rs 751.55.

 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Be smart with Smart Home 
			With smart home  the innovative home loan product unveiled by HSBC  you can decide on how much interest you want to pay on your home loan. It is really simple: just put your usual savings, lying idle in other accounts, in the HSBC bank account which you get with your Smart Home.																								How is that possible? In Smart Home, the interest is calculated on a daily basis on the outstanding loan amount, which appears as a debit balance in your account. The savings that you deposit in your account every month  over and above your Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI)  is deducted from that balance, thus reducing your interest cost. The limit on the loan reduces automatically every month as per the EMI schedule.																								Cant I use my savings?																								You can use your savings as and when you need since it provides you complete flexibility to operate the Smart Home account as your main account. You can deposit and withdraw funds from the account according to your cash flows. You will be given full access through a chequebook, debit card and net banking. 																								Who is eligible for the loan? 																								If you have a net income of Rs 1,50,000 and are 21 years of age, you can apply for Smart Home. For salaried people, the upper age limit is 58 years and for self employed it is 65 years. You can take a minimum loan of Rs 5 lakh and a maximum of Rs 1 crore. The maximum tenure for the loan is 20 years, but it is restricted to 15 years for self-employed people. 					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Brokers resent insurance circular
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 16: Brokers are up in arms against the insurance watchdog  Insurance Regulatory And Development Authority  which has allowed large firms to negotiate premia discounts directly with insurance companies.																								A recent IRDA circular on special discount in lieu of agency commission and broker remuneration released earlier this month allows companies with a capital of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 3 crore to bargain for a special discount of 5 per cent while directly covering their risks with a general insurer.																								Brokers have argued that such guidelines go against the primary objective of the government to create and give impetus to the nascent insurance industry. The commission structure has changed five times since March 2003.																								Our body clearly represents the interests of the insured (policyholder). It is we who can advise them best on what cover to take, said Major General A. L. Suri (retd), advisor, Armour Consultants and spokesperson for the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI).																								Insurance analysts feel that the regulator is being tough on brokers, which is trying to find its feet in a fast-changing world.																								Brokers like Suri argue that scrapping this guideline could prove beneficial in two ways. First, a better managed system could be evolved involving the expertise of a broker, which in some cases may even lead to a lower premium payout by the policyholder. Brokers could also help companies take more prudent insurance decisions.																								Second, it will encourage the development of new areas of insurance such as retail insurance, public liability insurance, directors and officers liability insurance.																								The role of the regulator is not just to regulate but also to encourage and develop the sector. By adopting such a methodology, they are just trying to hinder growth, said R. S. Srivastava, director, J. K. Insurance and Risk Managers Limited.																								There is no doubt that the circular issued is in bias of public sector insurance companies, Srivastava said, adding that the average management cost of a PSU insurer is 26 per cent of the premium paid.																								By reducing the scope of commission to the intermediary, the regulator is helping the PSUs retain their management expenses which otherwise could further go up by 10-12 per cent, he said.																								However, IRDA chairman C. S. Rao has already gone on record stating guidelines have already been reviewed by the expert committee. I dont think there is any need or scope for further review.

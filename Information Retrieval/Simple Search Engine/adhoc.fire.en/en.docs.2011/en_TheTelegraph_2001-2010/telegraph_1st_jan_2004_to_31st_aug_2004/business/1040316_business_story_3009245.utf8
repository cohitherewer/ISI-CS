 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Marico oils bonus with third payout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 15: Marico Industries cheered its shareholders today by announcing a 1:1 bonus issue of equity shares aggregating Rs 29 crore. The FMCG major has also recommended a third interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per share for the current fiscal.																								The board has decided to opt for an early redemption of 8 per cent bonus redeemable preference shares (RePs) of Rs 29 crore by March 31. As per the terms of the issue of RePs, they were to be redeemed at par on or before October 1, 2005.																								Marico stock rallied on Dalal Street today fuelled by the news of the bonus issue. The scrip closed 3 per cent higher at Rs 283.35. It had opened at Rs 281.65 and shot to an intra-day high of Rs 298. Marico was one of the few counters that ended in the positive territory on a day when the market was bleeding under heavy selling pressure.																								Marico has been performing consistently for the past 17 quarters now and the new product or business turnover has been rising at about 20 per cent. The medium to long-term outlook on the business is positive, said Harsh Mariwala, chairman and managing director.																								The company will seek shareholders approval for its bonus issue at an extraordinary general meeting on April 21. Bonus equity shares would be allotted to the shareholders after receiving the approval at the EGM, the company said.																								Promoters hold close to 66 per cent in the company, which has an equity capital of Rs 29 crore. Institutional investors comprising mutual funds, banks, financial institutions and foreign institutional investors hold 25.51 per cent and public hold 7.42 per cent stake in the company. Private corporate bodies and NRIs/OCBs hold the remaining stake.																								The proposed bonus would ensure that more equity shares are available for trading. The earlier bonus issued in April 2002 had led to doubling of the floating stock to 1 crore shares.																								Maricos portfolio includes Parachute, Oil of Malabar, Revive, Medikar, Saffola, Sweekar and Sil. Apart from introducing new products in the skin-care segment, the company is also planning to enter the hair-care segment. 																								It posted a net profit of Rs 13.67 crore for the third quarter of this year.

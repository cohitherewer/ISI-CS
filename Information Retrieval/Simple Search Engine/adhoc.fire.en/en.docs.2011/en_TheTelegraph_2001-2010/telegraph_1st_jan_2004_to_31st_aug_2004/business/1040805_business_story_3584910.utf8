 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Banks in no hurry to raise home loan rates
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Strong base 																								Mumbai, Aug. 4: Housing Development Finance Corporations (HDFC) move to raise the interests on its fixed-rate loans is unlikely to see banks following suit immediately.																								Bank analysts do not visualise interests on home loans to go up, even as the leading finance company jacked up rates yesterday.																								Justifying the hike, HDFC had said that though the rates will remain soft in the short-term, they are likely to rise in the long-term. This is reflected in the 10-year G-sec rates, which are quoting at over 6 per cent, it added.																								However, bankers have a different point of view. Though they agree that the rate of inflation is firm and yields on the benchmark government security has shot up, they said there is abundant liquidity in the system. There is no room for an immediate increase in rates as there is excess liquidity in the banking system. Therefore, I dont expect the lending rates to go up, said Corporation Bank chairman K. Cherian Varghese.																								Corporation Bank belongs to an aggressive breed of public sector banks and has seen its retail loan portfolio multiply over the past couple of years. The bank, however, has been laying more stress on floating-rate home loans, which comprise a large part of its housing loan portfolio, since its resources have an average tenure of one to three years. Varghese said, Borrowers should not worry at this stage. Even if there is a slight upward movement, it will be evened out.																								On the other hand, Centurion Bank managing director Shailendra Bhandari has a different point of view. Speaking to The Telegraph, Bhandari said interest rates on other retail products such as personal or two-wheeler loans are unlikely to go up as yields on the treasury bill or the two-year government security have not changed considerably.																								This would only look up if the central bank were to jack up short-term rates such as the repo rate, he added. Bhandari, however, said banks will now have to assess the implications of long-term yields on government securities going past the 6 per cent-mark.

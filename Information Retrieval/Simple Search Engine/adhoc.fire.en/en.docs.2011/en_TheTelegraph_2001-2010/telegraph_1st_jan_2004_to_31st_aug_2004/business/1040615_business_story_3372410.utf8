 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Tatas power ahead on trade licence
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 14: Tata Power Trading Company Ltd (TPTCL) has been awarded the first-ever licence to trade in power by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). 																								At present, Power Trading Corporation is the only player operating in the sector with a provisional licence.																								TPTCL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power Company Ltd, the company that generates and distributes power in Mumbai and New Delhi.																								TPTCL has been granted the licence under the Electricity Act 2003, enabling it to carry out transactions all over India, the company said.																								TPTCL director . K. Gupta will be at the helm of affairs.																								Tata Powers stake in Power Trading Corporation has risen from 10 per cent to 17 per cent following the latters initial public offering in March 2004.																								With stakes in two power trading companies, analysts tracking the sector wonder whether there will be a conflict of interest.																								Tata Power sources have practically ruled out any conflict between Power Trading Corporation and its own subsidiary. Instead, there will be a lot of synergy, they added. The sector is at a nascent stage and with more players, there will be a better pool of power requirements, they said.																								TPTCL said it will trade surplus power of state electricity boards, captive power plants, generating companies and power output of merchant power plants, which are currently under execution by TPC and other companies.																								TPTCL will introduce initiatives, including day-to-day/ hour-to-hour, short-term, time-of-the-day and non-requisitioned power trading.																								It will engage in pooling of power as well as developing infrastructure to leverage the opportunities of trading power on a real-time basis, including monitoring round-the-clock flow of power in a centralised control room. TPTCL will meet the diverse needs of its customers by acting as a single window providing a bundle of efficient services. 																								The power sector has seen a major imbalance in availability. There are pockets of surplus and at the same time there is a deficit in large areas. In such a scenario, inter-state power trading emerges as a significant tool to meet power supply needs in an open market framework, Tata Power said. 																								Trading in power requires a superior skill in risk management, an ability to leverage opportunities and deliver instant value to customers.																								Tata Power Company is the countrys largest private sector power producer with an installed generation capacity of 2278 MW.

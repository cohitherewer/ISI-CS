 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 WTO firm on textile quota phase-out 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 13: The textile quota regime will be phased out by 2005  and pressure on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) from a number of countries to push back the date is unlikely to succeed.																								The agreement on textiles and clothing is unlikely to be extended beyond January 1, 2005 as member countries are willing, WTO deputy director general Kipkorir Aly Azad Rana said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								However, he said there were pressures on developed countries not to phase out textile quotas. We have received some requests, but there seems to be great determination. It does not seem that the deadline will have to be extended.																								Major textile exporting countries like India, Bangladesh and China, which have low wages, are expected to benefit from this move. This is currently seen as a restriction by many sourcing companies. Many leading retail chains like Walmart and JC Penney have already indicated that their apparel sourcing from India will go up once the quotas are phased out.																								Rana said WTO had already started capacity building exercise for trade integration for countries which will face end of preferences after dismantling of quotas.																								Asserting that there was no substitute to multilateralism, Rana said the proliferation of regional trade agreements and bilateral agreements were evolving more like a building block, thereby assisting the multilateral fora.																								It is nice to see that poorer countries are increasingly using the multinational forum to push forward their agenda, he added.

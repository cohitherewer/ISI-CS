 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee (centre) in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 9: Gail expects a PIB clearance to invest Rs 332 crore in Haldia Petrochemicals by September, even though the principal promoters  the Bengal government and The Chatterjee Group  are yet to spell out the actual investment needs from the gas major.																								Gail is open to the idea of investing as much as Rs 600 crore in Haldia Petrochemicals.																								Gail chairman and managing director Proshanto Banerjee said, Initially, our investment was pegged at Rs 200 crore. Later, we were asked whether it was possible to invest Rs 600 crore as part of the debt restructuring process. Subsequently, we got a letter from IDBI setting our investment at Rs 332 crore. It is now the turn of Haldia Petrochemicals to let us know the actual investment needs.																								The Chatterjee Group has already put in Rs 143 crore to put the debt restructuring package, cleared by IDBI on January 22, on course.																								Gail has also planned to set up a 1,00,000-metric tonne styrene-butadiene rubber (synthetic rubber) plant for Rs 538 crore in joint venture with Haldia Petrochemicals. 																								The detailed feasibility report has already been prepared and is under evaluation. The proposal will be placed before the Gail board shortly. Once the board clears the proposal, we will take up the matter with Haldia Petrochemicals, said Banerjee.																								Banerjee also made public the companys plan to invest in the state. I am happy to announce that Gail has planned to invest more than Rs 2,200 crore in Bengal, he said.																								One of the major initiatives of Gail is the Rs 4,500-crore Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline for natural gas to cater to the demand in Bengal. The detailed feasibility report has already been prepared. The cost of the pipeline section in Bengal is estimated to be over Rs 500 crore.																								The project will take 24 months to be completed beginning from October, Banerjee added.																								Gail is also pursuing exploration and production activities in Bay of Bengal in blocks 26, 24 and 7.																								The company also plans to set up Rs 800-crore coal gassification project in eastern India with a capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day in collaboration with Royal Dutch Shell.																								Gail is also considering equity participation in Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation Limited. 																								We would like to take 50 per cent of the equity. We will shortly start negotiations with the state government  the owner of the corporation, Banerjee said.																								The company is also in talks with the state government for distributing CNG and piped gas in Calcutta.

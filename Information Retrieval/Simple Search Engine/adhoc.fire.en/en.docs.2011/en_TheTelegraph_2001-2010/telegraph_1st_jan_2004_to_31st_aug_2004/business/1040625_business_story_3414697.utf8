 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 24: Reliance Industries has struck gas off the Orissa coast in the Bay of Bengal. Initial estimates from seismic and other studies indicate in-place reserves of about four to five trillion cubic feet.																								Reliance, which had earlier made a major gas discovery in the Krishna-Godavari basin with in-place reserves of 14 trillion cubic feet, plans to invest an additional Rs 2,500 crore in oil exploration and production in the next 24-30 months.																								Chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said these discoveries came after earlier operators drilled 61 unsuccessful wells. The company is evaluating the find, while certification processes are under way, he added.																								The blocks have been named as Dhirubhai 9, 10 and 11. Reliance had also struck oil in an onshore block in Yemen, in which it has a 25 per cent stake. Currently, the KG-D6 block is a priority and plans are to bring gas to the shore by 2006-07, he added.																								Ambani also hinted at the companys plans to make acquisitions in the global oil and gas sector. Reliance aims to be in the top 10 per cent globally in oil and gas exploration, production, distribution and marketing. 																								The company plans to achieve 30 per cent energy security for the Jamnagar refinery in the next 10 years.																								This will be achieved through acquisition of small and medium-sized oil companies and participation in exploration and developmental projects. We are focussing on Africa, West Asia, Australia and Latin America, he said.																								Reliance is on course to build 5,840 petroleum retail outlets over the next 3-5 years across the country.																								The plan is to roll out 300-400 retail fuel outlets every quarter, starting from the second quarter of the current financial year.																								The company will consider expanding its refinery capacity once the retail outlets are in place, Ambani said. The capacity expansion is likely to occur over the next 5-7 years, he added.

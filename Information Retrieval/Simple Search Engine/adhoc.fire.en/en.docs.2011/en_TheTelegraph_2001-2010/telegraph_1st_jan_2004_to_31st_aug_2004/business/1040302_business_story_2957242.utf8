 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 CMC adds Rs 190 cr to selloff coffer
 OUR CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, March 1: The government today said it will rake in around Rs 190 crore through the CMC public issue, which closed last Saturday. 																								A half of the public offering, which was oversubscribed 11.3 times, has been allotted to retail investors.																								The public offer price has been fixed at Rs 485 per share. Retail investors will get the shares at a 5 per cent discount at Rs 461.75 per share. The process of actual allotment to investors started today.																								The government received bids for 44.9 million shares against the 3.98 million shares that were put on the block.																								In November 2001, the Tata group had acquired a 51 per cent stake in the company with management control for Rs 151 crore at Rs 197 per share.																								The CMC offer, where the government had fixed a floor price of Rs 475 per share, had closed on February 28. HSBC Securities and Capital Markets and Enam Financial Consultants were appointed the book-running lead managers for the CMC issue, which was conducted through the book-building route.																								Meanwhile, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, who is in Mumbai today, is gung ho about the prospects of partial divestment in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the oil and natural gas exploration major. 																								Shourie has said overseas investors have shown strong interest in the partial divestment in the public offer of ONGC which will hit the market on March 5. 																								Last week, the government had completed the sale of its residual equity in Indian Petrochemical Corporation (IPCL) through a public offering. The government had raised Rs 1,200 crore by offloading its residual stake in IPCL at the floor price of Rs 170 per share to institutional investors while small investors will get them at a price of Rs 161.50. After the successful CMC float, the total money in the government kitty from both the floats is Rs 1,390 crore. 																								Besides CMC and IPCL, government will offload its residual equity in IBP through a public issue of 5.7 million shares. Also on the anvil are public offerings of 10 per cent stake each in Gail and ONGC and sale of 20 per cent stake in state-owned Dredging Corporation of India (DCI). 																								With the six public offerings that it has lined up, the government is likely to cross its revised disinvestment target of Rs 14,500 crore set for the current financial year and ahead of the elections scheduled in April.

 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, March 12: State-run National Insurance (NIC) and United India Insurance are likely to improve their balancesheets further this financial year. 																								National Insurance managing director H. S. Wadhwa said his company will earn a premium income in excess of Rs 3,500 crore in 2003-04. Of this, Rs 599 crore is expected to come from bancassurance alone.																								United India Insurance chairman-cum-managing director V. Jagannathan asserted that people still have high confidence in public sector companies. The general insurer expects to garner a profit of Rs 250 crore in 2003-04 against Rs 214 crore reported last year.																								National Insurance has tied up with Bank of India, Vijaya Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, Bharat Overseas and City Union, Allahabad Bank and State Bank of Mysore. Indicating that the insurer is still scouting for partners to forge more distribution alliances, Wadhwa said, We are trying our best to take the lead.																								NIC has already seen a 20 per cent growth in its premium income to touch Rs 2,839 crore in January. Of the total premium income that NIC expects in 2003-04, motor insurance will contribute approximately 35-40 per cent, fire insurance would comprise 30 per cent and marine approximately 10 per cent.																								Wadhwa said that the insurer had to cough up as much as 80-100 per cent of its premium earnings in the health portfolio to settle claims. The motor insurance claim ratio still stood at a high of 150 per cent, while the own-damage portion was below 60 per cent.																								United India Insurance is confident of acquiring the second position, after NIC, in the race for the top slot among four state-run general insurers. Jagannathan said, Hopefully, we will be able to take over other players in a few more months.

 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Power-play: Everyones part of it
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Towering ambitions																								Calcutta, July 8: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has promised electricity to all in the budget for 2004-05.																								As a first step towards it, the minister has decided to give an impetus to the renovation and modernisation of the existing transmission and distribution system in the country. This will help to reduce the transmission and distribution losses in the power sector to a great extent and provide quality power to the people.																								Transmission and distribution are the weak links in the chain of power supply. 																								The finance minister has also announced the governments intention to dilute its stake in the central public sector undertaking  National Thermal Power Corporation  by 5 per cent through a public offer. 																								In his budget speech, the minister said the power sector also deserves tax concessions. The Electricity Act 2003 envisages unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution. To promote renovation and modernisation of existing transmission and distribution lines, he has proposed to extend the benefit under Section 80-IA to projects undertaken from April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006. 																								Under the existing provisions of Section 80-1A of Income Tax Act, 1961, roads, highways, bridges, airports, ports and rail systems are regarded as infrastructure facilities and the enterprises engaged in developing or operating and maintaining such infrastructure are entitled to a tax holiday for five years and a deduction of 30 per cent of profits for the next five years. 																								Enterprises may avail of the benefit in 10 consecutive years out of 15 years beginning with the year in which such an enterprise develops the infrastructure facility.																								Tata Power managing director Firdose A. Vandrevala said there are two concerns in the power sector  affordability and reliability. 																								To make power affordable, we were expecting elimination of customs duty on import of fuels for power generation and other sops. On that score, this budget makes no contribution. In an indirect way, the extension of 80-1A benefits for investments in the transmission and distribution sector is a very welcome move. This will encourage utilities to invest in this part of the value chain to improve reliability and subsequent cash flows and commercial viability, Vandrevala added. 																								The finance minister also informed that an inter-institutional group in the power sector formed by IDBI, ICICI Bank, IDFC, SBI, BoB and PNB has succeeded in bringing six power projects to financial closure. Another 10 projects are on the verge of financial closure.																								The government today announced that its stake in NTPC will reduce marginally by 5 per cent subsequent to its public offering to raise capital.																								NTPC has filed a prospectus with Sebi to raise capital through a public issue. Consequently, the governments holding in NTPC will be marginally diluted, Chidambaram said																								NTPC is likely to hit the market in the first week of August, targeting to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore. NTPC is hoping to get the green signal from Sebi by July 15, based on the draft red herring prospectus submitted about a week ago.

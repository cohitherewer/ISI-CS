 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Bank shares wilt on jitters over farm loans 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 25: A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular allowing banks to lend to defaulting farmers whose loans have been restructured, has added to investor concerns over rising bad assets.																								This apprehension was reflected on the bourses, where most of the bank shares ended in a negative territory today. Banks, which at one point of time were the toast of the stock markets, have come under pressure in the past couple of months with the UPA government emphasising on higher credit outflow to farmers.																								While State Bank of India dropped by Rs 3.15 to Rs 419.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, HDFC Bank was weaker by Rs 16.20 to Rs 366.00 and ICICI Bank by Rs 2.50 to Rs 250.40. Bank of Baroda was a tad weaker at Rs 148.45 compared with its last close of Rs 149. Bank of India ended the day lower at Rs 46.80 and Corporation Bank at Rs 260. 																								The losses in bank shares came even as the markets ended higher.																								The bank index closed at 2414.72, a 25.79 point drop over Thursdays close of 2440.51. Among the other sectoral indices, the BSE FMCG index also closed weaker compared with yesterdays close.																								In a circular issued yesterday, the RBI said the interest arrears in the accounts of calamity-affected farmers up to March 31, 2004 may be clubbed with the principal outstanding. This amount can be repaid over five years at current interest rates, including an initial moratorium of two years.																								Last week, the UPA government had said debt-ridden farmers could restructure their bank loans by taking five more years to pay back the money or work out a one-time settlement.																								Following this, CLSA, a foreign brokerage, observed that the governments directive to banks to hike total credit availability to farmers and restructure loans is likely to bring back directed lending.																								The central bank had also authorised bank boards to grant a one-time settlement for small and marginal farmers who have been declared as defaulters till June 24.																								Even as the markets are worried over the impact of higher credit flow to the agricultural sector, senior bank analysts have termed loans to this sector as a viable commercial proposition. 																								Early this week, V. Leeladhar, Union Bank of India chairman and managing director and Indian Banks Association chief, had said the banking sector can achieve a 30 per cent growth in credit target set by the UPA government for the agricultural sector.Sensex gains																								The sensex opened on a promising note at 4717.83 and later fluctuated in a range of 4775.66 and 4680.42 before ending at 4756.39 compared with yesterdays close of 4708.55, a net rise 1.02 per cent.																								The volume of business was relatively high at Rs 1945.28 crore compared with Rs 1931.06 crore yesterday. 																								Tisco was the top-traded scrip with the highest turnover of Rs 213.97 crore followed by Reliance Industries (Rs 197.64 crore), SBI (Rs 156.53 crore), Maruti Udyog (Rs 135.29 crore) and Tata Motors (Rs 114.09 crore).

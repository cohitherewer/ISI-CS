 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Fed chief sees slow price rise
																								Washington, June 16 (Reuters): Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, heading for virtually certain Senate approval for a fifth term at the helm of the US central bank, repeated on Tuesday that interest-rate rises were likely to be gradual. 																								Answering questions before a Senate Banking Committee hearing considering his nomination to remain as chief of the Fed, which he has headed since 1987, Greenspan said he saw scant likelihood that inflation was about to flare up and force a round of aggressive short-term interest rate increases. 																								Our general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a serious concern in the period ahead, Greenspan said, so future rate rises were very likely to be measured over the quarters ahead.

 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 VSNL-Flag bandwidth row ends 
																								New Delhi, March 24 (PTI): The battle for bandwidth between corporate giants Tatas and Reliance came to an end today with the former agreeing to release 1000 mega bytes additional capacity within a week, thus paving the way for a cut in prices for end-users.																								Tatas-controlled VSNL and Flag Telecom, acquired recently by Reliance, reached a settlement in the presence of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).																								The agreement assumes importance in the wake of Reliances earlier declaration of cutting down bandwidth price by up to 70 per cent for end- users, while VSNL offered release of 17 STMS (a capacity totalling 1,000 MBPS) to Flag in case it had the capacity to accept the same.																								After chairing the six-hour long meeting, Trai member D. P. S. Seth said, VSNL will release 17 STMS within a week... Reliance has accepted the proposal.																								With this, the release of bottleneck facilities sought by Reliance had been achieved, Seth said. But the commercial terms between the two would be decided by them, he added.																								Neither the Tatas nor Reliance officials were available for comments immediately after the meeting.																								Seth said there were some doubts over Flags capacity to provide bandwidth equivalent to 17 STMS, which was clarified by the concerned party.

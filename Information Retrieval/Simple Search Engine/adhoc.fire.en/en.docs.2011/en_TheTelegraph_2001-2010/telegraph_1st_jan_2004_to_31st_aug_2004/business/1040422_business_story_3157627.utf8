 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Its the smallest PC
 							 - Taipei firm joins hands with Jaipuria group OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi April 21: It is touted as the smallest PC: it weighs just 4.5 kg, can be lugged around like a laptop and easily plugged into a monitor or a TV. It comes with a remote control that can hook on to the internet at a stab of a button.																								ChainTech Corporation, a Taipei-based hardware maker and the seventh largest manufacturer of motherboards, has launched the smallest PC at Rs 35,800 with a LCD monitor  and it will fire up the market for PCs if the mindset about these gizmos can be changed.																								ChainTech has joined hands with Jaipuria Group, the leading dealers of Pepsi and Raymond Suiting.																								Jaipuria Advance Technologies Pvt Ltd of Jaipuria Group has bagged the exclusive rights for the product and will market it across the country.																								The company will market the countrys first internet, multimedia and office (IMO) desktop through a retail channel and franchisee model.																								Executives work both at home and office and a lap-top may not be able to carry all the data. With this system, an executive can carry his data in a PC to home, office or wherever he wants to. Further the feature enabling a connection with TV will provide the opportunity to view broadband movies, said Chandrakant Singh, country head of Jaipuria Advance Technologies Pvt Ltd. It also has a remote control that will function as a second keyboard and also perform switch on and off functions.																								One of the interesting features is the ability to switch on your internet connection with the help of a remote.																								Our main challenge in India in selling the product is the mindset of the people. We will try to meet this challenge with the help of a sustained campaign and initiatives like special demonstrations in schools and corporate houses, said Singh.																								The product carries a one-year on-site warranty and offers an extended warranty at 45 per cent of the total cost of the product. The company has set a target to sell about 1000 PCs per month and generate revenue of Rs 50 crore in the first financial year.																								Lawrence Wu, regional head ChainTech (Asia and Africa), said, We have decided to first enter India in the Asia Pacific region due to the vast market comprising corporate houses and financial institutions. We believe in the concept of small is big and this category is fulfiled by IMO Desk.

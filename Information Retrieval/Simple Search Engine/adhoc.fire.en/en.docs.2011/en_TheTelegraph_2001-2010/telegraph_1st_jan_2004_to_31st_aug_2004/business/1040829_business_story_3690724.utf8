 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Tata: Committed 																								Bhubaneswar, Aug. 28: Orissa seems to be emerging as the major investment destination for the Tatas.																								Apart from reiterating its commitment to set up a steel plant in Jajpur district, the Tatas have evinced keenness to invest in the states software and tourism sector. 																								In his meeting with chief minister Naveen Patnaik at Orissa Bhawan in New Delhi yesterday, Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was exploring the possibility of setting up a software development centre in Bhubaneswar. 																								Tata also said the company was equally keen on developing the Rs 2000-crore Dhamra port project which was being actively pursued along with Larsen and Toubro and other partners.																								At the meeting, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman told Patnaik that the company has already finished the feasibility study on the steel project and has applied to the Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (IDCO) for 2500 acres of land at Kalinganagar. 																								He said the company may require another 1500 acres for the project. The land has already been identified. 																								The chief minister suggested that the Tatas should invest in the proposed special tourism zone at Puri. 																								Tata said the company would like to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state government, clearly spelling out the investment plans it had for the state, while indicating the time-frame within which these projects would be completed. 																								Last week, Tata Steel had expressed its commitment to set up a six-million tonne steel plant at Duburi in Orissa at an investment of Rs 12,000 crore.

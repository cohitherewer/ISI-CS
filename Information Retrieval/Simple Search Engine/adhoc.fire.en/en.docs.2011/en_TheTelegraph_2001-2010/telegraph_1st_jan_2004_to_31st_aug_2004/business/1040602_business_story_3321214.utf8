 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Aiyar hints at cut in oil duties
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 1: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said the duties on petroleum goods would be scaled down in order to avoid a major increase in prices. He, however, added that no decision has been taken as yet on whether prices would be increased at all.																								India is keenly looking forward to the Opec meeting in Beirut on June 3. The outcome of the meeting will be the key input in formulating a new pricing policy for petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene. The government is waiting for the outcome of the Opec meeting before taking any decision on the prices of petrol and diesel, Aiyar said.																								Petrol and diesel prices have remained unchanged for the past five months despite crude oil prices soaring by $6 a barrel.																								Aiyar said the spurt in crude oil prices was a matter of deep concern and wanted Opec to act quickly to mitigate the crisis in developing countries like India, which is dependent on imported oil. He, however, was non-committal on the way domestic prices will move if Opec decides to raise output or international crude prices do not ease even after supplies are increased.Crude prices																								US oil prices leapt to a record $42 a barrel on Tuesday after an attack in Saudi Arabia by Islamic militants killed 22 people, heightening fears about political instability in the region.US light crude rose $2.12, more than 5 per cent, to touch $42 a barrel following an attack by suspected al Qaida militants on the offices of western companies in the Saudi oil city of Khobar on Saturday. That was the highest seen in 21 years of crude trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. London Brent crude rose $2.07 to $38.65 a barrel.

 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Many firms queue up for Petronet product
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: Essar Steel and a clutch of petrochemical and fertiliser companies in Gujarat will be buying the bulk of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Dahej terminal of Petronet LNG. 																								These companies expect to reduce their input costs substantially by switching their feedstock from expensive naphtha to LNG.																								The LNG imported from Qatar will be sold at $4.6 per million British thermal units (Btu) in Gujarat due to the high incidence of sales tax in the state. The smaller proportion to be sold outside the state will carry a price tag of $4.3 per million Btu. The cost of naphtha to these companies currently works out to around $6 per million Btu, according to industry analysts.																								Gail (India) Ltd will be marketing 60 per cent of the 5 million tonnes of LNG being imported at Dahej out of which 1 million tonnes will be sold to GSPCL.																								It will also sell 1 million standard cubic metres of gas per day to Essar Steel in Hazira and 0.35 million standard cubic metres to the IPCL unit at Dahej. Another 0.09 million standard cubic metres per day of regassified LNG will be sold to Gujarat Narmada Fertiliser Corp and Gujarat State Fertiliser Corp.																								Although natural gas is being supplied from ONGC and OIL fields at the rate of a mere $2.5 per million Btu, there is not enough to meet the demand. It is this factor that Petronet has kept in mind while preparing its marketing plans. 																								However, National Thermal Power Corporation, which currently consumes 40 per cent of the natural gas produced in the country, has steered clear of Petronet LNG as it cannot afford to pay more than $3 per million Btu since the power that it produces is sold at a regulated price of Rs 1.57 to the state electricity boards.																								Indian Oil Corporation, which also holds a stake in Petronet LNG, will be picking up 30 per cent of the LNG.

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Ford eyes 10% sales growth 
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, March 17: Ford Motors Indian arm expects sales to grow between 8 per cent and 10 per cent over the next three years in line with analysts projection of an average annual 10 per cent growth this decade.																								Our target is to sell around a million units by 2007, which means we would have to grow at an average rate of 10 per cent, said Vinay Piparsania, director of sales operations at Ford India.																								Ford India Ltd, which has posted losses for the last two years, is counting on the launch of Fusion in the latter half of the year to wipe out losses and achieve full capacity utilisation.																								Sources said Fusion would be powered by 1.4-litre Sigma series of engines and sport a sticker price above Rs 6 lakh.																								Piparsania said the new model would offer higher sales volumes, and help turn around Ford Indias fortunes. He said the carmaker would post operational profits in the financial year starting from April 1.																								The automaker, 85 per cent owned by Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, has invested Rs 1,700 crore to set up a factory near Chennai. It makes the Ikon sedan in the country and sells completely knocked-down kits of the car to its units in South Africa and Mexico.																								It also offers the Endeavour sports-utility vehicle and imports the larger Mondeo sedan as a completely built unit.																								The response to Endeavour has been terrific, Piparsania said. He added that exports helped in capacity utilisation, which adds to the profitability and gives the automaker the necessary volumes of production.																								Sales in April-February, the first 11 months of the fiscal to March, rose 30 per cent to 17,988 units, up from 13,866 a year-ago. Piparsania said the company expected to close this fiscal with sales of nearly 20,000 units with exports of an equal number of units.																								In the previous financial year ended March 2003, the automaker had reported sales of 14,970 units and exported 28,915 completely knocked-down kits.																								Analysts said higher disposable incomes, cut-throat competition in financing deals along with new models and discounts were spurring car sales in one of the fastest growing economies of the world.																								Figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers showed that 11 companies sold a total of 6,20,725 units in the April-February period up from 31 per cent a year earlier. 																								In February alone, sales leapt 73 per cent to 64,821 units, up from a relatively low base of only 37,445 units a year-ago.

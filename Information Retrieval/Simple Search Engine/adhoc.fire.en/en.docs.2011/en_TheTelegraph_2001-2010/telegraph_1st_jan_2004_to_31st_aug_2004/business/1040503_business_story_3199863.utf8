				 	 Buffet: Sounding the alarm																								Omaha, May 2 (Reuters): Warren Buffett has criticised hedge funds and warned of the dangers of derivatives and looming inflation in front of nearly 20,000 shareholders who trekked to Omaha, Nebraska, for the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc.																								Buffett, the worlds second richest person, took questions from shareholders for nearly six hours along with his long-time partner, Charlie Munger. He also responded to shareholder groups who criticised his role on the board of directors at Coca-Cola Co. 																								Buffett called hedge funds a fad that was more about Wall Street marketing than sound investing. People that are now investing in hedge funds in aggregate are going to be disappointed, Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, said. The fees that hedge fund managers charge were unfair, he said. Buffett said he was seeing inflation heat up in the United States. 																								In his remarks to shareholders, he used the example of the $6-billion accounting scandal at mortgage financier Freddie Mac to demonstrate the risks of derivatives. Despite having intelligent board members, being chartered by the US Congress, and being followed by dozens of Wall Street analysts, he said Freddie Mac could not get a hold on the complexity of these financial instruments. 																								Sometime in the next 10 years, you will have a huge problem that will either be caused by or accentuated by peoples activities in derivatives, quot; he said.																								Buffett said that the larger Berkshire gets, the more difficult it is to find places to park its money. It gets harder all the time to deploy all the funds that come into Omaha, Buffett said. The company was sitting on a stockpile of $31 billion in cash at the end of 2003. 																								Buffett told the audience not to rely on financial consultants and was especially critical of those who advise some sort of specified 60-40 per cent split between stocks and bonds.																								Its nonsense, he said. Instead, Buffett advised the audience to seek out bargains no matter what type of investments they are. 																								Buffett, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes at $42.9 billion, reflected on some of his mistakes. He said by being trigger-shy on buying into Wal-MartStores , he cost Berkshire $10 billion. If every shot was a hole in one, it wouldnt make the game very interesting, Buffett said. You have to hit balls in the woods a few times.

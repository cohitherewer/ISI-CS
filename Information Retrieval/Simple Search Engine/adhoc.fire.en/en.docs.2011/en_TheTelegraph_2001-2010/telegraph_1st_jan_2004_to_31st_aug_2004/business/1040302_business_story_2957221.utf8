 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Home loan rates stable
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Parekh: Realistic																								Mumbai, March 1: Interest rates on housing finance, largely in single digit figures, are unlikely to go down further, says Deepak Parekh, chairman and managing director of HDFC Ltd.																								Speaking informally to newspersons after a meeting here today, Parekh said that there is not much scope to further bring down the interest rates. 																								Parekhs comments mirrored similar views expressed by bankers in the recent past. They said that the current interest rates on housing loans are likely to remain stable in the short-term. But there is a strong possibility of the rates firming up marginally in the medium term.																								Interest rates on housing loans, which were earlier ruling at around 18 per cent, are now down to single digits in some maturities. This has been attributed to the lower interest-rate regime prevalent over the past few years.																								Housing loan rates have declined by about 675 basis points since April 2000. In the last year, as competition intensified, rates have declined by 250 basis points.																								While banks and housing finance companies have been witnessing a robust growth in these portfolios, keeping in tune with a healthy retail demand, there is a rising concern about non-performing loans in this segment.																								A study recently conducted by credit-rating agency Crisil on the housing finance sector said that the industrys overall profitability could come under pressure since the incremental return on equity is very low. The agency said that this could even push up the interest rates by 50-100 basis points.																								It added that the rise in interest rates could be controlled if the industry players are able to contain their non-performing loans in this segment. 																								Meanwhile, in a communication to the stock exchanges, HDFC said that it has allotted 10,000 secured redeemable non-convertible debentures of Rs 10 lakh each, aggregating to Rs 1,000 crore on a private placement basis.																								The NCDs of five-year tenure would carry an interest of 5.85 per cent, bond market sources said.																								HDFC said that the NCDs issued are in terms of the Umbrella Offer Document for Rs 2000 crore filed with the NSE on February 13. The exchange had issued in-principle approval for the same on February 17.

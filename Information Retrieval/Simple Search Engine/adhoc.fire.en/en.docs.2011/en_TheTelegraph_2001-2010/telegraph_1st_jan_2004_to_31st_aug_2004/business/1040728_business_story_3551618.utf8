 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Birla will war kicks off before new judge today
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 27: The much-awaited legal battle between the Birla family and Rajendra Singh Lodha is set to start in Room No 7 of Calcutta High Court tomorrow. 																								After Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee, in whose court the matter came up for hearing on Monday, backed off the case on personal grounds, acting chief justice of Calcutta High Court, Ajay Nath Roy, today assigned it to Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta. 																								As both the Birla family and Lodha prepare for a protracted legal battle over the ownership of the MP Birla group, new claimants are weighing their chances of getting a slice of the empire. While Lodha has claimed that Priyamvada Birla bequeathed all assets of the MP Birla group to him by showing her last testament, the Birlas have questioned the veracity of the will.																								And along with the immediate family, Gita Sanghi, the Indore-based daughter of Gajanan Birla  brother of M. P. Birla  from his second marriage is set to join the legal battle. 																								My client is reaching Calcutta tonight and if she thinks she has a rightful claim on the assets, she will contest the will and pray for a direction to file an affidavit in court, said Pramod Khaitan, the lawyer representing Sanghi. 																								The case involves Lodhas petition challenging the interest of the caveats of K. K. Birla, B. K. Birla, G. P. Birla and Yashovardhan Birla and urged the court to quash them. 																								The four members of the Birla family had filed caveats to ensure that they get a hearing once Lodha filed the will of Priyamvada Birla for authentication. 																								The two sisters of M. P. Birla  Laxmi Bai Newar and Radha Bai Mohta  have also joined the legal battle by filing caveats. Though Lodha is contesting the caveats filed by the four members of the Birla family, he is not challenging the sisters of M. P. Birla.

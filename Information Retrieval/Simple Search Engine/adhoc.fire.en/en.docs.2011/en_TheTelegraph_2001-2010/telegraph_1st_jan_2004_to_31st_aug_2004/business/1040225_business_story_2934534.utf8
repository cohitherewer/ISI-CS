 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Bajaj Auto demerger plan in slow lane
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bajaj: Back gear																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: The proposal to split Bajaj Auto into its investment and manufacturing arms has been put on hold, chairman and managing director Rahul Bajaj told newspersons here today.																								It (the demerger plan) is on, but it has been put on the backburner for now, Bajaj said on the sidelines of the third Asia-Pacific forum organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). It is likely to take place in the next one or two years after the family settlement is carried out.																								In the middle of 2002, brother Shishir Bajaj dropped a bombshell when he said he wanted to sell his holdings in Bajaj Auto (2003 sales: Rs 4,744.4 crore) to the existing promoters while taking control of the two Bajaj group companies he runs  Bajaj Sevashram, Bajaj Hindustan and Deccan Aurvedashram.																								The family initially tried to dissuade Shishir from breaking away but, when he remained adamant, they were forced to look for mediators to help them establish the fair valuation for the stock-swap deal that the disentangling of the crossholdings would involve.																								Last September, Rahul Bajaj and the other promoters floated the idea of demerging the countrys largest two-wheeler maker but said they would like to first settle the deal with Shishir before going through with the plan.																								The financial institutions, however, have been insisting that the demerger plan could go through even without first reaching a settlement with Shishir.																								The biggest hurdle to the settlement with Shishir has been the price at which he should offload his 6 per cent stake in Bajaj Auto to the Rahul Bajaj-led clan. While Shishir had initially insisted that it should be at a premium to the market price, Rahul Bajaj and the other promoters have been insisting that the valuation should be at fair value.																								Analysts feel that a demerger post the implementation of a family settlement could add value to the stocks of the new entity as the ownership patterns would be clearer. 																								Bajaj Auto Limited is examining various options for the demerger proposal of the company, including how much cash will go into each of the entities and what role and business opportunities the demerged entity will be involved in.																								When the company announced its demerger plan, it said it planned to create an investment firm by taking out about Rs 1,000 crore from the cash surplus of Rs 3,000 crore with Bajaj Auto.

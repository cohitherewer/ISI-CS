 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 6: Dubai is rolling out the red carpet for Indian tea traders. 																								Traders operating from that country will be offered certain concessions, the Dubai government told members of Contemporary Targett  the third-largest auction house in India.																								The members were in Dubai to conduct a feasibility study for setting up an auction centre there.																								We have received the feasibility report. We might have to start consignment sales first and then go ahead with the auction centre, C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, told The Telegraph.																								A decision will be taken at a meeting of senior ITA members in the middle of this month, he added.																								According to the report, the Dubai government has already earmarked an area in the Jebel Ali Free Zone for tea. A company operating out of the free zone will not require a local partner and neither will it pay any income tax or sales tax. This area will include tea warehouses and blending units.																								The government will offer free warehousing for 45 days along with a means of trade and stock financing under a scheme named Dubai Commodity Receipt.																								Dubai Metals amp; Commodities Centre  the government agency which is setting up the facility for tea trade  is also making arrangements for blending tea at a concession. If required, buyers can buy original lines from different estates and blend it to their requirements quickly and at a cheaper rate.																								DMCC is also working out a scheme to ensure that consignments do not get stranded. If a certain brand does not sell or is found to be below the minimum permissible quality standard, the original shipper can take the consignment back at a nominal cost.																								However, DMCC is not considering the auction centre plan right away. Auctions will evolve in due course of time, it feels. The Dubai government is open to the idea and will provide all support if the plan makes commercial sense. 																								Since commercial space is expensive for manual auctions, the DMCC is also prepared to consider electronic auctions and hold talks about such systems with Indian companies, the report added.																								This could be a big opportunity for Indian tea to increase its exports of CTC and orthodox tea. We would like to send tea on a consignment basis within a month, said Dhanuka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 GM to roll out Tavera in June
																								New Delhi, March 14: GMI would break even this year and aims to sell 32,000 units in 2004 with the launch of sports utility vehicle Tavera in June, GMI president and managing director Aditya Vij said.																								So far, we have invested Rs 1,200 crore here, he added. The Indian arm of the worlds biggest carmaker, which aims a 3 per cent market share this year, plans to sell 50,000 units from its existing product portfolio by 2005.																								Sixty per cent of our sales will come from the Chevrolet badge, while Optra will contribute the remaining 40 per cent, he said.																								GMI re-launched Chevrolet brand last year with sports utility vehicle Chevrolet Forester and premium mid-size car Chevrolet Optra.																								He said the Chevrolet brand would be the mainstay of GMI.																								To help support growing sales, GMI will set up a call centre while sales and service network will be strengthened by the year-end.																								The number of sales and service outlets would reach to 75 and 90, respectively by the year-end. The four-week-long waiting list for Chevrolet Optra will also come to an end as production capacity is being augmented at its Halol (Gujarat) plant with an investment of Rs 1,261 crore.																								The production capacity at the Halol plant was being increased to 50,000 units from 25,000 units at present, Vij said.																								With the hike in production, the long waiting list for Chevrolet Optra would come to an end. 																								The demand for the vehicle picked up with the launch of a 1.6 litre engine variant of the car.																								With the expansion at Halol plant, the companys entry into the volume-spinner compact car category and setting up of GM Engineering Centre in Bangalore, General Motors remained committed to the Indian market, he said.																								Asia Pacific was home to five out of the eight fastest growing markets with India being on the second position.

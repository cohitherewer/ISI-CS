 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Surplus in current account 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 3: In its first report on management of foreign exchange reserves, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today said the country has posted a small current account surplus of $207 million in April-September.																								There is thus a reversal from the earlier trend which saw a current account deficit as high as 3.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990-91. While the current account surplus is 0.7 per cent of the GDP in 2002-03, the small surplus posted in the first half of the current fiscal was driven mainly by the surplus in the invisible account, the central bank said.																								The RBI is proposing to compile half-yearly reports on management of foreign exchange reserves to bring about more transparency and increase the level of disclosure. These reports will be prepared with reference to positions as on March 31 and September 30 every year.																								The central bank said Indias exports increased to $52.7 billion in 2002-03 from $17.9 billion in 1991-92. Invisibles such as private remittances also contributed significantly to the current account, it added.																								Lower international interest rates in June-July 2002 led to a fall in returns on Indias foreign currency assets to 2.8 per cent compared with 4.1 per cent in the previous year, while that on gold reserves declined to 0.6 per cent from 0.9 per cent.																								While referring to the sources of accretion of reserves in the recent period, the central bank said this has been on account of capital and other inflows. The major sources of increase in the reserves were foreign investment, banking capital, increase in other types of capital inflows, short-term credit and valuation changes in reserves.																								There was an increase in the annual foreign direct investment (FDI) from $133 million in 1991-92 to $4.7 billion in 2002-03. In the first half of the current fiscal, FDI inflows into the country were $1.6 billion, while outstanding non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits increased to $31.3 billion in September.																								The report also said the foreign exchange reserves are invested in multi-currency, multi-market portfolios according to the existing norms which are similar to international practices. As on September 30, out of the total foreign currency assets of $87.2 billion, around $31.7 billion was invested in securities, $9.6 billion with other central banks and Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and $15.8 billion in the form of deposits with foreign commercial banks.																								On gold reserves, RBI said it holds 357 tonnes, forming about 4.3 per cent of the total reserves as on September 30. Of this, 65 tonnes were held abroad since 1991 in deposits with Bank of England and BIS.

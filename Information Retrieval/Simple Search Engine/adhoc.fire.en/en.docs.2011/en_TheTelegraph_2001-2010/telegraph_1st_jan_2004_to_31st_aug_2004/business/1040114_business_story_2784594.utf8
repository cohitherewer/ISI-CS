 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 CAs show the way in laying more tax traps
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: Chartered accountants have come up with a set of radical proposals to widen Indias taxpayers base  which at present is very small with less than 3 per cent of the countrys population paying income taxes.																								The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has come up with wide-ranging suggestions in the field of direct and indirect taxes to net more taxpayers.																								In a memorandum which it plans to submit to finance minister Jaswant Singh, the ICAI has recommended that persons transferring immovable properties should be required to file income tax returns. In order to avoid harassment to small value transactions, a threshold limit of Rs 5 lakh has been recommended for this purpose, said one of the authors of the suggestions.																								ICAI has also suggested that persons booking tickets to overseas destinations should be required to give their permanent account number (PAN). This information can be included as part of the return under section 285BA. 																								Further, persons who pay electricity bills amounting to Rs 24,000 per annum should also be required to file returns.																								Another major area in which the ICAIs memorandum focuses its attention is tax avoidance. At present, exemption is available in respect of agricultural income and various types of other income under the provisions of section 10. However, the law has no mechanism to verify the genuineness of various claims for exemption made by the assessees. 																								A check has been provided in the Income-tax Act by way of a report from a chartered accountant in respect of deductions permissible for export sector, new industrial sector etc. The ICAI has recommended that a similar provision should be introduced requiring a report from a chartered accountant to check whether the assessees claim are genuine in this regard.																								It has called for the restoration of credit for minimum alternate tax (MAT) and consideration of the tax credit allowed as an advance tax for the purpose of capturing interest payable under section 234A, 234B and 234C.																								ICAI has also pointed out the deleterious effect of ceiling limits on remuneration to partners. These ceiling limits act as an impediment to growth of professional firms in particular. The institute has called for abolition of such ceiling limits. 																								Pointing to the fact that the institute has notified several accounting standards, the memorandum makes a plea for notifying the accounting standards of ICAI under the Income-tax Act which would at once obviate the need to bring numerous accounting-related amendments. 																								The mere requirement in the Income-tax Act that all assessees should comply with the accounting standards issued by the institute will ensure that correct accounting principles have been enshrined in the Income-tax Act, a senior ICAI official said.

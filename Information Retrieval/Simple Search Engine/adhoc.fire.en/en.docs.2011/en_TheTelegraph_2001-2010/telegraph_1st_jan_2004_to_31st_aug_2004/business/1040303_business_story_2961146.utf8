 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Hitachi lines up export plans
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, March 2: Hitachi Home amp; Life Solutions (India) Limited is focusing on the domestic market, after Thailand and China, to expand its business globally. The expansion plan aims at raising the overseas sales ratio to 40 per cent by 2004.																								Vice-president (marketing and service operations) Amit Doshi said, Hitachi is increasing the export of room air-conditioners (ACs), so that it can contribute 20 per cent of the turnover by 2005. Currently, the export share is 5 per cent of the turnover at 10,000 units, which we expect to double by next year.																								With an annual volume growth of 20 per cent, the domestic market is lucrative for ACs and will act as a strategic base for the companys business.																								Hitachi is looking at India as a base to outsource its products to West Asia, Africa and Saarc countries. The products have been specifically designed to function in climatic conditions of these places, said Doshi. Special tests, including high temperature resistance, sandstorm and lethargy, are made on these products, he added.																								The parent company has recently acquired the 19.4 per cent stake held by Ahmedabad-based Lalbhai Group in Amtrex Hitachi Appliances to make good the accumulated losses of the last few years.																								In India, the company will follow a twin-brand strategy with Hitachi catering to the top-end and Amtrex to the middle segments.																								We have put our turnaround strategy in place and expect to come out of the red in the next fiscal, said Doshi. The accumulated losses were brought down from Rs 14.04 crore to Rs 2.19 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal. 																								The company plans to achieve a turnover of Rs 240 crore in the seven-month period between September 2003 and March 2004. The next financial year will be from April to March to synchronise with Hitachis global business calendar.

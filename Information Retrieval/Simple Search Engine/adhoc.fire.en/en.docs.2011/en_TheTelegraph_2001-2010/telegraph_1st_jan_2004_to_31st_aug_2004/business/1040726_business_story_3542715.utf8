The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 CalTel capacity crunch sparks worry
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, July 24: Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) is concerned over capacity shortage as user base surges with one lakh mobile subscribers being added in the past 70 days.																								CalTel had launched its pre-paid services  Excel  on May 12, after upgrading its network from the earlier C-DoT switches to Ericsson. The new switches have a capacity to handle one lakh users.																								The increased subscriber base has caused congestion on the network and there is a chance of deterioration of services. This has prompted the company to consider limiting the number of new subscribers till the infrastructure is upgraded, BSNL sources said.																								Customers who are acquiring pre-paid connections have had to wait for three to four days before the SIM is activated.																								The problem is that the switch capacity is nearing saturation and adding more subscribers could affect the quality of service, he said.																								The company currently has 93 base stations from the earlier 82 and seven more will be added by this month-end. By December, CalTel expects to have 200 towers across the city.																								CalTels user base increased to 1,22,000 in July from 28,000 in May without any marketing or promotional activity. Despite the absence of a brand repositioning exercise, around 2000 requisitions are placed with the company everyday.																								The necessary equipment is available but we are unable to start installation as we are facing problems erecting towers at the right location. This has caused congestion and there are black holes in even important locations where business volumes are higher, the source said.																								General manager, sales and customer service, S. K. Bhaduri denied that services would be withdrawn. We are adding 1500 customers on an average every day and the demand still exists, he said.																								Excel subscribers are, however, facing a shortage of recharge coupons.

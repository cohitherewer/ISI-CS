 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Offer boosts infotech stocks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 19: The initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) might pole-vault the Tata group to the number one wealth-creator spot as the infotech majors market capitalisation would be pegged around Rs 43,000 crore, pushing over Reliance Industries (RIL) from its current position.																								However, if RIL spins a surprise by listing its subsidiary Reliance Infocomm, it will regain the top slot in market value for its shares  a probability that cannot be ruled out at this juncture.																								Investors interest in the infotech sector gained ground even as analysts were divided in their opinion whether it was due to a spate of good quarterly results or the TCS offer.																								TCS is the first domestic IT services company to post revenues in excess of $1 billion and holds the number one position in terms of revenue and profit.																								The past few days, however, have seen even midcap infotech stocks like Zensar Technologies and Hexaware being re-rated on the bourses.																								Zensar gained Rs 7.95 to close at Rs 99.10 against Fridays Rs 91.15, though Zensars share price is still far away from its years high of Rs 165.																								The Hexaware share closed today at Rs 410.25 from Thursdays Rs 402.40, gaining Rs 7.85. Its years high and low were at Rs 433 and Rs 124, respectively. 																								MphasiS BFL, quoting ex-bonus, gained Rs 2 to close at Rs 272, while Wipro and Infosys Technologies made marginal gains on the stock exchanges.																								iGate Global Solutions was among the few infotech shares that fell today, with the scrip losing Rs 1.90 to Rs 236.80 from the previous close of Rs 238.70.																								Analysts also expect institutional investors to sell some of the infotech stocks to buy TCS shares.

 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Suspense on PTC market debut lingers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 5: Power Trading Corporation (PTC) officials camping here to iron out allotment glitches have no clue when its shares will be listed on the bourses.																								As the company missed another date for debut, all PTC officials would say was that they were keeping their fingers crossed until MCS, the registrars, confirm that new shares have reached NSDL and CDSL.																								We will take it one day at a time, said PTC executive vice-president (corporate development) R. Bhardwaj. Other executives were loath to commit a date. After missing the first date, we have not given exchanges a new one. Therefore, to say we have postponed the listing for the third time, is incorrect, he added.																								Market watchers expected the stock to debut today because of companies preference for the first day of the week.																								As conjectures about the next date swirled around, MCS was still struggling with the allotment of an issue that drew over six lakh applicants. 																								Many investors were waiting to hear from it about their new shares. As its troubles grew, MCS was pulling out voluntarily of several offers slated to hit the market. These include the ICICI Bank public issue of Rs 3500 crore.																								Bhardwaj, however, said mismatches in the data received, and fed to the two depositories, were being removed. 																								Mismatches up to 3 per cent are allowed under Sebi rules. So far, MCS has brought it down to 6 per cent. It is trying hard to resolve conflicting issues and has our sympathies in the effort, said Bhardwaj, who has been here since Friday, when the problems first became public. The company is headquartered in Delhi.																								Asked whether the delay in listing had been a damper in spite of the fact that the issue was oversold 36 times, Bhardwaj admitted it was unsettling. We are working with the registrar, so that the shares are uploaded in the NSDL and CDSL, the two depositories. 																								Asked if PTC would reconsider MCS as its registrar in future, he said it was not the appropriate time to think about it.																								PTC is the first power trading firm up for listing It clocks a turnover of Rs 200 crore per month from power trading  a fledgling business kick-started after the government initiated sweeping reforms in the sector. 																								On March 30, the listing of Power Trading Corporation was postponed for the second time as the share allotment was unfinished. The debut, put off from March 29 to March 31, was delayed further as MCS told the firm it could not wrap up allotments due to the large issue size.

 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Toyota to rev up with Prado debut
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Road rage																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Toyota Prado could be the next sports utility vehicle (SUV) to roll out in India.																								Toyota Kirloskar Motors, the Indian subsidiary of Toyota Motor of Japan, is mulling the launch of the SUV.																								The buzz is that the carmaker will launch the premium Prado model, pitting it against Mitsubishi Pajero, which retails for Rs 32 lakh.																								Prado, which would be imported as a fully-built unit and sport a sticker price of Rs 30 lakh, will be powered by a three-litre, four-cylinder, 16-valve, inter-cooled, turbo-diesel engine that packs an output of 161 bhp.																								We are studying the SUV segment as this is a rapidly growing market, Toyota Kirloskar Motors managing director A. Toyoshima said. 																								The SUV market has been growing with sales increasing 65 per cent year-on-year in June at 3082 units. The biggest sellers are the Tata Safari and M amp;Ms Scorpio and Bolero. But the premium end of the SUV segment is dominated by Hyundai Indias Terracan at Rs 18 lakh, General Motors Forrester priced between Rs 16-17 lakh and Suzukis Grand Vitara at Rs 15 lakh.																								Toyoshima said the Indian market is expected to more than double to 2 million units by 2010. Toyota plans to corner a market share between 10 per cent and 15 per cent by introducing additional models, which would boost sales, he said.																								Toyota Kirloskar Motors, a joint venture between Toyota and the local Kirloskar group, was established in August 1997 with a paid-up capital of Rs 700 crore. Since then, it has invested Rs 200 crore and plans to spend another Rs 130-160 crore this year, which would increase its capacity to 60,000 units from 45,000.																								The plant, located on the outskirts of Bangalore, currently manufactures the Qualis utility vehicle and the Corolla mid-size cars. It imports the luxury Camry sedan as a fully-built unit.																								The capacity expansion programme will be completed by year-end, which would help bring down the waiting period of our models, deputy managing director K. K. Swamy said.																								However, profits are expected to dip or at the most remain flat inspite of an overall growth in revenues due to an increase in excise rates of steel, he added.																								In the previous fiscal to March 2004, the automaker had clocked a profit of Rs 109 crore on a turnover of Rs 2,700 crore. It expects to report a lower profit of Rs 80-100 crore in 2004-05 although revenues would rise around 14 per cent to Rs 3,100 crore.																								The profit situation is still fluid as the operating margins are sliding, added Swamy.

		 Monday, May 31, 2004  Q amp;A				 Paying partners
																																																																																													Can the salary or interest paid by a registered partnership firm involved in the trading of edible oils to its partners be claimed as deduction in computing total income of the firm? 																																																																													B. Saha, Calcutta 
																																																																																													Interest payment is eligible for deduction up to a limit of 12 per cent on capital employed by the partners. 																																																																																													 case of salaries, deduction can be claimed on the actual salary paid or a per centange of book profit of the company whichever is higher. If the firm has a book profit of Rs 75,000, then 90 per cent of it is eligible for deduction, on the next Rs 75,000 it can get relief on 60 per cent and on the balance, 40 per cent will be deducted. If the firm suffers a loss, then the deduction amount can not exceed Rs 50,000. 																																					Tax token																																																																																															I am a senior citizen and have a house and telephone. Am I required to pay income tax on LIC annuity pension? My taxable income is Rs 70,000 but senior citizens have a tax rebate of Rs 10,000. Am I required to submit income tax returns? 																																																																													P. K. Saha, Calcutta
																																																																																													LIC annuity pension is taxable. If your taxable income is Rs 70,000, your tax liability comes to Rs 3,000. Rebate is allowed on tax liability, not taxable income, which is Rs 20,000 for senior citizens. Since your tax liability is within the limit of rebate, you need not pay any tax. 																																																																																													 income tax return has to be filed if the total income computed after all deductions exceed Rs 50,000 and in your case, it is Rs 70,000. Moreover, since you own a house and telephone, you will have to file return under 1/6 scheme. 																																					Filing returns																																																																																															I am 74 years old and have a PAN card. I have no income for the last two years and before that also, I never had any taxable income till 2002-03. I have Rs 5 lakh in a company deposit, which is due for redemption in the current period. But the company has applied to the law board and has not paid out a single penny yet. Do I still have to file income tax return?																																																																													M. M. De, Calcutta
																																																																																													Since you have not received the proceeds from your company deposit, it will not be included in your taxable income. If your income does not exceed Rs 50,000 after considering all deductions and you do not fall under 1/6 scheme, you need not file returns.

 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Mergers welcome
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 28: The government will not object to the consolidation of banks as the sector needs institutions with adequate strength, muscle power and scale to function like a world-class bank, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today.																								Consolidation is the name of the game in every sector, be it oil or telecom. Banks also have to consider mergers that will not only deliver strength and necessary muscle, but also create a world-class bank, he said. Consolidation alone will give us the strength, muscle, size and scale to act like world-class banks.																								IBA chairman V. Leeladhar said consolidation is an inevitable process as banks need to reap the benefits of economies of scale.																								Leeladhar, who heads Union Bank of India, said our banks do not feature high on the list of large global banks. While only 20 Indian banks feature in the top 1000 list, even smaller countries like Taiwan have banks larger than the largest Indian bank.																								There are synergies to be leveraged through consolidation. Factors such as size, spread, technology, human resource and capital can be reconciled, he added.

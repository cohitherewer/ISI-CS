 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 ONGC to sink Rs 30000 cr in high-sea hunt
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 Gold-digger 																								Mumbai, Feb. 15: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has lined up investments of over Rs 30,000 crore in the next four years. Apart from deep-water exploration and drilling, the funds will be used for enhancing recovery methods in its oil fields.																								The investment is part of the companys strategic initiatives targeted at increasing its domestic exploration and development efforts and improving the oil and gas recovery rates and gas utilisation levels.																								In its prospectus submitted to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), ONGC has said in addition to these efforts, the focus will be on expanding the companys international production and diversifying operations through downstream integration.																								ONGC is planning to spend close to Rs 4,486 crore to explore and develop the deep-water acreage granted under the new exploration licensing policy (NELP). 																								This campaign involves deployment of three advanced deep-water drilling ships and international consultants for geological survey and deep-water drilling services, ONGC said.																								The company will also explore existing shallow-water offshore and onshore basins.																								Around Rs 9,571 crore will be used for oil field redevelopment programmes and enhanced oil recovery projects. Over Rs 8,356 crore will be deployed in the Mumbai offshore basin, a mature area whose production is declining.																								A similar programme is also on the anvil at the Cambay basin (located in Gujarat), which is a significant onshore crude and natural gas producing area for ONGC. The company is planning to invest over Rs 660 crore on its redevelopment work. 																								In the Assam basin, an investment of around Rs 553 crore on redevelopment projects is also planned.																								According to ONGC, it will also look into its overseas exploration ventures through ONGC Videsh Ltd. The company plans to diversify production by expanding the international output of crude and natural gas.																								To do so, ONGC is looking at opportunities to acquire or obtain participation interests in additional producing assets and exploration and development concessions in promising overseas locations. 																								Currently, while assets in Vietnam and Sudan are international producing centres, the Sakhalin-1 project in the Russian Far East is yet to begin production. 																								It will conduct intensive exploration in its existing block in Myanmar where natural gas deposits have been discovered recently, as well as its blocks in Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, ONGC added. 																								Moreover, ONGC Videsh is eyeing oil and gas producing assets in Africa and western, central and Southeast Asia.

 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Mauritius venture augurs well for IOC
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 8: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects to break even in its Mauritian venture during the next financial year (2005-06). 																								The first year will be a phase of consolidation in which 10 petrol pumps will also be set up and the company would start making a profit in the second year, a senior IOC official told The Telegraph.																								IOC is now rubbing shoulders with multinationals Shell, Caltex, British Petroleum (BP) and Total of France with its foray into Mauritius where it has started supplying jet fuel. Mauritius Airlines has given the Indian oil major a 20 per cent share of the aviation fuel market while the rest is with the four global giants. 																								A state-of-the-art micro-processor controlled storage terminal with a capacity of 15,500 tonnes was inaugurated last week and forms part of IOCs $ 18 million investment plan for Mauritius. The storage terminal will increase the petroleum goods storage capacity on the island by 20 per cent. 																								The Mauritius petroleum goods market is dominated by multinationals and IOCs entry is expected to help break this stranglehold so that consumers can benefit in terms of lower prices and better service due to increased competition. 																								The Mauritian venture comes close on the heels of IOCs Sri Lankan foray where it is operating around 100 filling stations and supplying bunker fuel to ships as well. IOC will start supplying bunker fuel to ships at Mauritian ports as well. 																								The Indian oil major plans to set up a network of 25 petrol stations in Mauritius in a phased manner apart from the aviation fuel and marine bunker business. 																								IOC chairman M. S. Ramachandran, who visited Mauritius recently, expects the companys first petrol pump to be rolled out by the middle of this year. This will be followed by another nine filling stations in the first phase. IOC will also invest $500,000 to set up a modern laboratory on the island to test jet fuel, petrol and gas.																								IOC is also marketing its Servo brand of lubricants in Mauritius in small quantities and this is expected to pick up once the petrol pumps are in place.																								IOC has a lubricants blending plant at Dubai and this can be used to supply its retail filling stations in Mauritius. 																								The company earns around $2 million a year through lubricants exports. The other countries where the Servo brand is marketed include Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bahrain Nepal and Yemen.

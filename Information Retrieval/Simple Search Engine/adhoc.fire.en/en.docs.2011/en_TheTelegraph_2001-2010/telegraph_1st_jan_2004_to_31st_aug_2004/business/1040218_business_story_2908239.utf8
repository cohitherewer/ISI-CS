 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 On the road, old masters amp; new owners
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 17: The government hit the road today with campaigns for a selloff wave that promises to unleash a tide of excitement for investors and markets.																								Bets are high that stake sales in Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited (IPCL) and CMC  the former owned by the Ambanis and the latter by the Tatas  will re-ignite the kind of scramble seen in Marutis float.																								CMC got the selloff juggernaut rolling with expectations that the government will eventually succeed in raising more than the Rs 14,000 crore it aimed to. In all, 39.76 lakh shares, constituting 26.25 per cent of the diluted post-offer paid-up capital, will be sold.																								Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie and IPCL chairman Mukesh Ambani flagged off IPCLs hard-sell drive under which the Centre will sell 5.94 crore shares  or 23.94 per cent of its paid-up capital. 																								This is a historic phase in the Indian capital markets, said Vallabh Bhanshali, chairman of Enam Financial consultants, one of the lead managers to the CMC issue.																								CMC chairman S. Ramadorai, who is also the TCS vice-chairman, did not say much on the issue, choosing to focus on the synergy between the two Tata firms.																								Shourie, strongly backing disinvestment, said many companies where the government had sold its stake had shown marked improvements in performance.																								He said the decision to go in for another round of divestment reflected the governments confidence in the management of these firms. We are confident that the company will prosper under the new management. 																								Referring to the criticism of the selloff process, Shourie said experience had proved that it was a vindication of the disinvestment policy and procedures. He cited specific instances where PSUs that were sold went from strength to strength under new owners.																								He cited the case of Paradip Phosphates, a company that suffered losses of Rs 12 crore every month. Post disinvestment, production at the company quadrupled. In other companies, employee wages increased 25-30 per cent; in some, even allowances were restored.																								Kotak Mahindra Capital Company chief Uday Kotak, whose firm is managing the IPCL share sale, called the second round of government stake sales a historic development. He drew attention to the way markets boomed in the eight months since the Maruti offer. There has been a dramatic turnaround since then.																								Speaking on the occasion, Ambani said more than a year ago, when the government sold a strategic stake in IPCL, Reliance paid Rs 231 for a share whose book-value was Rs 120. 																								This reflected our conviction in the value of IPCL, he said, adding the company is now planning an expansion programme of over Rs 350 crore and extending its global reach. He indicated that Reliances Krishna-Godavari gas find would feed two IPCL crackers.

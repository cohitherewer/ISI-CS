 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Return fears roil ICICI Bank share
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 11: Shares of ICICI Bank were smothered on bourses by concerns that its just-announced public offering of stocks will crimp returns. The knock, which came just a day after the countrys largest private sector bank took the wraps off a Rs 3500-crore flotation, sent the stock tumbling Rs 27.60, or 7.98 per cent, to Rs 318.15 against Rs 345.75 on Tuesday. 																								Market watchers said the sudden decision by the bank to raise funds through equity was a damper. CLSA, a key foreign investment bank, went ahead and slashed the rating assigned to the stock to under-perform.																								Analysts remain upbeat on the banks growth prospects in the domestic market, but are plagued by fears that the planned 20 per cent equity dilution and investments in an overseas foray will slice return on equity.																								The share price has shot up two fold in the past six months, and analysts say it is now quoted at a premium to its peers. This difference will come under pressure as a result of the Rs 3000 crore-3500 crore float. The issue is expected once the mega issues of ONGC, Gail and the residual stake sales in IPCL, CMC and a few others like Dredging Corporation of India, are through. The fact that a shareholders meeting has been called in March points to a launch in April or May.																								Analysts reckon that the share-offer will give more room to foreign investors, who have almost reached the ceiling of 74 per cent with their present holding of 71 per cent. The management has indicated to analysts that the capital mop-up will be adequate for the next four years.																								The bank is known to be aggressive in the area of retail loans where it has increased its market-share and is giving leaders in these segments a run for their money. Analysts expect retail lending to continue to grow at a fast clip with the current figures up 85 per cent from last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 How it all added up for the ace accountant
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, July 13: Rajendra S. Lodha, one of the leading names in the countrys chartered accountancy circuit, first came into the limelight in 1984 when he became the president of the Indian Chambers of Commerce (ICC). 																								A senior partner of Lodha amp; Co, he earned the accolades of accounting professionals at a very early age. That brought him into focus, and finally in touch with the Birla clan.																								The ICC assignment, said a senior member of the chamber, had given him proximity to old family-run business houses, including the Birlas. Another advantage he had is that his father J. P. Lodha was a leading chartered accountant and had held briefs for various family-run businesses, including some from the Birlas, sources said.																								His impeccable academic background (he was a gold medallist in the chartered accountancy exams) and articulate ways have always attracted people. And, the Birlas were no different, sources said.																								He became associated with the MP Birla group about two decades back, when the patriarch was very active. 																								According to Birla Corporation sources, Lodha drew Birlas attention quickly. After M. P. Birlas death, he quite obviously became the person Priyamvada depended on. She made him co-chairman of the group.

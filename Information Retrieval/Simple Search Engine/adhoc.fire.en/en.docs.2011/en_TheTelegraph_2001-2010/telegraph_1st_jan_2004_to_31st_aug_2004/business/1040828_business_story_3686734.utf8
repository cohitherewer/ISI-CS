 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Inflation rate dips to 7.94%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: The inflation rate fell marginally by two basis points to touch 7.94 per cent, from a high of 7.96 per cent last weekend.																								Although vegetable prices soared in most centres, lower mineral prices saw the index falling.																								The government also discounted reports of any possible increase in Indian petro-product prices on the back of a fresh round of global crude-price rise.																								At a time when inflation is creeping up to 8 per cent, a responsive government has to give priority to holding the price line, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar told newspersons here today.																								Finance ministry officials said they expected the index to fall further as vegetable prices have already started cooling down, and prices of other food products like chicken have also fallen in many centres. Once the truckers strike is sorted out you can expect lower prices all over. Besides, the duty cut on petro products will also come into play in calculating price index soon.																								However, oil prices rose again today in global markets, stemming from five days of heavy losses as fresh sabotage attacks on Iraqi oil infrastructure despite a peace deal in Najaf renewed concern over the countrys supplies. US crude climbed 40 cents to $43.50 a barrel, $6 below a record peak struck last Friday at $49.40. Londons Brent crude gained 42 cents to $40.75 a barrel.																								Despite the danger of inflation creeping up further, the central bank saw no need to constrain demand by sucking up more money from the market as it was more a supply shock, which was responsible for the recent spike in inflation. It is predominantly a supply shock and we are monitoring it very carefully, Reserve Bank governor Y. V. Reddy told a bankers forum in Hyderabad.

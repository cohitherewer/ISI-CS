 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Kshema Tech in Mphasis fold
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 2: The Mphasis BFL group has bought the Bangalore-based Kshema Technologies for $21 million through a combination of stock and cash deal.																								Mphasis will pay $6 million in cash to acquire a 33 per cent stake in Kshema, with the remaining 67 per cent in stock. 																								Kshema is a high-end IT services company established in 1997. It provides software solutions in industrial automation and embedded technologies, healthcare and life sciences and enterprises applications.																								The company has over 400 employees and global customers in the US, Canada and Europe. 																								Mphasis BFL chairman and CEO Jerry Rao said the acquisition will provide a fillip to the companys service offerings in embedded solutions and industrial automation space. It will help us stay ahead of our competitors in a challenging global market, he added.																								Kshema, having 35 clients, is expected to report $15 million in revenues and a profit of Rs 7 crore in 2003-04 and cash reserves of Rs 60 crore.																								Kshemas authorised capital is Rs 18 crore and it has a paid-up capital of Rs 3.4 crore. Venture capital firm Global Technology Ventures held a 48 per cent stake in the firm and Singapore Computer Services owned 30 per cent, which it acquired for $12 million in early 2002.																								We wanted scale and were looking out for acquisitions or aligning with a similar player to tap global business, Kshema CEO Anant Koppar said. He will be president, technology division of Mphasis.																								Rao said an extraordinary general meeting would be called soon for shareholders approval and the deal is expected to be completed by June 30, subject to regulatory approvals.																								Asked whether SCS wanted cash to exit from Kshema, he said they preferred cash, adding the venture capital firms had exited Kshema.																								Rao said 15 per cent of Mphasis IT services revenues of $31 million in the third quarter ended December 31 came from technology business with clients, including H-P and NEC and we would be able to increase our business with them through the additional strength.																								Kshema had set a revenue target of $100 million by 2005-06, but could not go beyond $15 million because of changing business environments, Koppar said.

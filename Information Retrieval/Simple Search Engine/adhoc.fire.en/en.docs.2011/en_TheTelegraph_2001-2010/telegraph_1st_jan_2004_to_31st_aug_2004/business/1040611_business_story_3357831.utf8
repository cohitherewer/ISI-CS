 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised to personally look into the controversy over demands that Balcos residual stake be sold by the government to Sterlite. 																								CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who met the Prime Minister to press him to intervene and stop any such sale, said Singh had assured him that he would look into the entire matter. 																								Sterlite Industries, which three years ago had under a controversial deal bought majority stake in Balco, has applied to the government seeking to buy the remaining stake in the highly profitable aluminium major.																								Coal and mines minister Shibu Soren has already promised that the government will see whether it at all needs to sell the residual 49 per cent stake it holds in the firm.																								Sterlites initial buy had rocked Parliament for months as it had bought its 51 per cent stake in Balco for Rs 551 crore. Opposition parties, including the Congress and the Left, had termed it a classic case of crony capitalism as many analysts valued the firm at over Rs 3,500 crore. 																								Sterlite had earlier this year applied to the NDA government for buying out the residual stake. However, no decision was taken at that time. It was left to the new government to take a call on the stake sale issue.Sterlite plans rights issue																								Sterlite Industries will raise Rs 2,084.47 crore through a rights issue of equity shares and has filed a draft offer with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). 																								The shares of face value Rs 5 would carry a premium of Rs 545 per share, the market regulator said today. The issue includes the promoters contribution  Anil Agarwal, Dwarka Prasad Agarwal, Twinstar Holdings Ltd and Madras Aluminium Company Limited, it said.

 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Apollo eyes Europe market
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 20: Apollo Tyres plans to tie up with major European automakers this year to supply passenger car radials, said Onkar S. Kanwar, chairman and managing director of the firm.																								We already export passenger car tyres to the Latin American market but we are now targeting the European market which will be our future growth driver, said Kanwar on the sidelines of a conference to announce the launch of Apollo-Michelin co-branded tyres.																								The Delhi-based tyremaker, last year, had offloaded 14.9 per cent of its equity for Rs 129 crore to French tyre major Michelin and formed a joint venture company to manufacture radial tyres for commercial vehicles.																								Michelin will hold a 51 per cent stake in the new joint venture  Michelin Apollo Tyre Ltd  to be set up at a cost of Rs 322 crore over the next four years, while Apollo will hold the rest. 																								Kanwar also said the firm plans to invest between Rs 100 crore and 150 crore for capacity expansion which would be funded partially through internal accruals and money raised through a debt programme.

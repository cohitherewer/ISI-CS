The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Recipe for boom on bourses
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 18: JM Morgan Stanley has charted out five tenets to fuel the domestic capital market growth over the next five years.																								Chairman and managing director Nimesh M. Kampani said there should be an increase in market capitalisation, free float and asset under management of equity mutual funds, coupled with changes in the systems used in the market and emergence of several growth industries.																								The market capitalisation should double within the next five years, Kampani said at a seminar on capital markets organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (eastern region) in association with the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.																								The current market capitalisation is $220 billion, which is 37 per cent of the countrys GDP in 2003-04. In contrast, the average market capitalisation worldwide is pegged at 78 per cent of GDP. 																								Thus, the domestic capital market is poised for a significant growth in the coming period, said Kampani.																								Secondly, an increase in free float will substantially raise investors participation, thereby enhancing liquidity and market capitalisation. Furthermore, it will lead to price sustainability in the market due to efficient demand-supply conditions. Dilution in the promoters holding and divestment by the government will help increase the free float.																								The domestic equity mutual funds has the potential to grow at a CAGR of 30 per cent in the next five years, said Kampani. Currently, the mutual fund industry stands at $6 billion, which is a mere 3 per cent of the total market capitalisation. It has the potential to grow to $22 billion by 2009, whereas the total market capitalisation will grow to $450 billion. Thus, in 2009, mutual fund will constitute 5 per cent of the total market capitalisation, which still leaves a huge room for growth, considering the US mutual fund industry stands at 23 per cent of the total market capitalisation.																								Changes and improvisation in the capital market systems should also lead to growth. Steps such as integration of trading and payment mechanism, review of primary issue process and introduction of the unique identification number programme by the Securities and Exchange Board of India are all in the right direction, said Kampani.																								Finally, the emergence of various growth industries will provide a huge impetus to the market. Kampani broadly classified the industries into domestic market-oriented and export-oriented. The former includes the services (telecom, retail), manufacturing (auto and auto ancillaries, consumer goods) and infrastructure and infrastructure inputs (power, ports, cement, steel) industries. Among the latter, the infotech and IT-enabled services industries will witness a major growth, with the former growing to $32 billion and the latter to $25 billion by 2009. 																								The Indian IT services will constitute 5 per cent of the global industry in the next five years. The other export-oriented industries are pharmaceuticals and healthcare, including auto ancillary and textiles.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 IMF gets a Spanish boss
				 	 Rodrigo Rato at a press conference in Madrid on Wednesday. (Reuters)																								Washington, May 5 (Reuters): The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday elected Spanish former economy minister Rodrigo Rato as its new managing director that maintains the tradition of a European heading the 184-nation global lender.																								Rato was picked in a two-stage vote by the IMFs 24-member executive board, including a secret straw poll that produced a majority in favour of the Spaniard, the fund said.																								The executive board of the International Monetary Fund today selected Rodrigo Rato to serve as managing director and chairman of the executive board for a five-year term, an IMF statement said.																								Rato, 55, succeeds Horst Koehler, who resigned in March to bid for the German presidency. He is expected to hold a news conference in Madrid on Wednesday.																								His appointment is considered a triumph for the political status quo over change sought by developing countries that want to end the 60-year custom of putting a European in charge of the IMF.																								IMF directors said Ratos selection was a done deal before Tuesdays vote despite the nomination of a second candidate, Mohamed El-Erian, a former senior IMF official.																								Egyptian-born El-Erian was nominated by Egypts IMF executive director, Shakour Shaalan, who led the developing worlds push for more say over the selection of the funds top official.																								Board sources said the final tally of the secret straw poll, that would indicate if there were any objections to Ratos taking the top job, was not divulged to directors.																								There were no abstentions in the formal vote that followed, which showed consensus over Rato, the sources added.																								In the formal session we all united around the one candidate, one source said.

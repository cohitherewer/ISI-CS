The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 UBI asked to hasten recast of tea loans
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Turning a new leaf																								Calcutta, April 1: The Indian Banks Association has directed United Bank of India to restructure the loans of tea companies.																								The Indian Tea Association recently wrote to . Sisodia, secretary in the department of banking and insurance, that some banks, including State Bank of India, United Bank (UBI) and Union Bank, had not yet implemented the tea relief package on the ground that no Reserve Bank directive on the issue had reached them.																								Talking to The Telegraph, C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said, UBI has already taken steps to restructure tea loans. The bank has an exposure of more than Rs 300 crore in the sector. It is one of the major bankers to the tea industry, Dhanuka added.																								However, State Bank has not yet taken steps to restructure the loans, the ITA chairman said. The regional office in Calcutta has informed the industry that they have not received any directions from the head-office in Mumbai to restructure the loans, he said.																								SBI has an exposure of Rs 300 crore to the industry. Loans from UBI and SBI account for 60 per cent of the total bank credit extended to tea companies. 																								The industry feels that financial restructuring is extremely important now. The season will begin from April. If the industry has to reap benefits now then the loans should be restructured immediately, industry officials said. The revival package prepared by the IBA says that large tea growers and manufacturers would be considered on a case-to-case basis. The position of accounts as on December 31, 2003, may be considered.																								Irregular outstandings in term/working capital loan accounts as on December 31, 2003, may be converted into a special tea term loan (STTL).																								The repayment of STTL may be allowed over a period of five to seven years, including a moratorium of one year based on the cash-flow projection. Interest on STTL may be charged at the benchmark rate of the bank. The benchmark rate varies between 10.5 to 11 per cent.																								IBA has asked banks to consider a fresh working capital limit based on the requirement. Interest on fresh working capital would be in keeping with the pricing policy of the bank.

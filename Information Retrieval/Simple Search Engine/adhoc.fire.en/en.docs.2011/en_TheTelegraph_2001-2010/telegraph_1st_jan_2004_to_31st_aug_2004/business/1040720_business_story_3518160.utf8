 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Lodha shadow looms on Birla board trinity
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 19: Three Birla companies sail into a turbulent Tuesday as they hold key board meetings amid the controversy over succession in the MP Birla group firms.																								In the focus are Birla Corporation, Birla Ericsson, and Century Textiles, but the turn of events at the second and the third will be the most keenly watched.																								Two of them  Birla Corp and Birla Ericsson  are MP Birla group companies; Century Textiles is a BK Birla group company in which Priyamvada Birla was a director on the strength of the MP Birla groups 25 per cent stake in Pilani Investments.																								Pilani Investments, in turn, holds a 36.39 per cent stake in Century Textiles, while Birla Corp holds another 1.94 per cent in the company out of the total promoter shareholding of 44.87 per cent.																								Century Textiles will hold its 107th annual general meeting in Mumbai amid indications that it will reduce the number of directors on its board from 11 to eight. Priyamvada Birla was up for re-election as a director.																								Birla Corporation will meet to approve the unaudited financial results for the first quarter. 																								A senior company secretary said R. S. Lodhas presence is not essential for a meeting that, ostensibly, will merely approve numbers. 																								The board or its committee can endorse the result, he added. This means Lodha, currently the co-chairman, may not attend the meeting, given the way he has been avoiding publicity. 																								At Birla Ericsson, the board may decide to appoint Lodha as a director in a session that will probably take place after its annual general meeting, which is being held in Rewa (Madhya Pradesh).																								If Lodha is to be the chairman, a special resolution must be moved 21 days before the AGM, company secretaries said. No such resolution has been framed for the board. 																								Lodha, not on Birla Ericsson board, needs to be first inducted as an additional director of the company before he can be elevated as its chairman. 																								It can happen only after the annual general meeting, when the board meets. It will also send a signal on the intention of the board. Lodhas name can be proposed by any director and the board will either support or reject it, a senior company secretary told The Telegraph. 																								Lodha amp; Co, R. S. Lodhas audit firm, has already opted out as the auditors of Birla Ericsson  in a move that was planned two months before Priyamvadas death, but announced on Saturday.

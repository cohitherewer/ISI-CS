 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 28: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the rate of inflation, that currently stands at 7.94 per cent, would come down and asked people to be patient.																								There are three to four factors that fuelled inflation, including excess liquidity and oil price shock, and it (inflation) will moderate, he told newspersons after addressing the annual general meeting of the Indian Banks Association here.																								We have no control over oil prices. We have taken fiscal steps and hopefully the performance of the various sectors will bring down inflation in the coming weeks, he added.																								The government, Chidambaram said, had to take a fiscal hit in order to bring down prices. We have taken a deliberate hit in order to moderate prices, particularly petroleum, he added.																								Explaining the duty cuts on steel and petroleum, the finance minister said, That was a conscious decision, it was not taken in secret.																								Chidambaram said in the past also the country had witnessed 8 per cent inflation on one occasion in 2000-01. However, it did come down soon.																								Asked to comment on interest rates, he said, we want the rates to be stable as stated by Reserve Bank governor Y.V. Reddy.

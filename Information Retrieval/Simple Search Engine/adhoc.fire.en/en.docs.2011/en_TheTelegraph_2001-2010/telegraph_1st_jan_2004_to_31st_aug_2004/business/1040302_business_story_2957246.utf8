 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Petronet falters, Power Trading shines
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 1: Petronet LNG and Power Trading Corporation were the latest to join the booming primary market when their initial public offers opened for subscription today.																								The first day saw investors reacting differently to the issues of the two companies. While Petronet attracted bids for only 3.62 per cent of its 26.1 crore shares on offer, Power Trading had already been oversubscribed two times, having attracted bids for 11.75 crore shares.																								After the initial hiccup, the IBP issue closed today with merchant bankers saying that outstation bids from small investors are still being keyed in. The exact figures will be available only by midnight. The public offer was oversubscribed 1.56 times with bids for 90.31 lakh shares.																								Gail continued to do well with the issue being oversubscribed by more than 1.5 times. It has so far received bids for 12.85 crore shares against 8.45 crore on offer.																								Dredging Corp, in which the government proposes to divest 20 per cent of its stake, was oversubscribed 1.63 times. It received bids for 91.43 lakh shares against 56 lakh shares on offer. Retail investors, considered to be the follower segment flocking for shares at the fag end of the offer period, are expected to queue up as companies like PTC and Petronet have just started operations. Moreover, their shares are available at a small premium.

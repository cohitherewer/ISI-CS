The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Makeover for ICICIPru unit-linked schemes
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, June 13: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has decided to change features in its unit-linked products  the flagship scheme LifeTime, LifeTime Pension, LifeLink, LifeLink Pension and Smartkid.																								Reviews based on consumer feedback acted as guidelines for the changes we made in the product features. It is based on the fundamental philosophy of flexibility and offer consumers with more options, said Abhishek Bhatia, head of marketing.																								The new features of the market-linked plans include introduction of a new fund  Preserver  offering policyholders a low-risk option to invest up to 20 per cent of their initial contribution. The fund invests a maximum of 50 per cent in debt and a minimum of 50 per cent in money market and cash.																								It has also introduced variable premium levels that enable policyholders to increase the planned premium contribution and there is no limit on that. One can also decrease the premium paid to up to 80 per cent of the initial contribution. However, minimum bands apply for each policy. Moreover, loans can be availed up to 40 per cent of the surrender value of LifeTime and LifeLink since the policies acquire a surrender value after payment of the fourth-year premium.																								LifeTime was earlier a three-year premium-paying plan after which investors had the option to pay premium at their discretion. Also, investors had the option to withdraw the entire sum after the three-year period. However, the current changes have made it a 10-year policy, with a premium holiday of two years. If the holiday extends beyond two years, the sum assured under the policy ceases to exist.																								The customers have been given the benefit of two levels of sum assured. It includes a single sum assured which can be increased or decreased on request and also an automatic guaranteed increase in the sum assured by 15 per cent of the base sum assured each year, up to a maximum of Rs 3,00,000 a year.

 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Oil firms breathe a sigh of relief
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 7: The decline in international prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from a peak of $320 per tonne in the winter months to $260 per tonne last week has come as a major relief for the national oil companies which have to foot the lions share of the subsidy on the cooking fuel. 																								Sources said the global demand for LPG has come down with the passing of winter and this has led to a fall in the prices of the fuel used both for cooking and heating purposes.																								The government had made a budget provision of only Rs 6,120 crore for subsidy on LPG and kerosene in 2003-04. This, however, was not enough to meet the subsidy bill. This burden is borne by ONGC and the downstream oil companies like Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation. 																								ONGC alone expects to take a Rs 2,000-crore hit on account of the LPG and kerosene subsidy for the financial year ending March 31, 2004.																								In 2004-05, the provision for the subsidy has been slashed further to Rs 4,300 crore and this will only lead to higher burden on the oil companies unless they are allowed to pass on the increased price to the consumers. 																								This has not been allowed this year because of the Lok Sabha elections. However, after the elections, some increase cannot be ruled out due to the reduced subsidy allocation in the budget. While the country has become self-sufficient in refining capacity and now exports diesel and petrol, LPG is still being imported.																								A substantial quantity of LPG is picked up from Reliance Industries at international prices. Since the demand for LPG exceeds domestic supply, around 2.5 million tonnes of gas has to be imported every year.

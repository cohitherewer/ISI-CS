 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Vedanta shares hammered
																								London, Jan. 27 (PTI): Shares of Vedanta fell to a fresh low after analysts at Morgan Stanley started their review of the company with a stark warning of risks.																								The shares, which were sold to investors at 390 in last months float, fell to 11 to 333. They have underperformed other mining companies, such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, by around 15 in the past six weeks. The float was sponsored by JP Morgan.																								In a note giving an underweight recommendation, Morgan Stanleys Paul McTaggart and Amos Fletcher said yesterday the balance of risks and rewards was not favourable, adding we think there is a significant risk that its key growth project, the green field Orissa alumina refinery, could go over time and budget or indeed not go ahead at all.																								The company is also exposed to further falls in tariffs, commodity prices, copper treatment and refining charges, the Indian rupee, undiversified political risk and litigation contesting ownership of its key zinc business.																								He added, since last months float, Vedanta has already lowered earnings guidance to reflect the Indian governments decision three weeks ago to cut import tariffs on key commodities by about 5 per cent, which came quicker than expected. Cutting tariffs makes minerals, which account for 97 per cent of Vedantas production, less competitive against foreign imports.																								Morgan Stanley calculates each 5 per cent tariff reduction hits Vedantas 2005 net earnings by 21 per cent.

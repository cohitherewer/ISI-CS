 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Heat on fake drug makers
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, July 17: Spurious drug makers beware. The government wants to bring in death penalty for those making fake medicines by amending the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.																								The Mashelkar Committee has proposed punishment relating to spurious drugs up to a maximum of death penalty or imprisonment for a term, which shall not be less than 10 years.																								Pharmaceutical companies, both domestic as well as multinational, had been asking for the most stringent punishment for the makers of spurious drugs.																								In the NDA government, the then minister of health and family welfare, Sushma Swaraj, had announced that the highest form of punishment, including capital punishment must be given to the makers of spurious drugs.																								By treating, the crime as one of the most heinous one and equating it at par with mass murder, the term of imprisonment may be extended to life imprisonment, the proposed bill states. The culprit will also be liable to fine of Rs 1 lakh or up to three time the value of the goods seized, whichever is higher, said sources in the ministry of health and family welfare.																								Penalties for subsequent offences will also be enhanced up to 10 years and with fine, which shall not be less than Rs 1 lakh. Also, offences relating to spurious drugs will be made non-bailable and cognizable.																								India has one of the highest incidents of spurious drugs. Study reports have revealed that one in every four drug is potentially a fake drug, including live-saving drugs.																								In the past the brand protection committee of the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have raided and seized drugs and FMCG products worth crores of rupees and burnt the products.																								The proposed bill also has provisions of setting up special courts for speedy trial of offences relating to spurious or adulterated drugs. 																								It will confer powers upon police officers not below the rank of sub-inspector or other designated officer to institute prosecutions under the said Act.

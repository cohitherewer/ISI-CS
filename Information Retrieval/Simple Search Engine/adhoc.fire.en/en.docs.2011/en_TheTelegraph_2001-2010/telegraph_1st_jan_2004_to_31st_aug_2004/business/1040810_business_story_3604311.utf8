 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Clarity on unified licence 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has clarified that services under the unified licence would include telephony, internet, broadband, cable TV, direct-to-home (DTH), television and radio broadcasting.																								However, if a unified licensee wants to offer broadcasting service using wireless spectrum, the licensee will have to apply to the information and broadcasting ministry. The content, in any case, would be regulated by the I amp;B ministry. The regulator also clarified that stand-alone broadcasting services licence could be issued. The prevailing process of issuing of such a licence by the I amp;B ministry (including allocation of spectrum in consultation with the wireless planning commission) would continue.																								In Trais recommendations on broadband services, DTH has been recommended as one of the alternative platforms to offer broadband services. The authority, in its draft recommendations, had included broadcasting services under the unified licensing category because this licence includes all types of telecom services.

																								New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) today sought increase in foreign direct investment in telecom sector to 74 per cent from the current 49 per cent and sharing of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limiteds infrastructure to reach rural and remote areas.																								The next big push in telecom can come from introduction of unified licensing, sharing of infrastructure to reach rural areas, enhanced FDI/FII limit of 74 per cent to obtain huge funds for networks and increased spectrum, said T. V. Ramachandran, chairman, ITU regional working group on private sector issues for A-Pac. He is also the director general of COAI.																								Introduction of mobile broadband and reduced levies for the sector should also happen as soon as possible, he added.																								The above package of third generation telecom reforms will accelerate economic development and take the benefits of world-class mobile services to rural areas to help India reach a base of 500 million mobile users by 2010. 																								He said mobile tariffs have fallen by over 90 per cent since 1995 and services have spread far and wide to reach the common man.

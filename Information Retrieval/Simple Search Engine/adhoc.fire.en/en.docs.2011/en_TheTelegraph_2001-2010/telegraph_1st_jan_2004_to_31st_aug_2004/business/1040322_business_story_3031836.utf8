 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Tryst with taxman
 In a sweat over filing your returns? Chandralekha Tulal plays your tax planner																								The countdown has begun. With the March 31 deadline looming, taxpayers are scrambling to make last-minute investments to wring tax breaks.																								March 31 spells a double deadline: it is the last opportunity to shovel surplus cash into a melange of investment instruments in order to cushion the blow of the tax axe. It is also the deadline by when you should file your income tax return for the previous fiscal  April 2002 to March 2003  to avoid a penalty of Rs 5,000.																								Tax benefits through savings are mostly targeted at people earning incomes ranging between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5,00,000. 																								Under section 88, tax rebate is available for certain investments such as provident fund, life insurance, infrastructure bonds, National Savings Certificate, equity-linked savings schemes and others. 																								The rebate is also available on repayment of housing loan, both principal and interest, up to an amount of Rs 20,000. Tuition fees for two children, up to an amount or Rs 12,000 per child is also eligible under the total limit of Rs 1,00,000 for claiming tax rebate under section 88. For people earning less than Rs 1,50,000, the rebate is 20 per cent (of the amount invested in instruments that qualify for rebate under this section). For people with an income in the Rs 1,50,000-Rs 5,00,000 range, it is 15 per cent.																								Premium paid for life insurance up to an amount of Rs 70,000 is eligible for rebate under section 88. LIC and other private insurers offer such plans.																								Investment in Public Provident Fund up to an amount of Rs 70,000 is also eligible for tax deductions under section 88. The interest rate offered is 8 per cent with a maturity of 15 years. Equity-linked savings schemes are also another avenue in which investments can be made up to an amount of Rs 10,000 with a lock-in period of three years. 																								Infrastructure bonds (currently the IDBI Flexibonds issue is open) offer an interest of 5.5 to 6 per cent and have a maturity of 3 or 5 years. Investment up to an amount of Rs 1,00,000 is eligible for rebate under section 88.																								National Savings Certificate offers an approximate return of 8 per cent and has a maturity period of 6 years. The investment amount and the accrued interest are eligible under section 88 whereas the interest is allowed as deduction under section 80L.																								People earning an income of more than Rs 5 lakh need not despair: although they do not qualify for tax breaks under section 88, the law allows various deductions from their gross total income under section 80. 																								Under section 80CCC, investment in pension plans up to an amount of Rs 10,000 is eligible for deduction. Medical insurance premium paid by cheque up to Rs 10,000 (Rs 15,000 for senior citizens) is eligible for deduction under section 80D.																								The amount of rent paid for residential accommodation is also eligible for deduction under section 80 GG (as shown in the chart). The amount eligible for deduction is the lowest of three options: Rs 2,000 per month, or 25 per cent of total income, or actual rent paid minus 10 per cent of total income. 																								The most important tax break is under section 80L wherein deduction is allowed on income from various sources like bank interest, cooperative societies, interest on certain government securities, interest on approved financial institutions, interest on investments made in National Savings Certificates and others. Deduction up to Rs 12,000 is allowed with an additional amount of Rs 3,000 for interest on government securities.																								A special rebate is available for senior citizens under section 88B up to an amount Rs 20,000. Rebate is also available for women assessees under section 88C up to an amount of Rs 5,000.

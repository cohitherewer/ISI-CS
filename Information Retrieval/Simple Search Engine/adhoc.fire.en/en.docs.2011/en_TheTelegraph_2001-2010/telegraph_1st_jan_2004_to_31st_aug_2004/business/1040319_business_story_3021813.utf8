 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Microsoft-EU spat on 
																								Brussels, March 18 (Reuters): The European Commission and Microsoft failed to settle antitrust charges on Thursday, removing the last obstacle to a landmark ruling next week branding the company an abusive monopolist.																								Id just like to inform you that a settlement on the Microsoft case has not been possible, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference after three days of top-level talks with the worlds biggest software firm.																								Microsoft had no immediate comment on the breakdown but a spokesman said the company would issue a statement shortly.																								The EU decision, to be adopted next Wednesday, will require Microsoft to supply a second version of its ubiquitous Windows operating system stripped of built-in audio-visual software.																								Brussels will also order the company to share proprietary information with rival server makers and levy a fine running to hundreds of millions of euros.																								Most importantly, Microsoft will be formally ruled to have abused its dominant market position in the European Union, as it was in a 2001 final appeals court ruling in the United States.																								That decision could open the way for further legal action against Microsoft in all European Union countries  25 of them after May 1  if the company is seen to be competing unfairly.																								The Commission is probing two other cases against Microsoft.																								Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer negotiated with Monti for four hours on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday and Thursday, to avoid the formal decision.																								Sources close to the case said he made a last-ditch offer on Wednesday to compel computer makers to carry rival audio-visual software alongside Microsofts dominant Windows Media Player.																								Monti praised Microsofts efforts, but said they fell short because the software giant was unwilling to make commitments to change its future business practices.																								A centrepiece of the Commission inquiry has been to go beyond the specifics of this case and focus more broadly on Microsofts use of its market dominance to crush smaller rivals.																								The aspect of setting a clear and strong legal precedent is indeed of key importance, Monti said. It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company in cases which are either there or on the horizon.

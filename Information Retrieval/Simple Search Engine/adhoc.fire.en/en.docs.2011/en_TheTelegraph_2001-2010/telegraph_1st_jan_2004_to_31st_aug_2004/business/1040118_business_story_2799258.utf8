 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Yamaha plans to raise capacity
 SRINJOY SHARMA 				 	 Top gear																								New Delhi, Jan 17: Yamaha Motor India Ltd plans to boost its production capacity as it expects a nearly 50 per cent jump in sales in 2004 on the back of new models and higher demand.																								Rajiv Pruthi, head of corporate planning at Yamaha Motor India, said they expected higher sales of around 4.5 lakh units will be fuelled by an increased demand from urban and semi-urban areas.																								Yamaha India, the local unit of Japanese Yamaha Motor Corp., will also invest Rs 100 crore in product development and expansion of manufacturing capacities to 5 lakh units from 4.5 lakh in the current calendar year.																								There will be a rationalisation of our models as all our two-stroke bikes including the old Rajdoot model will be phased out due to the new emission norms which comes into effect from 2005 onwards, he said.																								Yamaha plans to launch two motorcycle models  Fazer and Libero Lx  this year. The 125-cc Fazer will be positioned in the deluxe segment priced between Rs 45-50,000 while Libero LX motorcycle has been priced at Rs 39,800.																								We will be in each and every segment within the next two to three years and regain our market share, said Pruthi adding that Yamaha India also plans to enhance its dealer network.																								Pruthi said higher sales volumes are required to compensate the lower growth in revenues due to the hefty price discounts offered by the firm to retain its market share.																								Fazer, to be launched during the summer season, would have dual headlights, engine, balanced suspension, aerodynamic bodylines and be available in five colours.																								M. Shibuya, managing director of Yamaha India, said the motorcycle maker would aim to consolidate its position in the Indian market and strive to translate its research and development efforts into value proposition for the Indian customer.																								With its current Crux, Libero and Enticer premium bikes, Yamaha competes with top selling Hero Honda, second-ranked Bajaj Auto Ltd, which makes bikes using technology from Japans Kawasaki Heavy Industries and third-ranked TVS Motor Co Ltd.

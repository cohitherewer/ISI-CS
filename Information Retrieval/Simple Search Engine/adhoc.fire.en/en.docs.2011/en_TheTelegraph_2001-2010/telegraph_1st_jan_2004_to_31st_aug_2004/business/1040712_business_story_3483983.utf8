 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 More powers for tax officers on valuation
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Close vigil 																								New Delhi, July 11: The powers of income tax assessing officers are being strengthened through a new section 142A, which will have retrospective application from November 15, 1972.																								The new section states that an assessing officer has and always had the power to make a reference to the valuation officer in any dispute over the determination of the cost of construction of properties.																								The change has been necessitated because section 131 which vested powers in an assessing officer to make a reference to a valuation officer  had sparked different legal interpretations.																								The new section removes the convoluted manner in which the power is devolved to the assessing officer under section 131. 																								The old section said the assessing officer had the same powers as are vested in a court under the code of civil procedure 1908 when trying a suit. One such power related to issuing commission which empowered the court to make a local investigation and also to hold a scientific, technical or expert investigation. 																								The new section says the assessing officer can also make a referral to a valuation officer seeking an estimate of the value of any bullion, jewellery or other valuable article for the purpose of making an assessment or reassessment.																								The valuation officer to whom such a reference is made will have all the powers that he already enjoys under section 38A of the Wealth Tax Act 1957.																								Sub-section 3 of the proposed new section says that after the receipt of the valuation report, the assessing officer may, after giving the assessee an opportunity to be heard, take into account the report while making an assessment or reassessment.																								The intention of inserting such a section is not to unsettle the cases already decided (except in cases where a reassessment is required to be made under section 153A), says the explanatory memorandum to the Finance Bill. 																								It is proposed to include a proviso to the new section that it shall not apply in respect of an assessment made on or before September 30, 2004 and where such an assessment has become final and conclusive.

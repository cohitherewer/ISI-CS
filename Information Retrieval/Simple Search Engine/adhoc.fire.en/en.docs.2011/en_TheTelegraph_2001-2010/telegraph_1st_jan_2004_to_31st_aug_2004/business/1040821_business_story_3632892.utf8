 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Power Finance to fund projects abroad
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: Power Finance Corporation will offer loans and pick up equity in projects in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other neighbouring countries.																								The corporation will also set up a subsidiary to offer merchant banking services like those provided by SBI Capital Markets. The merchant banking services will be focused on power sector.																								The state-owned corporation is in the process of drafting a vision document for 2012 and 2020 that will highlight the process and strategies it needs to undertake to become a leading financial institution for power sector projects.																								The vision document will contain a few core areas that need to be addressed as part of its growth strategy.																								PFC has identified lending for power projects in new areas like financial services and allied services. It is also planning investments in fuel linkage, gas pipeline, new services areas like international operations, direct investment in coal mining, gas and thermal power projects and human services as its core thrust areas as part of the future vision of the company.																								Shyam Wadhera, director (projects) of PFC, said, The vision document will include the core area and will be headed by an executive director for each of the core areas to monitor them both at the conceptualisation and implementation stages.																								The plan is to transform PFC from a simple lending agency to a comprehensive and complete financial service provider for the power sector, not only in India but also in other countries. We will offer services to power projects in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operations (Saarc) countries. This will be our initial target, but later we plan to take up equity in power projects in these countries in the South Asia region, Wadhera said.																								The corporation is also planning to revise its lending rates for power projects based on the project cost after the final approval of the draft. The power projects in state sector, that need an investment of Rs 1000 crore and above, have been categorised as mega project, while those requiring less than Rs 700 crore will be considered as large projects.																								However, private sector projects that require an investment of over Rs 500 crore have been categorised as mega projects, while those that need an investment of Rs 300-500 crore have been classified as large projects.																								Lending for 15 projects with a capacity to generate 6,700 megawatt of power are pending at various stages with the PFC.																								The corporations proposal to set up an India Power Fund with an initial corpus of $5 billion to help PFC meet the capacity addition targets during the ninth and tenth plan periods is pending before the government.

 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Gail bid to thwart Reliance pipeline
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Aiyar and Banerjee: Joining forces 																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: Gail (India) Ltd has locked horns with Reliance Industries Ltd over the proposed inter-state gas pipeline from Kakinada on the Andhra coast to Gujarat for transporting gas from the offshore Krishna-Godavari (K-G) basin.																								Sources say Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee will be meeting petroleum and natural gas minister Mani Shankar Aiyar very soon to make a presentation against the Reliance move.																								Gail is of the view that the Reliance proposal to build the pipeline goes against the draft policy drawn up by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas in September 2003. 																								This draft clearly states that Gail is the notified company to build all inter-state trunk pipelines for the transportation of gas across the country. 																								According to Gail officials, the draft policy also states that any producer of gas can lay a pipeline of up to only 100 km to sell the gas directly to consumers.																								The draft policy envisages Gail as the only company to lay inter-state pipelines which can be used by other companies on a common-carrier principle. This approach is also followed in other countries as it avoids wasteful duplication of pipelines among competing companies. The US is the only exception to this rule. 																								Gails claim is that it has already drawn up plans to lay the Kakinada-Uran pipeline to link the east with the west as part of its ambitious national gas grid plan.																								An internal paper prepared by Gail argues that although Reliance wants to lay the inter-state gas pipeline to transport its own gas, this is not permissible under the draft policy. Nor does the new exploration policy under which Reliance was awarded the offshore gas block have any provision for laying such a pipeline.																								The paper points out that both Gail and Reliance had made presentations to the petroleum secretary in April this year about the tariffs for transporting gas from the KG basin. While Reliance did not specify any tariff in its proposal, Gail had confirmed a tariff of $ 0.39 per million British thermal units for transporting the gas.																								Reliance, on the other hand, has floated a subsidiary called Gas Transportation and Infrastructure Company Ltd (GTCIL) to build the proposed gas pipeline.																								Reliance has been claiming that it had applied for the right of way for its pipeline before the draft policy was announced and, therefore, should be allowed to go ahead with the project. 																								The company has tied up with NTPC to supply gas for the Kawas and Gandhar power projects from its offshore field in the K-G basin.

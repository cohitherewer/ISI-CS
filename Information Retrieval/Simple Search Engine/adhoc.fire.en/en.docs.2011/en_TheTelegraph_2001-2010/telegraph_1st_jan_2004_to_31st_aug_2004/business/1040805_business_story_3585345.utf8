 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Essar Steel to raise $200 m 
																								New Delhi, Aug. 4 (PTI): Essar Steel, owned by the Ruias, is likely to raise up to $200 million or about Rs 1,000 crore from the market for its long-term working capital requirements. It would also reduce the companys interest outgo on loans and debts.																								The funds can also be used to swap costly Indian rupee loans with cheaper overseas funds, thereby saving the companys interest outgo, officials said. The company gives away about Rs 462 crore annually as interest payments on its term loans, debentures and borrowings from banks.																								Essar Steel has not fixed any time schedule for entering the market. Officials said it would offer financial instruments to members, promoters, employees, debenture-holders, strategic investors, financial institutions, banks, foreign investors, NRIs, FIIs among others, at an appropriate time.																								It would approach the Sebi, Reserve Bank of India and government after finalising the terms and conditions of the issue.

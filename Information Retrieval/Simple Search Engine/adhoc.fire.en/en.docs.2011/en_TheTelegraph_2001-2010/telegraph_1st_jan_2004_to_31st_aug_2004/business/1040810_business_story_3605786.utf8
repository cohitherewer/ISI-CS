 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Paswan asked to tame steel prices
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY(From top) Singh, Paswan amp; Chidambaram: Peer pressure 																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: In a first bid to batten down the hatches against further depradations by the inflationary monster, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his chief firefighter, finance minister P. Chidambaram, want their colleague steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan to talk down raging steel prices. 																								The Big Two want Paswan to get the head honchos of steel firms like Tisco, Essar, Ispat and Jindals to agree to stall a planned rise in steel prices by another Rs 500-Rs 1,000 a tonne and then roll back prices by using a combination of carrot and stick.																								Although steelmakers deny such a move, the government is convinced they are planning to do so and wants to nip it in the bud. Besides the panic which high inflation rates have induced in Singhs cabinet, the need to talk down prices also stems from the heat raised by politically well-connected steel-user foundries. 																								The BJP leaderships smug statements about the inability of the present government to manage the economy properly, and hints that prices were being deliberately allowed to rise, have added fuel to the fire. 																								The government also wants to roll back export incentives to steel makers as a punitive step against the sudden price hikes. It also wants to slash duties on ship breaking and the scrap steel this industry supplies to the countrys re-rolling mills and foundries as this could help reduce or arrest increases in prices of construction steel. 																								North Block and the PMO have, however, made it clear to Udyog Bhawan (where the steel ministry is housed) that it still must call a meeting to halt the rapid-fire strategy that has seen steel prices surge by as much as Rs 2,000 a tonne over the past month. It has been stressed that such a move is essential if it wants to slam the lid on the hydra of inflation.																								Rising prices mean higher costs all around as steel is a basic component of all manufacturing and construction activities. Any increase has a cascading effect on all goods. 																								However, the problem for the PM and his lieutenant is that Paswan wants to wriggle out of this tough job by claiming that in a free market he has no role to play in talking down prices  a strange stand for a man who wanted to build a steel regulatory mechanism just a month back. 																								Top aides of the PM believe this is because he is still sulking at the way in which the PMO had scuttled that plan. 																								The sudden steel price rise has been one of the main factors for the inflation rate jumping to a three-and-a-half year high of 7.52 per cent, leaving users of the metal  in cars and kitchen goods to building roads and houses  with fatter bills. 																								Instead of calling a meeting, Paswan has asked chief executives of steel firms to give him a plan on how to contain rising prices. 																								Predictably, these CEOs want export of high quality iron ore from Kudremukh, which is being sold to Japan under a long-term pact, stopped. They are also pressing for slashing duty on raw material like coke and sponge iron to zero, better supply of natural gas and lowering of interest rates, besides bringing down excise duties to 5 per cent. This is a wishlist that the finance ministry is not at all impressed with. 																								Domestic steel rates have been going up mainly because of a gap between global and domestic prices. While the landed cost of steel stands at Rs 36,000 a tonne, it is around Rs 28,000-Rs 30,000 a tonne at home.

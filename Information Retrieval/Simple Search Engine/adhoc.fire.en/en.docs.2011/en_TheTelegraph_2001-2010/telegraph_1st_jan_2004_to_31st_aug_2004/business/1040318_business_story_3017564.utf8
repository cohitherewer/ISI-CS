 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Varun looks at Singapore anchor
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Going places																								Mumbai, March 17: Varun Shipping plans to list its shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange through an issue of Singapore depository receipts (SDRs).																								The company board has appointed a committee of directors to explore the possibility of issuing SDRs. The shipping company had said it planned to raise funds to the tune of Rs 275 crore to expand its fleet.																								This is the first time that an Indian company is considering listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange. 																								Already, investors in Singapore, including the government of Singapore and Temasek Holdings, have considerable exposure on the Indian bourses. Singaporean investors have invested in Indian companies and the debut could be an easy task, analysts said.																								So far, Indian companies have listed on only four or five global bourses. These include the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq in the US, the London Stock Exchange and exchanges in Luxembourg and Frankfurt. 																								Varun Shipping officials said Singapore is a maritime country and there is a lot of interest in the shipping sector.																								Recently, Indian companies have been raising funds through the global depository receipts route by listing them on Luxembourg or London bourses. Varun Shipping has steered to the Far East, which may make others sit up and take notice, analysts said.																								The company recently acquired its fifth liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carrier. With this acquisition, the company controls almost 65 per cent of the LPG tonnage in the country. The company is planning to acquire two to three vessels in the hydrocarbon sector in nine months. 																								Over the years, Varun Shipping has been concentrating on the hydrocarbon sector, which has paid rich dividends as freight rates rose in line with other sectors.																								The company has recently announced a 10 per cent interim dividend.

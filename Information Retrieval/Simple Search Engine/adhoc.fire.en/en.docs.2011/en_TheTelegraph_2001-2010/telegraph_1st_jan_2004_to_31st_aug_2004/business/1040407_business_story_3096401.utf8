 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Call for oil hunt bar on China, Pak 
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, April 6: The home and defence ministries have reportedly asked the petroleum ministry to disallow companies from countries like China and Pakistan from bidding for a piece of the action in the upcoming NELP-V round of bidding for oil and gas exploration blocks. 																								The BJP-led government plans to invite tenders for NELP-V on May 25. The petroleum and finance ministries, which are keen that this round of bidding goes off well and can be held up as another bit of India Shining, are against any restrictions being imposed on bidders based on nationality. They are, however, agreeable to restrictions being imposed on blocks in sensitive areas.																								In fact, the government is keen that data centres be opened in Singapore, London and the US besides the main centre in Delhi to attract a wider audience. The government also wants to conduct high profile road shows in Europe, South East Asia and the US to hawk the oil fields on offer.																								The government is expected to insist on tough conditions similar to those imposed during the last round of bidding. Oil companies will be asked to deposit any disputed dues in an escrow account and the government will reserve the right to cancel a production sharing contract even when arbitration proceedings are pending. 																								The exploration blocks are given on the basis of such contracts and the government has been facing a tough time in settling problems related to these contracts which have been raked up by private firms who have been awarded the oil or gas bearing blocks. 																								Last time when oil blocks were on offer, the defence ministry had raised objections but those were ultimately disregarded except in the case of sensitive areas like the Andamans. 																								Firms that took blocks in the earlier bidding  Reliance, Canadas Niko and Cairn Energy (which bought the field from original bidder Shell)  have struck rich finds. This is expected to enthuse other global majors, which have so far stayed away from the NELP blocks, to chip in for this round. 																								Officials said state-run firms like ONGC would be stepping up exploration expenditure. ONGC is expected to spend up to Rs 3,900 crore on exploration in this fiscal. Gail plans to double exploration spend to Rs 230 crore.

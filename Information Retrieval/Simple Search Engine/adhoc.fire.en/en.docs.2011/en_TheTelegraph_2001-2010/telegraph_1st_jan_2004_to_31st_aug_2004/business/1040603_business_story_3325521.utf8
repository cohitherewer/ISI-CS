 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Mait wants duty cuts to lower PC prices
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, June 2: The Manufacturers Association of Information Technology (Mait) will approach the government seeking a cut in excise for IT peripherals and an increase in depreciation to help reduce PC prices. It will also seek tax benefits on the purchase of a computer. The apex body feels the move will help expand the market by exploiting the potential of the home and SME segments.																								Mait executive director Vinnie Mehta said, A PC is no longer a standalone purchase. Consumers usually buy a solution that includes printers, scanners, UPS and other peripherals. A reduction of excise from 16 per cent to 8 per cent on all IT peripherals will bring down prices.																								The reduction of excise on PCs to 8 per cent in January resulted in an 8 per cent to 12 per cent drop in prices, which was passed on to the consumer. This resulted in a 50-60 per cent growth in sales in January-March 2004 against an average growth of 30 per cent.																								Homes, small and medium enterprises and smaller towns comprise a significant part of the sales in the last quarter, said Mehta. With 80 per cent of the revenue coming from corporate sales, the home and SME segment provides a good opportunity for expansion, he added.																								At present, customs duty for PCs is 10 per cent and excise is 8 per cent. The special additional duty (SAD) has been abolished. Duties for parts and components vary between zero and 5 per cent.																								Mait expects a 40 per cent growth in both PC and peripherals during the current fiscal. The industry crossed the one-million-mark in the first half of 2003-04, mainly due to price drops.																								The apex body for the hardware industry is also in favour of increasing depreciation rates from 60 per cent to 100 per cent.																								Mehta said, With a 100 per cent depreciation, the cost to the company goes up and there is a drop in profit. However, this results in savings on income tax paid, which can be translated into subsidies through price reduction on the equipment.																								The increase in depreciation rates is expected to translate into a 14-15 per cent drop in PC prices.																								With the present price range, the industry is not in a position to offer any more discounts. The only way in which prices can be reduced is through indirect benefits to the industry, he added.																								Mait is also taking an initiative to counter the unorganised grey market by proposing tax benefits for consumers who buy branded PCs.

 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Power sale fetches SEB Rs 327 cr in eight months 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 15: The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has earned Rs 327 crore by selling power in the May-December period of this fiscal.																								The board sells power to Power Trading Corporation and NVVL  an arm of the National Thermal Power Corporation. WBSEB sells 550 MW of power on an average during the off-peak period and 100 MWs during the peak period. It charges Rs 2 per unit for off-peak power and Rs 2.60 per unit for peak power.																								Dipak Ganguly, member (operations), said, We would like to increase the revenue on account of sale of power. This power mainly goes to the northern and western grids.																								The board has garnered Rs 2,985 crore in revenue in the first nine months of 2003-04 against Rs 2,711 crore for the whole of 2002-03.																								We are sure to earn Rs 3,800 crore in revenue in the current fiscal, said Ganguly.																								The board has been able to save Rs 80 crore from the Rs 861 crore-JBIC (Japan Bank of International Co-operation) loan even after delays due to legal wrangles. JBIC had provided this loan to upgrade, augment and set up a transmission system under the West Bengal Transmission System Project.																								The board is setting up 24 transmission lines under this project and work will be completed within January 31. As part of the same project, the board is upgrading, extending and setting up 31 sub-stations. The work for the sub-stations will be completed within June this year.																								For these two projects the board has placed orders worth Rs 465 crore. Apart from this, we have some other expenditure related to the project. Overall, the entire project cost will come to Rs 780 crore, Ganguly said.																								The board has received another Rs 250 crore from Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electricity Corporation for augmenting the second tranche of transmission projects.

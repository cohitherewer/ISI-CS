 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Govt dispels rate-control fears
 OUR BUREAUS				 	 Brokers silhouetted against a giant screen as the interim budget is presented. (Reuters)																								Feb. 3: The government today tried to dispel fears that it was trying to drive interest rates in the banking industry by asking them to provide cheap loans to farmers and small entrepreneurs.																								Interest rates continue to be deregulated and it is our expectation that banks will reduce their lending rates. Some banks have already responded, said banking secretary N. Sisodia.																								In a bid to give a boost to the feel-good factor in Asias third-largest economy and woo the rural population ahead of an expected April-May poll, Singh said the budget was committed to providing cheaper credit to the farm sector, which are 200 basis points less than the current 10.5 per cent market rate.																								Singh also urged banks to assess individual creditworthiness and not routinely insist on additional collateral. 																								Collateral security should be proportionate to the value of the loan, he told Parliament.																								State-run Union Bank of India currently offers 9 per cent interest rates to farmers and small-scale industries on loans up to Rs 50,000 and between Rs 2-5 lakh at 10.75 per cent, down by almost 225 basis points. The budget has allowed farmers to avail credit more than Rs 50,000 at 9 per cent interest.																								There is no limit which has been provided...Interest rate would be fixed taking into account the borrowers profile and the kind of product for which he is applying, Sisodia said.																								The finance minister also announced issuance of credit cards to eligible small-scale entrepreneurs, farmers and the formation of a committee to look into farmers existing bad loan problem, which, otherwise, would have barred them from fresh credit.																								To further encourage the development of small-scale and self-employed ventures, steps have been taken to increase credit limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh under the Laghu Udyami Credit Card Scheme, said Singh.																								The measures, economists and analysts said would now boost the ruling Bhartiya Janata Partys re-election campaign as 70 per cent of the countrys billion plus population lives off farms, which also account for 25 per cent of its GDP. 																								P. K. Chowdhury, managing director of rating firm Icra, said there should be a mechanism for monitoring the end-use of funds and also in its recovery as there is a tendency to treat these grants as subsidies.

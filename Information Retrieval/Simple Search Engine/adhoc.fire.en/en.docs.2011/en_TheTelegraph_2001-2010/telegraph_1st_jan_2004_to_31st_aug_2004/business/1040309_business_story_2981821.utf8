 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Cola majors brace for fresh battle
 RAJA GHOSHAL 				 	 Thirst choice																								New Delhi, March 8: Cola warriors Coke and Pepsi are stumping up fresh cash as they square off for another gruelling battle this summer.																								The two cola giants will be investing $170 million to expand their operations: Pepsi has put in about $100 million in raising production capacity by 40 per cent this year and Coca-Cola, which last year put $100 million to increase its capacity, is keeping the kitty at $70 million this year. 																								Sunil Gupta, vice-president, public affairs and communication of Coca-Cola India, said, We will be investing up to $70 million to increase our production capacities but this will include investment by both Coke and our bottling partners across the country. 																								Both the number of franchisees and co-packers will go up this year, said Gupta. Coca-Cola has 27 company-owned bottling plants, 21 franchisee-owned bottling plants and 25 co-packers, who do only production, unlike franchisees who undertake distribution and sales as well. 																								Sources at Pepsi said while production capacity of the existing plants is being increased, new plants will also be set up.																								Another area where both the cola majors are pulling up their socks is the distribution game at the retailing end.																								By the end of this year we aim to increase our retailing network of 1 million outlets by 24 per cent, said Gupta.																								Pepsi wants to ramp up to 1 million outlets by the year-end.																								But why is production being increased for the cola drinks? Is consumption rising? The companies  which had to fight off a dip in sales after a raucous debate last year over pesticide residue in colas  claim sales have been rising rapidly.																								Per capita consumption of soft drinks from the Coca-Cola Company has gone up from 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent and, in rural areas, it has gone up from 2 per cent to 3.7 per cent, said Gupta. 																								For the entire soft drink market, the consumer base has gone up from 160 million last year to 240 million this year, he added. 																								Market watchers, including senior ex-employees of Coke and Pepsi, say increasing reach and penetration and decreasing price points will boost sales but badly crimp profit margins, especially during summer.

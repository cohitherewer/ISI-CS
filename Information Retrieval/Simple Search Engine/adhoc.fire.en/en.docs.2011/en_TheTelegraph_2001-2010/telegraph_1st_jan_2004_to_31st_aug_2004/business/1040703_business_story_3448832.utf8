																								Beijing, July 2 (PTI): LNM group, owned by NRI steel baron Lakshmi Mittal, will build its first steel production plant in China with an estimated investment of $100 million. It also plans to set up marketing, purchasing and manufacturing centres to tap the booming market, a senior official said.																								LNM will have its first manufacturing base in Yinkou City in Northeast Chinas mineral-rich Liaoning province. We firmly believe China is one of the leading places where we must expand our presence, said Malay Mukherjee, president and chief operating officer of LNM Ispat.																								The Netherlands-based steel giants first foray into the Chinese market is expected to start operations on a trial basis before the end of 2005, Mukherjee told the Chinese media in Shanghai, which is the countrys commercial hub as well as the largest metropolis.																								The first phase of the project will include a galvanised plate facility with an annual production capacity of 400,000 tonnes, while the second phase will see a cold-rolled steel sheet facility with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tonnes.																								The second biggest steel company in the world, LNM produced 38 million tonnes of rolled steel last year and reported $12 billion sales.																								LNMs output is expected to touch 42 million tonnes this year as a result of expansion of its original capacity and acquisition of other steel and iron plants, he said. Last year, the steel major exported close to $2 million worth of rolled steel to China.																								Mukherjee also said the company has targeted a procurement volume in China of some $300 million by 2006. Such a plan is part of the companys efforts to increase its presence largely in China, he added.																								We need support from Chinese suppliers, and we have to ascertain how much they can do in our annual $8-billion purchase volume worldwide, he said.																								For the first six months of this year, LNMs purchase volume in China has already reached $40 million compared with merely $5 million last year, Mukherjee said, while attending the LNM China supplier conference held in Shanghai.																								The company unveiled a large package of targeted purchase items for Chinese suppliers, ranging from refractory material, ferroalloy to coke and steel roll.																								The China-based procurement of coke, for example, is expected to reach some 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes this year, according to Mukherjee.

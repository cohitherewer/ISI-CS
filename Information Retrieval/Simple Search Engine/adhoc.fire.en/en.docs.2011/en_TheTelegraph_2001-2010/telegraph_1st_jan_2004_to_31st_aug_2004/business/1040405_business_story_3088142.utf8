The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Banks home in on small towns for retail lending
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Reaching out 																								Calcutta, April 4: Banks are focusing on smaller cities to tap the potential in the emerging markets of retail finance. Ruthless competition in this sector in the metros is forcing bankers and housing finance companies to spread into these cities. 																								Banking industry analysts broadly define metros as Tier-I areas, state capitals and bustling towns as Tier-II and other semi-urban and rural centres as Tier-III. 																								After flooding the urban markets with housing and auto loans, a number of leading banks and financial institutions are now targeting smaller cities and satellite towns to aggressively push their retail loans.																								A major factor influencing this shift in territorial focus is the ongoing rate war among banks and financial institutions, which has pushed many of these players to lend below their cost of funds.																								Analysts feel that the next retail boom will take place in these smaller towns and cities, as the urban markets may now be saturated. 																								ICICI Home Finance, one of the leading players in the housing finance sector, is looking at expanding its presence in Tier-II cities, according to a senior official. We have been present in these cities in the past one-and-a-half years. The market has been growing in these areas. We are looking to expand into locations where we do not have a presence, he said.																								ICICI Home Finance is also exploring opportunities in the Tier-III areas. 																								A major factor forcing many public sector banks to reposition themselves in the retail-loans market, by enhancing focus in the Tier-II cities, is that most of them have lost considerable market share in the metros to their private sector and foreign counterparts.																								A senior official with United Bank of India (UBI) said, The Tier-II cities and satellite towns offer great potential for the retail loan market as most of these areas are still largely untapped. In fact, a lot of auto and two-wheeler companies are looking at this market segment with a new interest.																								Another advantage in moving to Tier-II cities for business is that customers still have limited options, the bankers said. The customers are not as aware as their counterparts in the big cities, they added. 																								Since there are few players in these areas, customers here dont drive a hard bargain to prune the interest rates, said the UBI official. 																								Meanwhile, new-generation private sector banks are also waking up to the potential this market has to offer and trying to snatch a piece of the pie through their agents.

 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Ficci moots rigid norms for pension managers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 14: India Inc is concerned about the credibility of fund managers who will be responsible for managing the pension fund for central government employees.																								In a letter recently written to the finance ministry and Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority (PFRDA), the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has asked the government to scrutinise fund managers before entrusting them with this huge responsibility.																								It is important that the entry approach therefore looks at the fund managers experience in investment management, both in terms of size of funds handled as well as the number of members (beneficiaries) handled in domestic or overseas markets, says Ficci.																								The chamber has suggested that there should not be a cap on the number of pension providers in the market. This will be against the spirit of free market economy. It should be left to the market forces to determine the size, says the industry body. At present, the regulator has only allowed nine players to enter the market.																								The chamber has also recommended financial incentives in the form of attractive tax savings to attract more investors to this potentially huge market.																								Initially, pension funds have to start with contributions from the Centre employees joining service after January 1, 2003.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Rupee hardens, stocks flounder
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 23: The rupee recovered by a staggering 50 paise against the greenback due to dollar sales by state-run banks at the behest of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while the sensex slumped by 91.86 points to close at a one-month low of 4644.00.																								A huge volatility on the forex market saw the rupee open at 46.26 per dollar, touch an early high of 45.96, before strengthening further 45.76 at the close. 																								It is expected that exporters, who held on to their dollars on the hopes of the rupee losing further ground, would now aggressively sell the greenback as the RBI has now come into the picture.																								Some amount of dollar sales by exporters was seen today pursuant to the sale by nationalised banks, leading to the sharp upward correction from overnight 11-month closing lows of 46.26 per dollar.																								Vivek Royzada, a senior analyst with Mecklai Financial, said while the rupee had lost ground on earlier sessions mainly due to a lack of indirect intervention by the central bank, the forex market has now taken dollar sales by nationalised banks very seriously. This, he added, could see the rupee appreciating and it could open with a big gap at 45.60 in tomorrows trading.																								On the bourses, brokers said many investors continued to stay on the sidelines. 																								With sustained heavy selling in key stocks and a bearish trend till the budget, the BSE 30-share index opened stronger at 4742.80 against yesterdays close of 4735.86 and immediately touched a high of 4752.47.

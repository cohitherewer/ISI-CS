 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Going up																								New Delhi, Jan. 1: Indian exports leapt nearly 14 per cent in November despite an appreciating rupee against the dollar and is on course to meet the 12 per cent full-year target.																								Data released by the commerce and industry ministry today reported exports stood at $4.49 billion in November against $3.95 billion in the same period a year ago. Export growth, however, had expanded by a meagre 5 per cent in October. The country aims to corner a 1 per cent market share of global trade within the next three years from the current 0.67 per cent market share.																								Exports during the April-November period grew 8.1 per cent to $36.502 billion from $33.546 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.																								Exports make up nearly 10 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product (GDP) and is a key demand driver for the industrial sector.																								The Indian economy is set to report a more than 7 per cent full-year GDP growth driven by a bumper farm output and robust inputs from other sectors such as manufacturing.																								In the second quarter (July-September) of this financial year, the economy leapt by 8.4 per cent. Industrial output reported a robust growth of 5.4 per cent during the nine-month period ended October.																								Analysts said the pick-up in exports reflects that the rising rupee has not blunted Indias competitiveness in global trade and augurs well for the industrial sector as 80 per cent of the exports is industrial goods.																								In 2003, the rupee rose more than 5 per cent against the dollar driven by higher foreign investments, robust economic growth and higher corporate earnings.																								However, the trade deficit also widened to $1.91 billion from $1.12 billion in the year ago period, driven by increased imports which has been fuelled by higher demand of goods. 																								The deficit also doubled in April-November period to $11.21 billion from $5.57 billion in the year earlier.

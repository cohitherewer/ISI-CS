The company attributed this loss to the lack of major product launches coupled with higher expenses.

For the full-year 2003-04, DRL posted lower net profit at Rs 283.19 crore compared with Rs 392 crore in the preceding year.

However, generics business was the worst hit with a revenue of Rs 44.38 crore (Rs 132.29 crore) during the quarter.																								The drop in sales from generics did not surprise analysts as the company did not launch any major product in this segment in the past couple of years.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 4: The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) has urged the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow banks to offer gold-backed investment products.																								The chamber has also demanded that banks should be encouraged to offer gold loans to jewellers, thereby enabling India to emerge as the regional gold trading hub.																								Keeping in view the rising demand for the yellow metal among Indian household and liquidity surplus of the banks, the chamber says it will benefit not only the bankers but also common household investors if they are permitted to invest in gold-backed products.																								An Assocham survey suggests that investment in gold is considered the safest route which brings in the highest returns to its investors. There are about half a dozen commercial banks that have been seeking the RBIs approval for investing in gold-backed products.																								The other demands also include asking RBI to permit the banking sector to extend commercial loans, both on short and long-term basis to jewellers who have built credibility.																								Statistics show that domestic buyers purchase roughly Rs 5,000 crore of gold as bars and coins through various discreet routes. In 2002, gold demand in India has been estimated at 570 tonnes, which rose to 588 tonnes by the end of 2002-03.																								The survey also states that interestingly, demand for gold has been more than 60 per cent in the rural sector compared with the urban sector. Another reason for an increase in demand is last years good monsoon.

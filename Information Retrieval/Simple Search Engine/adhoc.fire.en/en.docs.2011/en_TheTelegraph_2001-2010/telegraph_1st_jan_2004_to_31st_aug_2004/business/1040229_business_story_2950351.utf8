Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Feb. 28: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) may pick up a 5 per cent stake in the LNG project of RasGas in Qatar.																								A high-level delegation from RasGas will meet ONGCs top brass in Delhi on March 4 to discuss the issue, sources said.																								ONGCs business development group will visit Qatar in early March before starting the due diligence process, they said.																								The strategic investment in RasGas will be made to ensure unhindered supply of LNG for the Dahej terminal of Petronet LNG (PLL). RasGas, which is the principal supplier of LNG to the Petronet terminal, had offered it a 5 per cent stake in its Qatar unit.																								Based on the share purchase agreement, either Petronet or any of its promoters can take the stake. Accordingly, Petronet has assigned the rights to ONGC, which is now seriously considering the proposal.																								ONGC is serious about a stake in RasGas because it is setting up a gas extraction plant at Dahej near the Petronet terminal. Hence, the LNG supply chain management is very important for the company to carry on the extraction process, a senior ONGC official said.																								ONGC is investing over Rs 900 crore to set up the LNG extraction plant at Dahej.																								Meanwhile, RasGas is keen to pick up a 10 per cent stake in both Petronets existing project as well as in the proposed greenfield 2.5-million-tonne terminal in Kochi.

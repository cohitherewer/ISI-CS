The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Jute ready with wishlist 
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Calcutta, May 24: The jute industry has proposed the formulation of a national policy on jute by the United Progressive Alliance government. It also wants the unfriendly policies by the NDA government to be redressed.																								The Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) has already sent out a wishlist to the Congress and CPI(M) members of Parliament from Bengal today seeking restoration of policies on jute introduced by Rajiv Gandhi under the Bengal Package in 1987.																								Stressing the environment-friendly nature of the fibre, the association has also proposed formulation of laws, regulations, rules and implementation modalities to encourage the maximum use of the biodegradable material.																								IJMA chairman Sanjay Kajaria told The Telegraph that 12 mills have been closed down in recent weeks and about half-a-dozen more might face closure due to absence of an order for gunny bags for the kharif season.																								Orders ranging between seven and eight lakh bales of sacking for kharif crop packaging from the central and state food procurement agencies usually start pouring in from April-end and ensures production till October. Kajaria said there was no indication that orders will come in the next few weeks as the NDA government had drastically diluted the mandatory packaging of food grains in jute sacks introduced by Rajiv Gandhi in May 1987.																								The NDA government had proposed dilution from 100 per cent to 60 per cent in 2004-05. Following an appeal by the association, Calcutta High Court, in an order last week, restrained the government from giving effect to the Union textile ministry notification issued on May 16. The industry has asked the new government to stay away from the move and ensure 100 per cent packaging of food grains in jute sacks. 																								IJMA has also proposed that the UPA government should also ensure that the raw fibre and jute goods continue to be regulated under the Essential Commodities Act so that farmers are ensured of a minimum support price and production is regulated for the benefit of the industry.																								The NDA governments move to squeeze the role of the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), a public sector raw jute procurement agency which also ensures minimum support price to the farmers, by withdrawing compulsory linkage of the fibre supply to the mills against sacking order by government agencies, should also be scuttled to ensure a price and supply balance between farmers and the industry, IJMA said.

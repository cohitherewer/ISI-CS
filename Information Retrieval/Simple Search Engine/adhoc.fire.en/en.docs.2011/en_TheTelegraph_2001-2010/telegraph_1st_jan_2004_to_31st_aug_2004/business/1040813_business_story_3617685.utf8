 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Computers clock 35% sales growth
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 High-Tech boom																								Mumbai, Aug. 12: The domestic PC market, including desktops, notebooks and servers, grew 34.6 per cent in the second quarter of calendar year 2004, according to a study conducted by Gartner Inc, the leading research and advisory firm.																								The country shipped more than 7,60,000 units during the period and garnered a 9.23 per cent market share in the Asia Pacific region.																								Notebooks gained popularity in the reporting period, said the study.																								In the organised sector, Hewlett Packard (H-P) led the team with 14.9 per cent market share, up 9 per over the corresponding period last year. HCLs share increased to 11.9 per cent (8.8 per cent), IBM stood at 7.8 per cent (6.6 per cent), Dell at 3.5 per cent (3.4 per cent) and Acer at 3.3 per cent (2.5 per cent). However, the market share of other players dipped to 58.6 per cent from 69.6 per cent last year. 																								Healthy economic conditions, coupled with increase in business run-rate, resulted in a good second quarter this year. Desktop purchases halted for a brief period in the last two weeks of June due to the general elections followed by the Union budget. But this did not really impact the overall upward trend in purchases, said Vinod Nair, analyst-computing systems, Gartner. 																								Retail consumers, education and small-and-medium businesses (SMB) contributed a large part to the shipments in this quarter, he added. 																								While desktops registered a 32 per cent growth, notebooks grew steadily at 123 per cent. Notebooks constituted 5 per cent of the total shipments. 																								He further pointed out that the narrowing price differential between desktops and notebooks has catalysed notebook purchases, especially in the SMB segment.																								According to the research agency, the next step for vendors would be to provide attractive finance schemes with monthly instalments comparable to those available for consumer-durable goods. This will increase the affordability and further expand the PC buying capacity. 																								Gartner said increased focus on the consumer segment has helped H-P and HCL gain market share. 																								IBM also improved its share with better business from the medium-business segment. Gain in market share for these vendors has come at the cost of the white-box assemblers, the study noted. Shipments to the Asia-Pacific PC market during the quarter increased by 16.5 per cent. China, India and Thailand remained the key engine of growth in the region, with growth rates exceeding 30 per cent.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Haldia Petro maiden issue after elections
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ready to join the IPO bandwagon																								New Delhi, March 5: Haldia Petrochemicals is likely to float its initial public offering (IPO) after the elections. The IPO, which may hit the markets sometime between May and June, will aim to rake in about Rs 400 crore. 																								The company had earlier decided that the IPO should be floated within six months of the approval of the debt-restructuring package on January 22, which will be implemented over the next 15 years.																								The company had already decided that the minimum size of the IPO would be Rs 268 crore. Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group (TCG), one of the principal promoters of Haldia Petro, has also announced his decision to underwrite the issue in case of non-subscription.																								Senior company officials closely associated with the IPO said, Four to five lead merchant bankers are in the fray to handle the issue. The final choice will be made within a month.																								The company is also likely to approach the Reserve Bank of India for lowering of interest rates on foreign loans in a month.																								The board meeting, however, did not see Gail joining the board as many had expected it to. 																								One of the key elements of the debt-restructuring plan was that Gail would infuse money within six months of the approval of the package and take part in the management of the company.																								Gail is expected to bring in Rs 332 crore in two tranches for a 16 per cent stake in the company. While the gas major is expected to infuse Rs 200 crore as soon as it joins the board, the remaining Rs 132 crore will come after three months. 																								The package also envisaged conversion of a rupee term loan (including bonds, DCPS, OCD) of Rs 140 crore, funding of interest for six quarters from July 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003, and reduction in interest on rupee loans to 10.5 per cent among others. 																								The debt restructuring is also expected to bring down debt-equity ratio from 4.2:1 to 2:1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Windfall gain for insurance firms
																								Insurance companies are cock-a-hoop over the Centres decision to halve stamp duty in the recent interim budget.																								At present, the cost of stamp duty on each insurance policy is 40 paise per thousand sum assured. This is expected to come down to 20 paise. The biggest beneficiary of this relaxation will be Life Insurance Corporation, which sold 1.67 crore policies in the 10 months between April last year and January this year.																								LIC managing director R.N. Bhardwaj said, We have not gone through the details. It is difficult to say how much it will benefit us.																								According to preliminary estimates, with LIC underwriting business in excess of Rs 12,000 crore, it seems that the state-owned insurer is set to benefit quite a bit.																								Rathin Lahiri, assistant vice-president of Kotak Old Mutual Life Insurance, said, It is a step in the right direction. However, at present it will not have a large effect on the private players because the size of business they underwrite and thereby the premium earned is relatively small. In future, when insurance companies break even, the impact will be greater.																								R. Krishanmurthy, managing director and CEO of SBI Life Insurance, said, In future, the cut in stamp duty will definitely impact group term insurance schemes. This will reasonably benefit us as this product has a great demand.																								It is a positive step by the government, he said.																								However, industry officials from other private life insurance companies feel that the move to halve the stamp duty, will result in a reduction of less than 1 per cent in premium of all the private life insurers put together. 																								The private life insurers are expected to underwrite business worth Rs 2,000 crore. However, unlike LIC, the impact of the stamp duty cut will be marginal on them until they break even and start making profits.																								Garima Singh

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Low supply may spoil tea auction party
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Stock taking																								Calcutta, Feb. 24: Scarcity of tea at auction centres may force the industry to suspend auctions from the middle of March.																								A final decision is expected on February 25 when the auction committees of Calcutta and Guwahati meet to take stock of the situation.																								Sale 11, which is scheduled for March 15, and Sale 12 on March 22 may get cancelled.																								A similar thing happened some eight years back when the industry decided to hold back auctions due to non-availability of tea, said a senior official of the Calcutta Tea Traders Association (CTTA).																								Rapid sale of tea at the auctions in the last ten months has resulted in the low supply in the opening months of this year.																								According to the new Tea Marketing Control Order, tea cannot be kept at auctions for more than 19 days. Earlier, the auction committees did not place the entire supply at the auctions. This resulted in huge carry-over stocks, industry officials said.																								Following the introduction of this order, an additional 25 million kgs of tea have been sold at the Calcutta auctions in the first 10 months of 2003-04 compared with the corresponding previous period.																								The Calcutta auction centre sold 133.2 million kgs of tea in 2003 against 105.8 million kg in the previous year.																								A CTTA official said fresh arrivals are down to 10,600 packages. There is almost no production in January and February in north India. Fresh arrivals in January were 8 million kgs and 7 lakh kgs in February.																								If the offerings are below 4,000-5,000 packages then the auction cannot be held, industry officials said.																								The drop in supply has resulted in a recovery in tea prices. The average price, which hovered around Rs 62 per kg during this period of 2003, has gone up to Rs 70 per kg this year. 																								However, the industry does not expect a huge jump in price as the end-season tea is low in quality.																								Meanwhile, the Tea Board of India has discarded its proposal that a broker should be present at 25 per cent of auctions.

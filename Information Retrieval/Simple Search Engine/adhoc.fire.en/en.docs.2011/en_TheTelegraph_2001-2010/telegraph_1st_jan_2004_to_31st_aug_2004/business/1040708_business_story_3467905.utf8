 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 7: Inflation  that bugbear which has raised its head again  will be capped at 5 per cent this year, just as the Reserve Bank of India had projected earlier.																								The economic survey says the inflation rate (calculated on the basis of the wholesale price index) has risen to 5.5 per cent for the week ended June 5. Petrol, diesel and LPG prices were raised on June 15. Although the survey doesnt give the figures for the week ended June 19, inflation has remained at the same level after a brief bump up to 5.89 per cent in the earlier week. World crude prices have been rising again after the Iraqi hand over and the survey says rising world crude prices will continue to exert an upward pressure on prices.																								Inflation had risen to 6 per cent in January this year on the back of rising world crude prices though it softened considerably after March.																								The falling inflation rate starting mid-February 2004, induced mainly by the falling prices of primary articles and subdued inflation in the fuel group, has continued in the new financial year, says the economic survey.																								The WPI inflation rate of 4.4 per cent in beginning of March 2004-05 declined to 4.2 per cent in mid-May mainly due to seasonal increase in prices of fruits and vegetables during this part of the year. The survey also states that a comfortable stock position of foodgrains and the Met departments projection of normal monsoon augur well for the country.																								It also says, quot;Conditions at present look more favourable for the primary sector, which had to suffer during 2003-04 from the carry over effect of a bad monsoon, are expected to keep the inflation rate of the primary sector in 2004-05 at a level lower than the average inflation rate of 4.2 per cent during 2003-04.																								The rise in prices of manufactured products goods during the first two months of 2004 was largely due to hike in prices of steel and sugar, it said. The survey said inflation for manufacturing sector, which remained above 5 per cent for part of 2003-04 has shown signs of softening in April.

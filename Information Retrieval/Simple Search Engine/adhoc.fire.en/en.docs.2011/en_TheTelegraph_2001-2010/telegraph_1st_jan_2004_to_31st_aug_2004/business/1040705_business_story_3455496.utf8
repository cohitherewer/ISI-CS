 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Indian Oil in race for Nigerian refinery deals
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Tall order																								New Delhi, July 4: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is in the $20-million race for refinery maintenance contracts in Nigeria.																								Senior IOC officials told The Telegraph that the contracts would also enable IOC to test the Nigerian waters as it has been offered a stake in a new refinery to be set up in the African country.																								The maintenance contracts pertain to two refineries and each deal is worth $ 10 million. If IOC bags the contract, it will have to station its teams in Nigeria and they will oversee the running of the refineries over the period of the maintenance contract, which could be a year or so.																								While IOC has also been offered the opportunity of investing in a refinery project in Nigeria, it is in no hurry to rush into the project due to the political unrest in the country. 																								A senior IOC official said IOC would have to proceed in a guarded manner when it comes to investing in Nigeria. Political stability in a country is of paramount importance when it comes to overseas investment.																								Taking up the refinery maintenance contracts, on the other hand, does not involve any long-term capital investment and is more in the nature of a knowledge-based exchange. It will also enable the company to get a first-hand feel of the country.																								Apart from IOC experts moving from India to Nigeria, some locals will also be hired to help out in the project if the contract comes through.																								IOC with its vast expertise in running refineries has been taking up similar contracts in the middle-east as well. IOC has a technical services agreement with Emirates National Oil Company, Dubai, which has been renewed for the sixth year in a row. 																								It also has a manpower secondment agreement with the company, which has been renewed for the fifth consecutive time.																								Similarly, IOC is implementing an integrated management system for Oman Refinery Company and has also provided catalyst advisory services to Petronas of Malaysia. 																								Nigeria produces high-quality Bonny light crude, to which ONGCs Mumbai High crude is also benchmarked. The price of this crude is higher than the Brent crude of the UK. IOC had entered into term contracts for crude imports with Nigeria and the country was amongst the largest suppliers to India two years ago. 																								However, civil strife in the country had led to the periodic disruption of supplies and, in the last two years, Indian crude imports from Nigeria have dwindled.

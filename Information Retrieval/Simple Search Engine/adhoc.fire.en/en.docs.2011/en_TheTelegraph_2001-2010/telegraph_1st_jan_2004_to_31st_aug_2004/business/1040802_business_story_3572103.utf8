																								New Delhi, Aug. 1 (PTI): Deferring the deadline for completion of Doha round of trade talks, the World Trade Organisation has decided to hold the next ministerial meeting in December 2005 in Hong Kong to seal the final deal.																								The original deadline for the completion of the round, which was launched at the Qatari capital in 2001, was January 1, 2005. The WTO general council will meet in May and July next year to take stock of the negotiations on the framework.																								Hong Kongs secretary for commerce, industry and technology, John Tsang welcomed the decision, saying, Hong Kongs bid to host the meeting, already accepted by the general council in October 2003, underlines our active and constructive participation in the WTO. With the timing of the event now decided, we shall be able to press ahead with our preparatory work in full steam. 																								According to him, the preparations for the ministerial meeting are being overseen by a co-ordination office set up under the trade and industry department. 																								These involve the economic and trade office in Geneva as well as other key departments in the Hong Kong special administrative region government. 																								We shall also work very closely with the WTO membership and the organisations secretariat to stage a conference which is successful in both substantive and logistical terms, Tsang was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency today. 																								The general council of WTO has been meeting in Geneva in the past week to take stock of the ongoing negotiations on the Doha development agenda and to decide on the next steps to take the negotiations forward. 																								The meeting will be a key milestone in these talks, which will be conducive to the broad and balanced development of the multilateral trade regime, Tsang said.

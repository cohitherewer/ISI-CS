 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Crude price bounty for petro firms
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 12: Margins of petrochemical producers will improve aided by a tight demand-supply dynamics and high product prices in the international market, said a CRIS INFAC report on the impact of firm crude prices. Standalone refining companies will benefit due to an increase in gross refining margins, it added.																								On the other hand, integrated players stand to lose unless product prices are raised. The subsidiary of rating agency Crisil also said international oil prices will remain firm at around $32-36 per barrel in the next three to four months. According to CRIS INFAC head-research Najarajan Narsimhan, prices are later expected to decline from these levels resulting in an annual average of $29-30 per barrel.																								In the short-term, high crude prices and resulting high naphtha prices are likely to reduce producer margins. With crude prices averaging $29-30 per barrel, Indian refining firms are likely to earn healthy margins of around $5.5 per barrel in the current year against an average of about $5 per barrel in 2003-04.

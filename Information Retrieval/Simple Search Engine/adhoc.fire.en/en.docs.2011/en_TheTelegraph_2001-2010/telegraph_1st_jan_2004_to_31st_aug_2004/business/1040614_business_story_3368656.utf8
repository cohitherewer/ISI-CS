 Chandralekha Tulal weighs the merits and demerits of electronic-filing of tax returns																								June 30: This is the time of the year when your nerves are on edge. You are scrambling to get all your paperwork ready in order to make that annual tryst with the taxman.																								The easiest thing in the world is to hunt down that tax consultant  you can pick them from a range of operators who work out of poky hole-in-the-wall outfits to plush offices (depending on how much moolah you raked in last year).																								The tax consultants offer package deals to individuals: they do the complete tax planning for the clients, file the returns, get the assessment done and arrange for a quicker refund. They also have the right to face the taxman on behalf of their clients if, on verification, there is a discrepancy in the tax returns. It saves you the hassle  but you end up paying a substantial fee.																								But if you are a braveheart and have a head with figures, you can file your returns in the specified forms without the assistance of the tax consultant. For assessees with income from salary, house property and other sources, one needs to file returns in Form 2E or Naya Saral.																								The filing of returns depends on the assessees place of residence or business based on the jurisdiction of a particular assessing officer under which the taxpayer falls. All the necessary attachments need to be submitted with the return.																								Theres also a possibility that you could miss out on various aspects of tax planning. Moreover, you have to go through the tedious process of filing returns, getting the assessment done and facing the tax authority in the event of scrutiny. 																								To save taxpayers from this entire hassle, provide them with faster processing of returns and ensure quicker refunds, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) introduced electronic furnishing of returns of income under section 139(1) last year. E-filing of returns will allow those who only have salary income and do not have any income under the head profits and gains from business or profession. 																								The eligible person has to approach a designated intermediary with tax challan or Form 16 and proof of savings, who will then file the returns to the income tax department electronically. The IT department had selected six banks to work as designated intermediaries for the purpose. They are UTI Bank, HDFC Bank, IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank, Bharat Overseas Bank and Indian Overseas Bank. 																								A taxpayer must, however, have a permanent account number (PAN) to avail of the facility and has to give consent to any one of these intermediaries to act as an agent for the purpose of furnishing e-returns. 																								At present, the e-filing scheme is restricted to seven cities: the four metros  Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai  as well as Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Hyderabad. 																								But theres a catch: the e-return must be supported by a duly verified paper return of income. Tax consultants say this defeats the purpose behind the whole exercise as it imposes an additional burden on the taxpayer. 																								They say the need to furnish a physical return must be done away with altogether. Moreover, if a taxpayer misses the deadline for filing returns under section 139 (1), and desires to file a belated return, he cannot do so under the e-filing scheme.																								Tax consultants feel that to broaden the scope of the scheme and make it truly assessee-friendly, it should be extended to all categories of taxpayers. Moreover, a facility should be created so that payments towards LIC policies, PPF, NSC or infrastructure bonds for rebate under section 88 or TDS claims could easily be verified through a database of the collecting agency concerned. Once this is achieved, it may be possible to do away with paper returns and enclosures.

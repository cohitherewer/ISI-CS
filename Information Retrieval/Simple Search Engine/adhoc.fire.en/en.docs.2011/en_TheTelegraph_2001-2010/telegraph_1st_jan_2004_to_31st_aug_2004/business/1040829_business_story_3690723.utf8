 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Procter chairman gets $3.5 million bonus
				 	 Lafley: Good going																								New York, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Procter amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers, on Friday said its top executive earned a base salary of $1.7 million this year and received other compensation, including a $3.5 million bonus, based on the companys strong performance. 																								A.G. Lafley, P amp;Gs chairman, president and chief executive, chose to receive his $3.5 million bonus as stock options, the company said in its annual proxy statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Lafley got a $3 million bonus last year. 																								The company said Lafley also earned $9.86 million, or 68 per cent of the total three-year award under a business growth programme, reflecting his leadership, which will be paid in the form of restricted stock units. 																								In a new three-year programme that began on July 1, Lafley could receive up to $11.22 million, which would be paid in restricted stock units, the company said. 																								Lafley also received stock options. 																								Cincinnati-based Procter amp; Gamble said that more than 90 per cent of Lafleys total compensation is at-risk based on the companys performance. 																								Procter amp; Gambles profit rose 25 per cent in its fiscal year ended June 30. Unit volume grew 17 per cent and net sales rose 19 per cent to a record $51.41 billion. 																								Last year, a non-binding shareholder proposal, which asked that the boards directors be elected annually instead of on a staggered basis, was voted in favour by 38 per cent of shares outstanding. 																								This year, in reaction to shareholders requests, the board is submitting a binding action to provide for annual election of all directors if approved by a majority, but recommended voting against it. 																								P amp;G said after studying the issue, the board unanimously concluded a move to an annual election of all directors is not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders. The company also said one shareholder proposal would be presented at its annual meeting in Cincinnati on October 12. 																								People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans to present a resolution asking for implementation of certain rules and regulations at the companys Iams pet food unit. The board recommended shareholders vote against this proposal as well. 																								Five of the companys board members will have their terms expire at the 2004 annual meeting and the board plans to nominate each of them for new terms that would expire at the 2007 meeting, P amp;G said in its proxy statement. 																								Shares of Procter were down 28 cents at $55.98 in at the close of Fridays trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

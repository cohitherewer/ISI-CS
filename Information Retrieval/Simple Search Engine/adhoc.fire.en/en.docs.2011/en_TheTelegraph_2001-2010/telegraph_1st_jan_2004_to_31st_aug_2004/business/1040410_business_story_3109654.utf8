 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 L amp;T cement demerger to be over by June
																								New Delhi, April 9 (PTI): Engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro today said the process of demerging its cement division into a separate company, Ultra Tech Cemco, would be over by the middle of this year.																								The process of cement division demerger is likely to be over by June, said A. M. Naik, L amp;T chairman. The company, however, would continue to have a residual interest and two directors on the demerged entitys board, he added.																								After the final demerger, L amp;T would have a 11.5 per cent stake in Cemco, while Grasim would hold 51 per cent along with management control.																								On the reason behind retaining residual interest in the demerged entity, Naik said the decision was technical in nature.																								The residual interest in Cemco would allow us to bid for the high net worth global construction projects, he said.																								L amp;T decided to hive off its cement division in favour of Kumarmangalam Birla-led Grasim Industries last year.																								Predicting future trend, Naik said the prices of the cement scrips would witness an upward movement in the next three to four years due to sustained focus on development of basic infrastructure facilities.																								This would, in turn, ensure demand for higher consumption of cement, he added.																								The demand and supply of cement would equal in most parts of the country, except the eastern region, which might witness a shortage as no new facility is coming up, Naik said.																								Going by the price movements at the stock exchanges, the cement share price is likely to touch Rs 400 in 2009 for a Rs 10 face value, he added.																								Grasim, which would run Cemco, would be the dominant player in the domestic cement industry with over 30-million-tonne capacity once the demerged plan finally comes into force, Naik said.

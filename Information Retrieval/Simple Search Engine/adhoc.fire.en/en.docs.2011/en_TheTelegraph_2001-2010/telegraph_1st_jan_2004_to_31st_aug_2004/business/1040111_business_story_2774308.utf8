 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 10: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has proposed substantial investments to increase iron ore production to jack up steel output in the next seven years.																								Confirming the move, a senior SAIL executive said a major part of the investment will be used for modernising existing mines, most of which came up in the 1960s and 1970s.																								These mines were developed with technologies prevalent at that time. Hence, they require a massive investment for technology upgradation, he said.																								SAIL has decided to develop new blocks at Chiria mines in Jharkhand and Rowghat mines in Chhattisgarh to produce 10 million tonnes per annum from each.																								This decision has been taken in view of the fast-depleting resources in mines like Rajhara, Dalli, Kiriburu and Meghahatuburu. Unless new mines are developed, there could be a shortage of iron ore in the medium and long terms, the executive said. The company, which is now faring well with the steel industry looking up, is also in the process of developing the south and central blocks of Kiriburu and Meghahatuburu mines as well as the Thakurani deposits.

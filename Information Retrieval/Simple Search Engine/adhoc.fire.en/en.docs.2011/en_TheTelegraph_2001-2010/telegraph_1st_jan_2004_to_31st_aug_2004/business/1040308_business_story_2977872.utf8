 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 RBI calls for transparency in lending rates
																								Mumbai, March 7 (PTI): Reserve Bank of India governor Y. V. Reddy has asked banks to be more transparent on interest rates charged to borrowers. The banks should assess individual credit risks rather than deal with the borrowers on a category-wise basis.																								The RBI would move out of prescription if banks have transparent loan and investment policies, Reddy said at a meeting with chief executives of public sector banks, some private and foreign banks on Saturday.																								Reddy, who shared ideas and discussed concerns of mutual interest, said to bring about transparency, banks should evolve their loans and investment policies with more initiative and on an interactive basis.																								He also asked banks to prioritise customer service and reduce transaction costs as well as procedural inconveniences.

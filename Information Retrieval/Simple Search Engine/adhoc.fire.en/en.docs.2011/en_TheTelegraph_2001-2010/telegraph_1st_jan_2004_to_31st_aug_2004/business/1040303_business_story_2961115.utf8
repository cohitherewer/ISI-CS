 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, March 2: State Bank of India, the largest public sector bank in the country, will set up separate central processing centres to keep track of its assets and liabilities. 																								The centres will help the bank save on transaction costs, said a senior bank official. 																								A pilot central processing centre (CPC) to manage liabilities will be set up in Mumbai by July. 																								The centre will keep track of both individual and corporate accounts and gather relevant data on deposits and advances from different branches. 																								On the liabilities side alone, the bank is expected to save up to Rs 200 crore in transaction costs. Each centre will add to the savings, the official added. 																								Once all the State Bank branches are connected through the core banking solutions programme, they will share information on the number of accounts being created or closed each day and other processing issues with the centres. 																								As a result, branch personnel will be able to concentrate on marketing and customer care, the officials said.																								The banks top brass feels that competition is quite stiff and the bank has to be aggressive to maintain its position. 																								The pilot centre in Mumbai will keep track of all branches in the western region. 																								The centres form part of the phase-II of the banks business process re-engineering project as chalked out by McKinsey. The first phase of the project dealt with conceptualisation and the second phase with implementation, sources said. 																								Plans are also under way to set up similar centres to look after assets, especially retail assets. The centre will help speed up processing of loans. The centre will also look after advances in future. 																								The retail sector has become a major area of lending for the bank. The size of the retail portfolio is increasing everyday. Moreover, with the recent boom in the housing sector, the bank is flooded with loan applications. Therefore, the bank wants to expedite the process of loan disbursal and also keep a close watch on retail advances, the officials added.

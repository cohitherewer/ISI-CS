 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: India Inc is pleased as punch. The fetters on global ambition fell away today with the government permitting companies to invest up to 100 per cent of their net worth in overseas ventures. Earlier, firms could invest only $100 million in overseas ventures  and it was seen as a major hurdle in realising the dreams to create Indias first transnational corporation.																								The decision to remove the $100-million ceiling sparked cheer in the information technology and pharmaceutical industries  the two players which are most keen to set up units abroad.																								It is a very good announcement for software firms since it will help faster mergers and acquisitions. Currently companies like Infosys and Wipro have been acquiring small companies (because of this $100 million cap); now they will be able to acquire bigger companies and soon we will witness a good growth of IT companies, said Nasscom president Kiran Karnik.																								Pharmaceutical companies encored that sentiment. We are always interested in acquisitions. The lifting of restrictions will let us look at acquisitions in a different light. We can now think big and bold, said Swati Piramal, director, Nicholas Piramal India.																								Nandan Nilekani, CEO and managing director of Infosys, was not ready to say just how the measure would benefit Infosys. This will help Indian firms become globally competitive multinational corporations, he said.																								Sameer Kochhar, CEO, Skoch Consultancy Services, said, The economy has been doing well, but if these high growth rates have to be sustained then we have to become global players.																								NIIT chairman Rajendra S. Pawar said This announcement is a positive step to help Indian corporations globalise.																								The announcement will help Indian companies to compete globally, said Arun Kumar, president and managing director, Hughes Software System.																								The lifting of the $100 million cap on overseas investment will help Ranbaxys strategy in the long term, said a company spokesman.																								A spokesperson for Morepen Laboratories said, The move is good for those pharmaceutical companies which are looking for acquisitions abroad. 																								Sharad Goel, spokesperson for Dabur Pharmaceuticals, said it was a confidence-building measure.

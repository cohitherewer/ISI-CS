 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Sales scrap grounds IA plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Hitting an air pocket																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: A sales war between rival aircraft manufacturers and the nations they represent has stalled Indian Airlines (IA) Rs 10,000-crore mega-aircraft purchase plan even as it threatens to jeopardise an opening of Indian skies to foreign and domestic private carriers.																								Various ministries have objected to the civil aviation ministrys proposal to buy 43 Airbus planes for IA and instead asked it to instead buy up to 28 aircraft which would service domestic feeder and trunk routes only. 																								The remaining 15 aircraft, these ministries aver, should be purchased after new technologies which have come into the market are evaluated. However, the civil aviation ministry is adamant that it goes ahead with the entire aircraft purchase plan as IA has been losing out on profits because of its ageing and rusty fleet.																								The contrary views of ministries has led to a public investment board meeting scheduled to clear the buy last week being put off. This happened soon after US-based Boeing, arch-rivals to Airbus, made an a fresh offer to sell its Boeing 7E7, a long-range large capacity aircraft which could be used on global and domestic trunk routes.																								Dinesh A. Keskar, Boeings president-aircraft trading, told The Telegraph: We have offered to cut prices by Rs 700 crore if Indian Airlines considers our offer ... I hope they do look at us. After all, at the current juncture, they are making a buy decision based on tenders filed one and-a-half years back, things have changed since then. 																								The BJP government had earlier taken a tacit decision to split its plans to buy 74 new aircraft for the two state-run airlines  43 for Indian Airlines and 28 for Air-India  and another three luxury jets for the VVIP squadron, between the two rival aircraft manufacturers. 																								The unofficial split decision taken at the highest level was made after the US president George W. Bush and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac led a high-pressure war on behalf of the two aircraft makers. 																								However, Boeing and the US government have since been unhappy as the bulk of the order is going Airbus way and there are still no guarantees that the Air-India order will fall into its lap. 																								The VVIP luxury Boeing jets meant for the President, the Prime Minister and his deputy have been held up as sale of certain security features the Indians have been demanding have to be agreed to by the US government. But the battle over aircraft purchase has also meant a big question mark on planned liberalisation of Indias new open-skies policy. 																								In anticipation of IA and Air-India being able to fly more aircraft to foreign destinations, civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy had also decided to go ahead with partial opening up of Indian skies. The two national carriers had not been able to fly more aircraft on global trunk routes despite huge sales demand, because they were hamstrung by their fleet size, minuscule by international standards.																								Rudy wants to take before cabinet later this week a new civil aviation policy which will liberalise bilaterals with other nations.

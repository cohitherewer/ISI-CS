 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Ficci against pension watchdog
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 15: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has opposed the formation of a pension regulatory authority.																								In a study paper on pension reforms in India that was submitted to finance minister P. Chidambaram, Ficci said, The proposal to appoint a separate authority for the pension system is considered by the committee as impractical. We have studied about 17 jurisdictions and countries and found that 11 of these have their insurance regulator as the pension regulator.																								It has also suggested the creation of multiple central record keeping agencies (CRA). The players (provident fund managers) should choose their CRA directly rather than the same being licensed or registered by the regulatory authority, it says.																								The chamber also suggests that within the three funds as proposed under the system, allocations to different investment options should be left to provident fund managers (PFMs) to decide.																								Voicing concerns of insurance companies, the paper seeks transparency in the entry norms, stating that there should be no auctioning.																								Life insurers are best equipped to develop pension products and therefore, should be allowed to participate fully in fund management and annuities, the chamber said.																								It is believed that participation by life insurers in pensions will result in lower overall system costs because of shared overheads and higher market leverage as a result of larger investment portfolios.																								Ficci has asked the government to create a conducive environment by introducing long-term bonds of 30 or more years to support annuities. Instead of a proposed allocation of sum accumulated at the time of retirement as 60 per cent in lump sum and 40 per cent in annuities, much higher amount should be allocated for annuities, says Ficci.																								Among various proposals made in regard to pension reforms, the scheme envisaged has three pension products, which will be mandated by the proposed regulator.																								Of the two streams of products envisaged (tier I and tier II products), tier II product is akin to a bank deposit to be managed by the PFM.																								The chamber has sought clarity on the tax burden on this scheme. The contribution as well as payouts will be taxed. There is no clarity in regard to payout taxation. It appears that even the capital amount (contribution made by the beneficiary) may be taxed, says the paper.

 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Industry seeks sops for broadband sector
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 15: Telecom and IT operators are projecting broadband as the new technological marvel which the government should promote through liberal tax concessions.																								A report prepared by IBM Business Consulting Services, India, in association with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and departments of telecommunications and IT, highlights the need to have 10 million broadband subscribers by 2010 and 35 million by 2020 in urban homes, enterprises and public kiosks. Broadband is capable of providing interactive voice, data and video services on public networks.																								The industry plans to showcase the $25-billion broadband sector, with a potential to offer employment to 1.9 million people, to the government. The report pegs the total investment required by the broadband industry by 2010 at $5,350 million.																								It seeks a slew of tax concessions and subsidies to help the growth of broadband in the country. The report warns that if India fails to catch up with this new revolution sweeping across Europe and China, there could be a direct impact on the economy.																								It took more than 5-6 years for the mobile talktime tariff to drop from Rs 16.80 a minute to a rupee a minute. IT and telecom industry experts feel that it will take about the same time for broadband to become popular and used in everyday life.																								In a report titled Indias Boradband Economy: Vision 2010, vision, strategies and action, the industry experts have asked the government to drive ubiquitous broadband for every Indian, accelerating economic development and improving the quality of life.																								Broadband is expected to yield a benefit of $90 billion while offering direct employment to 1.9 million people and indirect employment to 59 million in 2010-20.																								The report said to boost the broadband demand, the cost of access should be priced between Rs 450 and Rs 600 for a range of services like entertainment, education, health and community participation.																								A broadband is capable of providing a minimum asymmetric bandwidth of 1.5 megabits per second speed and another version can offer 256 kilobits per second speed, said Arvind Mahajan, partner IBM Global Services India Pvt Ltd.																								The report claims that the cost of broadband access to end-customers can be brought down from over Rs 3,000 at present through fiscal measures. The report has recommended a 10-year income tax waiver similar to that offered to infotech companies. It has also suggested that since hardware is a critical component, it should be exempted from all customs and excise duties, including countervailing duties, special duties and sales tax.																								The report has also sought an exemption of service tax on broadband services for the next 10 years. It has recommended a tax-free status for all investments in broadband centres, according a soft infrastructure status and providing easy financing options for the unemployed youth who wish to set up broadband kiosks.

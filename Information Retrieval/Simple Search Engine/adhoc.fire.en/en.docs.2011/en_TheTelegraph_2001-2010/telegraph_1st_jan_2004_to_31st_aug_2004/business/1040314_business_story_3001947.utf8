 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Big push to single phone licence 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 13: In a bid to bring all telecom services under the ambit of a single licence regime, the telecom regulator today issued a consultation paper seeking views on various issues, including the framework of the unified licence regime, registration charges, entry fee, authorisation charges and service area.																								It is envisaged that a new licensing regime  the unified licensing/authorisation regime  be implemented in which service providers may be able to offer any or all services, using technology of his or her choice with the area of operation so defined as to promote greater participation of all types of big and small entrepreneurs, Trai said.																								The key objectives of the new dispensation is to encourage free growth of new applications and services leveraging on the technological developments in the information and communication technology area. 																								Trai would also look into ways of simplifying the procedure of licensing in the telecom sector, ensuring flexibility and efficient utilisation of resources keeping in mind the technological developments and ensuring a no-worse off situation.																								Trai has also sought comments from stakeholder on issues like annual licence fee, interconnection, spectrum charges, numbering and resale of services by April 30.																								Blurring of boundaries and the ability of operators to offer services using a particular technology that may not be covered in existing service specific licence results in disputes and litigations, the paper said.																								The licencing regime should enhance the scope of applications and services, thereby removing artificial barriers imposed on application of technology and thus avoiding innumerable disputes and time-consuming litigations, the paper said. 																								The consultation paper also seeks the comments of various stakeholders on what should be the registration charges/entry fee/authorisation charges, service area, other licensing terms and conditions, annual licence fee, bank guarantees, roll-out obligations, interconnection, spectrum charges, numbering, sharing of infrastructure and direct interconnectivity across service areas and resale of services.																								The regulator feels there is also a need to exploit the special strengths of small niche operators, especially in rural, remote and less developed areas, besides the larger or integrated operators.

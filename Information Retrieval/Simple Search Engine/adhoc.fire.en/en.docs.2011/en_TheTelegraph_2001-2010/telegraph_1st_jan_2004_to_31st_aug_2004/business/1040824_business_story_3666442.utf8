 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 E-governance put on fast track
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Wired to growth 																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: The parliamentary standing committee on information technology (IT) has asked the government to complete the modalities to set up a Rs 1000-crore e-governance fund soon.																								The committee has also asked the IT department to approach the Planning Commission to seek additional resources to implement the National e-Governance Action Plan (Negap)  an important component of the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government.																								The standing committee report states, The committee is concerned to note that the Planning Commission has approved only Rs 215 crore (for e-governance projects). As a result, the IT department would not be able to extend the network infrastructure up to the block level in the first 18 months as planned and will have to take it up in a phased manner.																								The IT department had planned to strengthen the core infrastructure, including establishing a state-wide area network to cover the blocks and national/state-level data centres, promoting a common service delivery centre and replicating e-governance applications on a pilot scale. 																								The department had proposed an outlay of Rs 630 crore for 2004-05 but got only Rs 230 crore.																								The committee has also suggested that e-readiness by the states, departments and Union Territories should be undertaken annually to get them into the e-governance mindset.																								The parliamentary committee has also raised its concern over the non-implementation of the Planning Commissions advisory to the central ministries and departments to earmark 2-3 per cent of their plan budget for programmes/schemes relating to IT.																								It has recommended that the IT department should closely monitor those ministries, departments and states that do not follow its advices. The department is an implementing agency and a programme manager for co-ordinating different ministries.																								The committee has rebuked those who have not yet implemented the Planning Commission recommendation.																								In case the ministries, departments and states do not allocate 2-3 per cent and do not adhere to the suggestions of the programme manager in providing necessary infrastructure, the information technology department has less to lose compared with the stakeholder but the greatest loss will be to the nation, the report said.

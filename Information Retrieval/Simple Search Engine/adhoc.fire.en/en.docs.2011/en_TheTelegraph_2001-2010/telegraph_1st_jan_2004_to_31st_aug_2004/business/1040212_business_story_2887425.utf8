 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Ranbaxy pill for diabetes in US
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd announced today the launch of Riomet (Metformin HCl oral solution) 500 mg/ml, in the US, the first and only liquid form of Metformin to treat type 2 diabetes.																								Ranbaxy is increasingly counting the US market as a key driver for the growth of the company. However, the company did not disclose the market size of the product being launched. 																								In the United States, type 2 diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and Metformin is the number one prescribed oral treatment.																								Ranbaxy claims that as a liquid form of Metformin, Riomet may significantly improve the lives of people with diabetes who are unable to swallow tablets  a condition known as dysphagia. 																								Dysphagia is a relatively unknown but widespread problem, affecting one in 17 people in some form. 																								Jeffrey Thomas, vice-president, brand marketing and sales at Ranbaxy USA Inc and affiliate of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc (RPI), said, Non-compliance with treatment is a major problem among people with type 2 diabetes; only one-third control their blood sugar. With the liquid form, we have a big opportunity since a large number of people have difficulty in swallowing the pill. 																								Diabetes is a major health concern in the United States, where 6.3 per cent of the population has the disease. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.																								RPI based in Jacksonville, Florida, USA, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ranbaxy, Indias largest pharmaceutical company. It is engaged in the sale and distribution of generic and branded prescription products in the US healthcare system.

 															- How day three unfolded in the priyamvada bequest brouhaha SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, July 14: The high-stakes battle for a major slice of the Birla empire could explode into the next phase if Rajendra S.

The investment company holds substantial chunks in many Birla companies, including Aditya Birla groups Grasim Industries, Hindalco and Indian Rayon.																								If Lodha does throw down the gauntlet, it could take the battle to a new plane. The family has already declared that Priyamvadas will shall be contested. Lawyers say that the vacant position may not be immediately filled due to the legal niceties involved.

Birlas Kesoram Industries, Pilani holds 24.15 lakh shares, each priced at Rs 68.30.																								In Century Textiles, a company that has B. K. Birla at the helm with S. K. Birla and C. K. Birla as the other two pillars, Pilani controls 3.38 crore shares. These are worth Rs 392.41 crore, based on the price of Rs 116.10 apiece.																								Pilani also has stakes in Hindustan Times and Industry House  the Mumbai headquarters of the Birla empire. It also owns large chunks of several Thai and Indonesian companies that are now under the Aditya Birla group.																								In Mysore Cements, Pilani holds 26.61 lakh shares. The company is in the midst of a financial restructuring and the shares are quoted at Rs 7.80 apiece. 																								Pilani also owns much of Sutlej, Saurashtra Chemicals, Tanfac Industries, Cimmco Birla and Bihar Caustic. 																								The Birlas control 83.49 per cent of Pilanis equity.

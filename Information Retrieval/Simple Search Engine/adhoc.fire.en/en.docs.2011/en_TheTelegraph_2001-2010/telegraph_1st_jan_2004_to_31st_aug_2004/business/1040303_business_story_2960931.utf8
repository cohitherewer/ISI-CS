 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Ford Fiesta to boost Japan sales
 Japan connection 																								March 2 (Agencies): Ford Motor, the worlds second-largest auto maker, said it will begin selling the Fiesta compact cars in Japan in May, part of its push to increase 2004 sales by 47 per cent.																								Ford Japan Ltd plans to raise sales to 8,500 cars this year from 5,800 vehicles sold in 2003. About one-third of Fords 2004 sales, or 3,000 units, will be made up by Fiestas, Ford Japans president Katsuhiko Satoh said in Tokyo.																								Ford, which owns a third of Japans fifth-biggest car maker Mazda Motor Corp, is building its own sales network to establish its brand in Japan, the worlds second-largest auto market. 																								Tokyo-based Ford Japan, which has 45 dealerships operating 102 outlets in Japan, last year stopped selling Mazda vehicles at its dealerships.																								The Ford Fiesta, which shares a fifth of parts with Mazda Motor Corps Demio compact cars, will be the sixth model sold by the Japanese unit of Ford. It competes with Volkswagen AGs Polo and PSA Peugeot Citroens 206 cars.																								Ford will import the Fiesta from its factory in Valencia, Spain, where it also makes KA and Mazdas Mazda2 compact cars. Ford imports Mondeo sedans and Focus compact cars made in Europe for sale in Japan. It also sells US-made explorer and escape sport-utility vehicles, as well as Mustang sports cars.Peugeot sales fall																								French car maker Peugeot, a unit of PSA Peugeot Citroen, has seen sales fall globally so far this year but confirmed on Tuesday it expected 2-3 per cent growth in 2004 as it launches cars and as markets recover. 																								Peugeots head Frederic Saint-Geours had said at the Geneva auto show that Peugeots global sales volume had fallen in January and February but expected its share of its key western European market to be roughly stable compared with last year.																								Our February market share will be roughly the same as last year, perhaps a little bit better, he said. So far this year our global volumes are lower...but we expect 2-3 per cent growth for the year.Kia Motors plan																								Kia Motors Corp, an affiliate of South Koreas biggest carmaker Hyundai Motor Co, will build its first European assembly plant in Slovakia, as it expands to make vehicles closer to its second-biggest export market, said company officials. Kia, which makes Optima passenger sedans and Sorento sport-utility vehicles, is planning its biggest overseas investment, as part of the push with Hyundai to raise global production to as many as 5 million vehicles a year by 2010 and become one of the worlds five biggest auto makers.																								Kia, which exports half of the cars it makes, has an assembly venture in China. Hyundai Motor, which makes cars in India, China and Turkey, will start operating its first US plant this month. 																								Slovakia and Poland both offered incentives, including tax breaks, to attract investment from Kia. In addition to providing such incentives as subsidies to create new jobs or purchase equipment, the Slovak government also pledged to complete a 30-kilometer (19-mile) highway link to Zilina, the site offered to the car maker.

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Tea parlours for cola addicts
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Heady brew 																								Calcutta, April 19: The Tea Board will set up tea parlours/boutiques across the country to lure the cola-drinking population back to a cup of tea. 																								The parlours will be set up on a franchisee basis and the board will provide some financial assistance, a senior Tea Board official said.																								The Board also plans to set up tea parlours abroad, beginning with Moscow.																								The board has invited proposals from people keen to set up these parlours. A screening committee will be formed by the end of this month, which will decide on how the parlours would function, the official added.																								The board and the tea industry want young people to take to tea. The domestic consumption patterns do not show any substantial growth.																								The Indian Tea Associations status paper-2003 says the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, had projected a 3.1 per cent growth in domestic consumption but in reality there has been only 1.8 per cent growth.																								According to the ITA, the domestic consumption of tea in 2003 was 697 million kgs against an earlier projection (based on IIM-C data) of 714 million kgs. In 2002, domestic consumption was 685 million kgs. In 2003, the domestic consumption went up by only 12 million kgs.																								Going by the disposal pattern of Indian tea, the impact of a shortage of 43 million kgs during 2002 should have been easily realised in 2003. But in reality this did not happen, a senior tea industry official said.																								The franchisee for the parlour in Moscow has already been decided, the Board official said. The franchisee already owns five restaurants. So we thought he was the right partner for us, the official added.																								The Tea Board has a tea centre in Mumbai known as the Bombay Tea Centre. The Bombay Tea Centre is running successfully, the board official said. It has also set up a tea centre in South India.																								Meanwhile, Indias tea exports in January increased 34.91 per cent to 13.95 million kgs. Tea exports during the corresponding month of 2003 stood at 10.34 million kgs, Board officials said. 																								The export figure in January was a shot in the arm for the beleaguered industry. Tea exports between January and December 2003 were down to 173.10 million kgs compared with 201 million kgs in 2002.

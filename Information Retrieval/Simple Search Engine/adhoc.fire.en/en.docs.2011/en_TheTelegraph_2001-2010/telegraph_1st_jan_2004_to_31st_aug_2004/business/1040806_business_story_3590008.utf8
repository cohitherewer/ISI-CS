 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Pension fund capital norms to stay
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: The government is unlikely to lower the statutory capital requirement for pension funds from Rs 100 crore, which is on a par with the level set for insurance companies.																								There has been pressure on the government to relax the condition, but it has refused to relent so far.																								Sources said the minimum capital requirement would be fixed at Rs 100 crore though the would-be pension fund regulator will have the final authority to decide on the issue.																								Ideally, the minimum capital requirement for pension funds should be higher than insurance firms as the subscription base would be wider, he said. The regulator would also decide on the number of pension fund firms that would operate and the permissible foreign direct investment, he added.																								Officials also said the draft of the proposed regulatory body, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), has been finalised and would be introduced in the winter session of Parliament after approval from the cabinet and the Union law ministry.																								The governments approval for a separate regulatory body rests-to-doubt speculation that the insurance regulatory body, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, would be armed with additional measures to oversee this sector.																								The proposed bill would also seek 49 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) for pension funds, while licences for the operation of six funds would be granted through a competitive global bidding process.																								Earlier this year, US pension fund Calpers decided to invest in Indian equities, citing an expanding economy, higher marker efficiency and better corporate governance practices.																								Calpers, which manages about $53 billion of assets in Asia, has a reputation of an influential market watchdog and advocate for corporate reforms. Its moves are widely watched and imitated by other institutional investors.																								Analysts said Calpers decision would attract established offshore pension fund managers, which would make the market competitive and offer customers better products and services.																								Officials said the government has decided to reserve one pension fund for state-run fund managers. Unit Trust of India Mutual Fund and Life Insurance Corporation are in the fray.

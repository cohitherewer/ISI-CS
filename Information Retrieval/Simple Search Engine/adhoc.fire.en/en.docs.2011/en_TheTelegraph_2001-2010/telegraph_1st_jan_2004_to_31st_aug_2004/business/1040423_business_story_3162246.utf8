 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Annual core sector growth at 5.4%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 22: The growth rate in the infrastructure sector dropped to 5.4 per cent in the fiscal ended March 31, 2004 from 5.6 per cent recorded in 2002-03.																								According to official statistics released today, there was a slowdown in the rate of growth of the countrys crude to a meagre 1 per cent in the fiscal from 3.2 per cent in the previous year.																								The rate of growth of finished steel production fell to 6.9 per cent from 9.1 per cent clocked earlier. Similarly, the growth rate of the countrys cement output also fell to 6.1 per cent from 8.8 per cent recorded earlier. 																								The collective weight of these three industries pulled down the overall growth figure to below the previous years level, despite government claims that the economy had taken off on the high-growth path.																								On the positive side, the electricity sector, which had logged a dismal growth rate of 3.2 per cent in 2002-03, performed better in 2003-04 with a growth rate of 5.2 per cent.																								The downstream petroleum refinery sector was another good performer recording an 8.2 per cent growth rate, up from 4.2 per cent in the previous year. 																								The growth rate of the six infrastructure industries in 2003-04 was much lower than the preceding year in the first seven months of the fiscal (April-October). However, the growth rate picked up some momentum in November last year and touched 7.1 per cent in March compared with 4 per cent in the same month of the previous year.

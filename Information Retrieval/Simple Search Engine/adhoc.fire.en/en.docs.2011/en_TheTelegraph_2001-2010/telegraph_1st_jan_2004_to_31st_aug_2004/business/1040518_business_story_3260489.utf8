 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Pressure mounts to hold petro priceline
 OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES				 	 Holding on																								New Delhi, May 17: Political pressure has already starting building up against any proposed increase in the price of petroleum products, especially kerosene and diesel widely regarded as the fuels of the masses.																								While the NDA government had put petro goods prices on hold due to the Lok Sabha polls, the national oil companies are expecting the green signal to go in for a modest hike after the elections.																								However, with the strong showing of the Left parties and their staunch opposition to an increase in prices, the national oil companies will be expected to bear a greater burden of the soaring cost of crude in the international market.																								The public sector oil companies have seen their profits soaring in the last two years based on high refinery margins and the government can leverage this strength to cushion the consumers. 																								Petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi had already ruled out any sharp increase in the price of petroleum products even while the election process was on. He had clearly stated that the fear of any substantial increase in the prices of petroleum products is false. 																								He had also stated that the new government would take a decision on the issue while the oil companies are reviewing the spurt in crude prices to take appropriate action.																								According the official policy, oil companies are free to revise the prices of petrol and diesel every fortnight to bring them in tune with import parity prices. However, it is an open secret that the government still exercises control over the prices of these politically sensitive commodities. Crude at new high																								International crude prices struck a new high on Monday on simmering concern that rapid fuel demand growth will outpace global supplies at a time when traders fear a sabotage attack on the West Asia oil infrastructure.																								US light crude reached $41.85 a barrel, the highest price since the New York Mercantile Exchange launched the crude contract in 1983. Later it eased to $41.28, down 10 cents on the day. Londons Brent crude eased 12 cents to $37.74 a barrel.																								The short-term is dominated by low gasoline stocks in the United States and Europe and deterioration of the situation in West Asia. Neither is likely to change much in the months to come, said Societe Generale economist Frederic Lasserre.																								Low US gasoline inventories ahead of peak demand in the summer months, a surge in global consumption driven by healthy economic growth and worries that instability in West Asia may disrupt supplies have attracted investment hedge funds to oil in droves. Crude prices are up $9 a barrel, or 28 per cent, since the end of last year. The US has led consumer countries calls on the Opec producer cartel to release more supply as fears gather of inflation and a slowdown in growth.																								Opec, which controls half of world crude exports, will convene informally later this week on the sidelines of an Amsterdam conference and again in Beirut on June 3 for a full ministerial meeting.

 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 US gears up to fight export-ban blizzard
 DOUG PALMER AND RICHARD WADDINGTON				 	 The referee																								Washington/Geneva, Jan. 15 (Reuters): The United States said on Thursday it would fight efforts by India and other trading partners, including European Union, to slap sanctions on American exports potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars.																								The new move to seek sanctions by the EU, Canada, Japan, India, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and South Korea was aimed at a controversial US trade law  known as the Byrd Amendment  which the World Trade Organisation declared illegal one year ago.																								The United States missed a December 27 deadline to repeal the law or face possible retaliation. US trade officials said they would continue urging Congress to take the measure off the books, while fighting the sanctions threat at the WTO.																								The spat is the latest in a series of disputes involving the government of US President George W. Bush, an avowed free trader who critics accuse of being reluctant to bow to WTO rules when they go against the United States.																								In the case of the Byrd Amendment, Bush proposed repealing the provision last year, saying revenues it generated could be put to better use. But he ran into strong opposition from both Republican and Democrats in Congress, who said the WTO overstepped its authority in striking down the measure.																								The provision was signed into law by former President Bill Clinton as part of a 2000 budget year spending bill. It changed how funds raised by anti-dumping duties on allegedly unfair imports are distributed.																								Previously those duties went into the general US treasury. But since 2001, the funds have been distributed to companies that brought anti-dumping cases.																								Over the past three years, the United States has paid $710 million to US ball bearing, steel, candle, pasta, seafood and other companies under the measure, named for Senator Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who helped it become law.																								In future years, American lumber companies could receive billions of dollars annually under the program if disputed US anti-dumping duties on Canadian wood are included. Byrd Amendment																								The Byrd Amendment has raised widespread concerns ... as evidenced by the large number of complainants in this case, European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said in a statement announcing the EUs plan to seek retaliation.																								I hope the US will now take action to remove this measure, thus avoiding the risk of sanctions, he added.

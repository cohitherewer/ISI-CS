 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Number game																								New Delhi, March 5: The gross subscriber base of the fixed and mobile services together grew by 8.90 per cent to touch 70.53 million at the end of the quarter ended December, 2003 from 64.77 million as on September, 2003.																								The annual growth (December 2002 to December 2003) for the total telecom subscriber base was 39 per cent.																								The subscribers of fixed service (fixed-line and wireless-in-local-loop fixed) increased from 41.38 million to 42.09 million and that for mobile services (cellular and WiLL-mobile) grew from 23.03 million to 28.44 million during the above quarter.																								The period also indicates the emergence of new mobile operators consolidating their positions like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd added 4.93 million subscribers while private operator Reliance added 6.24 million subscribers.																								According to the performance indicators released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) about various telecom services for the quarter October-December 2003, the share of public sector unit operators versus private operators for mobile services stood at a ratio of 19:81.																								Trai first published the performance indicators of telecom services in July 2003 highlighting the trends for the financial year 2002-03, followed by two reports pertaining to two quarters of fiscal 2003-04. 																								While the fixed-line phones showed a negligible growth, mobile subscribers  WiLL (M) and cellular  combined showed a growth of 23.49 per cent during the quarter. There was 164 per cent annual growth (December 2002 to December 2003) for this segment.																								Another noteworthy trend is the number of mobile users having already exceeded the fixed subscribers in the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Vadodara and Shimla. If this trend continues during the current year, the country will have more mobile subscribers than the fixed subscribers during 2004.																								Tariff for mobile services have gone down by 14.74 per cent during the quarter. The effective per minute airtime charge considering an average usage of 400 minutes a month have declined from 67 paise per minute to 57 paise per minute.																								In the case of mobile services, the average rate per user (ARPU) declined by 11.43 per cent from Rs 516 to Rs 457, while there was marginal growth in average minutes of use from 298 to 301 during the quarter. 																								However, Trai says that the average minutes of use have increased by 35 per cent during March 2003. This trend appears to emerge due to a steep decrease in tariff for mobile services.																								The number of PCOs also showed a growth of 8 per cent in the country at 17.90 lakh during the quarter. The subscribers base for internet has shown an increase of around 4 per cent during the quarter, number of subscribers having increased from 3.98 million to 4.14 million as on December 2003.

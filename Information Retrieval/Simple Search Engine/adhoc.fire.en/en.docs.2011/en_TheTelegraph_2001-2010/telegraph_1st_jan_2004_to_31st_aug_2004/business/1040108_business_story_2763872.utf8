 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 RBI sees growth at 7%, promises price checks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Y. V. Reddy in Delhi on Wednesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Reserve Bank of India today raised its forecast for economic growth to 7 per cent for this fiscal ending March 31 but stuck to its inflation outlook of 4-4.5 per cent that it made in its credit policy in november.																								The RBI aligned its growth forecast with the governments predictions, up from its earlier forecast of 6 to 6.5 per cent and a week after government data showed the economy has clocked a scorching 8.4 per cent growth in the second quarter.																								Inflation will be in the range of 4 to 4.5 per cent although the downward bias  as was indicated in the mid-term review of monetary policy  may not be attainable, said Reserve Bank governor Y. V. Reddy.																								Assuming that there are no unexpected adverse developments, there is merit in maintaining the status quo as far as the monetary and credit policy measures are concerned, while pursuing with the reform process, Reddy told business leaders.																								The inflation outlook remains benign although careful monitoring and management would have to continue with a view to cushion supply shocks and remove supply bottlenecks for individual commodities so that price volatilities are evened out, he said.																								He added: The improved prospectus for real activity globally should add strength to the upward momentum in growth...on balance, therefore, there is room at this juncture for greater optimism in growth prospects than before.																								The government expects the economy to grow at 7 per cent this fiscal and some analysts have forecast growth to be higher. 																								Analysts said the GDP growth is likely to be higher than the RBIs stated range given the performance of the farm sector in the July-September quarter.																								Helped by the best monsoon in a decade, the farm sector expanded by 7.4 per cent in the year through the July-September quarter and was the key driver of overall growth. The sector accounts for around 25 per cent of GDP and about 70 per cent of the billion-plus population lives off the land. 																								The second-quarter estimates show that buoyancy has been spread across most sectors of the economy and is not confined merely to agriculture which still accounts for most of the rebound, said Reddy.																								Further comfort can be drawn from the fact that the economy has demonstrated considerable resilience to exogenous shocks in recent years, he added. Drawn by Indias growth prospects, foreign funds invested a record $6.7 billion in stocks in 2003, making the sensex Asias second-best performer.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 All weapons out to fight flare-up
				 	 Chidambaram in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug. 11 (PTI): Finance minister P. Chidambaram said there would be no panic or knee-jerk reactions in the battle against inflation. 																								The government would look at various fiscal options while the Reserve Bank would explore all monetary tools to control the price rise, which, he said, would settle down by September.																								We must be vigilant and confident to tackle it, allow seasonal factors to play out. Fiscal and monetary steps will be taken in a measured manner. There will be no panic or knee-jerk reaction. We have told the Reserve Bank to take necessary monetary steps and we will look at options on the fiscal side, he said.																								However, he declined to spell out the nature of steps the government contemplates.																								Attributing the totally unexpected and unanticipated spurt in international oil prices, Chidambaram said this was beyond the control of the government and had fuelled the inflation to 7.51 per cent. Inflation is a matter of concern, always. Even when it is at 4 per cent, attempts would be made to bring it down to 3 or 2 per cent.																								Chidambaram said the average oil price was $22 per barrel this time last year, while it is $39 now.																								Added to this are inflationary trends on account of monsoon failure and the soaring global commodities prices, like steel and cement.																								Contending that 7.5 to 8 per cent inflation rate was not uncommon, Chidambaram said it had ranged around that level in 2001-02 and between 6 and 7 per cent in January-February this year. The average may be a little higher than last year.																								Talking of the financial sector, Chidambaram said the government was not averse to mega merger of banks and financial institutions like IDBI and IFCI 7 if they meet all norms of the Reserve Bank.																								Consolidation is the name of the game. If two banks satisfy the RBI norms, why should we be averse to mergers, he said when asked whether the government was open to mega mergers like IFCI and IIBI with IDBI.  Govt allays raid fear																								Dismissing fears of a raid-Raj, Chidambaram today said taxmen would go all out after evaders for recovering tax arrears, amounting to Rs 87,000 crore, and ruled out any amnesty scheme to tap black money.																								There is no raid-Raj. There will only be recovery of arrears, which is undisputed and which is due to the government, he said.

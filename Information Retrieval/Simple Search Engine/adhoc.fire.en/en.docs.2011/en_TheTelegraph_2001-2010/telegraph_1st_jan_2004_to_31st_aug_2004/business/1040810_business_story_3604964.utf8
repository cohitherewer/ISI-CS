 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Zurich fund adviser sets up shop 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 9: Capvent AG, a Zurich-based private equity fund investment adviser, has set up an office in India, in line with its plans to establish operations in Asia.																								The groups activities will not only include investing in India-focused funds and creating private equity groups, but also co-investing with local and international firms. Capvent AG has over $425 million under advisory through two programmes.																								The firm hopes to cash in on the fundamental changes in the country, which will lead to a rapid growth and an increased need for private equity, Capvent said.																								Though Capvent did not specifically state the sectors it would invest in, it said the co-investment strategy would leverage its investment activities and relationships with both local and international funds.																								Capvent managing partner Varun Sood said, We have studied the market well and have the added advantage of having Indians among our senior staff. With expect corporate earnings to increase over 20 per cent each year, stable GDP growth, low leverage in all the economic sectors and good exit prospects in the long-term. We think that the stage is set for sustainable growth in private equity.																								Tom F. Clausen, also a managing partner of Capvent, said while the sector is relatively small compared with the US and Europe, the number of exits achieved in the market has demonstrated that private equity is a viable and increasingly well accepted source of finance in India.																								While Capvent will have a 10-member office in the country, the group said it would continue to follow a proactive approach by investing in areas where it sees an attractive potential for premium returns. Kotak Mahindra 																								Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund expects to garner Rs 75 crore through the initial public offering of its open-ended equity growth scheme Kotak Oportunities.																								The IPO, which opened on July 27 and closes on August 25, is also expected to get around 5,000 to 7,000 retail applications, Kotak Mahindra MF chief executive Ajay Bagga told newspersons here today.																								The scheme gives the fund manager a flexibility to capture the opportunities in the market, he added.																								Kotak Mahindra MF head of equity funds Rushabh Sheth said the scheme would invest across sectors, based on performance and potential of companies within the sectors.

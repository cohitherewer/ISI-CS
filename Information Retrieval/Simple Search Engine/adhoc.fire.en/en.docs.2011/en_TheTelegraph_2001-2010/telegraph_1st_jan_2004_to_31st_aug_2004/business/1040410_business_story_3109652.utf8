																								New Delhi, April 9 (PTI): Costlier foods, electricity and manufactured products pushed up the rate of inflation to 4.47 per cent for the week ended March 27.

The wholesale price index (WPI) rose by 0.3 per cent to 180 points with all the major indices of fuels, primary and manufactured products moving up. The index was 172.3 points in the year-ago period.																								The rate of inflation actually stood as high as 5.91 per cent in the week ended January 31 instead of 5.80 per cent, which was only a provisional estimate.																								The final WPI stood corrected at 179.1 points in the last week of January compared with the provisional figure of 178.9 points.																								The primary articles group index rose sharply by 0.5 per cent to 181.2 points with prices of food products going up substantially and that of non-food items marginally. It was 178.2 points in the previous year period.																								The food articles group index shot up by 0.7 per cent to 179.3 points due to costlier fish-marine (13 per cent), bajra (3 per cent), fruits and vegetables (2 per cent) and wheat (1 per cent).																								But prices declined for masur (6 per cent), poultry chicken (5 per cent), tea (3 per cent), eggs and barley (2 per cent each) and gram, condiments and spices, ragi and maize (1 per cent each).																								The index of non-food articles group was up by 0.1 per cent to 190.9 points due to higher prices for raw rubber (5 per cent), raw wool (4 per cent), soyabean (3 per cent), castor seed and raw tobacco (2 per cent each) and raw silk and sunflower (1 per cent each). Prices, however, fell for rape and mustard seed and linseed (2 per cent each) and cotton seed and gingelly seed (1 per cent each).

 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Export zones to go places soon
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 8: The government will soon come out with a policy for special economic zones (SEZs) which have been planned as enclaves for foreign investment.																								The SEZs have been around for a long time but have never taken off because of the dithering over a different set of laws that would have to govern them including a hire-and-fire policy for labour.																								Five SEZs have started functioning. SEZs require a special fiscal and regulatory regime.....and it is my belief that the passing of such a law would be a significant milestone in our quest to become a major hub for manufacturing and exports, quot; finance minister P. Chidambaram said.																								The government will also come out with a new foreign trade policy later this year.																								The budget has scaled down the customs duty on platinum imports from Rs 550 per 10 gram to Rs 200 per 10 gram apart and exempted rough coloured precious gemstones from customs duty as an incentive for gems and jewellery exporters.																								With this step platinum has been brought at par with gold and precious gemstones will be treated on an equal footing with semiprecious gemstones.

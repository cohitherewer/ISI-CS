 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 ONGC selloff in smaller share lots
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: In an effort to target the small investors, the government will offer shares in lots of 10 when it divests its 10 per cent equity stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the state-owned oil exploration firm.																								The inter-ministerial group (IMG) on ONGC divestment, which met on Wednesday, decided to offer the shares in multiples of 10 instead of the normal practice of offering in lots of 100 shares and multiples thereof, sources said.																								Instead of splitting ONGC shares into smaller denominations, the IMG decided to reduce the lot of shares on offer from 100 to 10. The idea is that a smaller lot will enable small and retail investors to participate in the public offer.																								The public issue of 14.2 crore shares of ONGC will hit the market on March 2 and open for bidding under the book-building route for seven working days. A draft prospectus for the public issue will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) before the month-end. Road shows for the issue will be held at London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai and a couple of places in the US in the last week of February. Simultaneous campaigns will also be organised in India.																								The public issue of the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) has also been speeded up. Instead of the March target set for divestment of shares in ONGC, an inter-ministerial group today favoured hitting the market with a public offer of 10 per cent equity by February 23.																								The high-powered group decided today that the public offer of shares is to remain open for five days up to February 27. The group comprising officials of law, finance, petroleum and divestment ministries, also chalked out a January 23 deadline for filing of prospectus with the capital markets regulator. The group has also favoured appointment of a second registrar to manage the issue, a move expected to hasten the process.																								The cabinet committee on disinvestment (CCD) had decided to offload 10 per cent equity each in the two oil PSUs within the fiscal in a move aimed at raising resources after the setback to government following a Supreme Court verdict halting privatisation of HPCL and BPCL.																								Meanwhile, Indian Oil , has paid an interim dividend of 50 per cent amounting to Rs 584 crore for the current fiscal.

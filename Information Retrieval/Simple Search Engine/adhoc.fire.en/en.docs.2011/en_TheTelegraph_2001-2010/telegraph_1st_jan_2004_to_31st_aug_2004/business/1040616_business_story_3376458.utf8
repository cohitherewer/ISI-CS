 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Bengal eyes 9% share in exports
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, June 15: Bengal plans to increase its share in all Indian exports to 9 per cent in 2006-07 from the current 6.09 per cent.																								During the AprilSeptember period in 2003, exports through ports located in the state stood at Rs 7,761.35 crore compared with the all-India figure of Rs 1,27,545.11 crore. Our share in the total volume of exports was 6.09 per cent during the period. We are targeting a 9 per cent export growth. Naturally, the rate of growth should be faster than the current rate, Sen said.																								Keeping the target in mind, the state has beefed up exports of fruits, vegetables, flowers, software and other agricultural items along with traditional items like textiles, jute products, tea and leather. 																								Bengal is planning to set up a state export promotion council involving such other councils and chambers of commerce and commodities.																								The government also plans to set up a commerce cell with the director of industries as the export commissioner. Plans are afoot to strengthen the board of trade and simplify procedures so that exporters get the required clearances easily.																								Given our strengths, we will achieve the export targets once the measures we have already taken get going, Sen said. The growth in Bengals steel sector is encouraging, contributing 8.19 per cent to exports in the April-September 2003 period, he added.

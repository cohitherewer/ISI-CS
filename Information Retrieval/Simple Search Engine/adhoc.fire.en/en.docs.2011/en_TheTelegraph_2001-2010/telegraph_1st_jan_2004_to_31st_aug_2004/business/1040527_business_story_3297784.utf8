 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 FMCG set to move at a fast pace
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Up amp; above 																								Mumbai, May 26: ACNielsen Indias latest findings on the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector brought cheers to an industry, which has been witnessing sloppy sales growth for the last few years. The study says the FMCG market has moved into the positive territory.																								In a country with a billion consumers, it is clear that the long-term growth story for the FMCG sector is intact, says ACNielsen India, the leading market research firm that tracks trends.																								According to ACNielsen, the domestic FMCG industry grew 1.4 per cent last year and 4.4 per cent over a five-year period. An overview of the calendar year gone by for the branded packaged goods industry indicates a minor positive movement for the FMCG sector with key categories registering positive growth over the short and long term, ACNielsen said in a statement.																								A look at the top 10 categories by contribution reflects double digit growth rates for biscuits and refined-oil consumer packs, the report said.																								Biscuits have grown over 10 per cent both in the short and the long term, while refined-oil consumer packs grew by over 20 per cent. This growth appears to be supported by increasing disposable incomes, the perceptible shift to lifestyle and convenience products and buoyant consumer confidence in urban India, ACNielsen stated.																								Over a one-year period, skin creams and beverages have also posted around 3 per cent growth and managed slightly higher compounded annual growth rates over the last five years. Skin creams and milk-food beverages (excluding tea and coffee) have consistently maintained a positive trajectory. 																								This can be attributed to some extent to their success in the urban market due to an explosion of brands in the skin-cream category where the versatility of skin products in solving beauty related consumer needs has multiplied, ACNielsen added.

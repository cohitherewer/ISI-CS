 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Overseas projects charge up NHPC
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd (NHPC) is exploring opportunities to set up power projects in Vietnam, Burma, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.																								The company has already received an in-principle approval from the ministries of finance and external affairs to go ahead with its overseas foray. While company officials were unwilling to comment on the foreign exchange that these projects would bring in, they pointed out that these ventures would strengthen the financial position of the state-run power company. 																								We are examining various power projects that can be set up in foreign countries. Necessary approvals have been received from the board and also the external and finance ministries. We are exploring opportunities in Vietnam, Burma, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, said Yogendra Prasad, chairman and managing director of NHPC.																								We are bullish about the proposals and a team from NHPC would soon visit Vietnam to explore the opportunities. The projects, once identified and commissioned, will earn foreign exchange for the country. It is difficult to quantify the amount. But these deals will place domestic power companies on the world map, he added.																								NHPC has already forayed into the South Asian region. It has completed a 60-megawatt (MW) hydro-power project at Kurichu in Bhutan besides the 14.10 MW hydro-power project at Devighat and Nuwakot Rural Electrification project covering 64 villages in Nepal. 																								NHPC will compete with many foreign companies from Canada and the US that have set up projects in India and other countries. However, Prasad is confident that NHPC has capabilities to bag projects abroad.																								He pointed out that the company has developed expertise in planning, investigation, design, engineering and execution of mega, medium and small hydroelectric projects from the concept stage to commissioning. We have also undertaken operation, maintenance, renovation and modernisation of hydro-power plants of small and major capacities. Our experience in executing projects in the worst geological strata and ability to finish them ahead of schedule are our strengths, said Prasad.																								NHPC and Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) have already joined hands to offer consultancy services in various fields of hydro-power development both in India and abroad.																								Set up in 1975, NHPC has an authorised share capital of Rs 15,000 crore and an investment base of more than Rs 20,020 crore. The company, with a paid-up capital of Rs 8,201 crore, operates eight power stations on its own generating 2,475 MW and four joint-venture projects with state governments generating 3,020 MW.

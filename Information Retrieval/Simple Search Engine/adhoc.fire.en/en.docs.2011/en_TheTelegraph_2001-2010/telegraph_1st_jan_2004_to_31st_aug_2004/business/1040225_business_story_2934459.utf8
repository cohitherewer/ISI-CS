 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Wagon shortage dogs Assam refineries 
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Tank trouble																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: Bombarded with SoS messages from oil companies, the petroleum ministry has asked the railway ministry to move on a war footing to increase the number of wagons to evacuate petroleum products from the refineries in Assam. 																								Sources say the petroleum ministry has informed the railway ministry that while the output of the Assam refineries has gone up with another 2 million tonnes of crude being diverted from the eastern offshore Ravva oilfields, the number of rakes being allotted to the region is below the peak level of the previous year.																								The petroleum ministry is of the view that the Assam refineries need another 150 rakes per month to clear their products.																								The shortage of tank wagons has a cascading effect on the operations of the refineries. As the storage tanks start reaching peak capacity, the refining process has to be slowed down and ultimately stopped. This adversely impacts the economics of the refinery. The failure of adequate quantities of products to reach the market also hits the bottomline of the companies.																								The PSU oil companies have invested in 1,200 railway tank wagons which have to be provided on a priority basis. The railways are also increasingly being guided by commercial considerations as their performance is judged by this yardstick.																								They, therefore, have a tendency to send these wagons to areas where the turnaround time is quick so that they can make more money. Sending these rakes to Assam leads to a slower turnaround time.																								The Numaligarh refinery has been the worst hit. According to reliable sources, if the refinery continues to operate at the current rate it is likely to process only 2.3 million tonnes of crude in the current fiscal, which is much lower than its optimum capacity of 3 million tonnes.																								Sources said there has been no improvement at the ground level despite several meetings with the railway authorities.																								The railway bottleneck has come at a time when the refineries in Assam are being turned around by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum. IOCs Bongaigaon refinery, however, has an access to the Bongaigaon-Siliguri pipeline which helps it to evacuate a good chunk of its produce.																								Senior BPCL officials said while the refinery has a state-of-the-art loading facility, the railways were letting them down.																								Unlike IOCs refineries in Assam, which can evacuate their products by pipeline as well, Numaligarh is totally dependent on the rail route for dispatching its products to markets outside the state.

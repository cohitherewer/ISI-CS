 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Govt looks to oil cartel for breather
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 2: The government is pinning its hopes on tomorrows extraordinary meeting of the Opec cartel in Beirut to bring down global crude prices and ease the pressure on Indian oil companies.																								Senior petroleum ministry officials are of the view that the 10 to 12 per cent increase in output that the Opec cartel has in mind will result in a significant decline in crude prices.																								The decline in crude prices will enable the government to avoid the politically dangerous step of going in for a sharp increase in prices of petrol and diesel. The government does not want the price increase on petrol and diesel to exceed Re 1 a litre. It is veering around to the view that the high level of taxes and levies on petroleum products could be slashed to cushion the blow to consumers and the oil companies. 																								Once international crude prices stabilise at a lower level, the government will have more breathing space to phase out the recovery period for the oil companies while shielding the consumer. Saudi oil minister Ali al-Nuaimi today announced that the leading oil producer was ready to increase oil production in an effort to bring down prices to Opecs target range of $22-28 a barrel. 																								Indian crude import is, however, cheaper by around $2 to $3 per barrel. It is a mix of cheap Dubai crude and the high quality Brent crude in the ratio of 55:45. Saudi Arabia has also warned the member countries that a continuous increase in oil prices could boomerang on the oil producers as it would lead to global economic recession which, in turn, would result in a sharp fall in oil prices. In fact, the slump in 1997 and 1998, when crude prices dipped below $10 per barrel, bears ample testimony to such an end-result.																								The United States, which is in election mode, and the European nations, which see a threat to their economic recovery, have mounted pressure on the Opec cartel to increase output to bring down crude prices.																								The formidable clout that the West enjoys over the Opec cartel is also reflected in the fact that Asian countries such as India have to pay $1 per barrel more for crude purchases from West Asia than the western countries.																								Opec members have been claiming that the rise in prices have nothing to do with the fundamentals of supply. They contend that such factors as speculation and the fear of terrorist strikes disrupting oil production are mainly to blame for the surge.

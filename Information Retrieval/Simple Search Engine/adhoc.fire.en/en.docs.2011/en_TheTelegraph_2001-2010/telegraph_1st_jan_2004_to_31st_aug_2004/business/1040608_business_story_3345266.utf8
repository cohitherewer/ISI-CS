 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Insiders to join LIC sales force
 							 - Insurance behemoth devises novel plan to help staff earn more GARIMA SINGH				 	 Cover for all																								New Delhi, June 7: Employees of Life Insurance Corporation, the largest state-owned insurer, now have an opportunity to increase their monthly earnings.																								The life insurance behemoth, which has an 87 per cent marketshare, will soon get its clerks and peons  employees working in categories III and IV  to hawk its products and earn a commission. At present, there are about 80,000 employees who are working in these two categories.																								Employees opting for the scheme, which has yet to receive government approval, will be assured 100 per cent salary in the first year. 																								The salary component will come down by 20 per cent every year. It will be 80 per cent in the second year, 60 per cent in the third year and so on  with the employee able to more than offset the loss of income through high commissions.																								In the fifth year, the employees will have the option of going off the rolls completely  a lucrative option for those who show excellent marketing skills.																								The scheme will start on an all-India basis. The board has given it an in-principle approval. We have not yet sent a proposal to the government, but will do so shortly after the final approval is given. Things are on the drawing board stage. If everything goes well, the scheme is expected to be launched in the next two to three months, LIC managing director R. N. Bhardwaj told The Telegraph.																								Undoubtedly, this scheme will be beneficial for employees who are not only knowledgeable but who also have the marketing potential. We need many more people to market our products across the country, he added. 																								At present, LIC has close to 9 lakh agents. Each year, the insurer adds approximately 2 lakh fresh agents and simultaneously terminates roughly 2.5 lakh non-performing agents.																								One of LICs top performing agents said, Unofficially, class III and IV employees have already been selling policies through development officers and dummy agents (wives and relatives). The launch of this scheme will only make the entire process official.																								G. C. Chaturvedi, joint secretary (insurance and banking) in the finance ministry, said, We have not received any official communication. But from what we have heard, it seems the scheme will prove beneficial to both LIC and its employees. However, the scheme will be approved only after seeing the finer details.

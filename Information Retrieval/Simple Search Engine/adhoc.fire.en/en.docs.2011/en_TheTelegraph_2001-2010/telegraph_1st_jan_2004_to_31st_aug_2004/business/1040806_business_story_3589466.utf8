 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Spurt in trade with China
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: China has emerged as Indias largest trading partner in the north-east Asia region and the total trade between the two countries is targeted to cross the $10-billion mark within the next two years.																								According to the commerce ministrys annual report released today, Japan was Indias leading trade partner till 2001-02 after which Indias exports to China doubled and imports went up by 39 per cent. This resulted in China displacing Japan as the countrys leading trade partner in the region.																								The major items of Indian exports to China are primary and semi-finished iron and steel, iron-ore, plastic and linoleum products, minerals and marine products. Major imports from China include electronic goods, chemicals, coal, coke, briquettes, medicinal and pharmaceutical products.																								The report pins great hopes on the special economic zones and expects them to emerge as engines of economic growth. It expects trade to expand further in 2004 as the trade in goods has strongly rebounded particularly in the US and East Asia. 																								The report points out that Indias trade performance for the financial year ended March 31, 2004 was influenced by a number of factors, including productivity changes in the manufacturing sector, recovery of global economy and world trade, continued trade promotion efforts of the government and an appreciating rupee against the dollar. It highlights the impressive growth rate of over 7 per cent by the manufacturing sector in the quarter ended December 2003.																								The report said world trade also recovered from the hiccups of the SARS scare, tension in West Asia and the economic slow down in Europe. These temporary factors had faded in the second half of the year as a result of which world trade could gather momentum again.

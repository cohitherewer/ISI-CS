 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 NTPC electrifies Centres divestment drill with IPO filing
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, June 21: National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) today filed a prospectus for an initial public offering (IPO) expected to raise Rs 3,500-5,000 crore in the first-flush of divestment since the Manmohan Singh government assumed office.																								Five per cent of the companys Rs 8,000-crore equity will be put on the block, making NTPC one of the first to benefit from the Centres promise of allowing state-owned firms to tap the market for raising expansion funds.																								The navratna public-sector undertaking has secured a rare Sebi exemption from rules that require companies to sell at least 10 per cent of their equity in an IPO.																								Weve just filed the prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The issue is still some time away from the market, a merchant banker affiliated to the power majors offer said. 																								Money raised through the rash of offers from blue-chip PSUs in March went into government coffers. This included the big-ticket ONGC offering, where funds mopped up through the sale of 10 per cent equity reached the exchequer. Cash from stake-sales in Gail, Dredging Corp, IBP, IPCL and CMC followed the same trail.																								NTPCs request for a special exemption from Sebi to allow it offload only 5 per cent of its equity is based on the notion the market lacks the appetite for a large offer. The argument is not without merit: the offers of ONGC and IBP just scraped through, rescued in large part by support from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 																								For NTPC, the equity dilution comes at a time when the market sentiment is weak. Against such a backdrop, a large section of analysts is of the opinion that selling a small chunk of the share-pile is a safer bet.																								In all, 43.29 crore shares of Rs 10 each would be up for grabs. These will make up 5.25 per cent of NTPCs equity, company sources said. Of this, 0.25 per cent, or 20.615 million shares, will be set aside for employees, they added. After the IPO, the governments holding will come down to 95 per cent of PSUs enlarged equity base.																								Three merchant bankers will ensure the IPO is efficiently managed and well received. Kotak Mahindra and ICICI Securities are the lead managers, while Enam Financials is the joint lead manager-cum-book runner.																								Based on an equity base of Rs 8,000 crore, the face-value of 5 per cent of the equity will be around Rs 400 crore. The issue will be priced at a premium that reflects the large reserves NTPC has built up over the years. 																								The largest central power generator secured government approval to divest 10 per cent of its equity, in one or more phases, earlier this year. 																								It also received the market regulators approval for a waiver of the listing norms that fix the minimum size of an IPO at 10 per cent of equity.

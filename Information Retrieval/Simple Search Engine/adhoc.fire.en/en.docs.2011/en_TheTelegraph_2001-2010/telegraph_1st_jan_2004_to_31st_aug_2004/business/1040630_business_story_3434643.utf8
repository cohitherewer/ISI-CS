 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Iron-ore exports set for robust growth
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, June 29: The countrys iron-ore export is set to witness a phenomenal growth over the next five years with the global consumption expected to cross one billion tonnes by 2010.																								The International Iron amp; Steel Institute (IISI) has forecast that the major demand will come from China where steel consumption is estimated to cross 385 million tonnes in the next five years.																								Tony Tricket of IISI said steel consumption in China would have an enormous impact on iron-ore and shipping.																								According to the IISI study, which has been released recently, the crude steel output in China will reach 360 million tonnes by 2010, while pig-iron production will be 333 million tonnes.																								The consumption pattern suggests that Chinas iron-ore demand is set to cross 489 million tonnes from the existing 330 million tonnes.																								Senior analysts said China will face a wider demand-supply gap in iron-ore in the next few years. India stands to gain from Chinas demand pattern because of the geographical proximity between the two countries. Moreover, the quality of Indian iron-ore has also been largely appreciated by the Chinese companies after the Australian ore, they said.																								Sources said a government-led delegation will visit China in September to discuss potential barter deals between the two countries over iron-ore and coking coal. While India is facing a coking-coal crisis, China is hit with iron-ore shortage. 																								 India was the second largest exporter of iron-ore to China in the first three months of 2004 after Australia by exporting 13.4 million tonnes, up 60 per cent compared with the exports in the corresponding period last year.																								Australia was the largest exporter of iron-ore with 18.1 million tonnes during the period under review compared with 13.5 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year. 																								The other key supplier this year was Brazil, at 10.4 million tonnes. In March alone, China imported 19.1 million tonnes of iron-ore. 																								Chinas total iron-ore import in the first three months of this year was up 48 per cent at almost 51 million tonnes, says Jim Lennon at Macquarie Research  Metals and Mining.																								India is the home to worlds finest iron-ore, which it can leverage for coking coal. But unfortunately, it has always been a one-way traffic, which goes against the countrys fortune, said steel industry insiders.																								Indian iron-ore exports used to hover around 29 to 38 million tonnes per year until 2002. But ever since the Chinese demand picked up, total exports have gone up phenomenally. 																								The countrys installed capacity for iron-ore production is expected to rise to 135 million tonnes from the existing 90 million tonnes at the end of the Tenth Five Year Plan. The total demand, during this period, has been estimated at 122 million tonnes.																								During the Eleventh Five Year Plan, another 100 million tonnes of production capacity is likely to come up.

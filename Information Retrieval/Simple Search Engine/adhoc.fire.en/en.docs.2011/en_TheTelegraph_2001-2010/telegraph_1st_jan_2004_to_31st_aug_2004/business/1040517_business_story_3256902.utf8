The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Data Access logs out of Net
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, May 16: Data Access India, an international long distance call operator, is in the process of winding up its dial-up internet services under the brand NOW.																								Confirming the move, Data Access managing director Siddhartha Ray said, The post-paid service has already been closed down. The internet service will be available to pre-paid subscribers for another six months.																								Ray said the step was in line with the companys strategy of strengthening its position in the wholesale market. The company plans to exit the retail business by November.																								During the initial years of its service, NOW had a subscriber base of over 2 lakh with revenues of Rs 10 to 12 crore. The base has now dwindled to just over 10,000 users. The internet service provider (ISP) was present in Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi.																								Bhartis Mantra and Wipros NetCracker earlier chose to opt out of the non-viable ISP business. Huge losses also forced CalTiger, the countrys first free ISP, to close shop.																								Retail business contributes to less that 2 per cent of our total revenues, said Ray. With its low volume and growth value, retailing has become non-viable. On the other hand, we have emerged as a strong player in the international long distance (ILD) segment.																								Data Access records 120 million minutes of traffic every month and has a 25 per cent market share and an estimated revenue share of 11 per cent. 																								After winding up the retail ISP business, the company plans to focus on the carrier business and expand its reach to more telecom operators.																								Data Access has suffered accumulated losses of Rs 98.6 crore on September 30, 2002, mainly due to the failing ISP business. With the ILD business gaining a foothold, the losses were down to Rs 92.8 crore on September 2003.																								The company has recorded Rs 850-crore revenue in 2003-04 and also registered a profit of Rs 5.85 crore.																								On the companys initial public offering (IPO) plans, Ray said it was being reviewed and a decision would be taken by the end of the month. The IPO, due to hit the markets on March 29, was postponed as a complaint had been lodged with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for non-disclosure of payments due.

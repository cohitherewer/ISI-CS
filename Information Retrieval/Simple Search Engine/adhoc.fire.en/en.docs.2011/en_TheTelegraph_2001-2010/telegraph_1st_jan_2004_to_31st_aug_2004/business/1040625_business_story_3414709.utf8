 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Infocomm rewards in sight
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 24: Reliance Industries expects its infocom venture to reap rich returns for the group in future.																								A million applications from subscribers within 10 days of the launch did throw up some problems in logistics, billing and collection, but Reliance Infocomm ironed them out, chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said.																								This whole issue is now behind us, he said. Despite an operating cash profit of Rs 596 crore during 2003-04, Reliance Infocomm adopted a very conservative stand and provided for bad debts amounting to Rs 436 crore. 																								Cash profit after provision for bad debt was Rs 160 crore, while depreciation and amortisation stood at Rs 550 crore. As a result, the company suffered a net loss of Rs 390 crore. The impact of the infocom business on the consolidated results of Reliance Industries in 2003-04 was a loss of Rs 265 crore.																								Despite such initial hiccups, Ambani said the company is now expanding its services to 5,000 towns in a phased manner. It is also trying to bring about a broadband revolution in the country. 																								Reliance Infocomm has an aggressive scheme for migration to pre-paid for its WiLL services. The company will cater to nearly 40 million subscribers on completion of its expansion.

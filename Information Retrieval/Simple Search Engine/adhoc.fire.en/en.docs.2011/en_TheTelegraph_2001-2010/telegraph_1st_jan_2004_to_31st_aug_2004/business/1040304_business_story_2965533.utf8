The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Metro Cash amp; Carry faces Karnataka ire
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, March 3: The Karnataka government has pulled up Metro Cash amp; Carry India Ltd for violating an FIPB norm. 																								According to an agreement with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), the company can supply only to distributors, wholesalers and retailers with valid trade licences/sales tax registration. Business-to-business sale is permitted under the extant policy, but cannot be strictly termed as retail trade. 																								The company, a 100 per cent subsidiary of retail giant Metro Cash amp; Carry of Germany, has allowed business customers to purchase at its two Bangalore outlets by issuing them access cards. 																								The cards have been issued to retail traders, hotels, computer training institutes, security service agencies and doctors.																								Business/trade licences are sales tax registration certificates, excise licence, service/professional tax registration certificate, labour licence, corporation licence and others.																								In its terms and conditions, the company says that it sells goods to the customer on the condition that they are for resale, commercial use or industrial use only and not for personal consumption.																								A verification by the Karnataka government revealed that the purchases made by the customers were for personal consumption. 																								Bhima Jewellers, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of jewellery and has a sales tax registration, purchased footwear, confectionery and other food products for personal consumption. 																								Similarly, Hatari Security Services has purchased food products for personal consumption. The government has cited many such cases in its detailed report to the department of economic affairs.																								The Karnataka government has observed, Most of the products being bought are for home consumption and end use and not for business-to-business purpose.																								It is clear that the company has violated the original condition laid down in the approval letter dated December 5, 2000, in which Metro Cash amp; Carry India was asked sells products to retailers who possess sales tax registrations and not to consumers, the report said.																								The Karnataka government feels it is losing out on resale tax revenue due to this violation. The state would have realised a resale tax from retailers on resale of goods bought from Metro.																								The government also said that no precaution has been taken by the company to prevent business customers who do not possess a valid sales tax registration from selling retail goods purchased without paying resale tax to the state government.

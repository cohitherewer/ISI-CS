 OUR BUREAUX New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 6: Interest rates on retail loans are expected to go up, reversing the trend of a soft-rate regime, as inflation rose to a three-and-a-half year high. However, the impact on the rates is unlikely to be immediate.																								With the Reserve Bank of India likely to tighten its monetary policy, which means sucking out the excess money from the system to curb inflationary pressures, the near-term interest rate could rise.																								Housing loans and advances for the purchase of automobiles and consumer goods could get costlier. This week, housing finance major HDFC raised interest rates by 25 basis points from the three-decade low of 7.5 per cent, while Union Bank of India had raised 50 basis points last year.																								The marginal increases, though separate and unrelated, might just trigger a rate hike. Moreover, the absence of demand-for-credit in the domestic financial system would hold back an increase until the busy season monetary policy scheduled in October.																								Arun Kaul, general manager in charge of treasury operations at Punjab National Bank, however, said it was a bit premature to predict a possible change in the monetary policy as it takes into account factors over a period of time.																								Keeping the global market in view, where the US federal treasury bills fell by 20 basis points and the dollar weakened against other currencies, we need to wait for sometime to see a clear trend emerging, said Kaul.																								In the monetary policy presented in April, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left its benchmark bank rate, used by banks to price loans, steady at a three-decade low of 6 per cent. The rate was last lowered by 25 basis points in April 2003. The short-term repo rate, which was last cut in August 2003, was also kept unchanged at 4.5 per cent.																								Inflationary pressures would push up costs and if the upward trend continues, there could be a 25-50-basis-point hike in the next monetary policy, said an analyst with a global consulting firm.

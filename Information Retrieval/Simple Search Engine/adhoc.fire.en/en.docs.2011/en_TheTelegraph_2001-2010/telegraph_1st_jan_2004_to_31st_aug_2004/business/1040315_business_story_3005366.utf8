The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Pumped up for highway spinoffs
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, March 14: Petroleum companies are upbeat on business opportunities arising from the Golden Quadrilateral project and other mega-highway plans.																								They see a rise in demand for high-speed diesel, which accounts for 40 per cent of all petroleum products sold.																								Reliance Industries, with the largest single location of 33 million tonnes grass root refinery, is betting that almost 60 per cent of high-speed diesel retail marketing will shift to these highways.																								Public sector oil refineries also support Reliances stand. We can put up petrol pumps wherever we want and all petroleum companies have finalised their strategies, said Arun Jyoti, managing director of IBP Ltd, a retailing company where Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) holds a majority stake.																								According to Jyoti, almost 68 per cent of the companys sales accrue from diesel. IBP has almost 70 per cent of its 2,524 petrol pumps on national highways. Last year, the company had set up the maximum number of petrol pumps in the south.																								Oil PSUs also plan to give a new look to their petrol pumps. IBP has tied up with dairy major Amul and consumer goods major Hindustan Lever to sell their products through its retail network. It has also tied up with banks to set up ATMs in the petrol pumps. 																								The petrol pumps will be one-stop shops where consumers can even fill up fuel, Jyoti said.																								Companies like IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and IBP also have groups dealing with consumer relations. Special attention is given to big customers like fleet operators, said a senior PSU official.																								Reliance will pose a challenge for oil PSUs as the company plans to open 300 retail petrol outlets in the next six months and ramp it up to 600 by the end of the year. Other private sector players, who are expected to set up retail outlets on national highways, are Essar Oil and Shell. 																								Oil and Natural Gas Corporation with Mangalore Refinery is also waiting on the sidelines to unleash its retail plans, with most of the outlets expected to be set up on highways.

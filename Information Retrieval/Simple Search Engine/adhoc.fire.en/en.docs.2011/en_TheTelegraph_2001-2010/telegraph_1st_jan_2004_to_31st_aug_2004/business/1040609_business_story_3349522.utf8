 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 8: Standard Chartered Bank India has more than halved its stake in Standard Chartered Mutual Fund, its subsidiary asset management company (AMC), to 19 per cent from 41 per cent.																								Sources said the bank has been ratcheting up investments in equity-based funds managed by other entities while reducing its exposure to Standard Chartered Mutual Fund, whose asset base comprises only debt instruments. A clutch of other investors has taken over the shareholding sold off by the parent bank. 																								Ever since the Congress-led coalition government with a left-wing slant took charge, the stock market has shed just around 1,000 points in 2004, or 17.2 per cent, making it one of Asias worst performers. 																								Foreign investors, who have sold net Rs 3,780 crore ($840 million) worth of stocks in May, said the pace of economic reforms along with fiscal deficit is a cause for worry.																								The decision to invest in equity-linked schemes could have hit the bank in the short-run as in the long-run equities would still be bullish, said analysts. 																								The market would be volatile till the new government settles down and would range between 4,500 points and 5,000 points, they added.																								The corpus of Standard Chartered Mutual Fund has, however, risen 57 per cent to Rs 9,200 crore in just over one-and-a-half years from Rs 5,770 crore despite a strong demand for equity-focused funds.

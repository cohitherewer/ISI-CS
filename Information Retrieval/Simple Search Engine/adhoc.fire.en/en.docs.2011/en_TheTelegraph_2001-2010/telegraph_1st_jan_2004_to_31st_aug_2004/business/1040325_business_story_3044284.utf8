 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 UTI gets Rs 328 cr from govt to bridge shortfall
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 24: The government today said it had re-issued 6.2 per cent, 6-year bonds worth Rs 328 crore to Unit Trust of India to help it meet a fund shortfall in its assured return schemes.																								The bonds have been issued to the administrator of specific undertakings of UTI for meeting their liabilities arising on account of a shortfall in the assured return schemes, a government statement said.																								The investment in the UTI bonds will not be reckoned as an eligible investment for purpose of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the statement said.																								Last month, the chairman and managing director of the fund, M. Damodaran, had said the government would lose Rs 3,000 crore for the premature closure of seven assured return schemes of the former UTI.																								Interest rates would be reset on the remaining eight schemes so as to minimise the impact of these losses, he added.																								The erstwhile Unit Trust of India, set-up in 1964 by an act of Parliament, was split in two  UTI I and UTI II  in August 2002, and provided a Rs 14,500-crore bailout package to meet possible liabilities from the assured fund schemes worth Rs 31,000 crore of UTI I.																								The UTI bonds will be transferable and eligible for market ready forward transaction (Repo). The bonds, however, will not be an eligible underlying security for ready forward transactions (Repo/Reverse Repo) with the Reserve Bank of India, the statement added.																								Last year in January, the government had transferred management control of Unit Trust of India II (UTI-II) to an asset management company (AMC). The AMC has been promoted by state-run State Bank of India along with Life Insurance Corporation, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank with a capital infusion of Rs 2.5 crore each.																								The fund, composed of the net asset value schemes of the erstwhile Unit Trust of India, recently acquired IL amp;FS Mutual Fund, worth around Rs 2,500 crore. With this merger, UTIs total schemes now stand at 52.

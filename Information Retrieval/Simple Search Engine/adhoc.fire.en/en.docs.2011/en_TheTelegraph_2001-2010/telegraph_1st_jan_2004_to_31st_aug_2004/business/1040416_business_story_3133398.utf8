 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Unit-linked policies to drive LIC growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 15: Following the trend set by private life insurers, state-owned Life Insurance Corporation will bank on unit-linked policies in fiscal 2004-05. LIC plans to introduce three to four unitised life insurance policies this year.																								We expect to launch a few by the month of May-June and remaining in the latter part of the year, said LIC chairman S. B. Mathur on the sidelines of a conference.																								He, however, cautioned that for a unit-linked policy to be successful, the pre-requisite is that the policyholder is well-informed. The risk on investment is entirely borne by the investor.																								Admitting that the future of insurance industry lies in unitised products, Mathur said, Internationally, such plans are considered very safe and capital intensive. With markets opening up in India, the future lies in these products.																								The public sector insurance giant has earned big bucks on Bima Plus, its only unitised product in the market. The insurer has sold approximately 1, 40,000 policies earning a premium of Rs 300 crore. With more unit-linked policies finding place in its kitty, premium generation from unit-linked policies alone can be very good, said Mathur.																								Confirming that removal of tax exemption under single premium policies had badly hit the insurer, he said LIC was expecting to garner a meagre Rs 700 crore premium from this product in fiscal 2003-04. This is a sharp decline from the Rs 3,000 crore that the insurer earned in year 2002-03.																								Finance minister Jaswant Singh had announced in his maiden budget the withdrawal of tax exemption on single premium policies. Mathur said, We had written to the finance ministry earlier and have reminded them again recently to seriously examine the issue.																								LIC is expected to revamp the single premium policies this year by offering more options as riders. The policy focus will be very investment oriented, said Mathur. 																								Confirming that the rate of return on single premium policies will come down, another senior LIC official said, It may be around 4 per cent. 																								Before the withdrawal of the tax exemption, the insurer gave 7 per cent rate of return on its single premium policies.

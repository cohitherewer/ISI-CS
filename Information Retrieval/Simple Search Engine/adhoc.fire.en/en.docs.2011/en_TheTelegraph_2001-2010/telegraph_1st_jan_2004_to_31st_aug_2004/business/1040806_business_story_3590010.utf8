 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Nath goes to FM with fiscal wishlist for trade
 S. P. S. PANNU Chidambaram (top)  amp; Nath: Deal date 																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath is likely to meet finance minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow to work out the various fiscal concessions that have to be woven into the new foreign trade policy. 																								Sources say Nath will be taking up the issue of incentives required to kick-start the special economic zones (SEZs) in the country.																								Exporters are looking for an offshore banking facility at the SEZs so that they can have direct access to loans in dollars at low rates of interest. The difference between the Libor rate of interest and Indian rates is a good 3 to 4 per cent and the exporters have been demanding this facility to lower transaction costs so that they can become more competitive in the international market.																								The commerce ministry has already prepared a proposal to enact a central legislation on SEZs so that a duty-free environment with a minimum of regulation can be introduced in these zones. The SEZ concept has been modelled on the Chinese lines where they triggered the export boom. 																								The duty entitlement passbook scheme (DEPB), an incentive given to exporters, is also expected to figure in the talks between the two ministers. The customs authorities are opposed to the scheme as it has been misused to drain the national exchequer. 																								There have been instances where unscrupulous players have claimed benefits under the scheme against export consignments that have not been made. In some cases, containers full of rags have been shipped overseas and shown as high-value goods to claim export incentives. Senior customs officials have been citing various seizures made by them to support the move for scrapping of this incentive. 																								However, the exporters claim that there are only a small number of black sheep that indulge in these practices and most of the exports are genuine. 																								Kamal Nath is also keen that the finance ministry notifications required to give effect to any incentives for boosting exports should be made along with the announcement of the foreign trade policy at the end of this month.

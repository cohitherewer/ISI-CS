 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, June 22: India Inc has recoiled with horror at the prospect of job quotas, but legal opinion is divided over whether the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government can force companies to earmark jobs for dalits and other weaker sections of the society.																								The job quota promise that the UPA made in its common minimum programme (CMP) has raised the hackles of companies with Sunil Munjal, the new CII president, among the first to voice his protest over a measure that many reckon will compromise the merit-based system that has honed the competitive edge of Indian firms.																								Now, the legal eagles are split on the constitutional validity of such a promise.																								Former chief justice P. . Bhagwati  who is also the architect of Sebis takeover code  says any legislation by the government to force the companies to provide for job quotas would be debatable and arguable in a court of law as its constitutional validity could be challenged.																								The Constitution provides for reservation only to the SC/STs and that too for a period of 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution in 1950. However, successive governments have not only extended this reservation from time-to-time but also provided job quotas to other backward castes (OBCs).																								In the case arising from the acceptance of the Mandal Commission report providing for jobs quotas to OBCs, the Supreme Court had held that reservation in any form shall not exceed 50 per cent.																								It is in this context that Justice Bhagwati says that any move to extend job reservation to private companies could come under judicial scrutiny.																								No matter which legislative method the government employs to provide for such reservation  a new law or an amendment to the Companies Act  it would have to meet the touchstone of Article 16 of the Constitution which provides for equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.																								Under this article, the Constitution empowers the government to provide for reservations, but then it is only in government departments, says Justice Bhagwati.																								Justice Bhagwati said it would have to be determined whether Article 16 providing for equality of opportunity in public employment could be extended to companies and other industrial sectors.																								However, Justice Rajindar Sachar, former chief of the Delhi High Court, has a completely different take on the issue. He reckons that the government is well empowered to enforce a directive principle of state policy.																								Education, health, and employment come under the directive principles of the state which supports the principle of affirmative action that provides opportunities to the disadvantaged and underprivileged sections of the society.

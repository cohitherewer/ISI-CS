 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Launch flurry from Bajaj
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, May 2: Bajaj Auto, the countrys second-largest two-wheeler maker, plans to introduce two to three scooter models this year to boost sales.																								We have found out that there is still a demand of scooters and, therefore, have decided to introduce trendier looking scooters, said a senior company official.																								The company is planning to revive demand for scooters by introducing new models. Scooters have been our traditional strength. But as the scooter market is going sluggish, there was not much action on the product front from our side, said vice-chairman Madhur Bajaj.																								The Pune-based company has traditionally been a scooter-maker with its popular Chetak and Super models. But, lately it laid more emphasis on the motorcycle segment as it continues to be the main growth driver.																								Geared-scooter sales have been on a slide with customers preference tilting towards trendy scooterettes and fuel efficient but more powerful motorcyles. 																								However, with the introduction of trendier and fuel-efficient scooters like Activa, Eterno from Honda Motorcycle Scooters India, demand is slowly picking up.																								During 2003-04 scooter sales rose 7 per cent to 8.85 lakh units against a negative growth reported in the previous financial.																								The market is picking up and we would like to capitalise on this as soon as possible, said the official. The products would be competitively priced, he added.																								Analysts said favourable demographics along with lower interest rates would continue to drive the growth in two-wheeler sales in short to medium term.																								Scooter is back in flavour, especially among the urban section, said the analyst. While, motorcyles would continue to drive growth, scooters will be a close second, he added.																								Currently, Bajaj sells the popular motorcycle models, which includes Boxer, Caliber, Wind 125, Pulsar, and the Eliminator. In 2003-03 cumulative motorcycle sales between 75 cc and 250 cc stood at 41.3 lakh units, up nearly 8 per cent from 38.3 lakh units reported a year-ago.

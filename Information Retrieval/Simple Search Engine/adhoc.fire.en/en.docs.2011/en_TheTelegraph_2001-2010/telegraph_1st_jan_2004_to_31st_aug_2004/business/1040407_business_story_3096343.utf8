 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 6: UTI Mutual Fund is set to launch an overseas equity fund and a couple of capital-guaranteed schemes for non-resident Indians. The countrys largest mutual fund that manages Rs 21,500 crore in assets, is scouting for a partner to manage the overseas equity fund.																								UTI Mutual Fund chairman M. Damodaran said: We do not have expertise in managing investments abroad. The search for a partner is at an advanced stage and we are hopeful that our overseas equity fund would be launched inside this year.																								This is not the first overseas equity fund to be launched in India  Principal Mutual Fund raised a little over $15 million (Rs 65 crore) from the recently-concluded initial public offering of its Principal Global Opportunities Fund.																								Analysts said it was not a bad beginning. Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research Online said: Considering its a new fund, Rs 65 crore isnt bad. It shows people in India have appetite for new equity products like this. The fund would invest its corpus in shares of multinational companies that own over 10 per cent in firms listed on Indian bourses. Damodaran said the two capital-guaranteed  schemes would be launched in partnership with Socit Gnrale  Asset Management of France. The latter would provide the  capital guarantee for a fee. The schemes would be modelled  on existing equity-oriented schemes like Mastergain and  MasterPlus. In the last few months, several  fund houses have launched schemes aimed at NRIs. What makes  UTIs proposed schemes attractive is the capital guarantee.  Indian mutual funds are not allowed to offer capital guarantee;  hence the partnership with Socit Gnrale.

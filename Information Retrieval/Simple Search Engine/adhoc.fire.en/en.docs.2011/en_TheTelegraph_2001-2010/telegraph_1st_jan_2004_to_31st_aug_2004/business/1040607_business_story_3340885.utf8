 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Generation boost to power SEB revenues
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Skys the limit																								Calcutta, June 6: West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has kept a target of generating Rs 4,508.86 crore in revenues this year by selling 1,202 million units of power.																								The corporate plan worked out by the board envisages sale of 6,461 million units to domestic consumers, 1,138.01 million units to decentralised bulk consumers and 4,421 million units to centralised bulk customers.																								However, all our revenue targets are subject to the orders of the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC), said a senior official of the board.																								It intends to generate an operational surplus of Rs 200 crore and convert Rs 550 crore worth of capital work-in-progress into assets. 																								Plans are also afoot to reduce receivables from Rs 1,600 crore to Rs 1,400 crore, and the size of inventories from Rs 227 crore to Rs 190 crore. 																								Liabilities, a big source of concern, will be brought down from Rs 2,900 crore to Rs 2,500 crore this financial year.																								Transmission and distribution losses, which are swallowing revenues, is another area in which the board wants to move aggressively. As part of this, revenue audit will be conducted in 30 medium and low-voltage units suffering an aggregate technical loss of 50 per cent. Aggregate technical losses comprise technical losses that arise from the system and pilferage.																								To boost the revenue collection system, the board will introduce bill-payment systems through bank/credit card in 20 towns. New connections will be given within 21 days of completion of formalities as part of a larger initiative to improve customer-care services.																								We are trying to improve the boards finances. If we are successful, it will have an impact on tariffs, though WBERC is the deciding authority on it. The board can only appeal, state power minister Mrinal Banerjee said.																								As part of the new transmission and distribution projects that the board plans to get off the ground soon, 42 33/11 KV sub-stations with a capacity of 365.6 MVA will be set up, along with 1,550 smaller sub-stations.																								The entire exercise is aimed at helping the board turn the corner soon, the official said. An image-building campaign is also brewing. People feel we are a non-performer. But our efficiency and service levels have improved a lot over the past couple of years, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 At TCS, its hot to just hang on
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 24: Log into Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and you are likely to hang around longer than your peers in other fast-moving infotech majors.																								The Tatas new jewel in the crown has just added more sparkle: It has the lowest attrition rate  a management jargon describing the frequency of job switching.																								That is unique for a company with 28,000 software engineers 10,000 of them abroad  and 3000-5000 additions every year. The attrition rate of employees on the payroll of the TCS in India was 3.6 per cent for fiscal 2002, 2.8 per cent for 2003 and 6.5 per cent for 2004, says TCS in its public-offer prospectus filed recently. 																								The company makes no bones about the fact that the attrition rate is its main risk factor. Our success depends, in large part, on our senior management and our ability to retain them, the prospectus states. Attrition is defined as the ratio of employees that left to those who remain on the payroll in a given period of time.																								Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the highly skilled professionals we need to sustain our business, said TCS, which joined the league of Indian firms with a turnover of $1 billion in 2003-04.																								According to Nasscom, the staff turnover rate in infotech fell two-thirds, from 35 per cent in 1999-2000 to 25 per cent in 2000-01 and to 12 per cent in 2001-02. Ironically, it took a slump in 2001 and 2002 to rein in job-hoppers.

 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Subsidy in power higher than in health
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, May 23: A recent study conducted by the Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) shows states enjoy higher subsidies in power compared with those in other key sectors. 																								The study  India Economic Review 2003-04  shows a much higher power subsidy on agriculture in several states compared with expenditure on sectors like health, irrigation and rural development.																								The study assumes significance in the face of recent comments made by newly-elected Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that even as high power subsidies in Andhra Pradesh were justified on the grounds of drought in the state, in the long run, people should pay for power.																								In Punjab, chief minister Amrinder Singh earned the ire of farmers who thought he went back on his promise of free power. 																								According to him, it was better to have uninterrupted power, rather than free power which was short on availability.																								S. P. Gupta, a well-known economist and former Planning Commission member, also said, Power supply to agriculture is not a question of cost alone, but of regular uninterrupted supply. It will be beneficial to farmers if they get uninterrupted power, rather than a free and irregular supply.																								The study reveals that power subsidy in several states constitutes a high share percentage of the fiscal deficit. 																								It is 74 per cent in Madhya Pradesh, 65 per cent in Gujarat and Karnataka and 51 per cent in Andhra Pradesh. 																								In Madhya Pradesh, the power subsidy on agriculture is Rs 3,250 crore, whereas it is Rs 900 crore for health and Rs 800 crore each for irrigation and rural development. 																								In Andhra Pradesh, the power subsidy on agriculture is Rs 3,100 crore, whereas the expenditure on health is Rs 1,200 crore, on irrigation Rs 2,600 crore and on rural development, Rs 1,500 crore.																								In Gujarat and Maharashtra, the power subsidies on agriculture is Rs 4000 crore, while those for health, irrigation and rural development does not even cross Rs 3000 crore. 																								Rural development expenditure is as low as Rs 500 crore in Gujarat.																								Gupta said, If the production and distribution of power is inefficient, then a subsidy is merely to cover up the losses of the production units. This should not happen. In the short-term, farmers can be given subsidies, but in the long run, the answer lies in efficient production and distribution.

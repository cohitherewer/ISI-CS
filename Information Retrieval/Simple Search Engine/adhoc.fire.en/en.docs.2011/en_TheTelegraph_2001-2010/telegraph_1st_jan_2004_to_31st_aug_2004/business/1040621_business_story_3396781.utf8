 GARIMA SINGH				 	 The Imperial Hotel in Delhi. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, June 20: The Imperial Hotel in Delhi is a bit of an anachronism. Built in 1931 by Bromfield, one of Sir Edwin Lutyens associates, and inaugurated by Lord Willingdon in 1933 as a rich amalgam of Victorian, colonial and art deco styles of architecture, the five-star deluxe hotel that describes itself as the first maiden of the East has a studied ambience that is redolent of the days of the British raj.																								Now, it is looking at the possibility of building a clone.																								The stand-alone property spread over eight acres  with its pillared verandahs, tableware from London, Italian marble floors, Burma teak and rosewood furniture, and original Daniells and Frasers on the walls  is scouting for its second destination, preferably in the south.																								The due diligence process is on. We are initially keen on expanding domestically and south India is the preferred destination. We are in the process of exploring all opportunities. However, being a very conservative company with strict criteria, the expansion has to suit our business model, The Imperial executive director Govind Singh told The Telegraph.																								Stating that the group was ready to acquire an existing property or starting a greenfield project, Singh said, We will make sure that we dont dilute our brand in any way.																								Industry insiders believe that the hotel will, in all likelihood, stick to its unique selling proposition and look to recreate the aura of an early 19th century English manor that the present low-rise structure on Janpath (or Queensway in the days of the raj) has. Tourism analyst Rabindra Seth says, Cities like Chennai and Bangalore have British residencies. The acquisition of any of these heritage properties hallowed in British tradition is a great possibility.																								If the hotel is built from scratch, the economics might not permit the group to replicate the same ambience, he added.																								Industry sources say The Imperial Hotel is open to the idea of building both a five-star resort and a hotel.

 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Procter quarterly profit rises 44%
																								Chicago, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Procter amp; Gamble Co. on Monday posted a 44 per cent rise in quarterly profit from a year earlier when it took restructuring charges, and also said it expects double-digit earnings growth for the fiscal year that began last month, sending its shares higher.																								The maker of Tide laundry detergent, Head amp; Shoulders shampoo and scores of other household and personal-care products said that even excluding the restructuring charges, earnings rose 13 per cent on increased volume across most businesses and the benefit of cost-cutting programmes.																								Volume was again boosted by the beauty care and health-care segments, as well as by sales in developing markets. Higher volume, in turn, helped make the companys factories operate more efficiently, increasing margins.																								It sounds like the P amp;G train keeps chugging along, particularly relative to what weve heard this far from other consumer products companies, said Joseph Altobello, analyst at CIBC World Markets.																								While P amp;G shares trade at a slight premium to other consumer products makers, Altobello said there is still value in the shares, and he rates the stock sector outperformer.																								The stock is not cheap, but I think that as long as the company can continue to deliver the kind of results they have, which we believe will continue, theres still upside to the stock, he said.																								P amp;G, which also makes Charmin toilet paper and many other household and personal-care products, had profit of $1.37 billion, or 50 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. That compares with $955 million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, when the company had $261 million in restructuring charges.																								Analysts on average forecast 48 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.																								Sales rose 19 per cent to $12.96 billion. Analysts on average forecast $12.86 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, such as hair-care products maker Wella AG, and divestitures, sales rose 10 per cent. The weak US dollar, which makes overseas sales worth more when translated into dollars on the income statement, added 3 per cent to growth.																								Volume, a closely watched measure for packaged-goods makers, rose 18 per cent and was up 10 per cent excluding acquisitions and divestitures.																								The company also forecast double-digit earnings growth for 2005 on volume growth of 6 per cent to 7 per cent. For the first quarter, the company forecast profit at the upper end of analysts expectations. Analysts forecast $2.56 a share for the year, a 10 per cent increase over fiscal 2004, and 70 cents a share in the quarter.																								P amp;G shares, which are up more than 7 per cent for the year, rose $1.71 or 3.3 per cent to $53.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning.Entergy fares well																								Entergy Corp on Monday reported a quarterly profit rise of 29 per cent, as results improved at both its utility and nuclear operations, and announced a $1.5 billion stock buyback programme that will extend through the end of 2006. The New Orleans energy company also said it is in advanced talks to sell its Entergy-Koch LP marketing and trading joint venture with privately held Koch Industries Inc. and plans to sell Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP after that.																								Entergy posted second-quarter earnings of $271.0 million, or $1.14 a share, matching analysts average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Meet to quell turnover tax flare-up
 							 - Chidambaram steps in to calm tempers frayed over new share levy OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 9: In a bid to muffle the furore against the new trading tax, finance minister P. Chidambaram today invited brokers for a discussion on Tuesday.																								As trading commenced on Dalal Street today, day traders, who contribute almost 85 per cent of the traded turnover on the stock exchanges, came out on the streets to protest against the turnover tax. Day traders are brokers who do not take share deliveries but square off their positions within a single session.																								As they shouted slogans outside, the Bombay Stock Exchange was felicitating companies with a listing history of more than 25 years.																								Infosys Technologies chief . R. Narayana Murthy was honoured for having created the greatest amount of wealth in the shortest time. Mahindra amp; Mahindra vice-chairman Anand Mahindra was also felicitated.																								None of the big brokers came to commiserate openly with the day traders. Unwittingly, Motilal Oswal, a bulge-bracket broker, became the unlikely supporter as he walked to the BSE convention hall to attend the founders day function.																								Meanwhile, following a meeting later in the evening, BSE and NSE brokers decided not to go on strike on Monday. Instead, they will chalk out their strategy for Tuesdays meeting with Chidambaram.																								Brokers are hopeful that Chidambaram will water down the tax from 15 basis points to 10 basis points and exclude debt and derivatives from its ambit.																								They blame some senior executives from leading foreign institutional investors and bureaucrats for creating the confusion.																								We never thought this (turnover tax) would have an all-encompassing charge on securities. It should have been applicable only to equities, a broker said.																								The turnover tax, if implemented, would enable the government to collect in excess of Rs 4,000 crore against its normal income of Rs 1,500 crore through capital gains.																								FIIs stand to gain from the budget proposals. The turnover tax, instead of capital gains tax, will ensure that they register and operate directly from India instead of routing through offices in Mauritius and other tax havens. They have been operating from tax havens basically to avoid double taxation.																								FIIs, which have reported a net inflow of Rs 277 crore in the past five sessions of the month, have made an all-round buying in blue chip stocks, aiding the market to make a strong turnaround.

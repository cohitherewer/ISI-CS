 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Back-office joins NIIT frontline
 							 - Courses revamped to help  train BPO job aspirants M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Rajendran: Change agent																								Bangalore: June 6: NIIT will soon kick off a major brand-building exercise with courses that are tailor-made for those who wish to join the booming business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT-enabled services (ITeS) industry.																								Launched in 1982 to impart basic computer skills, the company has been driven by competition to revamp the graduate NIIT (GNIIT) programme, one of its popular courses, to meet the demands of the BPO sector. 																								The new GNIIT format, the first initiative among the many changes scheduled to be announced over the next few months, has been co-designed with the IT and ITeS firms. The course now has four specialised modules, built on a common foundation  software engineering, system engineering amp; networking, information system management and business process management.																								The choice of these streams are based on an assessment of the most sought-after skills in IT and ITeS industry, and also after examining the kind of jobs that GNIIT students were engaged in the past few quarters, COO and IT education head P. Rajendran said.																								Students will begin with a common foundation, after which their performance and specific strengths will lead them to the area of specialisation they would like.																								The plan makes NIIT among the first to have moved ahead on a Nasscom suggestion that IT institutes design courses with inputs from ITeS companies, which are likely to recruit more than five million new professionals over the next 5-10 years. 																								The software export industry is expected to hire another 1.52 lakh IT professionals in 2004-05, up 36 per cent. About 25,000 non-engineering graduates with IT skills could be part of the large army of technicians in software engineering, networking, and business application.																								Our effort would be to maintain innovation, technology and global expansion. GNIIT and Net Varsity programmes have helped address the issue of remote learning, remote working. The student has to learn without assistance. The course prepares a person to work separately in future, like in managing a system alone, with the help of online support, Rajendran said.																								The new courses designed for the BPO brigade have come as much out of a review of NIITs core activities as they have from the need to meet industry needs.																								The company, already spun off into NIIT Ltd and NIIT Technologies, is looking for opportunities in the existing business as well as new areas. China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Russia, and Mexico will be key markets on the expansion route.

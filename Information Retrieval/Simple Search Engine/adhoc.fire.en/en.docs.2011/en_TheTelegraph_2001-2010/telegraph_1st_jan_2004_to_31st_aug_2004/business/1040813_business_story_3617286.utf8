 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Phillips Carbon eyes firms abroad
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 12: Phillips Carbon Black Limited is looking at acquisitions or greenfield projects in West Asia and Russia, where it has initiated feasibility studies.																								At present, the company has three units in Cochin, Baroda and Durgapur. An overseas unit will enable the company to cater to the growing global demand for carbon black as many tyre majors have undertaken expansion drives.																								The RP Goenka group company is also in talks with French tyre major Michellin to supply carbon black, which will take its exports to over Rs 200 crore by September 2005. Michellin has already approved the companys product.																								It has started exporting to Bridgestone at its manufacturing facility in Japan and will do so to facilities in China, Thailand and Malayasia. The value of the tied-up export is in excess of $300 million, said a senior official of the company.																								In the current financial year ending September 30, Phillips Carbon expects to more than double its carbon black export to Rs 100 crore from Rs 53 crore. Exports in the first three quarters registered 92 per cent growth at Rs 67 crore.																								The Cochin unit manufactures 35,000 tonnes per annum of carbon black, that in Baroda 95,000 tonnes and 140,000 tonnes are produced in Durgapur.																								Phillips Carbon has also decided to enter into power sales. The company has set up a 12-MW co-generation power plant using process gas at the Baroda plant. The total investment is around Rs 37 crore.																								Senior company officials said Phillips Carbon will use 5 MW power for their carbon black production at the Baroda plant and the remaining 7 MW will be sold to Adani Exports. The company expects to earn Rs 11-12 crore annually through the sale of power. We will also save Rs 14-15 crore on our power bill through this captive power generation, the officials added.																								The company is also carrying out a feasibility study at its Durgapur plant to set up another 16 MW captive power plant. Descon and M. . Dastur have been engaged to carry out the study. The total investment is to the tune of Rs 60 crore.																								The company is in talks with Power Trading Corporation to sell surplus power, which will be generated after fulfilling the Durgapur plants requirements.																								The project has not yet received the boards clearance. It will take another 18 months to commission the power plant. The funding process has not been worked out. It may be through internal accruals, foreign equity as well as ECB financing, the officials added.

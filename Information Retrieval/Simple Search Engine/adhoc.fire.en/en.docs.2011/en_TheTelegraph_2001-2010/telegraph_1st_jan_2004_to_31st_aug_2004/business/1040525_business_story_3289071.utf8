 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Wait amp; watch approach on petro-goods prices 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Aiyar in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 24: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said he was studying the current oil price situation and that his government would seriously consider all aspects before deciding on a price hike. 																								While international prices of crude have soared to a 21-year high in recent days, the public sector oil companies have not been allowed to increase the prices of petrol and diesel since January 1. Those of kerosene and LPG have been kept on hold for the last two years. 																								Since crude oil constitutes as much as 90 per cent of the cost of production of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene, these oil companies are under increasing financial strain.																								Senior petroleum ministry officials today apprised the minister about the overall situation. The need to rationalise the tax structure on petro goods in order to provide some cushion to the oil companies also came up for discussion. The excise and customs duties levied on an ad valorem basis are extremely high and go up further with the increase in prices. This brings the oil companies under further pressure. 																								However, there is some hope that international prices could come down as the G-7 countries are putting pressure on the Opec cartel to increase output. The issue was discussed by these leading economic nations at a high-level meeting today as well. Opec has been told that rising energy prices could trigger a world-wide recession. 																								The next Opec meeting is scheduled for June 3 where the 11-member cartel will take a decision on increasing output. Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer, has already agreed to an increase in output. However, time is running out and the Indian oil companies are heading towards a crisis situation as 70 per cent of the countrys crude requirement has to be imported.

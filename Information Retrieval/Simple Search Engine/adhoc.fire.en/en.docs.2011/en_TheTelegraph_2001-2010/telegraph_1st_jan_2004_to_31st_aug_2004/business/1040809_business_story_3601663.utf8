 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Centre reboots e-governance, quietly
 M. RAJENDRANReddy (top) amp; Naidu: Two faces of e-bliss 																								New Delhi, Aug. 8: The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government remains firmly committed to the e-governance initiative but does not plan to build any hype around it as Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh and the previous BJP-led government at the Centre did. Naidus successor, Y. S. Rajshekhar Reddy, does not quite share his vision. 																								Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran has indicated to the core team responsible for monitoring and implementing the e-governance initiative in the department of information technology that the government will push ahead with the programme.																								E-governance is the use of information and communications technologies to improve the efficiency, convenience, accessibility and transparency in the government.																								The UPA government has justified its approach by raising the budgetary allocation for e-governance to Rs 193 crore in the budget for 2004-05 from Rs 40 crore in 2003-04 under the NDA government.																								Department of information technology joint secretary R. Chandrashekar said, Definitely, every government lays out its priorities and these are made known to the people. E-governance is a dominant part in the common minimum programme (CMP) of the UPA government and a massive initiative will be undertaken, particularly in the areas of concerns to the common man. The priorities for promotion of e-governance have been set by the new government.																								Oracles e-governance centre head Jaijit Bhattacharya said, It seems that they may take it on to a higher platform. We feel that explicitly there is no drastic change in course. It will take some time to factor in if there is a significant change in the policy. We feel there is more focus on e-governance from the speeches of the communications and IT minister. 																								The enhancement in the budget indicates a need for significant funding that would be required to achieve the desired results. It is also indicative that funding will not be a constraint for e-governance.																								Chandrashekar said the department of information technology budget for e-governance is only for certain aspects and not the total allocation by the government. There is a significantly larger allocation in the budget of other ministries too for e-governance.																								Funding is important for e-governance. Without it, there will not be continuity and low shelf line for missions and project. There is need for adequate government funding, said Bhattacharya.																								According to the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the state and central governments together spent more than $950 million in 2002-03 and are expected to spend more than $5-6 billion in 2007-08.																								However, there is a growing disparity among state governments and also within the departments over the pace of progress made towards e-governance. The first report on e-readiness assessment brought out by the department of IT in 2003 showed a major disparity among states and the government departments.																								While a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and Tamil Nadu had scored more than eight on a scale of 10, Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh on an average scored less than five. Bengal does not figure in the first 10 states that have reached a critical 30 per cent e-governance.																								Chandrashekar said a lot of effort is required to create awareness to make people, who run the state governments and departments, understand the purpose of this transition and accept it.																								Maran said, We cannot and will not force the states to implement e-governance. It is an effort that they will have to take on their own.																								Vakul Sharma, an expert on Cyber Law and e-governance, said, In India, the concept of e-governance has more to do with facilitation rather than regulation. It is remarkable that the initial forays are more rural-centric than urban-centric.

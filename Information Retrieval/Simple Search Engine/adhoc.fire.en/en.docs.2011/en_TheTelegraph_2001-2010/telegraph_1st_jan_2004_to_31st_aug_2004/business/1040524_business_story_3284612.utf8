 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Tatas put water business on fast track
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 23: The Tata group is focusing on water management as its new business area. Jamshedpur Utility and Services Company (Jusco), set up to provide various services to Jamshedpur, is now looking at other cities to spread its operations.																								The expertise gained by Jusco in providing municipal services, including water management, has made the Tatas confident of providing the same quality of service elsewhere. They feel that services such as water management could turn into a lucrative business proposition with a huge potential.																								According to B. Muthuraman, managing director, Tata Iron and Steel Company, while Jusco will venture to other cities, the company will support businesses that are not core to its steel operations.																								Jusco was floated as a subsidiary of Tata Steel to take over activities which were not core to the steel business. It was created to handle various services which were delivered by the town division of Tata Steel and it began by supplying water and power to the entire township that came under the Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee.																								Sources said since Juscos core competence lies in such activities, it is now in a position to provide quality services at lower costs. This is expected to see the company attaining success as it spreads its wings to the rest of the country.																								While water management is a big business overseas, it is seen as having a huge potential here on expectations that this service will be privatised in other parts of the country as well.																								Tata Steel recently reported record profits, boosted by firm steel prices and a strong product mix. 																								Even as the steel business is expected to do well this year on the back of a good demand in the domestic market, company analysts are optimistic on a new line of business.																								Sources said its investments in Indian Steel Wire Products (ISWP) are now bearing fruits and the plant has already reached rated capacity.

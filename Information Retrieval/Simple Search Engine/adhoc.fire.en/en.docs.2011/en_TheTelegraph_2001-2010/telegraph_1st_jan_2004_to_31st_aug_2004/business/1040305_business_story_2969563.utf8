 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Reserves estimate casts a shadow
 ANIEK PAULCalcutta, March 4: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) says in its offer document that it may have to recalculate its oil and gas reserves if it has to comply with the evaluation standards of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US.																								In some cases, the variance could be significant, ONGC said, cautioning investors that if the change is significant, it would affect the companys financial performance.																								ONGCs estimates of its crude oil and natural gas reserves are based on the standards laid down by the Society of Petroleum Engineers  commonly referred to as SPE International Standards.																								Though SPE standards are quite widely used to evaluate petroleum reserves, SEC standards are somewhat more restrictive as ONGC puts it.																								ONGC says its proved crude oil reserves were estimated to be 3,979.4 million barrels, while its natural gas reserves were calculated at 463 billion cubic metres as of March 31, 2003. The estimates include its interests in overseas blocks.																								The disclosure casts a shadow on ONGCs public issue of 14.25 crore that opens tomorrow, especially after the shocking Royal Dutch/Shell announcement in January that it had overstated its reserves by 20 per cent. The announcement triggered probes into reserve estimates of various oil firms, some by the SEC.

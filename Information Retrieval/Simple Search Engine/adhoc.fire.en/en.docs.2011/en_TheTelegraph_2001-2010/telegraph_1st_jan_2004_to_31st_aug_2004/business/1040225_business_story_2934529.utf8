 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, Feb. 24: Standard Chartered Mutual Fund today launched an initial public offer (IPO) for its Grindlays Government Securities Fund. The scheme will target provident funds.																								This follows the government move to allow 70 per cent incremental accretions in provident funds to be invested in special mutual funds that buy 100 per cent government securities. The issue will be open till March 17.																								Managing director Naval Bir Kumar said, We expect to buy government securities at slightly higher yields in March.																								Standard Chartered said the provident fund plan carries a feature called defined maturity date which would allow PF fund managers to predefine a date for automatic redemption of their units and allow better planning of their cash flows. Provident funds will get the advantage of investing in an open-ended fund along with a predefined maturity date of their choice.																								For some time now, mutual funds have been positioning themselves to become key players in managing pension funds, highlighting their cost benefits. They also have an extensive distribution network.																								Mutual fund players have also been stressing that they can cater to the needs of investors through a variety of schemes.																								Standard Chartered Mutual Fund, which is focussed on the debt market, currently manages assets worth more than Rs 8,000 crore. It is credited with being the first to introduce a short-term fund, a dynamic bond fund and a medium-term fund in the domestic mutual fund industry.

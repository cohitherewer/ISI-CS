 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Oil India eyes BPCL stake in Numaligarh
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, July 14: A fresh tussle has broken out over Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) with Oil India Ltd (OIL) wanting to buy out the majority stake of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL).																								A high-level meeting was held in the petroleum ministry earlier this week with senior officials of both the companies to thrash out the issues involved. Currently, BPCL holds an over 60 per cent stake in NRL, while OIL has a 26 per cent share.																								Petroleum ministry sources disclose that BPCL does not want to relinquish control over the refinery. NRL is currently facing a marketing problem and there is a clear advantage in BPCL controlling the company with its strong chain of nationwide retail outlets.																								There is a glut of petroleum products in the northeast and the marketing network is in any case dominated by Indian Oil Corporation which prefers to lift products from its own refineries in Assam. NRL is, therefore, critically dependent on BPCL to sell its products. 																								BPCL evacuates NRL products by rail to the north and eastern parts of the country where it has a strong marketing network. Senior officials feel that if the BPCL link is broken, NRL would virtually collapse as it would lose this preferred access to the formers retail outlets.																								OIL, on its part, is keen to follow in the footsteps of ONGC and become an integrated oil company with a presence in downstream marketing and the refining segment as well.																								Assam MPs had backed the proposal of OIL taking over NRL during the Vajpayee regime as BPCL figured high on disinvestment minister Arun Shouries privatisation list.																								With a private company taking over BPCL, the fate of NRL would have become uncertain. Since a private company guided purely by the profit motive would not be sufficiently interested in running NRL due to its poor location, handing over the refinery to OIL would have made good sense.																								Since the new UPA government has clearly stated that the public sector oil companies will not be privatised, the earlier danger to NRL has ceased to exist. 																								Another case for OIL taking over NRL was based on combining all the refineries in the eastern region into one company and clubbing them with OIL, which had assured supplies of crude oil. 																								However, now 1.5 million tonnes of crude oil is being sent from the eastern offshore Ravva oilfields to Assam and some imported crude is also being reverse pumped from Barauni to make up the shortage. As a result, these refineries have adequate crude but are facing a marketing problem due to lack of demand in the northeast. 																								In such a scenario, downstream marketing company BPCL clearly has a stronger case than upstream oil exploration company OIL, an official said.

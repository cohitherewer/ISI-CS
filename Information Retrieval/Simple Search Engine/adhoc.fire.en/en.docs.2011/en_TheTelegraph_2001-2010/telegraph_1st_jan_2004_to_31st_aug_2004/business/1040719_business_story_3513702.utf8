 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Birlas load legal gun, Lodhas silent
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 18: Kumar Mangalam Birla and S. K. Birla are finalising strategies to counter R. S. Lodha, who has so far given little indication of how and where he will move to have Priyamvada Birlas will  and his ticket to a Rs 5000-crore bequest  probated. S. K. Birla is talking to Kumar Mangalam in Mumbai on ways to keep Lodha off the assets that Priyamvada purportedly passed on to him, Birla family sources said.																								Members of the Birla clan who have united against Lodha will meet tomorrow to take stock of the situation and prepare for the legal skirmish likely to begin this week. S. K. Birla could not be reached at his residence. His family said he was out of station.																								The Lodhas were silent, but sources close to the camp said: They are not in a hurry. They want to remain silent and keep themselves out of media glare.																								Aditya Lodha, R. S. Lodhas son, would not comment. He did not say when the family would go ahead to probate the will or if it is still open to a settlement. Senior officials of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm for the Lodhas, said: We will not say where and when our client will move for probating the will.																								For the moment, its over to Tuesday, when the Lodhas are expected to file the application to have the will authenticated and directors gather for a key board meeting of MP Birla group flagship Birla Corporation.																								In another group company, Birla Ericsson, Lodha amp; Co has opted out as auditors. Clark, Gardner, Wolf amp; Co will take its place. The move is being seen as an attempt by the Lodhas to take the top spot at the optic-fibre maker, which will hold its annual general meeting on Tuesday in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.																								The Lodhas decision to leave Birla Ericsson was drafted before the demise of Priyamvada. Auditors say the exit could be an attempt by the Lodhas to stave off the conflict of interest that may arise from being an auditor and, possibly, the head of the management. 																								Belonging to a different Birla group, Grasim, however, has retained the Lodha firm as its auditor. Industry circles say it is difficult to sack or discontinue auditors as the law is in their favour.																								Corporate watchers question if a resolution can be moved to make Lodha the chairman of Birla Ericsson even before the assets actually pass on to him. At the Birla Corporation meeting, the issue will be whether Lodha, its co-chairman, will be able to preside over the meeting or managing director K.C. Mittal will play the master of ceremonies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Stocks retrace path to peak
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 9: Stocks soared and then sagged in a roller-coaster session that was overrun by profit-hunters who cut short what would have been a scorcher.																								The tame finish masked two big events: the fact that the BSE sensex hit its highest-ever point ever, and the announcement of better-than-expected Infosys results.																								The 30-share index opened at 6211.06, and surged to 6249.60  the highest since it tested 6,150.69 in February 2000  in response to the sweeping tax cuts announced on Thursday by finance minister Jaswant Singh. It gyrated in a range of 152 points in todays trading.																								The index ran out of steam as profit-booking forced it to end at 6,112.32 points, up 0.18 per cent over Thursday. The final tally, still a record close, takes to 5 per cent the gains that the barometer has made this month. It had shot up a staggering 73 per cent last year. On NSE, the nifty closed 0.17 per cent higher at 1,971.90, after crossing the magical 2000 mark earlier in the day. 																								State Bank carried the day, vaulting when other market favourites like Reliance fell sharply to profit hunters. It towered like a Colossus, surging Rs 18.75 to Rs 640.80; Reliance lost Rs 13.55 to end the day at Rs 575.90.																								There were concrete gains for shares of cement companies, which firmed up on a reduction in customs duty to 15 per cent from 25 per cent. Analysts said overheads on account of coal, believed to be in the region of 15 per cent, will help cement makers slash costs. Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd and Grasim Industries sizzled. 																								However, the likes of Tata Steel, Hindalco, Hindustan Zinc lost heavily on fears that the cut in import customs would leave them with little room for price hikes. On Dalal Street, losers outpaced gainers by two to one amid 26.6 crore shares changing hands, up from 24.7 crore on Thursday. In the A group, 108 stocks, including 19 from the index, suffered losses; 89 closed with gains. State Bank was the chart-topper with turnover of Rs 295.45 crore. It was followed by Reliance with Rs 278.69 crore.

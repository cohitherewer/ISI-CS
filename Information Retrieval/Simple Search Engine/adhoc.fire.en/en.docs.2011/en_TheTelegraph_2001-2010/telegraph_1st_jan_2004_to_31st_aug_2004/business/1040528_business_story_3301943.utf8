 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Power act to be reviewed
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, May 27: The Electricity Act 2003, which had set June 10, 2004 as the date for unbundling of state electricity boards (SEBs), has been put on the backburner. The Congress party buckled under pressure from the Left parties to include the review of the electricity act in the Common Minimum Programme (CMP).																								It is not clear when the state electricity boards will be unbundled. Sources in the power ministry said that a deadline cannot be set as it is not clear whether the SEBs will be unbundled at all. 																								Unbundling of the state electricity boards would have resulted in the creation of three companies looking after generation, distribution and transmission.																								The CMP states, The review of the Electricity Act 2003 will be undertaken in view of the concerns expressed by a number of states. The mandatory date  June 10, 2004  for unbundling and replacing the state electricity boards will be extended. The UPA government also reiterates its commitment to an increased role for private generation of power and more importantly power distribution.																								The UPA governments decision to review the act has upset private as well as public sector power companies, but they were guarded in their comments. 																								Independent Power Producers Association of India president Harry Dahul said, It is difficult for a programme or policy that benefits only a few to become operational. However, the extension of date for unbundling is nothing but a reflection of inertia, laziness and trying to stick to status quo by a few under the garb of larger consumer and workers interests.																								I think six months or one year is a reasonable time for the unbundling process to begin. If the states want more time it should not be a problem. But how many years they want need to be spelt out, he added. 																								PowerGrid CMD R. P. Singh said, The proposal to review the act will not impact us in a major way. The company was recovering the outstanding dues at 96 per cent before the electricity act came into effect and currently recovering at 98 per cent. This will give further opportunity to the policy makers, stakeholders and the public to reconsider the issue on which there were a few heartburn.																								A Tata Power official said, It is a set back for the reform process. But, we should look at the brighter side. It gives us one more opportunity for correcting any mistakes that would jeopardise power reforms in the country.

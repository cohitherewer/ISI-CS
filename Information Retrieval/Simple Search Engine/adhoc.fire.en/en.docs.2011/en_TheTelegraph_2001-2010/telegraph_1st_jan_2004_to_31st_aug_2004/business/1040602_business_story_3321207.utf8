 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 FIIs help in turnaround
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 1: Stock markets today staged a smart rally with Sebi figures showing foreign institutional investors (FIIs) as net buyers for two successive days.																								The BSE 30-share sensex opened sharply higher at 4792.01 points and touched an intra-day high of 4899.53 before closing at 4835.12 compared with Mondays close of 4759.62, a net gain of 75.50 points. 																								Theres some churning in FII investment portfolios, said Navin Roy, a dealer at Taib Securities, a leading FII brokerage.																								But the rise came amidst low volumes and stocks closed well below the intra-day average prices that they touched today, Roy added.																								In sharp contrast to the recent downtrend, 25 of the 30 index-based shares registered gains. These included heavyweights like Reliance, Infosys, Tata Motors, ITC, Hero Honda, Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL), Grasim, ICICI Bank, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Maruti Udyog, Tata Steel, Ranbaxy and State Bank.																								FIIs picked up shares worth Rs 189 crore on Friday and the trend continued with a small accretion on Monday when they bought an additional Rs 21.30 crore worth of shares.																								Market analysts, however, term the rally as a technical bounce aided considerably by reports of good all-round numbers from the automobile sector.																								Among the public sector companies that gained considerable ground were petroleum sector shares like HPCL, Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil Corporation, IBP and Gail.																								Due to the upward correction, the BSE-PSU index rose sharply by 74.45 points or 2.56 per cent to close at 2978.11 from 2903.66. 																								The volume of business was relatively low at Rs 1,825.89 crore, down from Rs 2,033.16 crore yesterday. Tata Motors was the top-traded share with the highest turnover of Rs 189.58 crore followed by Maruti Udyog at Rs 169.92 crore.																								In the specified group, 146 scrips, including 25 index-based shares, registered sharp to moderate gains, while 49 others finished with losses.																								Infosys Technologies firmed up by Rs 78.20 to Rs 5,287.10, Reliance by Rs 3.65 to Rs 434.15, Maruti Udyog by Rs 15.40 to Rs 402.10, HPCL by Rs 20.15 to Rs 320.80, Grasim by Rs 52.20 to Rs 1,100.80, Tata Motors by Rs 27.90 to Rs 394.45 and ITC by Rs 22.65 to Rs 901.60.																								Among the losers were housing finance major HDFC that dropped Rs 19.75 to Rs 559.10 and Bharat Heavy Electricals fell Rs 10.10 to Rs 425.00.

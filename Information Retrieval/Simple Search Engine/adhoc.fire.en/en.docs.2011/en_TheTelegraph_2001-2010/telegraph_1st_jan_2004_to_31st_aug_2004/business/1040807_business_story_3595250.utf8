 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: The bad news is that inflation will rise further  and the villain of the piece has been the two rounds of fuel price increases.																								The inflation numbers have factored in the first round of price increases on June 15, but not the second on July 31. Next weeks wholesale price index (WPI) figures will capture the second round of fuel price increases, which is expected to stoke inflationary pressures.																								The price of petrol has risen by over Rs 3 per litre, while diesel has become dearer by Rs 2.48 per litre in the two rounds of hikes. The price of LPG had also been raised by Rs 20 per cylinder. 																								The oil companies were forced to go in for the hike as the cost of the Indian basket of crude imports has gone up from $33 per barrel in June to $37 per barrel at the end of July. International crude prices for Indian purchases have gone up further in August to over $38 per barrel.																								Oil companies claim that the entire burden has not been passed on to the consumer as the new government policy does not permit them to an increase of more than 10 per cent of the long-term mean.																								Given the political imperatives of the government, it will be difficult to go in for another hike immediately.																								The increase in the price of diesel will have a cascading effect as freight rates for transporting goods such as vegetables and fruits will go up, making these essential goods more expensive.																								The cash-starved state road transport corporations will also come under further strain and may have to increase fares. The railways, a major buyer of diesel, will also be hit by the price hike.																								Demand for diesel has also gone up for irrigation purposes due to the weak monsoon and farmers will have to face increased hardship.																								The strong US and Chinese demand for oil together with fears of supply disruptions due to terrorist strikes in West Asia, have created a demand-supply imbalance that has fuelled the price rise.																								The biggest Russian company, Yukos, is also facing financial trouble, which could force it to cut exports. Speculators out to make a fast buck are adding to the volatility by playing on the fears of buyers. Petrol is no longer the rich mans fuel as it is widely used even by two-wheeler and small-car owners. 																								Rising international crude prices spell trouble for the Indian oil companies as they have to sell LPG and kerosene at subsidised rates.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Mahindras set sights on Daewoo engine unit
																								New Delhi, March 4 (PTI): Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M), the utility-vehicles major, today evinced interest in acquiring the engine and transmission facilities of Daewoo Motors India Ltd (DMIL) at its Surajpur plant. This announcement comes close on the heels of General Motors planning to buy the car-assembly unit of Daewoo.																								We are open to the acquisition of the engine and transmission units of DMIL, M amp;M managing director Anand Mahindra said.																								The move follows Wednesdays announcement by General Motors, the worlds biggest car maker, to begin due diligence immediately for buying the car-assembly unit at the Surajpur (Uttar Pradesh) facility of DMIL. GM had made an offer to the creditors of DMIL  ICICI Bank, IDBI and Exim Bank  for the unit.																								Apart from M amp;M, Tata Motors is also believed to be interested in Daewoos engine and transmission units.																								This acquisition makes sense for an auto-maker like M amp;M as setting up such an unit afresh would be an expensive, time-consuming and cumbersome process, industry analysts said.																								Talking about the Daewoo deal, General Motors vice-president P. Balendran said, We have only made an offer to the creditors of the Surajpur plant to buy the car-assembly unit to which they have agreed. The due-diligence process will begin immediately followed by a definite agreement. Only after the due-diligence process is over, we can talk about the quantum of transaction, whether it is going to be an all-cash deal or if there is a need for an FIPB approval.																								Earlier, M amp;M had also expressed interests to set up an assembly unit in Indonesia to tap the burgeoning utility-vehicles (UV) market there as UV sales constitute 80 per cent of the total automobile sales in that country. For its Indonesian assembly line, the company is contemplating assembly of fully-built units.

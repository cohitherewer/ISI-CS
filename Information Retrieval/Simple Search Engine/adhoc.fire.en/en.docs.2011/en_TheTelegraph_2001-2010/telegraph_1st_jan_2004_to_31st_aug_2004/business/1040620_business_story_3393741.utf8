 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 IDBI sweetener for tea units
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, June 19: Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has restructured tea loans worth nearly Rs 150 crore to provide relief to the industry, which had undergone rough times in the last four years.																								The financial institution (FI) is upbeat that the industry will turn around this year following a renewed interest from Russia and Pakistans willingness to import more tea.																								Pakistan has recently slashed the import duty and sales tax on Indian tea. India expects to export 25 million kgs of tea to the neighbour.																								We are ready to invest in the tea sector provided it turns around. The industry is showing some initial signs of recovery. We think that it will make a comeback in the current fiscal, said a senior IDBI official.																								Apart from restructuring loans, the financial institution has converted the interest accrued from the tea companies into principal. The amount will be treated as additional loans for the tea sector. We have restructured the loans according to a package declared by the Indian Banks Association, said the official.																								Others who have restructured tea loans include United Bank of India, Uco Bank, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda.																								The official, however, accepted that the pace of industrial development in Bengal is slow compared with other states.																								In the last few months, IDBI has received proposals from Berger Paints, Texmaco, Balrampur Chini Mills, Champdany Jute and Hindustan Seals for corporate loans ranging between Rs 15 crore and Rs 60 crore. The FI has given an in-principle approval to these loans.																								On investment in iron and steel industry in Bengal, the IDBI official said, We have invested in this industry, but it is showing signs of saturation. At the moment, we may not go in for this sector. For the time being, we are watching how the sector develops.																								In the engineering sector, Structures India Limited has approached IDBI for some financial assistance and the FI is currently weighing its proposal.																								In the power sector, IDBI has not yet received any major proposal from the eastern region.																								Meanwhile, some companies from the east that have gone to the corporate debt restructuring cell of IDBI include Kitply, Dipak Industries and Duncans Industries.

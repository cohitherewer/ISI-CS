 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Vedanta picks up 51% in Zambian firm
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 20: Vedanta Resources plc, the holding company for Sterlite Industries, has decided to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Zambias Konkola Copper Mines plc for $48.2 million in cash.																								Copper makers like Sterlite and Hindalco are acquiring captive copper mines to neutralise the runaway rise in the prices of the non-ferrous commodity.																								The agreement was conditional on Zambia Copper Investments Ltds sharholders nod and was expected to be completed by October 2004, Sterlite informed the stock exchanges.																								Sterlite said of the total payment, $27.3 million is payable on completion. The company said the new opportunities arising out of its Zambian acquisition will allow the group to improve operational efficiency and enhance returns.																								The company said it is expected to enhance earnings in the first full year of ownership.																								It is a good acquisition for Sterlite. It is difficult to source copper concentrates and it is always prudent to have captive mines, an analyst tracking the sector said.																								Vedanta chief executive Anil Agarwal said, We have been negotiating with the Konkola Copper Mines shareholders and the Zambian government for a considerable time and I am delighted that we have been able to structure a deal that benefits all parties.																								The outlook for copper demand remains positive over the medium term and Zambia is one of the great copper areas of the world. Our immediate task will be to stabilise the existing assets and enhance production, he said.																								Konkola Copper Mines is currently 58 per cent owned by Zambia Copper Investments and 42 per cent by ZCCM Investments Holdings plc. Vedanta has the right to exit Konkola Copper Mines at any time after December 31, 2007, subject to a 12-month notice period, the release said.																								Last year, Hindalco acquired copper mines in Mt Gordon at Queensland and Nifty Mines in western Australia. 																								Analysts say a manufacturer garners profit from treatment and refining charges (TCRC) of copper cathodes. TCRC has been on a downhill for some time due to industry consolidation and voluntary cutback by miners in 2002 and serious setbacks at some of the largest copper mines in the world in 2003.																								TCRC have hit a historic low despite rising global prices. It is partly attributed to the rise in global sea freight charges and an appreciating rupee.

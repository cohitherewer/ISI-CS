 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Yahoo pares Google stake
																								New York, Aug. 28 (AP): Yahoo Inc said today it sold $191 million in Google Inc stock in that companys initial public offering, cashing out some of the 2.7 million shares Google gave Yahoo this month to settle two disputes.																								Yahoo sold 2.3 million of the Class A shares last week at $82.62 apiece. Google shares began trading on August 19, following its IPO.																								Yahoo spokesman Ruben Osorio wasnt willing to immediately comment on the stock sale. Google spokesman David Krane declined to comment.																								In exchange for giving Yahoo 2.7 million shares on August 9, Google got a perpetual licence to Yahoos patent on matching online advertisements to web-search results. 																								Yahoo, of Sunnyvale, California, also agreed to drop another dispute over warrants to purchase shares that Google granted it under a partnership signed in 2000.																								The stock of the Mountain View, California-based internet search engine finished at $106.15 on Friday, down $1.76, or 1.6 per cent, on Nasdaq.																								Yahoo also converted 1.1 million Class B common shares into a like amount of Class A stock, leaving Yahoo with 1.48 million Class A shares. Yahoo holds Class B stock, which has greater voting power, because it was an early investor in Google. Yahoo disclosed the information in a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

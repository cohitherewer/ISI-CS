 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 OVL eyes Cairn pie in Bangla field
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, June 22: ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of the oil and gas major, is in talks to acquire Cairn Energys stake in Bangladeshs Sangu gas field.																								The acquisition will help ONGC Videsh (OVL) set foot in gas-rich Bangladesh, a country ONGC has been trying to enter for a long time.																								Sources said Cairn Energy wants to dilute its holding in most of the oil and gas blocks in South Asia, including India.																								Apart from the Sangu block, OVL is also interested in other blocks in Bangladesh and is in touch with Petrobangla and the government there, they added.																								OVL, which has set an ambitious target of investing $1 billion every year in overseas projects, is ready to invest more in Bangladesh because of its proximity to India as well as its rich reserves.																								Talks are on at the diplomatic level to allow ONGC to bring gas from Tripura to Bengal by laying a pipeline through Bangladesh.																								OVL had registered a 1400 per cent topline growth at Rs 3,502 crore and a 626 per cent rise in bottomline at Rs 428.53 crore in 2003-04. The company is also eyeing acquisitions in West Africa, CIS and Latin America.																								This year, the company plans to invest around Rs 7,500 crore to acquire overseas projects. Last year, it had just chipped in Rs 1300 crore for such buyouts. OVLs total investment till date stands at Rs 9,690 crore.																								OVL is also eyeing a 15 per cent growth in total volume of production in various overseas projects. This year, the company plans to produce at least 3,00,000 barrels a day compared with last years 2,60,000 barrels a day.																								Sources said the production in overseas projects would be more than 500,000 barrels a day during the next financial year with several new acquisitions under way.																								The company has acquired an oil block in Angola where production is expected to commence sometime in 2006. Sources said the Angola crude is of a very high standard and it is expected to generate good demand both in India and abroad.

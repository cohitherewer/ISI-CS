 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 US chamber report busts job-loss claim
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 10: At a time when outsourcing of jobs to India has become a hugely contentious election issue in the US, a report prepared by the US Chamber of Commerce busts several myths and says that tens of millions of jobs are directly and indirectly created by foreign investment through insourcing.																								Terming it as one of the best kept secrets in the outsourcing debate, the report says insourcing  all the service work that foreign companies and countries hire Americans to do  illustrates the enormous stake Americans have in keeping our markets open and free.																								The report says 170 Indian IT companies have created 60,000 American jobs  and thats just the tip of the iceberg. Foreign direct investment in the US doubled in 2002 and 2003. It now exceeds $487 billion and supports 6.4 million jobs in the US, the report says.																								It said in 2003, the US enjoyed a surplus in service trade of nearly $60 billion, suggesting that America gained more from open trade in services than other countries.																								India has been facing a backlash in the US because of three million American job losses for rendering business process outsourcing (BPO) services.																								As the debate over trade, jobs and the sourcing of work overseas has unfolded, we are struck by how infrequently solid facts have been brought into the discussion, says Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce in its report Jobs, trade, sourcing and the future of American workforce.																								The report attempts to lay out in a logical fashion what we know and dont know about the extent of and reasons for the recent US job losses, as well as the links between employment, trade and worldwide sourcing.																								The chamber said increases in productivity, recent economic downturn, domestic business impediments and continued uncertainty are the primary reasons for job losses and slow pace of hiring in the US. It is not the movement of work offshore, it argued.																								Second, even with job losses in manufacturing and some service occupations, more Americans are working today than at anytime in history. More than half-a-million payroll jobs have been created so far this year.																								Third, even the experts dont know precisely how many US jobs have been or will be sourced overseas. Yet, under any estimate or forecast, these jobs amount to a small fraction of our nations 138 million workforce, the report said.																								Fourth, more white-collar office work is shipped from other countries to the US than our country ships overseas.																								Fifth, the report states that in spite of media reports and political rhetoric, the nations knowledge workers have not lost significant job opportunities to foreign competitors. The unemployment rate among Americans with a four-year college degree is just 2.9 per cent.																								Sixth, recent extension of worldwide sourcing from manufacturing to white-collar IT jobs do not threaten Americas technological leadership  yet serious slippage in education and broadband application does.																								Seventh, the report said, By 2010, we will not have shortage of jobs, but rather shortage of workers.																								The US must expand the pool of available workers through education, training, immigration and flexible workplaces in order to generate sufficient economic growth and the necessary tax base to support the coming avalanche of retirees.																								Eighth, to create jobs  it is critical that America remains open to the worldwide economy  where 95 per cent of our potential customers live. Isolationist measures designed to restrict trade and punish companies for sourcing must be defeated. The US should instead open markets and enforce trade agreements, improve the skills of its workforce and expand the labour pool, the report added.

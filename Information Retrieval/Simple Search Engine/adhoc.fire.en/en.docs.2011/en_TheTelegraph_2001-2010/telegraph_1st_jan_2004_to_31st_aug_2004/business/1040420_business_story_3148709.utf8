 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 19: The surging rupee against the dollar has helped lower production costs of automakers which have higher import percentage, said analysts and carmakers.																								Analysts also said a stronger rupee favours automakers who import some or all their models as fully-built units and augurs well for those who are planning to introduce one.																								The rupee rose 5.2 per cent against the dollar last year on steady trade remittances and record foreign investments. Moreover, robust inflows from foreign funds towards their bids at recent public offerings of state-run firms have helped the rupee appreciate against the dollar.																								Maruti Udyog Ltd managing director Jagdish Khattar said although an appreciating rupee lowers the import bill but then the realisation from exports also goes down.																								In a way, it evens out, Khattar added.																								While some models are imported as fully-built units, the majority has an indigenous per cent ranging from as low as 25 per cent  like Ford Indias Endeavour sports utility model  to a high of 95 per cent for Wagon R and Santro hatchbacks. 																								An appreciating rupee does lower the import bill of automakers which in some cases are pretty high, said Icra managing director P. K. Choudhury.																								Among the models, currently imported as a fully-built unit are  Toyota Motors luxury sedan Camry, Marutis Vitara sports utility vehicle, and General Motors Opel Vectra.

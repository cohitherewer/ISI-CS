The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Its boom time for value investors
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, May 11: The tumbling markets could have sent investors scurrying for cover, but it has also opened up a window of opportunity for bottom-fishing, say analysts. 																								The volatility in the market provides an ideal situation for buyers to scoop up shares of fundamentally strong companies at cheap prices as these are not going to be affected by the political uncertainties and the changing global scenario.																								Although there was selling across the board today, we have purchased some stocks where we found the valuations attractive, said Ajay Bagga, CEO, Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund. Investors may look at FMCG, consumer durables and pharmaceuticals as sectors that have held value in the carnage. Export-earning companies should also do well riding on the strengthening rupee. Thus, infotech stocks could be an attractive option, but one should stay with the forerunners of the industry. However, it would be prudent to stay away from bank and PSU stocks since they would be the first ones to be hit if there is a change in the government. 																								Although metals and cement stocks have taken a hit because of the impending slowdown in the Chinese economy, infrastructure development in India should make these stocks an attractive option, Bagga said. 																								A change in the government cannot stop the reforms process, said Chandravadan Desai of CD Equisearch. The fundamentals of the economy will remain intact and going forward, improve. It is a good time to buy into sectors like steel, cement, pharmaceuticals, power and auto ancillaries as they will continue to do well despite any change in the government or other global factors, he added.																								In such a market, value investing should be the investment style, mirroring the Warren Buffett approach. A value investor looks at stocks whose prices are low for their companies intrinsic worth, determined by the fundamentals of the company. The demand-supply intricacies and the behaviour of the stock market as a whole is not a factor for the value investors, they hunt for opportunities to pick up shares at low levels.

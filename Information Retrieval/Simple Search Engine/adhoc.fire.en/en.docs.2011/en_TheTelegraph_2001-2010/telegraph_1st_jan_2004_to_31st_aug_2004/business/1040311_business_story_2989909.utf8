 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Petronet offer at Rs 15
																								New Delhi, March 10 (PTI): Petronet LNG will raise Rs 391 crore through its initial public offering (IPO) of 260 million shares with the offer price being fixed at Rs 15 per share. The IPO, which closed on Monday, was oversubscribed 4.2 times.																								About 79 per cent of the bids were received at the higher-end of the Rs 13-15 price band and so the bookrunners of the issue have decided to fix the offer price at Rs 15, a source said.																								More than seven lakh applications were received by March 9, the issue-closing date, with the retail portion being oversubscribed 10.5 times.																								Petroleum minister Ram Naik said, It (the successful IPO) is another feather in the oil sectors cap. I am indeed very happy that a start-up company has received such an overwhelming response.																								The success of the Petronet issue also inspires confidence in LNG as a fuel to meet our energy needs. It is also an indication of the countrys entry into the 21st century, when gas will be the prime mover, he added.

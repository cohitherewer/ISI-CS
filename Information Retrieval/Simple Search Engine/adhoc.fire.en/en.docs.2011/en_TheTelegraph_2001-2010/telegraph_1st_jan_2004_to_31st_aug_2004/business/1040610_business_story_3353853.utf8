 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 BPO boom cries for core elements
 B. R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, June 9: The men driving the booming IT-enabled services (ITeS) and business process outsourcing (BPO) firms today said Indias biggest sunrise industry was under the cloud of a creaky infrastructure.																								If our BPO centres cannot be accessed by good roads and do not have regular power supply, you are hitting at the root of success we intend to achieve, Infosys CEO Nandan Nilekani said at the ITeS-BPO Strategy Summit, a two-day conference organised by Nasscom. The industry has set a revenue target of $5.1 billion for the current financial year, an increase of 40 per cent over last years levels. 																								Association president Kiran Karnik underscored the need for laws and policies governing data/cyber security and intellectual property rights (IPRs). The industry and the government will have to work for a sound legal framework that enforces cyber and patent laws.																								The summit also focused on human resources, voicing concern over the high rate of attrition, up-front investment in training and the growing cost of infrastructure. The industry, government and academia have to pool in their resources to produce thousands of ITeS-BPO-oriented students, Nilekani said.																								Cost pressures and growing competitiveness are driving global firms to look at offshore outsourcing as a strategic alternative. The local talent pool, economies of scale, wage arbitrage and higher profit margins are making global firms choose the Advantage India option, Karnik said.

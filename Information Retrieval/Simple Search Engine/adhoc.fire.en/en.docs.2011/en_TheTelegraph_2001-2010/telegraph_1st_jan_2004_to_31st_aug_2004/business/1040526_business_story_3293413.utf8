 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Raha keeps MRPL merger option open
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Raha: Oil clear?																								Mumbai, May 25: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is exploring the possibility of merging Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) with itself. However, chairman Subir Raha said the corporation has yet to take a final view on the merger. 																								We are weighing various options and are yet to take a final view on this, Raha told reporters at a press conference called to announce the companys results for 2003-04. 																								The company has posted a net profit of Rs 459 crore in the reporting year against a net loss of Rs 412 crore in 2002-03.																								While outlining the business plans, Raha said in the current financial year both ONGC and MRPL may set up five retail outlets. Both the companies are in the process of evolving a brand equity, following which the outlets would be rolled out.																								There are also plans to operate MRPLs refineries at higher capacities through de-bottlenecking. 																								While ONGC has obtained permission to set up 1,100 outlets, MRPL has been allowed to set up 500 outlets in the country. Senior officials said that both the companies would maintain separate identity similar to the arrangement between Indian Oil Corporation and IBP. 																								Projecting a possible shakeout on the retail front in the next three to four years, Raha said that ambitious projects, such as the Golden Quadrilateral, would augment the retail demand for petro products. Therefore, even as there is a case for building new outlets, companies need to create a brand appeal among the customers.																								In the fourth quarter, MRPL has reported a net profit of Rs 551.15 crore compared with a loss of Rs 80.34 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. 																								Net sales jumped to Rs 3,635.50 crore in the period under review against Rs 2,049.60 crore year-on-year.

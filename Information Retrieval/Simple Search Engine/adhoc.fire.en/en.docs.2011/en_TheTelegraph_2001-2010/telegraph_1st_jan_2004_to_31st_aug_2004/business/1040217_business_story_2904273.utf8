 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Trai watch on group plans
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The telecom regulator will review the corporate and family tariff schemes being offered by some operators. The tariff plans offer free or lower call rates within the group. 																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will examine whether differential tariff for calls within the network should be treated as discriminatory. It will also examine whether closed-user-group (CUG) and virtual-private-network (VPN) tariff schemes should be disallowed as it involves differential call charges and thus, amounts to discrimination.																								Trai has decided to carry out a consultation on the issue and has circulated a paper that will determine whether certain terms and conditions need to be prescribed by it to ensure that these schemes are not misused.																								Comments on the consultation paper dealing with application of principle of non-discrimination in tariff schemes like CUG, VPN, F amp;F (friends amp; family) will be received till March 5.																								The development of technologies, reduction in the cost of providing telecom services and escalation of competition in the market have all resulted in telecom service providers offering various innovative tariff schemes.																								The regulator has noticed that the tariff under some schemes under the nomenclature of CUG, VPN has in-built features to provide free/concessional calls within the group. 																								A senior Trai official said, This feature appears to infringe upon the principle of non-discrimination, which has repeatedly been enunciated by the regulator. There is also a view that, tariff concessions applicable to CUG/VPN subscribers of one network cannot be extended to subscribers of another network by virtue of the definition of CUG/VPN. 																								The regulator is worried whether such tariff plans would amount to dilution of the principle of non-discrimination emphasised by it.																								Considering the fact that services such as CUG/VPN have been found to satisfy legitimate interests of various organisations in the past, it was felt necessary to issue a consultation paper to elicit the views of various stakeholders, said Trai release.

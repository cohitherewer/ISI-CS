 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Hong Kong gets a Classic sparkle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Shining moment 																								Mumbai, Aug. 17: Classic Diamonds (India) Ltd will set up a retail diamond jewellery outlet in Hong Kong.																								This follows the trend of Indian companies looking at retailing overseas to capitalise on the potential in the emerging markets. Classic Diamonds plans to open a chain of 24 exclusive retail stores worldwide in the next three years.																								Classic Diamonds, a large diamond manufacturer and exporter, said it would open its first international retail diamond jewellery store in Hong Kong under its flagship brand Classic Jewels by March 2005.																								The store will be located in Hong Kongs high street area called Mong Kok, catering to the rich and famous.																								Managing director Kumar Bhansali said, There has been a shift in the clientele of diamond jewellery. Previously, it was targeted at the older affluent class. Today, manufacturers are targeting a much younger audience between the age group of 25 and 35 years. It is positioned as a fashion accessory rather than a piece of ornament or as an investment avenue. The availability of affordable diamond jewellery is contributing to this growth.																								The Southeast Asian market has been exhibiting healthy growth trends in the retail jewellery segment and according to industry estimates, the market is estimated at $25 billion.																								Director Nirav Bhansali said the company was committed to take the Classic Jewels brand to the global retail market. 																								The US, European and Japanese markets have traditionally been the major buyers of Indian diamond jewellery. Globally, the industry potential is estimated at $60 billion, he added.																								We believe Southeast Asia has an immense potential. The retail store in Hong Kong is the first in a chain of stores that we have planned to increase our international presence, said Nirav Bhansali. 																								Apart from the overseas foray, Classic Diamonds is also looking at the expanding domestic retail market. The company has opened retail stores in Gurgaon and Chennai, in addition to existing ones in Hyderabad and Bangalore. The new stores are being set up with an outlay of Rs 40 crore.																								Classic Diamonds has an annual turnover exceeding $150 million and a profit of over $6 million. The company is a sightholder with Diamond Trading Corporation (DTC), enabling it to procure raw materials timely at the most competitive prices.																								From a diamond manufacturing and export house in the 70s, the company is now a leading integrated diamond and jewellery manufacturer. It processes more than 125,000 stones everyday.

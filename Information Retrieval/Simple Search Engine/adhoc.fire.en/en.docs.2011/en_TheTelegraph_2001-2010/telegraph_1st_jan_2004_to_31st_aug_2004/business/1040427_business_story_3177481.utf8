 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Ministry spat rocks ship hiring
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, April 26: A turf war has broken out between the petroleum ministry and the shipping ministry. Senior petroleum ministry officials are of the view that the shipping ministry is trying to encroach into their territory.																								The shipping ministry triggered the war by seeking a meeting with the petroleum ministry to draw up an offshore policy for oil exploration. Sources say the petroleum ministry officials have very clearly told their counterparts in the shipping ministry that according to the rules of business drawn up by the government, all matters related to oil exploration and production are to be handled by the petroleum ministry.																								The shipping ministry, on the other hand, is trying to bring ONGCs offshore operations under the ambit of the cabotage law that governs the countrys coastal shipping. According to this law, Indian vessels have to get preference in all coastal shipping operations. The shipping ministrys contention is that ONGC must give preference to Indian vessels while hiring rigs and offshore supply vessels for its offshore operations.																								The petroleum ministry has expressed the view that ONGC has entered into deep-sea exploration for which the latest world-class technology is required. The rigs required for these operations have been hired through the international bidding route and this technology is not available with Indian companies at all.																								The oil ministrys stand is that unless the domestic companies meet the technical specifications required for the job, hiring them would spell disaster for the oil hunt. Senior ONGC officials were also present at the meeting to explain the issue in greater detail.																								The Comptroller and Auditor Generals latest report on the Essar and Oil India Ltds (OIL) case is cited as another example of how hiring a rig from an Indian company led to disastrous results. Although Essar did not have the capability for offshore drilling, it managed to get its rig hired by OIL and took huge amounts of money in advance but could not accomplish the task. To complicate matters further, Essar has filed a court case against OIL causing a further loss of valuable corporate time, which could be devoted to getting on with the task of discovering oil.																								Such lessons cannot be ignored by the public sector oil majors when conducting business in the future, a senior petroleum ministry told The Telegraph.																								He further said, While there may be a case for hiring Indian offshore supply vessels, ONGCs past experience with private domestic companies has not been very good. 																								The private companies took soft loans from ONGC to buy the rigs and charged huge amounts as hiring charges and became owners of these vessels within five years. ONGC, on the other hand, had to continue to pay exorbitant amounts for hiring the vessels.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 India Inc suffers Sasser sting silently
 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Breaking in 																								New Delhi, May 5: The Sasser virus  a deadly bug unleashed worldwide over the weekend  has wrecked havoc for India Inc though no one wants to admit it.																								The virus, which coils itself around the Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems, has hit banks, telecom firms, oil companies and a large swathe of manufacturing companies, say e-security firms like Symantec who have received frantic calls to help them deal with the snowballing crisis. 																								Vishal Bindra of ACPL Systems, a partner of Trend Micro in India, which is one of the leading e-security firms, says, There have been more than 100 calls each day from the customers during the last few days. Today, we had more than 250 calls. The first complaint was received on Saturday from a major corporate and it is rising. We cannot divulge the names of our customers but not many corporates have survived this attack. 																								There are more than 11 million installed computers and over 30,000 servers in India. With most of the PCs using the Microsoft software for computer operating systems, the virus is likely to spread further and cause more damage, unless the users follow the instruction and install the software patches. 																								The Sasser virus  which has four variants  has affected home users as well.																								However, Kiran Karnik, president of Nasscom, said, We have not heard anything serious. The calls to anti virus companies in India (which is about 100-250 per day) is much less than in other virus attacks. I have not checked on the latest.																								Interestingly, the Indian computers emergency response team (Cert-In), which keeps track of viruses and rates the risks, has rated W32 Sassar worm in the medium-risk category. However, TrendMicro has put it in the high-risk category.																								Industry observers said Sasser virus is the fastest written Windows worm (17 days) beating the previously written Blaster worm that attacked computers on August 11 last year, using a vulnerability revealed 25 days before it launched its attack.																								Microsoft revealed a total of 20 software bugs in a bulletin issued on April 13 and the first version of Sasser appeared on April 30. The corporates had failed to heed these warnings, including our attempts to educate them about installing the patches long before the virus attacks. Most of these patches are made available for a nominal cost and a few were also given free, said a senior executive with HCL Comnet Systems amp; Services,another partner with Trend Micro in India. 																								However, customers using the open source software like Linux have not been affected. 																								A senior executive of Symantec said, Most of the companies at their customer interface departments by choice have opted for open source software. This has helped them to save their customers from the virus attacks. ATMs will function normally, pumps will provide the petrol and calls can be made and received without any problem. quot;																								Bindra said, Those who have installed the patches from Microsoft have not been affected. Unlike attacks by earlier worms, most of the corporates have been caught off-guard due to their policy of not pre-empting attacks with the installation of patches.																								More than 85 per cent of the corporates have not undertaken pre-emptive patching. Microsoft has released patches, but if the scanning and cleaning tool does not work for you, IT experts suggest use of one of the free worm-removal tools available on the antivirus software vendors websites of Computer Associates, F-secure, Network Associates, Norman, Panda, Sophos, Symantec and Trend Micro.

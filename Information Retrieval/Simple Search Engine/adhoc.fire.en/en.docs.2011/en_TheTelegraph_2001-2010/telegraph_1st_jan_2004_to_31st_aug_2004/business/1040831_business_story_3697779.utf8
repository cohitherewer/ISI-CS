 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 30: Medicine Shoppe India, the largest retail pharmacy chain in the country and the Indian arm of the US-based Medicine Shoppe International, is implementing a Rs 50-crore expansion programme to become a 500-outlet retail chain by 2009. This year, the company would double the number of retail outlets from 57 to 100-plus by March 2005. 																								Organised pharma retail is fairly new in India and the prospects are promising, said Rick Clark, director, international operations of Medicine Shoppe International. The funds for expansion will come from Medicine Shoppe and the new franchisees, he added.																								Medicine Shoppe would constantly help the Indian initiative through marketing support, international collaborations, training, business strategy inputs and exchanges of executives for exposure of work practices and culture, he added. 																								Among Medicine Shoppes chains of international businesses, India ranks number three after Canada and Taiwan. We expect the Indian operations to grow at a faster rate compared with other regions in the coming years, Clark said. 																								Medicine Shoppe India is an associate of Medicine Shoppe International Inc, which is an arm of $50-billion US healthcare giant, Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health was ranked 17th on the Fortune 500 list in 2004 and was named as one of the best US company by Forbes magazine for 2004.																								Medicine Shoppe, a pioneer in the concept of community pharmacists, aims to provide value-added marketing and delivery services to its customers. Medicine Shoppe India is the first to bring these services to the country. 																								Over a period of time, we have endeavoured to add to the basket of services offered to our customers in India and adapt the same to domestic conditions, says Viraj Gandhi, managing director, Medicine Shoppe India.																								The company has expanded the basket of its value-added services by tying up with Oriental Insurance Company to offer free Mediclaim to Medicine Shoppe customers. 																								Now with every purchase of Rs 5000 worth of products from a Medicine Shoppe pharmacy a customer will get a Mediclaim policy worth Rs 5000. It does not specify any time-frame.																								The initiative follows the success of Medicine Shoppes first free personal accident insurance offer, where the company has issued policies worth more than Rs 16 crore in the last 18 months. 																								With Mediclaim, we hope to make a stronger dent in the market. We also hope that more people become aware of this policy, said V. . Bhargava, regional manager, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd.

 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Big Four accused of helping clients fudge
 In the glare 																								New York, Aug. 27 (Reuters): The Big Four accounting firms wrongly let some corporate clients understate liabilities and distort their financial health in their 2003 accounts, the regulatory body for auditors said in a report.																								The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), in its first-ever examination of the audit industry, said the Big Four accounting firms had misinterpreted a nine-year-old rule. It also found they had failed to spot other problems in 2003 client audits.																								The problems included inadequate documentation, mistaken calculation of common stock and deferred taxes and underestimation of some contingent liabilities.																								The PCAOB, created two years ago to tighten governance of the industry after several accounting scandals rocked Corporate America, assessed audits by KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst amp; Young and Deloitte amp; Touche.																								The group, appointed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, has the power to regulate and discipline US audit firms.																								The regulator, which examined policies, practices and procedures in auditing clients books, found the firms allowed clients to incorrectly classify some debt as a long-term liability.																								By not properly classifying the debt, companies understated current liabilities and overstated working capital, distorting the financial position of the company to look stronger than it should have. The guideline, set in place nine years ago, relates to revolving lines of credit agreements under which a companys balances are classified as current liabilities if the agreement contains certain clauses.																								In several cases, the PCAOB staff asked the audit firms to convince their clients to restate financial statements during the inspection. PCAOB did not name the audit firms or their clients.																								The US audit industry came under harsh scrutiny after auditor Arthur Andersen collapsed when it was discovered Anderson did little to stop accounting fraud at bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. 																								The PCAOB, headed by William McDonough, a former chief of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has sought to impose more accountability on the industry.

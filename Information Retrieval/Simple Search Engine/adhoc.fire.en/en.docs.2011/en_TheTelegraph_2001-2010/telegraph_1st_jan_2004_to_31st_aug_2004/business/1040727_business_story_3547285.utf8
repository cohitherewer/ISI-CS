 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 26: The Oriental Bank of Commerce-Global Trust Bank merger is seen as a win-win deal for the Delhi-based public-sector bank, which has overnight gained a formidable presence in the south and west  regions where it is yet to make deep inroads. Analysts say the fact that both banks have the same technology configuration makes the amalgamation easier. Oriental has also promised to take all GTB employees.																								We will have to ascertain the cost-benefit equation from the amalgamation before we take a call on just how attractive the new OBC share will be, said Jignesh Shah of Ask Raymond James, a Mumbai stock consultant.																								The costs of merging a bank that suffers a negative networth with a healthy one like OBC, has to be calculated. 																								OBC has, over the years, built up a reputation for being an efficiently run bank with high employee productivity, a low cost-to-asset ratio and most important, zero non-performing loans on its balance sheet. It is the only public sector bank to have made full provisions for its portfolio of non-performing assets.																								After the initial confusion over the way it would be asked to take over Global Trust, the Oriental Bank of Commerce share bounced from its intra-day low of Rs 247.25 to hit a high of Rs 283 before closing at Rs 267.20 on BSE. This is an increase of 1.65 per cent over its previous close. The rally followed a Reserve Bank statement that the GTB takeover would involve no share swap. 																								On Dalal Street, over 39 lakh OBC shares were traded. Investors began to realise that the merger with GTB would give it a presence in the south faster than it could have hoped for if it had continued to grow in an organic way, an analyst said. 																								Analysts also say OBC, whose capital adequacy ratio is at a comfortable level, will not have to dilute its equity for snapping up Global Trust.																								OBC is a mid-sized public sector bank and does not have as many branches or employees as its larger peers. The bank lends heavily to the farm sector in the north, which includes money invested in agro-based industries. In recent times, it has turned to retail loans, a shift that will be hastened after it brings GTB  also known for large bets in this segment  into its fold.

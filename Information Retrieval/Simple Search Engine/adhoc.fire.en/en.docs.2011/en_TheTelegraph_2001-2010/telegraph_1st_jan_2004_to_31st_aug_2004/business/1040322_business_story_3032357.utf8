 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 CAs not to follow US standards
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, March 21: Indian accountants will not kow-tow to the US: they are sticking to their principle-based approach to accounting standards.																								Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has said they intend to stick to the principle-based approach rather than switch over to the rule-based approach that the US follows under its Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).																								Explaining the difference between the two approaches, a senior ICAI official said in a rule-based approach, the rule is spelt out in black-and-white and that has to be followed, whereas in a principle-based approach, it is the abiding principle or the rationale that is important.																								The US GAAP follows a cookbook approach  providing auditors with a comprehensive checklist of rules to follow. The International Accounting Standards (IAS)  the global standard fashioned by Europe that will become mandatory for all publicly traded European Union companies from January 1, 2005  is based on general principles, compelling auditors to enforce the spirit of the law and not just the letter.																								Indians have preferred to go the European way rather than adopt the US accounting standards even though more and more companies across the world are choosing to report their accounts using US GAAP, which is mandatory if they seek listing on the American bourses.																								The disenchantment with US GAAP comes after a string of accounting scandals in the US, especially the Enron debacle.																								According to experts, under the IAS, Enron auditors would have looked not just at the numbers but also quizzed the management about why it had shunted assets and liabilities off its balancesheet and then made their own assumptions about what was actually going on.																								Rule-based accounting standards are prone to misuse. This has been amply demonstrated in the events of corporate wrongdoing such as Enron that shook the US in recent years. A principle-based approach is much better, said ICAI technical director Avinash Chander.																								European countries have been following the principle-based approach even before scams hit the US corporate world, particularly Enron. However, after Enron, not only various countries, but the US has also started a process of collaboration with the IAS on several spheres, even though they will retain their separate accounting standards, said Chander.																								ICAI has recently revised the preface to the statements of accounting standards after a gap of 25 years. The institute has taken this as an opportunity to highlight in the preface itself that India will stick to the principle-based approach which it has been following and sees no reason to change.																								Rahul Roy, partner in S. R. Batliboy amp; Co (Indian partner of Ernst amp; Young), said, The IAS is undergoing major improvements, which are becoming more important the world over than the US GAAP with which it is at considerable variance.

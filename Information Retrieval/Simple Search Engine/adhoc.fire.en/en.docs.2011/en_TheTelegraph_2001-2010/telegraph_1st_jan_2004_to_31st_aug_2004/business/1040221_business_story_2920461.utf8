 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 20: The IPCL book-built issue panned out just the way others have over the past few months: they were sell-outs within the space of a few hours. This has fired hopes that other offers will be lapped up just as quickly.																								Two premier stock exchanges, NSE and BSE, reported over subscription of 56 lakh shares on the first day itself, a trend that many say started with Maruti, and continued with TV Today and Patni Computers.																								Under book building, qualified institutional investors  for whom the government has tentatively set aside 50 per cent of the public issue in the six offers ready to hit the market  can bid without paying the price up-front.																								This is going to be the story in the coming days, said Ashok Kumar of Lotus Strategic Consultants. Like IPCL, five other companies in which the government plans to sell its equity, will also open in style  get more orders than shares up for sale, on day one.																								While an overwhelming number of bids for IPCL poured in at the floor price of Rs 170, analysts expect buyers to quote higher in the days ahead; institutions could be ready to shell out between Rs 175 and Rs 185 each. 																								One can safely read from the trend seen today that all public issues this season will be oversubscribed, Kumar said. Prominent BSE broker Ramesh Damani felt that with primary markets giving the public offers such a strong reception, the secondary segment will also look up.																								Attention is now riveted on retail investors, who will make up their minds, and bids, in the last few days of the issue. IPCLs oversubscription was attributed to a good mix of interest from foreign and local institutions, says S. Ramesh, head of Kotak Investment Banking, one of the lead book-runners to the issue.																								The institutions  defined qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) in market parlance  can revise bids till the issue closes. This allows them to improvise till the last day, gauging the market response and reworking the quantities and prices at which they have bid. Individuals, who are required to lace their bids with cheques, have not been extended this privilege.																								The government has, for the first time, offered small investors a 5 per cent discount (on the cut-off price) on the IPCL shares it intends to offload in the market.

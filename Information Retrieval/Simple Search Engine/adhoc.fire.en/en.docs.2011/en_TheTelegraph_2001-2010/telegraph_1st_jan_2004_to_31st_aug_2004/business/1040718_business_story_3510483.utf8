 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Monsoon clouds gather over growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Chidambaram: Looking for the silver lining																								New Delhi, July 17: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said a delayed monsoon could impact economic growth but in the same breath added that 6.2-7.4 per cent growth rate could still be achieved.																								The finance minister said, I cannot comment on monsoon as it is not under my control. I pray for rains and I request you to pray also... A GDP growth of 6.2-7.4 per cent has been projected by economic think tanks. Even this will be quite high on the back of an 8.2 per cent growth attained last fiscal. 																								The finance minister was speaking at an investor camp, organised by a business television channel. The minister dwelled on several important economic issues, including the budget, fiscal deficit and disinvestment.																								Speaking about this years budget, the finance minister said, The United Progressive Alliance) has a complex electoral mandate, a mandate for the agriculture and rural sector. The mandate is also to continue reforms to make the Indian economy stronger, competitive and to take on the world.																								It is my duty as the finance minister of India to interpret the mandate and fulfil it, Chidambaram said.																								He said that the budget took into account needs of the poor, children who drop out of schools, senior citizens and, above all, farmers. 																								Chidambaram also said the government was committed to bringing down fiscal deficit to a manageable level of 1.5 per cent of the GDP and wiping out revenue deficit by 2008. This means, there should be greater tax compliance... If compliance improves, income tax rates could be brought down, he said.																								On the contentious issue of divestment, the finance minister said, As long as public sector units continue to make profits, they should be left undisturbed.																								The minister said an overwhelming majority of the Indian population do not believe in deconstructing public sector undertakings.																								The common minimum programme (CMP) binds me to classify PSUs in three categories  navaratna, profit-making and chronically-sick  and each category will be dealt in a different manner, Chidambaram said.

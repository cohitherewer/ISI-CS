 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Breakeven hopes drive Daimler
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, May 7: The local unit of DaimlerChrysler today said it will break even within the next two to three years. The company expects a 20 per cent rise in sales in 2003-04.																								We are no longer a sick company, Suhas Kadlaskar, finance director at DaimlerChryslers Indian unit, told newspersons adding the carmaker would wipe out its cumulative losses of Rs 280 crore in three to five years.																								DaimlerChrysler India Pvt Ltd, which assembles the C, E and S-class Mercedes Benz sedans at its plant in Pune, said revenues would rise to Rs 500 crore against last years sales of Rs 434 crore.																								It sold 1,518 cars in 2003, and expects to sell around 1,800 units this year.																								Kadlaskar said profits before tax for the fiscal ended March 2004, would remain flat at last years level of Rs 34 crore but would still be the fourth straight year in the black.																								In 2002, DaimlerChrysler India, however, had clocked higher profits of Rs 39 crore against Rs 29 crore a year earlier. The firm also exported auto parts worth 72 million in 2003, up from 63 million in 2002 and expects this to rise to 80 million in 2004.																								Kadlaskar said the carmaker was also carrying out trials of an over 40-tonne multi-axle truck in the country along with jeeps and buses. We would take a decision on launching both jeeps and buses this year once the feasibility study is over, he said adding the automaker would first launch trucks and then buses.																								The automaker today held a news conference to announce the completion of the trial-run of C-class Mercedes Benz sedan, which has been powered by bio-diesel fuel developed from the extracts of Jatropha plant.																								The project, initiated last year in partnership with state-owned Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the German Hohenheim University, has been able to produce bio-diesel of Euro-III specifications.																								CSIR officials said the institution is holding talks with several automakers, including Tata Motors and petroleum companies, to create models where production and use gets integrated.																								We would be forging partnerships, said R. A. Mashelkar, director general of CSIR. We did write to half a dozen firms and most of them had expressed interest, he added.																								P. K. Ghosh, director of Central Salt amp; Marine Chemicals Research Institute, said commercial production of the fuel is expected to commence within five years. 																								We are entering the next part of the project where our challenges would be to develop a viable, self-sustainable model for commercial production.																								Our challenge is to scale up the production process and be able to sell bio-diesel at the same price of diesel, he said. We need to optimise the process and plan carefully. We would brainstorm on these areas.

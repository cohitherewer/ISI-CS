 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Handset makers to follow China model
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Aug. 5: The Manufacturing Committee will meet IT minister Dayanidhi Maran tomorrow to put forward its observations on the Chinese handset makers.																								The delegation had visited China last year to observe the handset manufacturing industry there and replicate its success in India.																								The committee comprises members of various representative bodies like ICA, Mait, Elcina, ABTO, COAI and company heads of handset vendors like Nokia and Samsung. 																								We will convey our observations to the IT minister and discuss ways to promote manufacturing of mobile handsets, accessories and components in the country, said committee chairman and ICA president Pankaj Mohindroo.																								Maran had identified manufacturing as one of the focus areas in the 10-point agenda.																								The outcome of the meeting will decide the future agenda, said Mohindroo. The proposal to set up a National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council will help in formulating plans.																								The domestic handset industry is estimated at Rs 6,500 crore, but is expected to double by the year-end.																								The committee is also awaiting the position paper being prepared by KPMG, which was appointed to assess the feasibility and competitive advantage of manufacturing in the country. The consultant is expected to present its study in October.																								Mohindroo said 300 million cellphone users in China were the driving force for the manufacturing industry.																								The first step will be to initiate growth in the 20-million Indian handset market and take it to 300 million through a planned strategy, said Mohindroo. The service providers and handset vendors have to come together to make this happen.																								Currently, China has more than 25 per cent share of the global handset manufacturing industry. Last year, 158 million handsets were produced, a 48 per cent rise over the previous year. Sales stood at 151 million handsets, a 42 per cent growth over the year-ago period.																								There are around 40 manufactures in China and the strategy is to source designs, chips and components from different members. Moreover, the manufacturers target the high- and medium-end segments. 																								Mohindroo feels that with a growing market, it will be economical to manufacture mobile handsets and components indigenously.																								Elcoteq, an electronic manufacturing service provider, will set up a production unit in India. The company manufactures telecom equipment and handsets for companies like Nokia and Sony Ericsson. Alcatel is also into talks with Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) to manufacture its handsets. LG and Motorola are also evaluating the prospects of a manufacturing facility.

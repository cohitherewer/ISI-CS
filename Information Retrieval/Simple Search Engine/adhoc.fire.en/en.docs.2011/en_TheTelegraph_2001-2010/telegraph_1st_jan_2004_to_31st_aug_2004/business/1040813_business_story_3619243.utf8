 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Another Tata auto firm on IPO road
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, Aug. 12: The Tata IPO trail is still hot. Before the ink dries on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ticket to the market, another group bellwether, Tata AutoComp Systems, is being primed for a flotation.																								Set up in 1995 as a holding company that makes spares for cars, Tata AutoComp has 12 joint ventures under its fold spread across five strategic business groups. It counts DaimlerChrysler and GM among its top customers. Sources say plans to take it public are prompted by a realisation that the company has attained the size and critical mass where it needs public money for expansion and to achieve greater visibility in the market.																								Officials were not available for comment, but there are signs the flotation could come as early as next quarter.

It is also able to pool resources and capabilities, sharing infrastructure and managerial resources. 																								Taco is already among the top five Indian auto-component manufacturers in spite of the fact that some lines of its business are only five years old. It has grown at a scorching pace of more than 57 per cent over the past five years against the industry average of 12.5 per cent. The firms rise signifies the integration of the Indian automotive components industry with that of global majors.

In addition, they offer services in engineering, supply-chain management and electronics.

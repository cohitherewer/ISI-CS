 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Terex Vectra launches local operations
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 3: Construction equipment maker Terex Vectra  an equal venture firm between US-based Terex Corp and Vectra Ltd UK  today launched its local operations hoping to cash in on Indias booming economy. India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and we see a huge potential for growth with increased focus on infrastructural development like roads, ports and railways, Terex Corp chairman and president Ron Defeo said.																								The firm, which has invested around Rs 52 crore ($12 million) at its plant located on the outskirts of the city, plans to grab around 10 per cent of the market share by 2006, said Defeo. 																								He said the company would manufacture vibratory compactors, midi excavators, vibratory loaders and skid steer. Terex Vectra would compete with the Indian unit of Caterpillar Inc, the worlds biggest maker of construction equipment.																								The UK-based Vectra, floated by a clutch of non-resident Indians, however, also manufactures tipper trucks in association with the Czech Republic-based Tatra A. S. at a manufacturing facility located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu.

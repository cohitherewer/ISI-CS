 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Big Bazaar starts thinking big
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 25: Pantaloon Retail India Ltd today joined hands with Arvind Brands Ltd to retail the Ruf amp; Tuf range of jeans exclusively in Big Bazaar outlets at attractive prices. 																								The Kishore Biyani-owned company has decided to allow private apparel labels in Big Bazaar stores.																								This is the beginning of our efforts and this strategy will step up our apparel sales at Big Bazaar, Biyani said. 																								While the company has focussed on its in-house brands so far, Biyani said by providing fashionable jeans for the masses, Big Bazaar was only abiding by its core principle of giving value-for-money products to the consumer.																								In the next few months, Pantaloon is looking to sell close to 10,000 pieces per month that would translate into a turnover of Rs 30 crore.																								Pantaloon is also considering a business-to-business model that will allow it to sell the Ruf amp; Tuf range to wholesalers and retailers. The company is open to the idea of doing this even at discounted prices, provided the retailers buy larger quantities.																								Biyani said the Ruf amp; Tuf brand will be available to shoppers at Big Bazaar from Rs 299 onwards. Next week, all the Big Bazaar stores in the country would begin retailing this brand, he added.																								Arvind Brands president Darshan Mehta said due to the strategic tie-up, the Ruf amp; Tuf brand would be available to the largely untapped segment of value fashion buyers who look for merchandise at affordable prices.

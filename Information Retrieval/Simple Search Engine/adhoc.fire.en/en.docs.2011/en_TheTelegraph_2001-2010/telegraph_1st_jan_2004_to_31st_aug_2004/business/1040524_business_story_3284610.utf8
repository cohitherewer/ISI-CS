 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 23: IDBI Bank is on the lookout for quality portfolios for enhancing its retail business. Pradeep Patil, country head, retail banking, said, Earlier, we had taken over some portfolios. But now we want to enter the takeover business in a big way. We are open to take over any of the retail portfolios, including housing, personal and consumer durables.																								The total retail asset base of the bank is Rs 3,500 crore and the bank wants it to grow by 40 per cent in the current fiscal.																								The maximum retail growth has come from the housing sector, Patil said. This is the sector which is booming and we want to enhance our exposure in this sector. There are many housing finance companies who are selling their portfolios. We are keen to take them over.																								The bank has decided to expand in the tier-II and tier-III markets like Moradabad, Panipat and Bikaner in the north; Kolhapur and Nashik in the west; Erode, Tirupur, Kakinada and Rajahmundry in the south; and Gangtok and Guwahati in the east. 																								There is a fierce competition in the metros and tier-I cities like Pune and Bangalore. So, we want to expand in tier-III markets where the opportunities are untapped, said Patil.

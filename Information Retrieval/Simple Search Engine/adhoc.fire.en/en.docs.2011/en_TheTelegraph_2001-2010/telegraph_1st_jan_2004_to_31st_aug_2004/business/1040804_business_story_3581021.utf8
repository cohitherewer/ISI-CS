The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Automakers in line of fire
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 3: The rise in hot-rolled coil prices will scorch automobile firms and spare makers. The tinplate and galvanised steel producers will also feel the heat. 																								However, an analyst said the domestic steel companies could no longer afford to delay the increase in prices as the international rates have gone up tremendously over the past few weeks.																								The pipe manufacturers, too, are going to be adversely affected, he added. The automobile manufacturers have already seen a huge rise in input cost due to rising steel prices. However, the huge competition in the auto market at present has prevented them from passing on the price increase to the consumers.																								What is most important is that the long products will also see a huge rise in prices in the next few days. Once that happens, the inflationary level will also rise leading to an overall problem, he said.

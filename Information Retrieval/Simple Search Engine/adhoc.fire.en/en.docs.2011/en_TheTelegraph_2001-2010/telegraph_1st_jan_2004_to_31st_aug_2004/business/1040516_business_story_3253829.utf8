 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 RBI lean season credit policy on schedule
																								May 15 (PTI): The Reserve Bank today said it will go ahead with its lean season credit and monetary policy for this year on May 18 as scheduled, despite the change in the government at the Centre.																								RBI governor Y.V. Reddy will announce the annual policy statement for the year 2004-05 on Tuesday, May 18, 2004, at 11.00 am in Mumbai, a release signed by RBI deputy general manager Ashok Joshi said in New Delhi.																								Usually presented in April, this time the central bank chose to present the lean season policy after the elections. There were apprehensions in financial circles that the policy could be delayed since the new government was not in place. Interest rates																								Adding his voice to the speculation on interest rates, Parkash Singh, United Bank of India chairman and managing director, has said he does not foresee any immediate increase in rates. 																								Interest rate for the time being may not go up, but in the long term if we are to compete globally, interest rates will have to come down, Singh told a banking conclave  Transformation in banking for accelerated Indian economic growth  organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Calcutta.																								He said to bring down interest rate, banks will have to reduce their cost of deposit which would be possible by improving efficiency and productivity and by reducing deposit rates.																								Only those banks, which can reduce cost, will stay in the system otherwise they will have to close or merge with other banks, Singh said. He said there were still some structural rigidity in the system which was preventing the interest rate decline, which in turn was affecting the competitiveness of companies in the global market.

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: Banks are outsourcing the management of their ATM network to reduce operational costs and focus on improving performance in key business areas.																								Diebold Systems, a major player in the ATM (automated teller machine) market, has set up a centre in Mumbai to cater to the day-to-day infrastructure management needs of the machines.																								Managing director Rajiv Singh said, Our managed services will reduce the burden of daily infrastructure management and cut the banks operational costs by 10 to 15 per cent. The services centre manages remote monitoring of ATMs, content delivery, security services, currency management and transaction processing.																								The centre in Mumbai tracks the ATM performance, identifies trends, predicts and manages cash replenishment needs and increases the uptime of the ATM.																								The services are still in initial stages and contributes only 10 per cent to our revenues, said Singh. It is however expected to increase to 25 per cent by next year.																								Diebold is already offering its services to Jammu and Kashmir Bank and UTI Bank.																								The need for outsourcing is evident from the fact that the number of ATMs in the country has increased from 8500 in June last year to over 13,000.																								The domestic ATM industry, estimated at $150 million, is growing at an annualised rate of 35 per cent, said Singh. The penetration is just 13 to a million and there is a major scope for expansion.																								The immense potential of the Indian market has prompted the $2.1-million US company to aggressively focus not only on selling its products but also providing end-to-end services and solutions for its clients.

 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 FDI hike cheers telecom firms
 M. RAJENDRANNew Delhi, July 8: The telecom industry is gung-ho over the decision to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) ceiling from 49 per cent to 74 per cent. If that was the icing on the cake, there were other smaller benefits that left them pretty chuffed with all that they got in the budget.																								There is a tax exemption for telecom companies planning to set up new networks and a revival package for Indian Telephone Industries. There is also an excise duty waiver on capital goods for the manufacture of mobile handsets. Chidmabaram also exempted customs duty on telecom grade optical fibre and mobile switching centres.																								But the real big measure that brought the buzz back in the business was the decision to raise the FDI cap that the telecom majors like Bharti and Hughes have been clamouring for. All of them want to expand their services.																								The smaller players who want to exit the sector have also been waiting for the entry of foreign players, which would help them strike better deals.																								Sunil Bharti Mittal, group chairman, Bharti Group said, This is a path-breaking and well-thought-out budget with an eye on infrastructure development and growth. The increase in FDI will give a major boost to the telecom sector. Telecom is a highly capital-intensive sector and by removing the cap on investment, the finance minister has removed a major hurdle in the expansion of telecom firms. 																								Large funds are required to roll out telecom networks. Companies can now access foreign capital to serve the hinterland, he added.

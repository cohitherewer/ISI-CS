 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Oil premium on Aiyars Opec agenda 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Aiyar: Arguing his case																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will take up with the Opec cartel next month the issue of India and other Asian countries being made to pay $1 per barrel more than the western countries for their crude purchases. 																								India is among the oil importing countries that have been invited for discussions with Opec members at Vienna before they begin talks on new oil production quotas.																								Speaking on the sidelines of the oil industry safety awards function held here today, Aiyar said he would make out a strong case for doing away with this $1 per barrel extra payment, which is currently being passed on as the Asian premium in the international oil market.																								Aiyars predecessor, Ram Naik, had also taken up this issue but the Opec members did not relent. The Gulf countries have tried to explain this extra payment on the ground that the western countries have to pay higher transport costs as they are situated further away and the landed cost of import works out almost same. 																								However, there are few takers for this line of argument and there is more reason to believe that the formidable clout that the western countries, especially the US, enjoy in the world enables them to buy crude at a cheaper price. 																								Aiyar said the government was following a wait-and-watch policy on world crude prices. He said the rates of crude futures were lower than the current two-year high. If future rates are quoted lower, the expectation is that prices will fall to more realistic levels in the coming months, he added.Petrol price																								The government is unlikely to raise prices of petrol and diesel at the next revision due on August 31 despite the surge in crude oil prices.																								At a time when inflation is creeping up to 8 per cent, a responsive government has to give priority to holding the price line, Aiyar said today.

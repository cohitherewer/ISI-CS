Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, May 20: The merger of IDBI Bank with IDBI will be discussed only after October when the latter starts banking operations.																								As of now we are operating as two independent entities. Merger of IDBI Bank with IDBI is one possibility. But nothing has been discussed yet. Maybe after October the boards of both entities might discuss something, said G. V. Nageswara Rao, chief executive officer and managing director of IDBI Bank.																								According to the IDBI repeal bill, the financial institution will become a banking company registered under the Companies Act. The IDBI Act was repealed in the winter session of Parliament to pave way for a smooth transformation of the countrys biggest financial institution into a bank.																								Rao said IDBI will function as a commercial and development bank while IDBI Bank will restrict itself to retail banking. 																								IDBI chairman M. Damodaran had said a couple of months ago that IDBI will become a commercial bank with an aim to raise low-cost funds. A commercial bank accepts deposits, gives business loans and offers related service.																								The bank hopes to achieve a 40 per cent growth over the last year in the current fiscal.																								When asked if the bank has any immediate plans to raise capital for funding the expansion and growth plans and to raise its capital adequacy ratio, he said, We do not have immediate plans to raise tier-I capital. We have recently increased our tier-II capital by Rs 130 crore. The CAR of the bank is 10.4 per cent.																								The bank today launched its first currency chest for the eastern region in the city. This is the second currency chest of the bank which has been opened to support the Reserve Bank of Indias clean currency policy to provide clean notes.																								IDBI Bank has received 28 new licences for opening new branches from the RBI. We will soon have branches in Guwahati, Gangtok and Dhanbad, said Gautam Gan, head for eastern and western regions.

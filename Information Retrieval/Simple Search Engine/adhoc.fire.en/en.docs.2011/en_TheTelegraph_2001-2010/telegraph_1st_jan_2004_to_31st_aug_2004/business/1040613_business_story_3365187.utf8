 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Fed talk fuels rate hike fears
																								Washington, June 12 (Reuters): The Federal Reserve must raise interest rates to protect its key anti-inflation weapon  credibility, top Fed officials said on Friday. 																								Inflation warnings from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and several regional bank heads this week have financial markets braced for the first rate hike in four years when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committees meets June 29-30. 																								The current federal funds rate, at 1 per cent, is too low to be sustainable. Inflation expectations appear reasonably stable right now, but I am concerned about the potential for them to drift up in this environment, Cleveland Fed president Sandra Pianalto told the Pennsylvania Economic Association. 																								Preserving price stability will require the FOMC to increase the federal funds rate. Failure to respond in a timely fashion puts our hard-won credibility at risk, said Pianalto, who is a voting member of the FOMC under this years rotation. 																								But, as Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern  who is not a voter  said on Friday, the central bank doesnt expect to have to institute a string of rapid-fire increases like those that shook markets in 1994. 																								The Fed has said it believes it will be able to raise rates at a measured pace. 																								For me, that means I dont think were going to have to raise interest rates aggressively ... but how things ultimately go are conditioned on what happens (in the economy), Stern said. 																								Behind the curve? 																								Signs that inflation is picking up have some economists doubting that the Fed is behind the curve in raising rates to head off worrying price rises. But officials have in recent days taken pains to reassure investors they are on guard and are ready to act  even aggressively, if needed 																								Greenspan said as much on Tuesday, telling a London audience the Fed would do what is required to keep inflation in check. 																								Atlanta Fed president Jack Guynn sounded a similar warning note on Friday.																								Citing a flurry of recent price rises and the resurgence in some industries of the ability to pass higher prices to consumers, Guynn said: Recent developments on the price front warrant significant attention in our analysis and policy debates. 																								Given the economic growth and rising prices now unfolding, the general direction of our next policy move should be clear  barring any unexpected events, he added. 																								St. Louis Fed president William Poole said on Thursday the Fed may need to raise interest rates more rapidly than the market now expects if inflation accelerates. 																								If it looks like the signal is really there, then my personal position would be that it would be appropriate for the FOMC to move further and faster than priced-in in the market today, said Poole, who has a vote on the FOMC this year.

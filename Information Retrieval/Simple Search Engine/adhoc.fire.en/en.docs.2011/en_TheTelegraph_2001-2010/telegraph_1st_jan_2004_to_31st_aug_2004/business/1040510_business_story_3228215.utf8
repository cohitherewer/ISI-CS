 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Private insurers begin to make a mark in life
 SATISH JOHN Weathering it all 																								Mumbai, May 9: After a sputtering start, private life insurers are notching impressive market-shares as they make their presence felt in the urban centres of the country.																								Three years after life insurance was opened up, private players have more than doubled their share to 17 per cent from 8 per cent in 2002-03. There has been a shift in the perception of private life insurers among the upper and middle classes, says Shivaji Dam, managing director of Om Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance. 																								Most private life insurers have registered a 100 per cent growth in first-premia collections, but analysts point out that the surge has taken place on a very small base, unlike Life Insurance Corporation, the market leader.																								The industrys first-year premia mop-up was Rs 14,600 crore, with LIC still accounting for Rs 12,179 crore (up from Rs 11,242 crore in 2002-03). 																								The private sector is expected to turn in Rs 2400 crore as first-premium income for the year ended March 31, 2004. This will be a growth of 146 per cent, giving them a 17 per cent market share. 																								Private insurance companies have done well by focusing on 30-40 cities, even though they have a small presence elsewhere. They are looking for a second alternative, says Dam. 																								ICICI Prudential Lifes first-premium earnings jumped 106 per cent, HDFC Standard Lifes 76 per cent and Max New York Lifes 122 per cent. 																								HDFC Standard Life CEO Deepak Satwalekar attributed his companys success to bancassurance partners, consolidation in urban areas by increasing sales force of trained financial consultants and introducing new unit-linked insurance and pension solutions.																								Unlike LIC, private insurers have concentrated on increasing the case size. For instance, Om Kotak has an average cash premium of Rs 20,400 per policy, one of the highest in the industry.																								Most insurance players are still consolidating their presence by adding more branches and agents. HDFC Standard Life, for instance, had 17,100 financial consultants compared with 10,500 in 2002-03. It covers 49 cities now. 																								The growth of private insurers may not be a threat to LIC, given that its apparently modest growth is being achieved on a bigger base. But the impact of the smaller players could be sharper and swifter in the coming days.

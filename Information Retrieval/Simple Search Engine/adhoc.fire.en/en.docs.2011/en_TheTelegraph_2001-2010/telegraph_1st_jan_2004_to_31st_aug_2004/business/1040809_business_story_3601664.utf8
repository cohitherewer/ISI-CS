 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 8: The US has emerged as the most preferred destination for Indian exports with an average annual growth rate of around 11 per cent per annum, says the CII.																								In a study conducted on India and the US: economic analysis and trade strategy undertaken by the chamber, exports to the US are shown to have risen steadily since 1993. However, imports from there have only grown at the rate of 6 per cent annually. 																								It is understood that this was largely buoyed by Indias removal of quantitative restrictions in 2000.																								Some of US exports to India over the last 10 years have been attributed to the purchase of high-ticket items like nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances, which were not imported earlier. 																								Last year, while Indias share of exports to the US amounted to $13 billion, US exports for the same period stood at $5 billion.																								The balance of Indo-US trade has continued to remain in Indias favour. This is not surprising given the vast disparity in per capita income between the two countries and their relative capacity to import goods and services, the study said.																								The study also discusses that there is very little diversification of products exported to the US. Gems and Jewellery, textile and clothing products, carpets and rugs are some of the regular items exported. Similarly, the US exports electrical machinery and parts, optical and photographic accessories among other products. 																								This lack of diversification requires immediate attention of both the governments, if exports have to increase significantly,the CII said.

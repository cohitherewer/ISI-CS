				 Easier to borrow abroad

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 
																								Mumbai, Jan. 23: Moodys upgrade of Indias foreign currency rating to investment grade will make it easier for domestic companies to raise money overseas apart from bringing down their cost of borrowings.
																								For India Inc, the move could not have come at a more auspicious time; global interest rates are at attractive levels and the government recently removed restrictions on overseas borrowings. 
																								All this, coupled with the stamp of vibrant economic growth that Moodys on India yesterday, is expected to result in a plethora of overseas fund raising programmes by domestic companies. Current estimates point towards companies raising over $1 billion over the next couple of months to cash in on the favourable conditions.
																								CFOs, who are still smiling over the Moodys decision, feel that flow of money to India will now rapidly increase due to the investment grade status. Banks have a ceiling for sub-investment grade countries. Most of the banks had hit the ceiling. Therefore, the investment grade status will now improve the flow of money to Indian companies, a senior official said.
																								Sushil K. Maroo, vice-president (corporate finance) of Jindal Steel amp; Power (JSPL), which is planning to raise overseas funds through external commercial borrowing to part-finance its 500-mw power plant, also feels that Indian companies will now be in a position to raise funds cheaply by around 20 basis points from their current levels. 
																								The Moodys decision will not only make it easier to raise money, but the cost of borrowings will come down, he added. 
																								The government also welcomed Moodys upgrade saying it would help in reduction of cost of borrowing abroad. Finance minister Jaswant Singh said the upgrade would be beneficial for the economy as corporates can now borrow at lower interest rates. 
																								Its a welcome move. We have been consistently saying that it was utterly conservative to assign our rating as speculative grade, chief economic advisor, Ashok Lahiri said.
																								Industry chambers CII and Ficci said India has crossed a important threshold and there were possibilities of further improvement in rating.
																								Others felt that the impact will be much more and that it could even result in more foreign funds into India. Moodys had yesterday raised Indias long term foreign currency rating to investment grade Baa3 from speculative grade Ba1.

 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 ERA scouts for partners to build roads
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 18: The Delhi-based ERA Constructions (India) Limited (ECIL) is eyeing highway projects at the state and national levels and is in advanced stages of negotiations for a strategic partner.																								Director A. K. Mehta said, As we have no experience in building roads, we are negotiating a strategic partnership with an experienced player, he said.																								ECIL is in talks with an Indian, a Korean and a Malaysian firm for the partnership.																								A deal is expected to be finalised by December, said Mehta. We plan to bid for a Rs 100-crore project in the next financial year.																								ECIL has bagged a Rs 30-crore contract to construct an integrated cargo complex for the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.																								We will be responsible for the civil, electrical and electronic works of the complex. According to the agreement, construction has to start within 30 days of receiving the contract and completed by 18 months, said Mehta.																								In the year ended March 2004, ECIL achieved a turnover of Rs 109.5 crore and had an order book position of Rs 450 crore.																								This year, we expect to achieve a turnover of Rs 150 crore, said Mehta. We have set a target of Rs 200 crore for 2004-05 and Rs 275 crore for 2006-07.																								If the company starts working on highway projects, an additional Rs 75 crore would come in 2005-06 and go up to Rs 125 crore in 2006-07, he added.																								The company sees a major growth potential in urban infrastructure projects.																								Currently, 90 per cent of its turnover is accounted for by PSUs and central government bodies like National Thermal Power Corporation, NHPC, Power Grid Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation and CPWD.

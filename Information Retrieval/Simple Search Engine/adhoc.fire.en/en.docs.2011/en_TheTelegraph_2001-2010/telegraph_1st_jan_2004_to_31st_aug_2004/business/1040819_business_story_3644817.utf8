 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 EIH finds more room for management deals
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From right) EIH chairman P. R. S Oberoi, deputy managing director Arjun Oberoi and managing director S. S. Mukherjee in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 18: EIH plans to grow by taking up management contracts and picking up small stakes in hotels, both in India and abroad. 																								The company is scouting for properties in West Asia, Thailand and Asia Pacific, including China, to be run on contract.																								Ruling out acquisition as a growth tool, chairman P. R. S Oberoi said: The company will pursue an active growth strategy by taking up management contracts in India and abroad. It will continue to strengthen its marketing efforts across the globe to optimise brand recall.																								The EIH group is not keen on greenfield properties in India too. We do not have any immediate plans. We are carrying out a survey in Bangalore and Mysore. If there is a demand for more hotels, we can think of setting up a new property, said S. S. Mukherjee, managing director of EIH.																								The company has also put on hold its plans to set up hotels in Morocco and Casablanca.																								Internationally, none of the big names in the industry own any hotel. Most are run on management contracts, Oberoi said.																								The Oberois have tied up with Hilton International to co-brand its Trident Hotels in India. The alliance brings together the international brand equity and worldwide marketing resources of the Hilton group and EIHs expertise as an owner and operator of international hotels.																								Trident Hotels, whose tariffs are 50 per cent lower than the Oberoi hotels, are enjoying 80 per cent occupancy, Oberoi said.																								EIH is also trying to reduce the cost of funds. The companys debt burden is around Rs 842 crore, while its cost of funds is 7.5 per cent. 																								We need to reduce it by at least one and a half percentage point. Many options are being worked out, including debt swap through replacement of high-cost borrowing by low-cost borrowing, Mukherjee added.																								Addressing shareholders of the company, Oberoi said: Last few years have been the most challenging for the travel and tourism industry world-wide. Weakening economies, depressed capital markets, the unfortunate events of 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the SARS epidemic hit travel by leisure and corporate travellers.																								During this period, the situation in India was further affected by tension on the India-Pakistan border, the unrest in Gujarat and travel advisories imposed by many countries in the spring and summer of 2002.																								However, things are looking up, Oberoi said. Sales of EIH have increased 19 per cent till July compared with the same period last year.																								The shareholders of the company today approved all the resolutions, including the induction of Arjun Oberoi and Vikram Oberoi as the deputy managing directors in the company.

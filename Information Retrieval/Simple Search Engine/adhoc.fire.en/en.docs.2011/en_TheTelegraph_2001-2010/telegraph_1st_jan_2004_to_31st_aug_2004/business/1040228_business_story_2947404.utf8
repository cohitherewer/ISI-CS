 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 ADB rupee bonds get a rousing ovation
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 27: Banks, financial institutions and mutual funds have lapped up the countrys first supranational issue  the Rs 500-crore rupee bonds floated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The issue, which closed on Wednesday, was 100 per cent oversubscribed.																								Bond market sources see more such issues coming. Both IFC, Washington, and the World Bank plan to raise around Rs 500 crore each from India through such rupee bonds, a trend that will boost the domestic bond market.																								ADBs rupee bonds represents many firsts in the history of the domestic capital market. It was the first issue by a foreign entity and the first to be rated AAA by Fitch, Moodys and Standard amp; Poors. This is the first time that ADB entered the domestic bond market of a member country.																								The bonds carry a semi-annual coupon of 5.4 per cent to yield 17 basis points over the 10 per cent government security. It will be listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).																								ADB will disburse the funds raised as rupee loans for infrastructure projects in the private sector. Senior ADB officials here said that while the institution had been financing either through debt or equity, proceeds from this issue would only be used for debt financing.																								Liquin Jin, ADB vice-president (operations), said the bond issue has generated a broad participation. Nearly 60 per cent of the issue had been placed with banks, 21 per cent with insurance companies and 19 per cent with mutual funds. 																								Jin did not rule out the possibility of re-entering the domestic bond market with another such issue. However, the institution would first look at the markets needs before taking any such decision, he added.																								The ADB bond issue is a positive signal for the domestic capital market as it has been raised in a borrowing country, said Niall S. K. Booker, chief executive officer of HSBC India, one of the lead arranger to the issue. 																								The other arrangers included ICICI Securities, Bank of India and Union Bank of India.																								Jin said that in 2003, ADBs local currency lending in India stood at Rs 500 crore for three private sector projects in infrastructure, healthcare and housing finance. The institution is already assisting a few power projects.																								We have identified three projects  power transmission (approximately Rs 270 crore), housing finance (Rs 135 crore) and healthcare (Rs 45 crore). Till the disbursements commence the funds will be invested in government papers of up to one year, ADB assistant treasurer Juan Limandibrata said.																								The loan tenure would be in the range of 8-15 years and the spread would be 2-3 per cent over the relevant government paper, he said.																								The first disbursement takes three to six months and the amount would be disbursed over three years, he added.																								The transaction will enable ADB to offer rupee loans for project in need of long-term local currency financing. Such loans would provide the most effective protection against exchange rate risk, as most ADB-financed projects generate revenues in local currency.																								ADB is now toying with the idea of issuing other local currency bonds in China and Thailand. The money raised from Thailand will be used to support its operations in Asia. According to S. Mukherjee, managing director amp; CEO, I-Sec, the ADB issue would lead to the domestic markets attracting top quality issuers.

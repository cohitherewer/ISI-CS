The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Jessop hitched to petro bandwagon for revival
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ruia: Divide and win																								Calcutta, June 28: Jessop amp; Co Ltd is planning to diversify in a bid to turn around in the current fiscal.																								The company has decided to manufacture equipment for the oil and gas sector in a joint venture with an Australian firm.																								Refusing to divulge the name of the foreign partner, Jessop chairman P. K. Ruia said the company would enter into a technical tie-up with a foreign company to make hydrocarbon fabricated products to be used in oil and gas rigs. The venture would be formalised in the next one month, he added.																								Jessop has already entered into a strategic partnership for ship repairing with Ukrainian company Tekhkom. Work for this project would be done on site as well as at the companys Dum Dum plant.																								Ruia noted that a few more joint ventures with global partners are under consideration. Some of these will focus on the existing product line, while others will be in areas of our core competence, he said.																								The company has also planned to reopen the Durgapur unit and make it a specialised centre to roll out world-class wagons.																								The Ruias, who acquired a 72 per cent stake in Jessop, are also willing to snap up the governments remaining 27 per cent stake. We would like to pick up the rest of the shares in the company. We will make a presentation to the government in this regard, Ruia said after the companys annual general meeting here today.																								It was earlier decided that the government may consider selling its stake one year after the divestment, Ruia said. With the one-year period ending on August 29, the Ruias would approach the Centre in this regard. The valuation for the 27 per cent stake would be worked out according to a formula decided earlier, he added. 																								The Ruias, who invested Rs 18 crore in August last year for an acquisition that turned controversial, are targeting a turnover of about Rs 100 crore this year compared with Rs 46.36 crore in the previous fiscal. 																								The company also aims to wipe out its accumulated loss of Rs 122 crore over the next three years, Ruia said. Having clients like the railways, ports, steel makers, hydro-power plants and even Coal India has put it in a position where it can hope to achieve that goal.

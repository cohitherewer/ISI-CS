 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 IndoNext blueprint with BSE 
																								New Delhi, Feb. 15 (PTI): The Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges (FISE) has finalised a roadmap for the much-awaited common trading platform for regional bourses, IndoNext. The federation has submitted the draft to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), which will forward it to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by next week.																								The proposal to increase the liquidity for investors having shares of small and medium firms was sent to BSE on Saturday. The federation has approved the draft proposal, which has been submitted to BSE. Thereafter, BSE and FISE will jointly submit it to Sebi, FISEs outgoing chairman Vijay Bhushan said.																								It is expected that the proposal would be sent to Sebi by next week before the BSE board meeting to be held in the third week of February. 																								He said the regional bourses have unanimously approved the proposal of forming a separate segment under BSE, under the banner IndoNext at a meeting on November 8. The board of directors of BSE has given in-principle approval also.																								The move to form IndoNext is in line with recommendations of the Justice Kania Committee, set up by Sebi in 2001.																								The alliance between BSE and FISE  representing 20 regional stock exchanges, is also intended to revive the regional bourses, most of which were reeling under losses and facing wind-up following tradeless session in the last few years.																								IndoNext will provide a common trading platform to mid-cap firms in BSEs B1 and B2 segments along with those listed exclusively on regional exchanges, Bhushan said.																								BSE will shift all the shares of companies with a capital base of Rs 20 crore to IndoNext. There will be a common settlement (T+2) for IndoNext, which would provide mid-cap shares a better valuation through a national exposure, he said, adding Indonext would assist in market development and once it is achieved, BSE may even come up with a mid-cap index.																								BSE and regional exchanges would ensure that only those companies, which have complied with all the listing agreement criteria, are allowed to be traded under IndoNext.

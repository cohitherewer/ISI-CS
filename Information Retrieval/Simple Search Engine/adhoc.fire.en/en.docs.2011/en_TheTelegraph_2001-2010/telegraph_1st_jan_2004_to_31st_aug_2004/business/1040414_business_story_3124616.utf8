 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Fresh churn in West Coast stake
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 13: CD Equisearch, a Calcutta-based brokerage, and its owner  Chandravadan Desai  have increased their stake in West Coast Paper Mills to over 10 per cent, having recently scooped up one lakh shares from a finance and leasing company.																								West Coast Paper, a Calcutta-based company, is one of the largest integrated paper producers. Promoted by Shree Kumar Bangur and his family, the company had a turnover of Rs 465 crore and earned Rs 36 crore in net revenues in 2002-03.																								Desai has always been keen on holding significant stake in the paper industry, with a holding of 4.29 per cent in Sirpur Paper Mills and around 5 per cent in Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills, amongst others.																								In the last fortnight, there has been a substantial rise in the price of paper pulp. This indicates that the industry is going to do well in the near future, said Desai.																								The price of paper pulp has increased by 30 per cent in the last fortnight, from $490 to $640, which puts pressure on margins for companies in this industry. 																								On expansion plans, Desai said that venturing into a greenfield project is no longer viable as investment in a plant with a capacity of 1 lakh tonne is close to Rs 900 crore. The only way to expand is through de-bottlenecking the existing plants and through acquisitions.																								In such a scenario, a company with an aggressive outlook will surely prove to be a value investment, according to Desai. 																								West Coast Paper Mills recently acquired a 33.85 per cent stake in Rama News Print from ICICI Bank for Rs 39.37 crore. The deal was followed by a cash offer for 20 per cent in the company and the transfer of management to West Coast.																								Last fiscal, the company also invested a considerable sum in expanding its existing operations. The companys existing plants are located in Mysore and Dandeli, both in Karnataka. 																								The scrips 52-week high stands at Rs 256, ranging around Rs 244 in the month of October. The share price dropped in November, again to peak to Rs 238 in December. Although the share has been declining since, it started gaining in the last three weeks. 																								The share closed at Rs 194 today, a gain of Rs 40 from Rs 155 in March.

 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Bima Nivesh in a new avatar
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 15: The Life Insurance Corporation of India is reviving Bima Nivesh, its blockbuster offer, in response to the market demand for single premium product.																								Called the Bima Nivesh 2004 (Table No. 166), LIC will introduce the revised version of Bima Nivesh as an investment-oriented insurance plan on Monday.																								The plan would be available for fixed term of five and 10 years under the single-premium mode of payment. The minimum sum assured offered is Rs 25,000, an LIC release said here today.																								The guaranteed additions at the rate of Rs 40 per Rs 1,000 per annum would be payable under the five-year plan and Rs 45 per Rs 1,000 per annum under the 10-year plan, it said.																								There is no upper limit for sum assured, LIC added. 																								Depending upon the corporations experience, loyalty additions may also be payable on maturity. In case of death, prior to the date of maturity, full basic sum assured and an additional term assurance benefit (in case term rider option is exercised) along with guaranteed additions will also be paid.																								The plan is ideally suited for those who have no regular but good periodical income. The liquidity facility includes loan and surrender value on expiry of one-year period.																								LIC which has a market share close to 89 per cent, has found the growth in first-year premium incomes stagnating ever since it disbanded this popular single-premium product.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 States to fix sugarcane floor price
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, May 5: The Supreme Court today held that state governments were vested with the power to fix sugarcane prices for purchase by the sugar mills over and above the statutory minimum price fixed by the Centre for sugarcane.																								A five-judge full Constitution bench by a 3:2 majority verdict allowed the appeal of Uttar Pradesh government and quashed an Allahabad high court order that the state could not force a price for sugarcanes over and above the statutory minimum price fixed by the Centre under sugarcane control order, 1966.																								On appeal, the Supreme Court today struck down this order of the high court and said the state governments could fix a price over and above the statutory minimum price (SMP) determined by the Centre for the purchase of sugarcane by the mills from the growers. This has hit millions of sugar mill owners across the country.																								Chief Justice S. Rajendra Babu, Justices K. G. Balakrishnan, P. Venkatarama Reddi, B. . Srikrishna and G. P. Mathur were on the bench which allowed a UP government petition challenging an interim order of the Allahabad high court.																								Justices Babu, Balakrishnan and Mathur ruled that the state government could provide for state advised price (SAP) over and above the Centres SMP and Justices Reddi and Srikrishna, by separate judgements, felt that mills could not be coerced by the states to pay the additional price to the growers as SAP did not have any statutory backing.																								Justice Srikrishna ruled that the UP Sugarcane Act, 1953 did not have any provision under which the state government could fix SAP for the benefit of sugarcane growers.

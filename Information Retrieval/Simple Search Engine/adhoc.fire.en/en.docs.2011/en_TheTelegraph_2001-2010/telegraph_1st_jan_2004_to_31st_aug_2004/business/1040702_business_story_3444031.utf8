 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Tata Steel sets out on expansion trail with Rs 7800 crore 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 The way ahead																								Mumbai, July 1: Tata Steel is on a major expansion drive. The private sector steel behemoth plans to sink in Rs 7,800 crore over the next five years to raise its capacity by 2.4 million tonnes. The bulk of the costs will be met through internal accruals and long-term borrowings.																								The expansion plan  which will take the steel giants capacity to over 7.4 million tonnes  is likely to be completed by 2009. Post-expansion, the company will add almost half its current production capacity. 																								The news of the proposed expansion perked up the Tata Steel share, which gained Rs 5.95 to close at Rs 306.75.																								Tisco is already augmenting its capacity at Jamshedpur by 1 million tonnes. Once that expansion is over by September next year, the plants capacity will go up to 5 million tonnes. Add another 2.4 million tonnes to it and the capacity will touch 7.4 million tonnes in another five years.																								Tata Steel has produced over 1 million tonnes of saleable steel in the first quarter of 2004-05, a 3 per cent rise over the corresponding previous period.																								Tiscos expansion proposal comes close on the heels of Steel Authority of Indias (SAIL) decision to go in for an output boost. The company proposes to raise capacity by 66 per cent over the next eight years to 20 million tonnes per annum from the present 12 million tonnes.																								Domestic companies are in a rush to add capacity as demand is expected to increase so fast that current output potential will prove to be inadequate by 2009.																								Moreover, the sudden surge in demand from China this year has helped many steel companies stage a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. Steel prices had been confined to cyclical troughs over the past few years.																								The crisis saw companies like SAIL drastically prune its workforce and reduce interest costs through debt restructuring.																								Private players like Jindal Vijaynagar Steel (JVSL), Ispat Industries and Essar Steel also benefited from such debt restructuring that saw high-rate loans being replaced with cheaper debts.																								SAIL and Jindal Iron amp; Steel are also contemplating investments in coal mining abroad to ensure a price stability and a secured supply of coal and coking coal. Sajjan Jindals JVSL, which will eventually be merged with Jindal Iron amp; Steel, is in talks with the Karnataka government for allocation of iron ore mines.																								Ispat Industries, another private sector player, has acquired iron mining leases in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra.																								Essar Steel plans to set up a pellet plant in Orissa. The Orissa government has asked Essar to set up a plant as policies do not allow exploitation of mines unless the company invests in a project in the state.

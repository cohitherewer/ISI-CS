 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Coal India mines arm for overseas foray
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 15: Coal India (CIL) has decided to set up a new subsidiary that will explore coal mining opportunities abroad and could be part-owned by SAIL.																								To be called Coal Videsh, the firm will be a take-off on ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, and serve as a repository of overseas coal equity.																								Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is likely to pick up a stake to get mining leases abroad, particularly for coking coal. CIL chairman Sashi Kumar said discussions with the steel major on the issue are under way. Everything is at a nascent stage, so it is difficult to comment on the equity holding pattern now, he added.																								He pointed out while SAIL would be keen on sourcing coking coal, Coal Videsh would even bring the non-coking variety. The new company will meet domestic demand first and then sell to the rest of the world, Kumar added.																								The move comes in the backdrop of Planning Commissions concern over the yawning gap between demand and supply of coal. Even if CIL and other companies achieve their targets in 2006-07 and 2011-12, the shortfall would be 55 million tonnes and 95 million tonnes respectively, Kumar said.																								The supply of coking coal, the shortage of which has hit most steel companies, is likely to be inadequate given that CIL produces little of this premium-grade fuel.																								To start with, Coal India and SAIL will try to bag a Mozambique coal block, whose bidding opens on June 28. 																								Kumar said the company is in touch with International Finance Corporation (IFC), the operating agency for the government there, to get the papers. Opportunities in countries like Australia, Indonesia and South Africa are also being looked at.Production boost																								CIL has set a production target of 350 million tonnes for 2006-07. In the Eleventh Plan period, it will create new capacity of 445 million tonnes by implementing 99 projects estimated to cost over Rs 19,000 crore.																								On the issue of awarding coal blocks for captive use, Kumar said the experience has been disheartening. 																								Only three projects are on, while 37 are non-functional. The company plans to insert stringent clauses for the second phase of privatisation of 96 new blocks.																								Coal India has posted a turnover of Rs 26,700 crore in the previous financial year, an increase of 9 per cent. It reported a pre-tax profit of Rs 3700 crore, up 30 per cent.

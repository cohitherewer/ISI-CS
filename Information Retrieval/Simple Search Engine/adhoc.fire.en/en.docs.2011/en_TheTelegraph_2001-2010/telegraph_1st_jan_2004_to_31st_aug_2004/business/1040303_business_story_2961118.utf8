 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Centurion Bank recast plan gets a Fitch pat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 2: Fitch Ratings India today gave a thumbs up to the capital restructuring programme of Centurion Bank. The agency feels the plan will help improve the banks asset quality and bring down its non-performing loan (NPL) ratios. 																								The financial profile of the bank will improve in 2004-05 as a result of the restructuring plan, Fitch said. 																								The ratings agency has placed the F3 rating of the banks certificate of deposit programme on rating watch with positive implications. 																								The agency added that the approval of the restructuring and recapitalisation programme and the successful completion of the first phase of equity infusion under the banks new management will provide it with the financial flexibility to expand. The bank has suffered due to a high level of non-performing loans and a low capital adequacy ratio.																								Fitch hopes the capital restructuring plan will help the bank to substantially improve its asset quality and bring down its non-performing loan ratio. The bank proposes to utilise a large proportion of the share premium received on fresh equity allotment to write off its non-performing loans, the agency said. 																								Fitch added that while Centurion Bank has been focussing on retail loans (comprising 77 per cent of total advances) that are relatively healthier with net non-performing loans at less than 1 per cent, it expects lower incremental NPLs. 																								The F3 rating signifies fair credit quality and indicates the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate; however, near-term adverse changes could result in a reduction to non-investment grade. 																								According to the recapitalisation scheme, fresh capital to the tune of Rs 154 crore will be infused by existing principal shareholders and new investors, led by Sabre Capital in the first phase and Rs 65 crore through a rights issue in the second phase. Bank Muscat now holds 34.76 per cent of Centurion Bank.

 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Tinplate to expand capacity
																								Calcutta, Feb. 26 (PTI): Tinplate Company of India Ltd has drawn up a Rs 46-crore debottlenecking plan to increase the operating scale from 90,000 MT to 145,000 MT per annum by July this year. We are investing Rs 46 crore to increase the production capacity. The fund would be generated from internal accruals, Tinplate managing director Bhusan Raina said today.																								The company has appointed Luxembourgs Arcelor and Japans Nippon Steel as consultants on process and technology improvements, he said.																								Tinplates current capacity expansion programme is expected to be completed by May-June. Following this, the company would plan doubling its capacity to around 300,000 MT at a cost of Rs 110 crore. However, this proposal is at an embryonic stage.																								Investment will be very large. We are working out the nuances. We are very agile on this, but it is yet to be firmed up, Raina said.																								Explaining the rationale behind the massive capacity expansion, he said though the company was very strong, it would not survive with the scale at which it was operating.																								Once the company decides to double the capacity, it would take another two years to operationalise and Tata Steel, the promoters, might pitch in, he added.

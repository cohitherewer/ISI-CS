The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 ICI lines up growth plans
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Eyeing a makeover																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: ICI India Limited plans to strengthen its core business areas by emphasising on both organic and inorganic growth.																								In the year ahead, we will focus on our core business areas as these can contribute substantially to the long-term growth of the country, chairman Aditya Narayan said at the 50th annual general meeting of the company.																								The company has almost completed restructuring its businesses and the money saved from the exercise has been invested in fixed maturity mutual funds and other instruments. We have plans to utilise the surplus cash currently invested in stable instruments, added Narayan.																								The company plans to use Rs 780 crore for acquisitions, of which Rs 480 crore has been generated from restructuring the businesses in the recent past. Another Rs 300 crore can be borrowed by the company to further aid the acquisition process, chief financial officer and executive director M. R. Rajaram said.																								The restructuring includes divesting its 51 per cent stake in its subsidiary Indian Explosive Limited and also selling off the total stake in nitrocellulose and trading businesses. It had earlier sold off its polyurethanes business.																								The company is looking at possible targets within the country for the paints business. For the textile auxiliaries, ICI is open to acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region.																								The company is trying to revive its rubber chemical business. We have not taken any long-term decision to exit the business and are putting every effort to turn the business around. But since the sector is suffering from depressed international prices, we cannot do much till they recover, added Rajaram.																								In the first quarter of the current financial year, the continuing businesses grew 26 per cent, recording a net sales of Rs 171 crore. The profit after tax at Rs 12.6 crore was higher than the corresponding period of the previous year by 65 per cent.																								Due to the prevailing difficult market conditions for the rubber chemicals business, net asset value of Rs 9.8 crore has been charged to the opening reserves. 																								The company has also made additional investments of Rs 3 crore in the last eight months for de-bottlenecking the rubber chemical plants. It has plans to double the capacity at the Hyderabad plant from the current level of 14 million litres to 28 million litres.

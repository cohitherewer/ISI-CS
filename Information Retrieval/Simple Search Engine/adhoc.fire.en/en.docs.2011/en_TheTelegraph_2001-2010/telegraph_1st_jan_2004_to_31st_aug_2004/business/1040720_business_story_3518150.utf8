 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Survey sees growth in FMCG market
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has shown signs of growth and recovery in fiscal 2003-04, says the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								Several factors have contributed to growth in the Rs 600-billion industry, including cost-cutting measures adopted by companies, tax benefits granted to them, rising demand, good monsoons and the overall economic growth.																								In a survey conducted by the industry body, it states that improvement in the performance of the industry is more pronounced in volume terms than value terms for most of the products. The industry has achieved a growth rate of 1.5 per cent in value terms and about 4 per cent in volume terms.																								Growth has been achieved despite rising raw material prices and the impact of series of price reductions slashing profit margins, but raising sales volumes, the study said.																								Since liberalisation began in the 90s, consumers have been able to make choices between products of domestic and foreign companies.																								One of the greatest innovations made by FMCG companies is the sachet, which helped introduce products in smaller package sizes at low price, reached new users and expanded market share for value-added products in urban India.																								Most multinational companies have also started sourcing their products from India. For example, Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) has become the production centre in respect of personal consumer products like oral care, skin care products, soap, detergents globally for Unilever.																								A significant feature that has impacted the industry is the offshoot and mushrooming of regional companies, which are posing a threat to bigger FMCG companies.																								While companies are going global, they are focusing on overseas markets like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and West Asia.

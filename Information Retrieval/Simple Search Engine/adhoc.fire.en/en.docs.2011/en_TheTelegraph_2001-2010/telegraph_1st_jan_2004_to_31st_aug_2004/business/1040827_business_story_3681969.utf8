The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Infotech wired to staff loyalty
 M RAJENDRAN																								Pune, Aug. 26: Information technology companies are heading towards Calcutta and Pune where job-hopping is less common in an effort to counter the problem of high attrition rates  a term used to denote a phenomenon where people leave companies for better opportunities and fatter pay packets.																								The high attrition rate in infotech companies based in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai is prompting a growing number of entities to make Calcutta and Pune their next ports of call.																								Zensar Technologies, the IT arm of Calcutta-based RPG Group company, set up shop in Pune in the 1990s instead of Bangalore or Hyderabad. It is now planning to open an office in Calcutta.																								Ganesh Natarajan, deputy chairman and managing director, Zensar Technologies, said, People in Pune and Calcutta have strong family values and loyalty to their home state. If the Bengal government can get its infrastructure in place, which is already happening and manage to provide the same quality as is available in Pune, they will not only attract big players like Infosys and Wipro (who are already there) but also serious players like us.																								I am going to Calcutta on Friday to meet the IT secretary of the state and will go to Salt Lake. We will decide our expansion plans outside Pune once we reach the $100 million revenue target set for financial year 2004-05. Our existing facilities in Pune, China and Singapore will not be enough. So, we will look for an alternative location and Calcutta is on the top of the list, Natarajan said. GTL, formerly known as Global Telesystems Ltd, is another Pune-based company that wants to expand its business process operations by setting up base in Calcutta.																								Pradeep Phadke, senior vice-president and centre head at GTL Ltd, said, For expansion of call-centre business, there is a thinking in the IT industry and also within our company that Calcutta should be the location for expanding this business. The reason for that is even if there were certain negatives related to setting up a business there, it is a good location in terms of manpower availability.

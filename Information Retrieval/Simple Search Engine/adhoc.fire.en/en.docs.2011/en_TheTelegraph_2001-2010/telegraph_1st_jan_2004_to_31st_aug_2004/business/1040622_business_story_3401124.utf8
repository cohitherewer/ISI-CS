 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 CII hits new track with call for 5% rail cess
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sunil Munjal in Delhi on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, June 21: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) today proposed a 5 per cent cess on passengers to develop railway infrastructure and presented an eight-point agenda to the government to achieve an 8 per cent sustained growth in GDP.																								The apex industry chamber was confident that a 7-8 per cent growth was achievable in the next decade provided the government aggressively pursued reforms. It predicted a doubling of per capita income in the next 10 years from the current level of income of $470 a year.																								The industry association said 2004-05 would close with a 7 per cent growth.																								CII president Sunil Kant Munjal, who was addressing his first press conference since assuming charge at the apex industry forum, said, Revival in agriculture, growth in industry and services and improvement in investments are the key imperatives for a high growth in the economy.																								Munjal said the government would have to focus more on rural economy as 60 per cent of the population was dependent on agriculture.																								The eight-point agenda calls for adequate thrust on rural housing, introduction of farm policy based on public-private partnership and incentives to corporate involvement in agriculture production and processing, making Indian manufacturing globally competitive. 																								The agenda also wants a boost to the services sector, revamp of small and medium enterprises and the removal of bottlenecks in infrastructure. Sectors like textiles, drugs and pharmaceuticals should be recognised as high potential areas for growth, he said.																								The CII also sought greater access for Indian products in the global trade market and implementation through a task-force approach.																								Competitiveness of India Inc  building for growth is the chambers theme for 2004-05. The CII plans to develop a new logistics advisory service, focus on marketing India as an investment destination and facilitate international experience sharing.																								Underlining key challenges before the economy, he said there should be even growth across sectors, including textiles, foods and consumer non-durables, which have witnessed slower growth.

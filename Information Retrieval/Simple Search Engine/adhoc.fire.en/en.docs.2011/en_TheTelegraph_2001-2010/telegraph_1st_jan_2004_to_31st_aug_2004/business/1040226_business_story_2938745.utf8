 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Sebi seeks data on trade pattern
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bajpai: Eyes wide open																								Mumbai, Feb. 25: Taking note of the governments concern over the lukewarm response to the ongoing PSU stock sale, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has decided to probe the recent bear onslaught.																								The market regulator has asked for data on the trading pattern of stocks, especially in public sector stocks like IBP and IPCL, to see if there is any deliberate bear hammering.																								The IBP issue is yet to attract a reasonable investor interest.																								Sebi has asked the exchanges to closely monitor stock movements, exchange sources said.																								Market surveillance is actually a normal routine for exchanges and form part of the daily reports sent to Sebi. 																								But we have to be doubly vigilant now as any artificial bear hammering could directly affect the IPO market, exchange officials said. 																								Shourie, along with merchant bankers, met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and decided to go ahead with the block-buster ONGC issue.																								Sebi chairman G. . Bajpai also attended the meeting fuelling rumours that some punters, including some corporate houses, could be put under the scanner.

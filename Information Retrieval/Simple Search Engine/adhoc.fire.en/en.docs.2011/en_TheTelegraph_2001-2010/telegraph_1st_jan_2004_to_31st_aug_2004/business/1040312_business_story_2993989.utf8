 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 11: The consortium of British Gas (BG), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Reliance Industries plans to invest another $140 million in Panna oil and gas field to target new reserves and expand current production.																								The ONGC-discovered Panna field, located 95 kms north-west off Mumbai, is estimated to have oil reserves of 1 billion barrels and gas reserves of 1.8 trillion cubic feet. 																								According to a statement issued by the British energy major, the expansion programme is expected to result in a gross incremental recovery of 1.8 million barrels of oil and 74 billion cubic feet of gas. The first enhanced production is expected in the third quarter of 2005. 																								The project comprises construction and installation of two new wellhead platforms and associated infield pipelines to connect to the existing processing and compression platform.																								The drilling schedule includes six horizontal wells from one platform and five horizontal wells from the other platform.																								British Gas owns a 30 per cent share in the field, which it had bought from Enron Corporation of the US. Reliance acquired 30 per cent share in the mid-nineties as part of the privatisation process of the field. ONGC owns the rest.																								BG India CEO Nigel Shaw said, BG India and partners are proceeding with investment plans to target the undeveloped areas of Panna field by applying advanced drilling techniques to extract oil and gas.

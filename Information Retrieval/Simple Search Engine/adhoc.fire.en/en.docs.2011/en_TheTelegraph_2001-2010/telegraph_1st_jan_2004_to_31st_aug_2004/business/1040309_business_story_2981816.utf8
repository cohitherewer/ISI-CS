 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 MRPL to break even this fiscal
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, March 8: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) expects to pull its downstream subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) out of the red in the current fiscal ending March 31 with a marginal net profit. 																								A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph that MRPL would break even as the last quarter of the current financial year is expected to yield better results. The turnaround of MRPL comes within a year of the national upstream giant having taken over the company. However, the company is still a step away from reducing the huge accumulated losses of Rs 800 crore. A marginal profit only means that there will be no more addition to the losses piled up in recent years.																								MRPL had suffered a loss of Rs 412 crore in 2002-03, down from Rs 492 crore loss in 2001-02. 																								The profits during 2004-05 are expected to be higher as the refinery has started operating at its full capacity and the downstream oil marketing companies  Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP  are expected to pick up a greater share of its products. MRPL will be able to realise higher prices for its products than the current year in which it had to export as much as 40 per cent of its output.																								In the countrys oil industry logistics plan for 2004-05 cleared by the petroleum ministry, the capacity of MRPL has been listed at 9.69 million tonnes. Earlier, its share in the domestic market was based on a capacity of 6 million tonnes due to the large quantity of products from the Reliance refinery that the national oil companies had committed to pick up under an earlier agreement. The agreement with Reliance expires at the end of this month.																								The prices of petroleum products in the domestic market are around Rs 1,000 per tonne higher than that in the international market and this makes for higher refinery margins. The higher prices are due to the 10 per cent customs duty protection given do domestic refineries. 																								Reliance has been mounting pressure on the petroleum ministry to extend its agreement so that the national oil marketing companies continue to market a neat chunk of its products but so far the government has stood its ground. About 50 per cent of the MRPL output comprises diesel and petrol. With the national oil marketing companies picking up these products in accordance with the priority given to public sector companies, the price realisation is expected to shoot up.																								The package to which the banks have agreed has come as a great boon as earlier a large part of its operating profits was eroded by the high interest payments with the company caught in a vicious debt trap.

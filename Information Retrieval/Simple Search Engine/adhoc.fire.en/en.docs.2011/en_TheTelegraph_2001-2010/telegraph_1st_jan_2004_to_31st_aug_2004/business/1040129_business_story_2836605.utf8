 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Boeing to open talks for sale of 7E7 planes
																								New Delhi, Jan. 28 (PTI): US aircraft maker Boeing will soon start talks with Indian carriers to market its latest aircraft, the 7E7, which is due for launch in 2008, as it strives to cash in on the fast-growing Asian aviation market.																								Unveiling the companys strategy for the 200-300-seater aircraft, Boeing senior vice-president (sales) Dinesh Keskar said the new aircraft would be positioned as a replacement for the Boeing 757 and 767 as well as Airbus A310 and A330 aircraft.																								We are planning to show it to all the airlines. Not only Air-India and Indian Airlines, but also Jet Airways and Air Sahara. But these will be preliminary talks, Keskar said.																								Deliveries and commercial flight of the 7E7 is expected to start in 2008. It would be available in three types  the 200-seater 7E7, 300-seater 7E7 SR and 250-seater 7e7 Stretch. 																								Keskar claimed the new aircraft was 20 per cent more fuel-efficient and could carry 40-60 per cent more cargo than those produced by Airbus.																								Boeings 18 737-800 aircraft were selected by Air-India in November 2003 as part of a 28-aircraft acquisition deal worth over Rs 10,000 crore.																								It was, however, left out of an earlier Indian Airlines board decision, which recommended purchase of 43 Airbus aircraft for over Rs 10,000 crore. 																								Boeing estimates that 24,276 aircraft would be sold globally in 2003-2022, of which single-aisle type aircraft would comprise the majority of 12,847 units, while the 767 and 7E7 aircraft of 200-300 passenger carrying capacity would be at about 3,500 units.

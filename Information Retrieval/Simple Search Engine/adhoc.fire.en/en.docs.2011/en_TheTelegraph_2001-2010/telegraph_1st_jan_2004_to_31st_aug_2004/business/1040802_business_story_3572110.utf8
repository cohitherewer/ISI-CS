 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Spectrum war erupts in telecom industry 
 M RAJENDRAN				 	 better clarity																								New Delhi, Aug 1: A war has broken out in the telecom industry over the allocation of a new band of airwaves to operators that will carry voice, multimedia and high-speed data, popularly known as 3G applications.																								Operators like Reliance and Tata have proposed that they should be given spectrum in the new band of airwaves called PCS1900.																								Bharti, Hutch, Idea, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd are bitterly opposing the proposal. They claim that it will not only lead to disturbance in the voice quality of their (GSM) service due to interference by the new band, but also block their migration to 3G services.																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued a consultation paper to elicit responses from these operators on spectrum allocation. With the growth of new services like TV on mobile and high-speed internet browsing (3G services), several operators have felt the need for additional spectrum and have approached the government.																								According to a submission made to Trai by T. V. Ramchandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), The allocation of the PCS 1900 band would not only result in a major interference to the services offered by operators using GSM technology but also block the progress of 30 million subscribers to 3G.																								There are two important components in a mobile service: uplinking (a call or data sent from your mobile phone to a base station) and downlinking (receiving a call or data from base station to mobile phone).																								While uplinking, the airwaves in the PCS 1900 band clash with those in 1800 band (allotted to operators using GSM technology) that downlink the call and data. 																								While downlinking, the PCS 1900 band interferes with the IMT 2000, which is the uplinking mode for 1920-1980 MHz paired with 2110 to 2170 Mhz (the core band identified by the International Telecommunications Union for 3G services).																								The interference for the 30 million subscribers using the GSM technology could range from gurgling noises as heard while tuning the radio stations, call drops, messages and data not reaching its destination.																								The National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP), which is set up by the wireless planning commission under the department of telecommunication, had identified a core band in 1920-1980 MHz paired with 2110-2170 MHz.																								This is the spectrum for international mobile telecommunication (IMT-2000) for 3G services agreed by more than 40 countries, including India, in 1992 at the International Telecommunications Union at Geneva.

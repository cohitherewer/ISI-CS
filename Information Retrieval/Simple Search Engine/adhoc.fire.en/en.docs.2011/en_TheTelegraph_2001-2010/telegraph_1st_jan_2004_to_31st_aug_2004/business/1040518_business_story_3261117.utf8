 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Watchdog provides support to faltering rupee
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Money matters																								Mumbai, May 17: The rupee today came under intense pressure over concerns of dollar outflow. However, unlike stocks, the Indian currency ended on a positive territory boosted by comforting statements by a pro-active Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its dollar-selling intervention.																								The rupee ended the day at 45.50/52 per dollar, a sharp gain of 10 paise from last Fridays close of 45.60/62. Its close marked a smart rally from an intra-day low of 46.02 per dollar, spooked by the meltdown on equity markets.																								Forex analysts predict that the rupee will remain under pressure over the next few days. Vivek Royzada, a forex analyst at Mecklai Financial, said while foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers of over $1 billion since early this month, the rupee could once again flirt with the 46-per-dollar mark as close to $2 billion FII money may flow out again.																								According to Royzada, had it not been for the comforting statements made by the central bank and its intervention, the rupee could have emerged sharply bruised against the US greenback today.																								If it had not been for the RBI statements, we would have seen the rupee hitting 46.50 or even 47 per dollar in todays trading, he added.																								The RBI said it will continue to sell dollars through agent banks to augment supply in the market or intervene directly to meet any demand-supply scenario. This considerably eased the pressure on the Indian currency.																								The apex bank also said it was ready to provide banks with liquidity to meet all their payment obligations, including intra-day requirements.																								FIIs will continue to reduce or increase their stakes in Indian equity markets. While RBI welcomes these flows, it will also like to ensure than those FIIs who wish to reduce their stakes can do as easily as possible at prevailing market rates, RBI said. 																								Authorised dealers acting on behalf of these FIIs are free to approach the RBI to procure foreign exchange at prevailing market rates depending on market conditions, it added.																								The Indian currency, which opened on a firm footing at 45.55/60 per dollar, came under pressure when stocks lost their ground on heavy selling by foreign investors over concerns about slow pace of economic reforms. 																								Statements by some Left leaders demanding that the process of privatisation of profitable state-owned enterprises be scrapped also added to the mayhem. 																								Foreign investors had pumped in a record $7.7 billion last year, leading to the rupee appreciating by more than 5 per cent. Yet another reason for the recent appreciation of the Indian currency was the recent public offers in public sector units that raked in hefty FII inflows.

 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Roaming costlier on AirTel, Hutch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 4: Mobile phone operators AirTel and Hutch have raised their national and international roaming costs. 																								Post-paid subscribers of AirTel and Hutch will have to pay an additional Rs 1.50 per minute airtime charges for outgoing calls while roaming under revisions that have come into effect from May 1. 																								Roaming subscribers will have to pay Rs 3.49 per minute for an outgoing call up to 200 kilometres and Rs 4.49 per minute above 200 km when they call another mobile phone.																								In case of an outgoing call from a mobile phone (while roaming) to a landline phone, the subscriber will have to pay Rs 4.49 per minute until 200 km and Rs 5.49 per minute till 500 km and Rs 6.49 per minute beyond 500 km. While the roaming charges for incoming calls from both mobile and STD would be Rs 3.49 per minute till 200 km and Rs 4.49 per minute beyond 500 km.																								The GSM operators have also raised the roaming charges for international roaming calls. Outgoing calls to the US, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Saarc will cost Rs 17.49 per minute. The calls from Gulf countries will cost Rs 20.49 per minute and it will cost Rs 41.50 per minutes for calls made to the rest of the countries.																								While the growth of subscriber base may not be impacted by this decision, the mobile-to-mobile STD/ISD call traffic is likely to drop and the customers may prefer to use fixed-line phones. The cost of an STD call beyond 500 km is Rs 3.60 per minute as against Rs 6.49 per minute for call from mobile to landline and Rs 4.49 per minute from a mobile-to-mobile phone.																								However, the two public sector telecom majors  Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam  and the two private operators offering mobile phone services using the code division multiple access technology  Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom  have retained their existing national and international roaming charges.

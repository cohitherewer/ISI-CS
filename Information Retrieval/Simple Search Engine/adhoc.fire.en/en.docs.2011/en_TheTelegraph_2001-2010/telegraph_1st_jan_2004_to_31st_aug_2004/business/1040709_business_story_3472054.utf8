 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Eighty-five items yanked off SSI list
 OUR BUREAU 																								New Delhi/ Calcutta, July 8: In a move that is expected to create a major ruckus among a vast group of small-scale industry (SSI) players, the government today de-reserved 85 items from the list reserved for the small scale sector.																								Almost anticipating a backlash, the government has also announced an increase in subsidy to give a boost to the sector. 																								SSI units must be given the space to grow into medium enterprises, finance minister P. Chidambaram said. The world over, policies are devised to meet the requirements of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Keeping in mind the twin objectives, the ministry of SSI has identified 85 items that can be safely taken out of the reserved list, said Chidambaram.																								The minister said technology upgradation of SSI units is the most urgent requirement to do business in a competitive environment. Towards this end, the government has reviewed the capital subsidy scheme and proposed to raise the ceiling for loans under the scheme from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore.																								Also, the rate of subsidy under the credit link capital subsidy scheme for technology upgradation will be raised from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. Chidambaram also said the scope of the scheme will be enlarged by adding more sub-sectors and technologies eligible for assistance.																								The finance minister also said SSI units will be encouraged to obtain credit rating. With these measures, I expect that many more SSI units will benefit from the restructured scheme, he said.																								A provision of Rs 135.24 crore has been made for schemes for the promotion of SSI and within that amount funds will be found for the capital subsidy scheme, the finance minister said. 																								The minister has also announced a fund for the regeneration of traditional industries, with an initial allocation of Rs 100 crore. These include traditional industries like coir, handloom, handicrafts, sericulture, leather, pottery and other cottage industries. 																								The minister has said the details, including mechanism for utilisation of the regeneration fund will be worked out in consultation with the industries concerned. 																								Small entrepreneurs and their organisations have generally welcomed the various measures announced by Chidambaram for the small scale sector.																								Small seem to be no more beautiful for the government  be it the NDA or UPA, small-scale industry leaders said following the dereservation decision.

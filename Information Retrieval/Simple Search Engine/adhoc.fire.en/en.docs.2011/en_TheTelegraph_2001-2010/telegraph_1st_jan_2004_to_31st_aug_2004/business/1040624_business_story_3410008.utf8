 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Core sector growth in slow lane
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 23: Domestic infrastructure growth skidded to 5.1 per cent in May from 9 per cent in April, although the pace of expansion is still more than the 4.1 per cent rise in the year-ago period.																								Data released by the commerce and industry ministry today showed output grew 6.7 per cent in April-May compared with 4.3 per cent in the same period last year.																								Production across several sectors, including electricity, cement and steel, slowed in May compared with April. However, output of crude and petroleum refinery products in May was sharply higher.																								The six core industries  spanning coal, steel, cement, crude oil, electricity and petroleum refining  accounts for a total weight of 26.68 per cent in the Index of Industrial Production.																								Analysts, however, said the year-on-year rise reflects the sustained demand-led recovery of the Indian economy, which is forecast to expand by around 7 per cent in 2004-05.																								In 2003-04, the economy grew around 8.1 per cent helped by the best monsoon in a decade.																								Data issued showed petroleum refining grew 13.6 per cent in May against a 0.4 per cent fall a year earlier while the coal sector rose 6 per cent in May compared with 4.3 per cent rise a year-ago.																								Cement output, however, declined 1.8 per cent in May against an 8.1 per cent jump in May last year. Also, electricity rose by a lower 3.6 per cent against 5.3 per cent a year-ago. 																								However, the crude oil sector jumped 8.1 per cent against a 5.3 per cent decline a year before, while the steel sector rose 5.4 per cent against a 6.9 per cent rise in May 2003.

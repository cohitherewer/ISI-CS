 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 AirTel ring-back tone
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: AirTel today launched a ring-back tone service, a personalised mobile music service where the caller hears songs and other sound clips instead of the traditional switchboard ring tone.																								The new service would be available for both pre-paid and post-paid customers under a brand name, Hello Tunes.																								It enables a customer to replace the traditional ring-back tone with a personalised sound file. To access the personalised service, a customer just needs to dial 678 and then choose a hit song or a sound clip or even a joke. The chosen tone can then be assigned to specific callers and/or for all callers.																								The Hello Tune service comes with a rental of Rs 30 per month. If a post-paid customer activates, the amount will be reflected in the monthly bill, while if a pre-paid subscriber activates then the amount is deducted from the airtime cost.																								The service is also backed with a wide range of content, including the latest Hindi and English songs priced at Rs 15 per download. The service can be accessed in most of the latest mobile phones and does not need any special handset since it is activated and de-activated by network.

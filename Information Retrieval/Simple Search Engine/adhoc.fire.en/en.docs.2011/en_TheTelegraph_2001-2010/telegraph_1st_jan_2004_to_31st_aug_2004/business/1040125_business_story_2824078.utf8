 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Processing unit for tea exports
																								Calcutta, Jan. 24 (PTI): In a bid to boost tea exports, the Calcutta Port Trust has decided to set up a state-of-the-art tea processing facility in collaboration with the Tea Board, port chairman A.K. Chanda said today.																								The port exported 61,000 tonnes of packaged tea last year.																								Proper packaging and processing of tea has become very important for boosting exports of tea. We are therefore joining hands with the Tea Board for setting up the tea processing facility at the Calcutta port, Chanda said at an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.																								The port, he said, had identified four plots and invited bids for the proposed centre.

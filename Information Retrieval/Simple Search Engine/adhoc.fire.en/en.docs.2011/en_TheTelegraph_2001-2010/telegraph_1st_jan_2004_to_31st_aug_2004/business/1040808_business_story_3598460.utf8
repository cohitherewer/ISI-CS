The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Bank of Rajasthan decides to look east
 VIVEK NAIR				 	 Tayal: Eastward ho!																								Mumbai, Aug. 7: Bank of Rajasthan will expand its operations in the east, in line with its plans to have a national presence.																								According to promoter Pravin Kumar Tayal, the bank has nine branches at present and has got the Reserve Bank licence to set up 11 additional ones in cities like Cuttack, Guwahati, Ranchi, Patna and Tata Nagar. The bank is also looking at increasing its presence in Calcutta and adjoining areas, he added.																								Bank of Rajasthan hopes to set up these branches in this fiscal. Speaking to The Telegraph, Tayal said the bank will be spending over Rs 25-30 lakh per branch property.																								We plan to increase our presence in the country by more than 100 branches. The bank will look towards the east and south to increase its presence there, he said. 																								We expect a growth in both our deposits and advances in these regions, where the customers are mostly loyal, he added.																								Initially, close to 80 per cent of the banks deposits of Rs 2500 crore came from Rajasthan. However, over the years, other regions have shown a rise in contribution. While bank deposits have shown a three-fold increase, the contribution of Rajasthan forms less than 30 per cent.																								The bank recently reported a net profit of Rs 20.15 crore for the first quarter ended June 30. While total income for the bank during this period was over Rs 155 crore, its revenue from banking operations improved to Rs 65.40 crore from Rs 63.79 crore in the corresponding period last year. However, the revenue from treasury dipped to Rs 90.05 crore from Rs 94.63 crore last year.																								Analysts feel that with interest rates looking up, huge treasury gains accrued by the banking sector is drawing to a close. Though some indications to this effect were available in the first quarter performance of many banks, income from their core operations have shown an increase.																								Banks have been focusing more on retail credit. At Bank of Rajasthan too, Tayal said, the retail focus has led to this segment occupying close to 30 per cent of its over Rs 2500-crore advances. 																								We have been making efforts to emerge as a one-stop financial house by offering mutual funds, life insurance and general insurance products under one roof. At the same time, the bank has also been focusing on the SME sector, he added.

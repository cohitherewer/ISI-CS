 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Pawar plans sops for Maratha sugar lobby
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								New Delhi, May 28: Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has already started working on a package for the Maharashtra sugar farmers in an apparent attempt to send a clear message to his vote bank that he is here to take care of his flock. 																								Pawar said today that the Centre had sanctioned an assistance of Rs 501 crore, including Rs 201 crore from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF), to Maharashtra for tackling drought, which had hit the state in recent years. 																								In his first media appearance, after assuming charge, Pawar said: I do not see a situation where we will have to import sugar. In states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, cane crop had been hit by drought, but in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh the crop was good. The country had enough sugar stock to meet domestic requirements, he added. 																								The minister also ruled out exporting grains from the central pool and granting subsidy to traders this year, as the stocks were just sufficient for the country. This puts to rest, as of now, the proposed Rs 600-crore grain export subsidy scheme. 																								Although Pawar ruled out sugar imports, he said that import of raw sugar for re-export after processing could be allowed. 																								The government was open to the idea of facilitating raw sugar import as mills were running idle owing to shortage of cane, he said.																								The minister said processing of raw sugar could help mills reduce their administrative cost, particularly those that are closed and running at a loss. He, however, added, I am generally not happy with import of agri-commodities. I am not going to take any liberal view on imports. 																								The minister said the government expects to stock 200 lakh tonnes wheat and 130 lakh tonnes rice by July, which would be sufficient to meet domestic requirements.																								Pawar said the agriculture ministry plans to double rural credit in three years.

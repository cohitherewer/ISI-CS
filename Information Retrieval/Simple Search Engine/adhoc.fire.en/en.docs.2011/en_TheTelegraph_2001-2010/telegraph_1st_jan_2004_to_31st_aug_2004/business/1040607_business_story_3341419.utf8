 Satish John stays cool even as assured return plans fold up in a hurry 
	We do not have an opinion about where the stock market, interest rates, or business activity will be a year from now. 
	We've long felt that the only value of stock forecasts is to make fortune-tellers look good. We believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should be kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also from grown-ups who behave in the market like childrenWarren BuffettIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, the market is a weighing machine Ben Graham																								There is wisdom in these words: they may have been made in a different context but they are just as relevant in India today where the swings on the stock markets look more violent than the printout from a kooky electrocardiogram (ECG) machine.																								If the gyrations on the market werent bad enough, investors are now confronted with the sudden rash of foreclosures of assured return schemes. The administrator of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI)  or UTI I  foreclosed seven schemes a couple of months ago and are planning to bring down the hatches on two more schemes that mature in 2004-05.																								The Sardar Sarovar bonds long-term securities that were floated with great fanfare in December 1994 with a whopping 18 per cent rate of interest (if held for the full term of 20 years) to raise cash to fund the Narmada dam project  were almost foreclosed in a hasty fashion before the Securities and Exchange Board of India stepped in to the rescue of hapless bond holders. Many, however, say the foreclosure of these bonds was inevitable.																								Investors have a hard time now in deciding where to park their investible funds. The good old fixed deposits and income funds are expected to yield just a piffle this year: 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent (if ones lucky). 																								The question: should investors meekly accept the cash returned or accept bonds that give a little above 6 per cent return, a tad above the inflation rate, enough to just preserve the principal amount?																								The verdict on the Street is to stay invested in equities. We cannot delude the investors that there are no market risks, says Sashi Krishnan, chief executive of Cholamandalam AMC Ltd that manages Chola Mutual Fund. But investors should now look at equity.																								The best option for risk-averse investors looking to make a decent return on their investment is to look for conservatively managed monthly income plans (MIPs) with an equity exposure of a little less than 10 per cent in bad market conditions. That is ideal for first-time investors in the equity market.																								Unlike balanced funds which shovel as much as 50 to 70 per cent of their corpus into equity, MIPs have a lesser exposure in equity (from 10 per cent to a maximum of 30 per cent) as it is aimed at investors with a modest risk profile. MIPs like other equity flavoured funds have seen net asset values eroding after the recent market hiccup.																								Theres no point to time the market, says Saurabh Sonthalia, head of strategy amp; business development at DSP Merrill Lynch Mutual Fund. He says investment in MIPs should have a time horizon of 12 to 18 months after the investor ascertains his risk profile.																								MIPs come with slightly higher risk than bond funds, says Saurabh because of the equity flavour in the schemes.																								Sashi Krishnan from Chola says this is the right time for a conservative risk averse investor to invest in MIPs who have an investment horizon of four to five years. A long-term wealth creation can happen at this point of time, he added.																								Funds like Chola have pegged the equity exposure at below 10 per cent to ensure that investors are not affected by the gyrations in stock markets when the times are bad. So do other funds keeping in mind the risk profile of the investor.																								For conservative investors, MIPs would be the best route to take an equity exposure. A little risk but returns on the longer term would be better than income funds in a scenario where interest rates remain low.																								As Robert Rubin, former treasury secretary in the Clinton presidency and a top-level Citigroup banker, once said: Condoms arent safe. A friend of mine was wearing one and got hit by a bus. Lately, investors in income funds and assured return schemes have been whacked by the harsh truth.

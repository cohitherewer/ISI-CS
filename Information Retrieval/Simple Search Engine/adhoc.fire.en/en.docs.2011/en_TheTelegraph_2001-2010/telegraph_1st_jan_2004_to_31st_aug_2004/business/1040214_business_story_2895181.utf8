The B K Birla group that runs the ailing cement maker with a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes today confirmed representatives of a Thai broker visited the unit.																								The company told the Bombay Stock Exchange that it will inform it if some concrete progress takes place in the matter. However, industry watchers have already started second-guessing the Thailand connection.																								There are reports suggesting the Thai merchant banker could be the representative of Siam City Cement, the leading cement firm in that country.

An Aditya Birla group spokesperson refused comment. It is not our policy to comment on speculation.																								The group with revenues of Rs 27,000 crore, is also the 10th largest cement producer in the world with large interests in Thailand through Thai Carbon Black, Thai Rayon  all of them set up by founder Aditya Birla. 																								Its flagship, Grasim, recently forged an intricate deal to take control of Larsen amp; Toubros cement wing. This has made some analysts dispute stories of Grasims interest in Mangalam.

 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Foreign investors still upbeat on India story
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 27: Foreign investors are bullish on India  drawn to the country because of its market size, skilled manpower and the availability of low-cost infrastructure.																								A survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) says 86 per cent of the respondents are planning to expand their operations in India.																								The survey presents a reassuring picture to the government, which wants to raise foreign direct investment (FDI) levels to over $10 billion a year from about $4.5 billion at present.																								But there are a few worrying factors that bother overseas investors: uncertainties regarding political stability, security and terrorism, exchange rate volatility and the rate of return.																								The Ficci survey says there is an improvement in the perception among overseas investors with regard to operational parameters and prevailing market conditions in India.																								The chamber has identified five thrust areas for the government which would result in strong FDI inflows in the near- to medium-term. These include IT and related services, chemical and chemical products, rubber and plastic products, electrical machinery and apparatus and services sectors.																								According to the survey, Indias attractiveness index has registered a gain of almost 8 per cent over the previous two years. The participating companies are extremely bullish on India with 73 per cent of respondents making positive assessment as an investment destination, says the survey.																								Ninety-three per cent of the respondents (82 per cent last year) reckon that the opportunities for greater FDI in their sector has grown.																								As for the performance measures, a substantial 77 per cent of the respondents said their Indian operations were profitable. Of these, nearly three-fourths surpassed their profitability target and a further 9 per cent are breaking even.																								On the operational parameters, the overall policy framework in India has been rated as being average to good by 88 per cent of the respondents.																								A notable development indicated in the survey is the improvement in the approval mechanism at the Centre. Nearly 86 per cent respondents shared this view. However, procedural delays at the state level were rated as quite to very serious by a whopping 93 per cent of respondents.

 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 In fixed company
 Its not in fashion but company deposits still have their own appeal. Chandralekha Tulal takes a look 																								It was the flyer that came along with the morning papers that caught Debarshi Guptas eye. XYZee was offering 11 per cent interest on its company fixed deposit scheme.																								Gupta, who has just raked in some moolah after opting for voluntary retirement recently, goggled at the rate of interest that the company was offering: 11 per cent, which is way above what he was earning on his cash. But should he bite the bait? Gupta talked it over with his friend Anurag Verma who was truly gung-ho over company fixed deposits. But Gupta was a little sceptical: company fixed deposits  which were a rage back in the eighties  had earned a bad rap after a colossal number of redemption delinquencies by true blue companies.																								Verma admitted that Guptas misgivings were not entirely unfounded. But he reckoned if an investor did a bit of homework before stumping up his cash, he ought to be able to earn a handsome return. Company deposits are fixed-term deposits and offer a fixed rate of interest. The big feature  and thats the hook which unscrupulous operators can exploit  is that the rate of interest offered is higher than other similar assets. The reason for this is that these deposits are unsecured  which means that if the company defaults, investors cannot press for recovery through sale of its assets. So theres a risk associated with investing in company deposits  but if you pick your company well and arent too greedy, you shouldnt have a problem.																								There are seven basic commandments chiselled in stone that any brave heart needs to scrupulously follow:																								First, select the right company to minimise the risk. It is always advisable to put money in reputed companies that may offer lower interest rather than a fly-by-nighter who is dangling that ooh-so-luscious lolly.																								Second, always analyse the performance of the company. Try and find out about the company, its business and future prospects. Parameters such as the debt-equity ratio and interest coverage give a fair idea of the companys ability to service debts. Avoid investing in companies with a high debt burden. Companies that are laden with accumulated losses are best avoided. Cash flow is another aspect that determines the repayment capacity. Avoid investing in private companies as not much information about their financial position is in the public domain. A government guarantee does not always imply safety.																								Third, always check out the credit ratings. A company with a low rating is likely to offer a higher rate of interest. Credit ratings are expressed as AAA  which implies highest safety, AA  high safety, A  adequate safety, B  inadequate safety, C  risk-prone and so forth.																								Fourth, beware of deposits offering ridiculously high interest rates, specifically those offering more than the prescribed rates by the Reserve Bank of India. This is a clear signal that the investment carries a high degree of risk. Also cumulative schemes give better yields compared with regular income options, as the interest is reinvested at the coupon rates.																								Fifth, remember that the theory of diversification holds for company deposits too and can be achieved by spreading investments across industries and sectors. It can also be achieved by choosing the appropriate term.																								Sixth, check the duration of these deposits  they vary from six months to several years. It is advisable to opt for a shorter term. It gives an opportunity to review the companys performance and the option of withdrawing the money. Also, never renew the deposits without first asking for a refund on maturity. Finally, always keep tabs on the performance of the company through annual reports and share price movements. This helps in making an informed decision about whether to renew the deposit.

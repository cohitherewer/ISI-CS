 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Canon India president and CEO Alan Grant (centre) in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, April 27: Canon India, the digital imaging company, is in talks with cellphone firms to form marketing alliances to sell mobile printers.																								We are negotiating with Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola. However, nothing has been finalised as yet. In a competitive world, it is important to forge marketing alliances which will result into brand leverage for both companies, said Alok Bhardwaj, director and general manager (consumer imaging and information division), Canon India, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Canon Singapore Pte.																								The company, which essentially sells inkjet printers and digital copiers, today introduced a range of 20 digital imaging products.																								These include seven digital cameras, two all-in-one photo printers, the companys first portable bluetooth mobile printer, three digital video camcorders for making movies and a home theatre projector among others. The prices of these products range from Rs 14,995 to Rs 99,995.																								Canon also hopes to expand its software unit located in India. At the moment we have 50 engineers working for us. The headcounts will be doubled in the next two years, said Bhardwaj.																								In India, Canon will face stiff competition in the printer segment from Hewlett Packard and Epson. However, for copiers, Xerox and Ricoh will be the main competitors. For digital cameras, Canon will compete with companies like Sony and Kodak. While for Camcorders, other key players in India include Panasonic and Sony.

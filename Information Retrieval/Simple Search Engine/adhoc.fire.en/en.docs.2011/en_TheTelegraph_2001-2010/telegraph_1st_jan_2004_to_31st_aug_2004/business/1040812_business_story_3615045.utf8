 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 RIL clears last bar for Trevira
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 11: The European Commission has approved the acquisition of German speciality polyester manufacturer Trevira by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). 																								The acquisition was announced on June 24 and the regulatory approval was vital for the acquisition process to be completed.																								A July 29 notification said for reasons set out in the notice on a simplified procedure, the commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement.																								Trevira has a capacity of 130,000 tonnes per annum of polyester fibre and yarn, spread over four locations in Europe namely Bobingen and Guben (Germany), Silkeborg (Denmark) and Quevaucamps (Belgium). It also has a state-of-the-art research and development (R amp;D) facility at Bobingen.																								With the acquisition of Trevira and expansions at home, the combined polyester fibre and filament yarn capacity of Reliance will exceed 1.8 million tonnes, making it the largest producer in the world.																								On the acquisition, leading UK-based polyester consultant PCI said the market was surprised that Reliance snapped up Trevira in Germany. They achieved this ahead of two other candidates from Greater Europe, who had possibly expected to acquire the business for a minimal outlay.

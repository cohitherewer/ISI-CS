 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 CSE members in a heated argument with secretary P. K. Ray after the bourses annual general meeting in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Jan. 7: The Calcutta Stock Exchanges annual general meeting was adjourned for the second time in two years, with members refusing to approve the bourses accounts for 2001-02 and 2002-03. The Sebi-appointed administrator of the bourse, who called off the meeting after members started voicing their grievances, announced later that the meeting would be reconvened in six weeks.																								Most important, the crucial resolution proposing demutualisation of exchange was not adopted though most of the hundred-odd members who attended the meeting, were inclined to approve it. We, the brokers representatives on the board of the exchange, had approved the demutualisation scheme in July last year, and all of us would have given our nod to it in todays meeting. But it was adjourned even before the issue came up for discussion, said a former broker-director of the exchange.																								Tushar Kanti Das, the administrator, said the meeting had to be adjourned as members created a pandemonium. I may not understand the capital markets well, but I am a good administrator. The next time the meeting is convened, well ensure better administrative preparation, he said. His administrative steps today include trying to keep the media out of the meeting, but he was forced to rescind his decision on barring the media when members threatened to boycott the meeting in protest.																								Das, who describes himself as the representative of the state government and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said Writers Buildings had pledged full support for the bourses revival. The bourses management, however, doesnt seem to have a convincing plan to drive it out of the woods.																								Das said his mandate was to resurrect the bourse without altering its structure and operation, though Sebi chairman G. N. Bajpai has repeatedly said that regional bourses couldnt continue the way they are. 																								The chairman insists regional bourses should merge among themselves or with a larger exchange to stay afloat. Alternatively they could introduce trading in other assets.																								At the end of a long speech with little or no import, Das hinted at the exchange foraying into other businesses, but kept details under wraps like a good administrator.

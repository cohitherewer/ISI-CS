 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Long-distance IA flights set for takeoff
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Seatbelts on 																								New Delhi, July 9: Indian Airlines, the state-run domestic carrier, will soon be permitted to operate long-distance international flights and the government has started identifying these routes, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel.																								New routes are being identified for the airlines to operate along with Air-India, said Patel, adding that the permission to operate international flights, including short-distance ones, may be granted ahead of the proposed civil aviation policy, which is expected to be announced within the next few months.																								Care would be taken to ensure that Indian Airlines does not eat into or compete with Air-India on these routes, the minister said. Sources said cities in both Europe and East Asia  which Air-India is not keen on serving  will be offered to IA.																								The aviation minister said he would hold a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram on the issue of withdrawal of tax exemption on aircraft and aircraft engines in the budget for this fiscal.																								Industry officials said the exemption on lease-withholding-tax, if withdrawn, would incur an additional expenditure of around 42 per cent, which would have a knock-on effect on retail air-fares as it is likely to be shared by end-users, that is, the consumers.																								The yearly additional tax burden on Indian Airlines and Air-India would be up by Rs 86 crore and Rs 91 crore respectively, he said.																								We will request him to take a considerate view on the matter as the aviation sector is now coming out of difficult times, said Patel. But, first let both Indian Airlines and Air-India submit their views on this matter.																								There is enough time for discussions on the issue since it is scheduled to come into effect in September. I would also hold talks with the Planning Commission on several issues, including this one, said the minister.																								He said the aviation ministry would dip into the Rs 40,000-crore worth infrastructure fund to upgrade and strengthen the existing fleet of state-run airlines and modernise airports. Of this, Rs 14,000 crore has been earmarked for funding the two firms.

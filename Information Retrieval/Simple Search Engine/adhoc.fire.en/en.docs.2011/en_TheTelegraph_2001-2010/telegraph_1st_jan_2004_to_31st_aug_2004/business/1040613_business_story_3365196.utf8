 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 SPS to foray into mining
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 12: The city-based Rs 400-crore SPS group is set to venture into mining in order to have captive source of raw materials for its steel making facilities in Orissa and West Bengal.																								The group, which is setting up a greenfield sponge iron manufacturing unit at Jharsuguda in Orissa at an investment of Rs 380 crore, is going to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government to get mining leases for coal and iron ore.																								According to P. Patnaik, chairman and managing director of Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Orissa Ltd (Ipicol), the MoU is expected to be signed by the end of this month.																								The Jharsuguda project of the SPS group is being implemented on schedule and the MoU is certainly going to help them make the project a success, Patnaik said.																								According to the norms of the Orissa government, mining lease will be granted only after a company invests to set up factories in the state. Moreover, companies will get the lease only after 50 per cent of the investment is complete, Patnaik said.																								The SPS group has fulfilled both the norms as the Jharsuguda plant is almost nearing completion. According to SPS group managing director B. K. Vohra, the first phase of the Jharsuguda unit, built at an investment of Rs 120 core, will go on stream shortly. While the billet caster will be ready by January next year, the blast furnace and the power plant will come up by October 2005.

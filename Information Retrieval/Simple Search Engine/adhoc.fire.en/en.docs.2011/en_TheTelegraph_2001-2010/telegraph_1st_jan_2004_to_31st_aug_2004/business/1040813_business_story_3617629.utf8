 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Two Birla firms foray into power
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 12: Two Birla companies  Texmaco and Hindustan Motors (HM)  have decided to make a foray into power generation.																								While Hindustan Motors, the GP-CK Birla flagship, will set up a captive power plant of 6 MW at its Uttarpara factory, K. K. Birla group company Texmaco will sell 2.7 MW hydel power that will be generated in Rilly and Ronbong areas of Darjeeling district.																								A senior Hindustan Motors official said its Ambassador plant at Uttarpara requires 16 MW power and the annual bill comes to the tune of Rs 1.5 crore. The captive generation will reduce the power bill of the company. Hindustan Motors will use rice husk, a major renewable energy source, for power generation.																								Texmaco will sell power to the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB). The two projects will have to be completed by 2007.																								The Birla companies have evinced interest to set up the plants following the Bengal governments decision to invite private parties to develop power from renewable energy sources.																								The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA) had invited private firms to invest in this sector. Initially, about 27 companies applied and after a thorough scrutiny, the WBREDA selected 23 companies to produce about 100 MW (composite capacity) power. The estimated investment is around Rs 750 crore.																								It is expected that the power units will be set up by 2007 and there will be a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emission due to these plants. 																								Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee today handed over the allotment letters to these 23 companies.																								Banerjee said there is a potential of generating 400 MW of power from renewable energy sources. We have decided to develop 150 MW out of this 400 MW through private participation. Another 50 MW will be produced by the WBREDA jointly with the WBSEB. 																								The state already generates 22 MW power from non-conventional energy sources, providing power to 1,000 villages.																								However, the technicalities involved in wheeling power from these power plants to the WBSEB need to be looked into.																								WBSEB chairman Sanjay Mitra said, The electricity regulatory commission has asked us to buy green power. We are also keen to buy it. But technical issues have to be sorted out first so that the wheeling of power from these units to us becomes smooth.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Competition to hit profits
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 1: A study conducted by Crisil on the housing finance sector has shown that the industrys overall profitability could come under pressure due to low incremental return on equity. This could even push up interest rates by 50-100 basis points, according to the rating agency.																								While a rise in interest rates could be curtailed if the industry players are able to contain their non-performing loans, Crisil said the incremental returns are low due to competitive pressures in the industry, driving down yields. Moreover, the non-performing loans are also fairly high.																								Housing loan rates have fallen by about 675 basis points since April 2000, which is higher than a decline of 582 basis points in the benchmark 10-year government securities rate. Last year, housing loan rates have declined by 250 basis points.																								On the other hand, non-performing loans are high at about 3.3 per cent compared with that in developed countries like 0.78 per cent in the US.																								Competition in the housing finance industry has intensified after banks have renewed their thrust on this business for its high yields and low non-performing loans, according to the rating agency.																								Banks, which had a market share of only about 20 per cent in 1999-2000, are the largest financiers today with a market share of over 50 per cent.																								Competition has led to a sharp decline in housing finance rates and an improvement in service standards, which has led to the expansion of the market. It has also compelled players to reduce their administrative costs and processing fees, which were even waived off in various cases. These factors have put pressure on the lenders spreads.																								Crisil said apart from genuine economic problems such as loss of jobs and life, and illness, non-performing loans are on the rise due to willing defaulters and an emerging population of fraudsters over the past two years.

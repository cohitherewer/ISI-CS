 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Survey sees 7% growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 23: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has forecast a GDP growth rate of 6.6 to 7 per cent for fiscal 2004-05 in its state of the economy report released here today.																								We believe that the upswing in services and industry will continue and indeed accelerate over the next few quarters, as domestic and external demand continues to strengthen, the chamber said. Companies across the board are preparing to meet the rising demand by expanding capacity, modernising technology and focusing on marketing strategies, CII noted in its report.																								The services sector is expected to grow at a faster pace. While the industry is expected to grow at 7 per cent, the services sector may clock a 9.2 per cent growth rate in 2004-05. This is due to rising income in rural and urban economies, which support greater spending on services ranging from transport and communications to financial services.																								CII believes that agricultural growth will be lower than last years double-digit growth, but it will not be difficult for farm output to grow by about 2 percentage points taking into account predictions of a normal monsoon.																								According to aggregate data on corporate performance analysed by the chamber, the manufacturing sector has maintained a healthy growth trend over the fourth quarter of 2003-04.																								However, the chamber has expressed apprehension on the sharp appreciation of the rupee, which may have an impact on the competitiveness of exports. The appreciation of the Indian currency against the dollar has been one of the sharpest in comparison to several south-east Asian countries, CII pointed out. But with the dollar changing direction to appreciate against major currencies in the international market, it expects less pressure on the rupee in the near term.																								With the third quarter GDP growth being pegged at 10.4 per cent (the highest ever since the Central Statistical Organisation began providing quarterly GDP estimates), the chamber expects CSO to revise its GDP estimate of 8.1 per cent for fiscal 2003-04.																								Given the excellent performance in the agricultural sector, CII is factoring in 9 per cent growth in the fourth quarter, which will take the full year GDP growth to 8.4 per cent.

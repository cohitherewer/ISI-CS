 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, July 25: Eli Lilly, a global pharmaceuticals major,has recently launched Forteo, its osteoporosis (a bone disease) drug in India. The drug is supposed to be the only one that actually helps re-build bones and not only arrest loss in a patient. 																								However, the treatment from Lilly does not come cheap. The cost per day for the drug therapy comes to about Rs 1000. On an average, a patient requires therapy ranging between six and 16 months. The drug is being imported to India at present from Lillys production facilities in the US and attracts a custom duty of 40 per cent.																								Osteoporosis is a disease marked by the weakening of the bone with a propensity to fractures. In India, there is an estimated Rs 14-crore market for drugs related to osteoporosis. Like insulin, the medication is needed to be injected through a pen meant for the purpose. 																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Eli Lilly spokesperson Anurag Khera said, All other drugs available in the market for osteoporosis are anti-resorptive... ...they prevent bone loss, where as Forteo actually re builds the bones which has withered away due to the disease. This is the USP of the product. 																								Worldwide, the lifetime risk for osteoporotic fractures in women is 30 to 40 per cent.

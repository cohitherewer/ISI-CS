 VIVEK NAIR				 Fuel for thought 																								Mumbai, Jan. 4: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is looking to retail petroleum in overseas markets, including Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar.																								The overseas plans are part of the companys drive to emerge as a vertically integrated and diversified transnational energy major from a pure sectoral company focussed on the downstream sector.																								While the existing regulations in some of these markets do not permit setting up of retail outlets by overseas companies, IOC hopes to make its presence felt soon after they are liberalised.																								In some markets, we already provide bulk supplies of various products, including LPG, lubes and bitumen. Therefore, once these markets are liberalised, establishing a presence should not be difficult, a source said.																								IOC had earlier signed two agreements with Nepal Oil Corporation for supplying petroleum products and sharing technical expertise. As part of the product supply agreement, IOC met the kingdoms entire requirement of petrol, diesel, kerosene, LPG and aviation fuel from the corporations depots bordering that country.																								We are looking to expand operations in Nepal as and when the regulations permit, the source said.																								Sources added that the Bangladesh market is also expected to open up where IOC supplies various products. Both Bangladesh and Myanmar are among the countries where IOC is looking for opportunities to secure oil and gas equity.																								These plans follow its successful foray into Sri Lanka, where the company envisages its market share reaching around 40 per cent in the coming months.																								Earlier this year, Indian Oil had become the first Indian petroleum company to conduct full-fledged retail business in an overseas market. As part of the agreement, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Sri Lankan national oil company, divested 100 retail outlets to Lanka IOC, the Navratnas 100 per cent subsidiary in the island nation.

 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 IA, Alliance jack up fares by 10 per cent
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 16: The continuous rise in the prices of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) saw Indian Airlines, the domestic carrier, and its subsidiary, Alliance Airways, announcing a 10 per cent hike in their fares with effect from June 21.																								Jet Airways, Air Sahara and Air Deccan have already announced fare increases.																								Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had said on Tuesday that he would be meeting Union petroleum minister Mani Shanker Aiyar next week to discuss the disparity in local taxes on aviation fuel.																								An Indian Airlines spokesperson said the increased fares would be effective on all tickets issued on or after June 21 but shall not affect the confirmed tickets issued on or before the cut-off date.																								The spokesperson said that the increase was necessitated due to a spurt in global crude prices that has added Rs 200 crore more to the fuel cost of Indian Airlines and Alliance Air than the budgeted estimate for 2004-05.																								The ATF price has increased from Rs 21,530 per kilolitre (kl) in March this year to Rs 26,000 per kl this month, he said. In February, the price stood at Rs 23,130 per kl and went on to an all-time high of Rs 26,000 per kl in June.

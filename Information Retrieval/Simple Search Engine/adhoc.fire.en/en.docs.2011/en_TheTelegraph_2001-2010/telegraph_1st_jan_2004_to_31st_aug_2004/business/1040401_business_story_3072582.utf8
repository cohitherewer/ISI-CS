 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 31: Public sector giant Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has closed the financial year 2003-04 with an all-time high saleable steel output of 11 metric tonnes. This is 6 per cent higher than the corresponding figure of the previous year. 																								SAIL officials said the rise in output was despite recent cutbacks in production in all integrated steel plants because of a shortage of high-grade coking coal. The company also registered a 7 per cent year-on-year increase in sales to touch a peak of 10.8 million tonnes during the year. The steel major exports recorded a jump of 36 per cent over the previous year.																								The high output coupled with cost reduction and resurgence of the global steel market enabled SAIL to finally enter the profit zone after a gap of five years. 																								SAIL had in January reported a sharp rise in profits, booking as much as Rs 1,497 crore in net profits at the end of the third quarter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Dena Bank fresh float in June
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Khandelwal in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, March 23: Dena Bank plans to come up with its second public issue of over Rs 100 crore in June this year. Post-issue, the governments holding in the bank will come down to 51 per cent from 71 per cent. 																								To raise its tier-II capital, the bank will float rated subordinate bonds of Rs 150 crore this month with a 66.2 per cent coupon rate. This will take the capital adequacy of the bank from 8.67 per cent to 9 per cent by March 31 this year.																								We will float a Rs 80-crore issue with a premium once the profit figures for 2003-04 are out. The size will be more than Rs 100 crore. The premium has not been decided yet. It will depend on the condition of the market at the time of flotation, said chairman A. K. Khandelwal.																								The banks shares are trading at Rs 26 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The share capital of the bank will touch Rs 286 crore after the second float.																								High non-performing assets (NPA) are one of Dena Banks major concerns. We are saddled with a gross NPA of Rs 1,600 crore, which is 17 per cent of gross advances and a net NPA of Rs 950 crore, which is 11 per cent of net advances, said Khandelwal.																								The bank is trying to bring down the gross NPA level to below 10 per cent and the net NPA level to 6 per cent by the end of 2004-05. In 2003-04, the bank managed to trim NPAs by Rs 450 crore through cash recovery, write-offs and upgradation of certain accounts.																								The bank has started a special drive to recover sticky assets. NPA recovery is not the job of the recovery department alone. I have asked all my 10,500 employees to try and recover these assets, the chairman said.																								The bank is targeting a business of Rs 29,000 crore next fiscal. Special emphasis will be on retail advances. 																								Only 6 per cent of our total credit goes towards retail lending. We would like to increase it to 15 per cent by the end of 2004-05. The housing loan portfolio, which now stands at Rs 500 crore, will increase to Rs 1,200 crore by 2004-05, he said.

 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Fund managers at the crossroads
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, July 8: The mutual fund industry seems to be a little baffled; while it is jubilant about the measures announced for equity schemes, fund managers are sceptical about the fate of debt funds.																								The abolition of long-term capital gains and reduction in short-term capital gains tax on equity funds is a positive move for the markets. Also, the continued exemption of dividend distribution tax on equity funds is a welcome step.																								Moreover, the favourable budget announcements and an absence of policy reversals will put an end to the concerns of fund managers over the way the government is heading. All this would help spur the growth of the capital markets and thus benefit the equity funds. 																								It is a pro-foreign institutional investment budget. The moves to introduce value-added tax and decrease fiscal deficit will help restore faith of global fund managers in Indian markets, Kotak Mutual Fund chief executive officer Ajay Bagga said.																								The budget gave a pleasant surprise by being favourable on various sectors and all these will spur the equity market, thereby benefiting the equity funds, UTI Mutual Fund chief investment officer A. K. Sridhar said.																								The only cause of concern is the transaction tax, which will add to the cost of the fund. But again, many feel that the positive side is that it would attract long-term funds into the market and put a stop to speculative activities.																								The budget was much more than we expected and the dust over 0.15 per cent transaction cost will settle in a few trading sessions, said Sridhar.																								But on the debt funds side, all the mutual fund houses are awaiting clarifications as to whether the transaction tax will be applicable to debt securities also. It may impact the volumes in the debt markets since the profit margins on debt securities are extremely low and a charge of 15 basis points on every transaction will absolutely wreak havoc.																								Chola Mutual Fund chief executive Sashi Krishnan said, It is a good budget but there is some confusion caused by the transaction tax. It is not yet clear whether it will be for both equity and debt transactions. The budget has also not been able to clarify as to whether the transaction tax is restricted to delivery-based deals or it will be levied on all transactions.																								On the other hand, the 75 per cent increase in the investment limit for foreign institutional investors in debt markets from $1 billion to $1.75 billion could improve the liquidity in the debt market.																								Also, the budget has announced a dividend distribution tax of 20 per cent for companies whereas it will remain at 12.5 per cent for individuals and hindu undivided families. 																								Moreover, since a large chunk of the money in the debt mutual funds are from the companies, this move may affect the flow of corporate money. But again, the companies may now just choose the growth option instead of dividend option with attractive capital gains tax regime.																								Finance minister has also announced steps to put an end to dividend and bonus stripping in units by making suitable amendment to the section 94.																								This will encourage investors to look at mutual funds as a long-term investment vehicle and not only for tax savings, thus promoting growth in the industry, added Sridhar.																								While welcoming the decision to plug the loopholes with regard to dividend and bonus stripping, Alliance Capital Fund chief executive officer Rajnish Narula said, There is an area of concern in the applicability of the turnover tax with respect to the mutual funds industry.																								Commenting on the Union budget, Sanjay Sachdev, managing director of Principal PNB Asset Management Company, said, The finance minister has lived up to his commitment of being the countrys investment minister. It is a very pragmatic, forward-thinking, long-term investment-oriented budget. The focus clearly is to encourage long-term investment into India.																								Reaffirmation of the Defined Contribution Scheme for central government employees is a welcome step, which will pave the way for a much-needed voluntary pension system for all unorganised sector employees.

With the expansion at Ropar, the company can now produce 14.5 million tonnes annually. 																								The capacity rejig is expected to strengthen GACLs presence in north India.

The company has bought 8 lakh tonnes of fly ash from the Punjab State Electricity Board, up from the promised 2.5 lakh tonnes. 																								The industry is expecting a growth of 8 per cent during this year. A few companies are also planning to set up greenfield plants or engage in brownfield expansions.

While the project is expected to take 18 months, it will see the companys installed capacity rising to 3.6 million tonnes.

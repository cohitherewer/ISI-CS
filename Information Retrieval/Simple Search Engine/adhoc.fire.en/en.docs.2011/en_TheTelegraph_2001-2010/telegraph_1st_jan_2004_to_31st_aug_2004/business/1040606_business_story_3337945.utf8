 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 BoI mulls flotation
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 5: Bank of India (BoI) plans to tap the capital market through a public issue to augment its resources. It is the first public sector bank to go in for a flotation since the Congress-led government took charge at the Centre. Post-issue, the governments 69.47 per cent stake in the bank will come down. Institutional investors hold an 8.79 per cent stake in BoI, while 15.10 per cent is with the public. The remaining is held by NRIs and private corporate bodies.																								The money raised from the issue will accrue to the bank instead of the government as it is issuing fresh equity. The banks board will meet on June 12 to consider the issue.																								The bank is now focussing on retail credit. It has projected domestic advances for the current fiscal at 17 per cent. The focus on retail credit is expected to result in its share of the total advances rising by 4 per cent to 28 per cent. 																								The bank has posted a net profit of Rs 349.1 crore in the fourth quarter of 2003-04 against Rs 282.53 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. However, total income dipped from Rs 2,155.31 crore in the same quarter of 2002-03 to Rs 2,059 crore last year.																								For the whole of 2003-04, the bank has posted a net profit of Rs 1,008.32 crore compared with Rs 851 crore in the previous year. Total income has increased from Rs 7,570.59 crore to Rs 7,587.89 crore.																								Last fiscal saw a UK court awarding compensation to the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in respect of certain transactions of earlier years entered in the normal course of business at the banks London and Cayman Islands branches.																								However, BoI had made provision of Rs 364.64 crore which was adjusted against the accumulated balance in revenue and other reserves.																								BoI is the second bank after ICICI Bank to come out with a public issue in this fiscal. ICICI Banks issue, one of the largest offering of equity shares, opened for bidding through the book building route on April 2. 																								The ICICI Bank issue would strengthen the capital base and help the bank tap various growth opportunities in retail credit and insurance. ICICI Bank had said that with the economy on a growth path of over 8 per cent, the money raised from the offering would adequately fulfil business growth plans for the next four years.

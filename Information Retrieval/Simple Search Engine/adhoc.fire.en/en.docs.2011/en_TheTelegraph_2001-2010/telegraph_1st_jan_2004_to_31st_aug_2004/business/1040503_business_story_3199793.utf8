 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 IOC pulls plug on Numaligarh
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 2: Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) could end up taking a Rs 40-crore hit during this fiscal as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has decided not to buy any petrol or diesel from the company.																								IOC was picking up as much as 40 per cent of petrol and diesel produced by NRL, while the remaining was marketed by parent company Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL).																								Sources say IOC has stopped purchasing diesel and petrol from NRL since April 1 this year although it is continuing to buy kerosene and LPG which are in short supply in the country.																								The surplus petrol and diesel now has to be sold through BPCL retail outlets which are situated in other states.																								NRL will have to dispatch its products to BPCL depots near Delhi, Mathura and Budge Budge for sale through the companys outlets in these regions. 																								However, this also means that NRL will have to pay much higher freight costs that will eat into its profits. 																								The problem has arisen as BPCL has very few retail outlets in Assam and the Northeast, which are dominated completely by IOC. Since BPCL does not have a refinery in the northern region it has decided to feed its retail chain in the region from NRL. Earlier it was picking up products from the IOC refineries in Mathura and Panipat to supply its retail network. 																								The price of petrol and diesel in the north is higher than the eastern region since it is linked to import parity prices at Kandla which is higher than the Haldia price on which the Northeast prices are based. However, this is not sufficient to compensate the huge freight cost involved in dispatching the products over such a long distance.																								Since NRL is already under siege due to the shortage of railway wagons, this problem is likely to increase further as more tank wagons will now be required to send products to these distant places. The turnaround time of the wagons will also be longer.

 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Surety for STD firms halved
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 18: National long-distance telephone operators received a pre-budget sop today with the government reducing the performance bank guarantee by 50 per cent to Rs 50 crore. The measure, however, did not satisfy the operators, who wanted the guarantee scrapped.																								The operators will be able to recover Rs 25 crore of the amount they stump up once they complete the roll-out obligation. Once the notification is issued, the operators will get Rs 75 crore  Rs 50 crore as refund and Rs 25 crore for establishing point-of-presence (PoP), which all firms have already established.																								Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran said, The department will soon be issuing the notification. The procedures are also being simplified so that the guarantee money can be quickly released once the performance is reported.																								R. . Prabhakar, deputy director-general of value-added service in the department of telecommunications (DoT), explained, The operators pay a licence fee of Rs 100 crore and a performance bank guarantee (PBG) of Rs 400 crore. There are four phases for the completion of roll-out obligations  Rs 100 crore for each. The operators were given Rs 100 crore after completion of each phase. Now, they will immediately get Rs 50 crore  Rs 25 crore after setting up PoP and Rs 25 crore after completing the rollout of network. Effectively, the guarantee has come down by 50 per cent.																								The operators can either get a self-assessment certificate or get the Telecom Engineering Centre to certify the completion of point-of-presence  installation of the equipment at the site, Prabhakar added. 																								However, the industry is not satisfied and wants the surety removed. The communications ministry had agreed to reduce it by 90 per cent, but it was finally fixed at 50 per cent.																								We welcome the move but there is no logic for the guarantee when we are setting up networks at huge costs. We pay taxes and a licence fee but there is no PBG. Why should there be a PBG for rolling out networks, Bharti chief Sunil Mittal said.

 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, July 13: ONGC expects to take a hit of around Rs 300 crore due to the service tax on oil exploration activities that finance minister P. Chidambaram has introduced in his budget.																								The service tax will in a way hit ONGC where it hurts the most as it will make the costly and high-risk deep sea oil exploration more expensive.																								ONGC is handling exploration in the onshore and shallow water areas on its own as it has the requisite expertise. The service tax will not be applicable for these operations as no services are hired.																								However, since ONGC does not have the technology to carry out exploration work in deep sea areas, it has hired state-of-the-art foreign rigs to carry out these operations. These are very costly operations as there are very few rigs of this class in the world.																								A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph, It is these foreign companies that will have to pay the tax and it is not clear at this point as to how much of the impost they will pass on to us. But preliminary estimates put the expected cost to ONGC at around Rs 300 crore.																								Banks do not give any loans for oil exploration as it is considered a high-risk business and oil companies have to finance oil exploration activity out of their own funds. The service tax will, therefore, only serve to make these operations costlier for the national oil companies.																								Critics of Chidambarams service tax point out that it is out of sync with the countrys new exploration policy (NELP). On the one hand, the government has offered a tax-friendly regime to both Indian and foreign oil companies in an attempt to step up the oil exploration drive in the country. Royalty rates have also been slashed and tax concessions extended particularly for exploration in the deep sea areas.																								The rationale behind the policy was that there have been no big oil finds in recent years and there was an urgent need to make some fresh strikes. The service tax is thus seen as a contradiction to this basic approach adopted in the NELP.																								India has made desperate attempts to attract global oil majors such as Exxon-Mobil, Shell, Chevron and Total to join the countrys oil hunt as these companies have the best technology. The efforts have come a cropper as the global oil giants do not see India as a major oil destination.																								A couple of small foreign firms like Cairn Energy of the UK and Niko Resources of Canada are the only ones that the country has managed to attract.

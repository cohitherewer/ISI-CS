 SATISH JOHN AND VIVEK NAIR				 	 Looking for more																								Mumbai, April 18: Having made a killing on the stock markets in the past financial year, foreign institutional investors are looking at alternate investment propositions, including the nascent securitisation market in the country.																								If they (FIIs) invest in asset-backed securities, this would be perhaps the first time that they are investing in a security with a tenure of 10-20 years, a banker affiliated to the structured finance segment said.																								Securitisation is a process through which illiquid assets are packaged by lenders, converted into tradable securities and sold to third-party investors. Such securities are referred to as asset-backed securities. This allows banks to unlock funds that otherwise would have been locked for at least 10-20 years. By selling asset-backed securities, they can keep rolling funds to finance more loans to customers.																								It is the first time we have noticed FIIs scouting around for securitised assets, a segment in which they have never invested before in India, the banker said.																								FIIs like ABN Amro, CSFB and Deutsche are believed to be interested in asset-backed securities, a market that runs into billions of dollars abroad, an official said.																								Banks such as ICICI Bank have used the securitisation route to refinance their lending capacities. It allows them to continue with their aggressive lending to capture market share as they reduce risks by repackaging their loan assets into asset-backed securities and selling to investors like insurance companies.																								If the FIIs buy such securities, it would provide a much-needed spark as the market has very few participants.																								ICICI Bank, Citibank and GE Capital have spun off asset-based securities to investors in a bid to refinance and churn their investment portfolios.																								Public sector banks have so far kept away from the sector. This is primarily because the norms governing this sector are still fluid and the bank may prefer the securitisation market to develop a critical mass. 																								Insurance companies, however, are prominent investors in this sector, led by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).																								It gels with their investment needs, as they want an attractive yield with a reasonably long tenure.																								Meanwhile, private sector banks, looking at securitisation in unlocking capital and helping them in exposure management, point out that corporate treasury has slowly began to evince interest in securitised instruments that include mortgage-backed securities.																								Currently, banks, mutual funds and insurance companies are the predominant investor class associated with securitisation.																								IDBI Bank recently met with success in tapping the new corporate segment. The bank conducted a mortgage-backed securities of Rs 82 crore across seven investors, including banks, insurance firms and companies.

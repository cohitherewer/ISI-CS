The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Knock-on effect on primary market
 OUR BUREAUX The shows over 																								May 17: The meltdown in Indian stocks, which has began on concerns of slow reforms, would have a knock-on effect on the primary market and also partially on the debt market, analysts said.																								The current jolt will trigger some caution on part of investors and help judge an initial public offering by the inherent merit of the company and not only on the supply and demand factor, said Anand Radhakrishnan, who helps manage Rs 2,000 crore in stocks at Sundaram Newton Asset Management Co in Chennai.																								According to analysts, concerns over a slowdown in the pace of economic reforms, coupled with withering foreign institutional investor (FII) interest in domestic capital markets, could delay the capital raising programmes of many companies.																								As the cash markets came to terms with a whopping 565-point drop in the BSE sensex, Mahesh Chhabria, chief operating officer, Enam Financial Consultants Pvt Ltd, said the primary markets will receive a jolt and will take some time to recover.																								The Indian bourses, which sucked out Rs 18,000 crore through public offer of state-run firms and some private sector companies, was set to witness the stake sale of several blue-chip stocks, including Tata Consultancy Services and National Thermal Power Corp.																								Shoppers Stop, the retail chain is also expected to come out with an IPO of Rs 150 crore to fund its expansion plans. The money will be used to open 16 new stores in the country in the next three years.																								Mondays losses extended a 6.1 per cent drop at the previous session, dubbed Black Friday which began on concerns that economic reforms would suffer under a Congress-led government, and particularly lucrative privatisation.																								There was some unhealthy trend in the primary market where the demand for a stock was created not in relation to the fundamentals, but to funding by financial institutions, which led to some kind of artificial demand with sometimes the company overstating its objectives, said P. K. Choudhury, managing director of rating firm Icra.																								Among the prominent names set to tap the market were: TCS (Rs 4,000 crore), SET India (Rs 200 crore), Shoppers Stop (Rs 100 crore), Central Bank of India (Rs 300 crore), and Hutchison Max Telecom (Rs 400 crore).																								The market is in a state of shock and an IPO plan needs to be postponed in spite of the companys effort to provide a quality investment vehicle, said an equity analyst.																								There is nothing wrong with these companies for they are fairly good firms, but a lot would depend on the quantum of money they are looking for and whether the market has that kind of appetite, said Radhakrishnan.

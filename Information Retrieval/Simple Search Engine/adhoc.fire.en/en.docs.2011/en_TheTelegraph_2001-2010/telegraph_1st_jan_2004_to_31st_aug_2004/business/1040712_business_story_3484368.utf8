Historically, both equity and debt funds have given better returns than the stock market and other fixed income instruments respectively. But the return is not guaranteed, as is their performance. You can check the return generated by 200 top mutual fund schemes in the scorecard that we carry on our stocks page. For further information on schemes not covered by us, you should refer to the fact sheets published by the fund houses at the end of every month.

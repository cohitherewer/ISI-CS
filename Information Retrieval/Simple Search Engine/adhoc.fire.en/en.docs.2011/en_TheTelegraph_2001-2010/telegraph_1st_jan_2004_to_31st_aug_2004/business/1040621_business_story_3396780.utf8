 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 IOC row lands on Aiyars table
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, June 20: There is trouble brewing in Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) with the officers association having approached petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to complain against the management. The issue appears to have snowballed with the associations of other oil majors, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and Oil India (OIL), backing their IOC counterparts.																								At the heart of the matter is a show-cause notice issued by the IOC management to the president of the officers association for questioning the decision of the company chairman on the quantum of punishment meted out to a junior officer in a corruption case related to the Panipat refinery.																								The petroleum minister is reported to have met the office bearers of the Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA), the umbrella organisation of all the public sector oil majors, and assured them that he would look into the matter.																								IOC officers association president E. Haque had alleged in a letter to the management that the disciplinary action against junior-most officers was the most stringent and claimed they were innocent as they were merely carrying out orders. His letter goes on to state that the decision taken by the management in awarding the punishment is irrational, biased and arbitrary.																								The management has issued a show-cause notice to Haque as to why disciplinary action should not be initiated against him for an act of insubordination and a blatant attempt to interfere and subvert the due disciplinary procedures of the company. He has also been accused of creating friction between the IOC management and employees. 																								The OSOA has stated in its representation to the petroleum minister that Haque had written the letter to the management in his capacity as the president of the IOC officers association. It has further stated that he was forced to resort to a written communication as the management had not held any meeting with the association for the last nine months and such meetings are supposed to be held regularly.																								Haques supporters feel that as president of the association he can question the decision of the management. 																								The show-cause notice, on the other hand, has been issued to him by the management in his status as an ordinary senior manager of the company.																								The IOC management has taken the stand that all company employees, no matter what their status or standing, are bound by the discipline of the corporation. They cannot arrogate to themselves the right to subvert the rules or due processes of the company which provide remedies by way of appeals for aggrieved employees.																								To be fair to the IOC management, it has been steering the company well and the profits and overall business expansion plans have shown a marked improvement with M. S. Ramachandran taking over as chairman.

 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Inflation puts India Shining under shade
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Singh: Balancing act																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: Finance minister Jaswant Singh today admitted that inflation had peaked at over 6 per cent, taking some of the sheen off his governments India Shining campaign. It (inflation) has peaked. The rise was mainly due to petrol and diesel prices, Singh told reporters here.																								The finance minister, however, refused to comment on the sudden meltdown in stock prices today that saw the sensex tumble by over 160 points after market regulator Sebi launched investigations into a sudden surge in scrip prices. 																								The continued bull run on the stock market has also been a key element in the controversial series of ads released by the finance ministry highlighting Indias economic achievements ahead of elections to the 542-member Lok Sabha. 																								The BJP is banking on a series of feel-good factors, which include bumper harvests after a good monsoon, rising stock prices, record forex reserves, lower interest rates and a spate of fiscal and economic sops for various segments of society. 																								The finance minister, who announced the fourth instalment of incentives yesterday, is widely expected to announce another with his interim budget which could include a package for bureaucrats including another instalment of dearness allowance, release of about 4 per cent of their pay as well as merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with their salaries.																								Part of the reason for announcing a series of sops is seen as a feeling that the feel-good factor is losing its sheen. It has been batting on its backfoot after government data revealed jobs have been shrinking in the last two years and the number of poor in rural India may have gone up.																								Singh and his team of bureaucrats who made a presentation to the media on a new tax information system set up by the ministry which will allow electronic filing of tax returns and electronic transfer of taxes and refund, today claimed that their management of the economy could well lead to fiscal deficit being contained at levels lower than that budgeted.																								They said with tax collections exceeding budgeted targets and expenditures being contained at lower than expected levels, this was a possibility. 																								Officials said direct tax collections surged by 22.8 per cent to Rs 66,761 crore till January 15. Going by the current trend, particularly in corporate tax, the government is expected to exceed the budget target by Rs 6,000 crore, revenue secretary Vineeta Rai said. The target for 2003-04 fiscal is Rs 95,569 crore.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 31: Allotment problems in the ONGC issue were festering even today amid claims from bidders that new shares had not reached their demat accounts.																								Senior officials at Central Depository Services Ltd, which holds the 14.25 crore ONGC shares the government has offloaded in the public offer, confirmed it still has to receive the allotment advice for a large chunk of the issue. 																								We still have nine crore shares waiting to be credited to demat accounts of successful applicants. Till late this evening, we havent been sounded by the registrars, a CDSL source said. 																								Qualified institutional investors and high net worth investors bid for more shares than was reserved for them, while retail applicants fell short of their quota. 																								Many of our clients are yet to receive information on the ONGC allotment, a dealer affiliated to a brokerage said. 																								While 50 per cent of the issue was earmarked for institutions, 25 per cent each was set aside for high net worth investors and small investors. 																								The under-subscription in the retail segment meant that the allotment would be 100 per cent  investors will get as many shares as they had asked for. In the other two categories, there would be proportional allotment.																								What happened instead was that the registrars error gave the high net worth category 100 per cent allotment. After this was discovered, the share transfers were reversed and corrective action initiated.																								What is surprising is that not a single allotment has been made to institutions  a category out of the controversy.

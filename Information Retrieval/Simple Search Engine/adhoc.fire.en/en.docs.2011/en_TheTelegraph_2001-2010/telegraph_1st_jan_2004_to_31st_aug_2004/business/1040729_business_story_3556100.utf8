 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Bharti Infotel to move court on refund demand
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Turned down																								New Delhi, July 28: Bharti Infotel, a subsidiary of Bharti Tele-Ventures (BTVL), is planning to soon move court against the department of telecommunications (DoT) order refusing to refund Rs 145 crore for the four licences  Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu  that it had surrendered following the change in telecom licensing policy.																								DoT has sent a letter to Bharti Infotel stating that its request cannot be entertained since the licence agreement signed by them stipulates that in case of transfer of licence the company would not be eligible for any refund.																								Last month, Bharti Infotel had formally informed DoT that it was surrendering its basic (fixed line) licence. It had said, This move is necessitated by a change in policy, ushering in the Unified Access Service Licence (UASL) regime, which did not take into account fixed and mobile licences being held by the same group in the same service area, thereby resulting in a redundant licence. We also seek refund of the entry fee, amounting to Rs 145 crore paid at the time of acquisition of these licences.																								The UASL licence merged the basic and mobile licences and allowed them to offer mobile and fixed-line services with one licence. Bharti executives said the governments migration policy had created such clauses that even those operators who held both the basic and cellular licence were forced to adopt the UASL licence.																								The company had no alternative but to move to UASL. As a result, the basic licence had become redundant for the company and this was the reason for us demanding refund from DoT, a senior Bharti executive said.																								Sources in the Bharti group said, We are yet to receive any letter from DoT on the issue of refund but we are prepared to take legal option at any time if the request is rejected.

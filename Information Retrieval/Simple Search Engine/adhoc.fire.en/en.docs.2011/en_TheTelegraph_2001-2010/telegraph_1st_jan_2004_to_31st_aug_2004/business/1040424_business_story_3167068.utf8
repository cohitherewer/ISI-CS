 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 23: Hindustan Motors Ltd, which has a technical collaboration with Japans Mitsubishi Motors Corp, today said the impact of DaimlerChrysler AG pulling the plug on the Japanese carmaker is not clear yet.																								DaimlerChrysler, which holds a 37 per cent stake in Mitsubishi, said the company would not participate in a critical capital fund-raising to rescue the loss-making Asian group as it could not seal a deal with its other prime shareholders.																								DaimlerChrysler may reclassify its stake in Mitsubishi as available for sale. However, Mitsubishi Motors shares were suspended from trade in Japan today. Without financial support from DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi Motors need for debt restructuring has heightened, said Standard amp; Poors. 																								Mitsubishi, Japans fourth largest carmaker, has stated that it was evaluating the situation and would make further announcements later. 																								Its Indian partner, Hindustan Motors, also adopted a similar stand saying, We will need to see how the situation develops and it is too early to predict. Hindustan Motors, owned by the CK Birla group, currently makes the Lancer sedan in collaboration with Mitsubishi at its factory in the outskirts of Chennai.

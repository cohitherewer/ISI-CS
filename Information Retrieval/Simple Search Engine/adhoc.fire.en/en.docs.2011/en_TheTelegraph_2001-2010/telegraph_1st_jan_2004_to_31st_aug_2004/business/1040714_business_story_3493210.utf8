Infosys business from overseas customers increased, and while the cry against offshore services continued in the US, Nilekani said it had eased now.																								Revenues for the second quarter ending September are expected to grow 42 to 43 per cent to Rs 1,631 crore- Rs 1,645 crore, while the EPS has been projected at Rs 15.10. We continue to see a stable pricing environment, said chief operating officer S. Gopalakrishnan.																								In all, 29 new clients and 2,305 employees joined in the first quarter. However, attrition had increased to 10.9 per cent.																								Infosys has planned a $21-million investment during the year. Pai said $16 million would be invested in life sciences, retail, insurance, European and APAC operations and $5 million in the banking business unit.

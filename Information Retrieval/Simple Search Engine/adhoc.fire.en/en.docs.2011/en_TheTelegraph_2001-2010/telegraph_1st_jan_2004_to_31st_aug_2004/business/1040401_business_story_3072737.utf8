 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Rupee at four-year high
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 31: The financial year 2003-04 ended with a bang for the rupee as the currency, armed with robust foreign fund inflows, closed at a four-year high of 43.65 to the dollar. During the day, the currency hit a 57-month peak of 43.35/37.																								The rupee thus gained around 9 per cent during 2003-04. Forex analysts feel the rupee would continue to appreciate tomorrow. However, its gain would get checked in the days ahead, they added.																								Amit Sharma, senior analyst of the forex advisory group at Mecklai, said the Reserve Bank, which has not interfered in the forex markets in the past few days, could now effectively step in to support the dollar. The proposed market stabilisation bonds are expected to provide the central bank with the armoury to check the rupees rapid rise.																								The rupee today breached the 43-mark in style after opening firm at 44.03/05 per dollar. The gain was largely due to huge inflows from foreign funds following the mega offers. 																								Another factor was the absence of RBI intervention. Analysts said the market was also encouraged by North Block statements which indicated that the authorities were comfortable with a rising rupee.																								With huge dollar inflows on one hand and lack of any worthwhile demand from companies, the rupee continued its climb.

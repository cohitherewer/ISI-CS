 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Wagon makers hardly on a roll
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, July 6: The sick wagon industry, 80 per cent of which is based in Bengal, is miles away from a turnaround with railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav hardly making any noteworthy proposal for fresh orders.																								The railway budget has made an investment proposal of only Rs 23.43 crore for fresh purchases, while Rs 1068.76 crore has been set aside to pay for orders already placed.																								Industry insiders felt that the wagon acquisition plan fails to meet common expectations, especially after five years of NDA rule, when orders almost dried up. 																								More important, the railway minister has proposed manufacturing of wagons at the Jamalpur Workshop in Bihar even as existing facilities have massive idle capacity.																								In the budget proposals, Yadav has stated that last year, there has been a considerable shortfall in the supply of wagons due to various reasons, with private sector units complying with only two-thirds of the orders placed and public sector units only a third.																								In 2003-04, only 13,471 four-wheeler units of traffic wagons were manufactured against our requirement of 19,050 units, he said in an attempt to build up his case for the new facility in Jamalpur Workshop  a unit where only cranes have been manufactured so far.																								Yadav said with the anticipated incremental loading, the railways have to take steps to augment wagon supply. 																								I had a dialogue with wagon manufacturers and impressed upon them the necessity to expedite supplies, he said, adding, To meet the demand, apart from pursuing existing wagon manufacturers, production also needs to be started at Jamalpur Workshop.																								The industry, however, feels otherwise. The proposed wagon production at Jamalpur Workshop is a retrograde step. Better planning and higher off-take are needed by the railways from existing units, which have substantial idle capacity, Texmaco president and CEO Ramesh Maheshwari said.																								About half a dozen units in the private and public sectors in Bengal have a combined capacity of over 30,000 wagons. Last year, delayed placement of orders for 19,000 units ensured that not even 40 per cent of these could be delivered by wagon makers, industry sources said.

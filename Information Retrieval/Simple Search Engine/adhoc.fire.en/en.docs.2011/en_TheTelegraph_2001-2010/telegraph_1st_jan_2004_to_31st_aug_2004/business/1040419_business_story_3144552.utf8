The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Bharti hub to make data calamity-proof
 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Figure it out																								New Delhi, April 18: Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd has assured its customers immediate resumption of services in case of a natural or man-made calamity.																								As a step towards establishing non-stop services for its customers come what may, Bharti has established a state-of-the-art data recovery facility in Chennai with an objective to have continuity in IT services. The company would provide uninterrupted customer care and no-delay, no-error billing for its customers even if its critical operations were hindered partially or completely owing to a disaster of any magnitude at the primary sites. 																								For instance, the company said it was equipped to handle adversities like the earthquake that hit Gujarat a few years ago or the attack on the World Trade Centre.																								While such initiatives were taken by infotech companies (after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US) to have a mirror site in a safe place in a different country, this is the first time that a domestic telecom company has set up such a centre.																								At Bharti, both its business units  AirTel (its cellular service) and Infotel (comprising basic telephony, broadband and long-distance services)  have the disaster recovery data centre facilities. 																								Jai Menon, director (IT and technology), IBM, said, The IT continuity mechanism built at these facilities has several levels of fail-over mechanisms that ensure continuity of systems as well as business in the event of a disaster, ensuring no service lapses for Bharti customers. The recovery time objective (RTO) is targeted to minimise data losses in the event of a disaster; two 45 Mbps links have been established for superior connectivity that facilitates an almost online data replication. A hybrid data architecture approach online and batch mode permits load balancing as well as scalability for rapidly growing business volume.																								Since Bharti has partnered with IBM to employ the latters global intellectual property (IP) systems and expertise to augment its existing infrastructure and has outsourced IT operations, IBM will manage the data recovery centre.																								Menon said, The data recovery centre has the most advanced self-healing, replication technology with primary sites and recovery mechanism for minimal interruption to business and overall customer services.																								A Bharti executive said the Tamil Nadu government takes pride in the centre and has accorded special infrastructure support in terms of location and uninterrupted power supply.

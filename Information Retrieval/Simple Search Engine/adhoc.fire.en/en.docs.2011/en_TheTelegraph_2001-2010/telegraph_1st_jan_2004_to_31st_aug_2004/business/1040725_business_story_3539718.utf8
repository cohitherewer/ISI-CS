 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Birlas stack up ammunition to fight Lodha
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Calcutta, July 24: The Birla family will produce a joint will of the late M. P. Birla and Priyamvada Birla to contest the probate petition filed by Rajendra Singh Lodha in Calcutta High Court. 																								According to Lodha, Priyamvada Birla, who died on July 3, had bequeathed all the assets of the MP Birla group to him. The chartered accountant moved a probate petition in Calcutta High court on July 19 to authenticate the will, which the Birla family has decided to contest legally. A copy of the will was given to the members of the family, who had earlier filed caveats in the court, on Friday. 																								During the past 36 hours, the family has scanned the will and taken extensive legal advice from a host of lawyers besides discussing among themselves on future strategies. The family is convinced that the will produced by Lodha is a manipulated document and its contents dont match with the earlier will of the couple, said a source close to the Birla family.																								To reiterate that the basis of their opposition to the probate petition is charity, the members of the Birla family are also planning to file an affidavit in the court stating that they would not stake any claim on the assets of the MP Birla group. 																								The will in the possession of Lodha also speaks in length about charity. 																								While the will  naming Lodha as the owner of all the assets of the MP Birla group  made it clear that it was the last testament of Priyamvada, legal experts say that the Birla family can challenge it. 																								It is a standard format. All the wills and codicils (the explanatory part) must contain this statement, otherwise the courts dont accept these documents, explained a city-based lawyer. 																								The brainstorming sessions  both in Calcutta and Mumbai  with the legal advisers have helped the family to chalk out the future strategy. The experts have identified certain inconsistencies in the inheritance document, produced by Lodha in the court, which will make the case difficult for him, said the source close to Birla Park. 																								The Birla family is quite confident and think that they have a strong case. They are in no hurry and have advised their solicitors Khaitan and Co to initiate legal action only after building a strong argument, said the source. 																								Not just the lawyers, even the members of the Birla family have started gathering legal documents related to inheritance disputes and strengthen their case. 																								According to the source, the family will also line up some close confidants of Priyamvada Birla to establish that she always expressed the wish that after her death the assets of the group will be used for the purpose of charity through MP Birla Foundation. 																								Besides making charity as the main pillar of their argument, the family may raise questions on Priyamvada Birlas state of health. 																								The fact that she was not well for some time and was under heavy doses of medicines will be submitted before the court, said a well-wisher of the Birla family.

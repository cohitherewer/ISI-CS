 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Survey sees sensex above 6700 in a year
																								Mumbai, April 25 (PTI): The stock markets are likely to post double-digit returns and the sensex may rule above the 6,700-mark in the next 12 months, according to DSP-Merrill Lynchs Fund Managers Survey.																								While the stock story remains largely unchanged with fund managers expecting double-digit returns over one year, the degree of bullishness has moderated, said the survey. It studied fund managers managing over Rs 20,000 crore worth of assets.																								Over a 12-month horizon, 50 per cent of fund managers believe that the sensex would be above 6700. Although bullish, this view is below the 7000-7600 range that we had last quarter, the survey said.																								With the markets trading in a broad range, the fund manager expectations of the index over a one-month horizon were dispersed in a wide range of 5400-6100, the survey said.

 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 Picture perfect																								New Delhi, Aug. 8: Graphic designers can finally break free from the tyranny of the mouse: digital pens are now on offer to help them limn better.																								While not exactly new in the Indian scenario, the awareness level about this technical gizmo is low. Graphic designers in Europe and the US see it as an essential tool to produce quality work.																								The ongoing Media Expo 2004 has an interesting range of digital pen display to lure the designing industry.																								Digital pens, for the uninitiated, are cordless, pressure-sensitive technology pens that are being used by designers (instead of a mouse) to create layers of detailing on a illustration or any application software, which is not possible through the mouse, with as much or more precision.																								Speaking to The Telegrpah, Unicorn Infosulotions director Baljinder Singh said, Digital pens are a must have as far as the international scenario in graphic designing goes. In India, the awareness of digital pens is not too high but sales are now picking up.																								Unicorn distributes digital pens from Japanese IT company Wacom. On display were the two brands  Intuse 2, whose range of products cost between Rs 17,000 and Rs 35,000. The other brand, Graphire, has a lower resolution capacity and costs between Rs 6000 and Rs 11000.																								We sell about 75 products from these two Wacom digital pens in a month, all over India. Sales are to the tune of $10,000 per month, said Singh. The typical clientele for digital pens are designing studios, advertising agencies, printers and publishers, video production houses and corporate houses.																								The hi-tech signage and PoP (point of purchase) materials, which were on display at the expo, also grabbed attention. Gigantic printing machines, mostly imported, were on display.

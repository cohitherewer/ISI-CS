 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Bruised exporters take heart from rising Asian currencies 
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, March 31: The concerns over a rising rupee have to be tempered with the realisation that all major Asian currencies also hardened against the dollar.																								This is the perception of analysts who track the course of currencies in Mumbais foreign exchange market. They argue that soaring Asian currencies put Indian exporters on an even keel with those from these countries. Most key Asian currencies are gaining value against the dollar. This means their exports, like Indias, will fetch fewer units of local currency after conversion.																								Whats important is to see how other Asian currencies are faring in the forex market, says Navin Roy, a dealer at Taib Securities. If these currencies are also going up, there is some comfort for Indian manufacturing exporters as other countries will face the same challenges that Indian firms encounter, he added.																								However, many experts agree that India has an edge when it comes to cost. India is still a compelling option, said an analyst affiliated to a leading FII brokerage. 																								The yen has scaled new highs against the dollar over the past couple of weeks, helped by the Bank of Japans strategy to leave the currencies alone. In the past however, Japans central bank was known to step in whenever its currency turned too strong. The move surprised forex traders, but other central banks have followed it. The yen was today hovering at 104 to a dollar.																								Among other units, the Korean won, the Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah have all risen in the global forex market. Except the Chinese yuan, which is not convertible and kept in leash by the government, the rest are moving in tandem, a forex trader at UTI Bank said.																								Forex dealers say the rise in Asian currencies against the greenback has been more pronounced in the past few days. The yen, for instance, jumped 7.5 per cent since early March. The rupee went up only 4 per cent in all of 2003.																								Talking of the rupee bite into corporate bottomlines, Roy says results for the last quarter of 2003-04 will be, more or less, along predicted lines. The effect of the appreciating rupee may not be seen much as most companies have already hedged their dollar exposures.

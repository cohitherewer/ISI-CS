 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 29: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has asked the auditors of Global Trust Bank to reply to a questionnaire that it has sent out as part of an exercise to determine whether there has been any accounting irregularities that enabled the bank to conceal its true state of affairs from the regulators.																								ICAI has refused to name the auditors and said the replies have been sought within the next two weeks. The ICAI action follows a notice it received from the Reserve Bank of India.																								The institute, which is the apex body for chartered accountants in India, will take action if it unearths any breach of discipline by the auditors. Its disciplinary committee regulates the ethical standards in the profession. 																								We have written to the auditors of Global Trust, pointing out the explanations which were brought to our notice by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), ICAI president Sunil Goyal told The Telegraph.																								Goyal refused to name the auditors or divulge the contents of the letter it had sent.																								The ICAI president said the letters had been sent to auditors of more than one year. 																								Global Trust suffered a net loss of Rs 272 crore in 2002-03 and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had audited the bank during that period. In the preceding year  2001-02  the bank was audited by Lovelock and Lewes. M. Bhaskara Rao amp; Company was the firm that replaced PwC.

 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Call to use cess for oil price buffer 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Roll over																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: The standing committee on petroleum and natural gas has recommended that the Rs 100,000 crore collected as cess on crude from ONGC and OIL over the years for the development of the oil industry should be used to create a price stabilisation fund for petroleum products.																								The committee has, in its report tabled in Parliament today, criticised the government for not making the cess available to the oil industry. Since 1992-93, the government has been imposing a cess of Rs 900 per tonne on domestic crude produced by ONGC and OIL in order to create a fund for the development of the oil industry.																								This cess was increased to Rs 1,800 per tonne from 2002-03 onwards, which amounts to around Rs 5,000 crore each year. However, instead of using it for the development of the oil industry, the entire sum is lying unutilised with the oil industry development board. 																								The committee has stated that there is no justification for levying the cess if the funds generated are not used for the development of the oil industry.																								It has, therefore, recommended that a price stabilisation fund be created to absorb the fluctuations in international oil rates. The report suggests that depending on the rise or fall of prices, money can be either debited or credited to the fund so that the rates are stabilised.																								This amount can also be used to provide subsidy on LPG and kerosene, the report says.																								The committee has set a three-month deadline for the government to respond on the action taken in the matter.																								The report also recommends that the customs duties on LPG and kerosene should be reduced to nil and excise on petroleum products should be pegged at a fixed level in order to control domestic selling prices.																								It points out that the reduction in customs duties on LPG and kerosene would not involve any financial burden on the oil companies and the government would not lose much revenue as kerosene is not being imported and only 15 per cent of the countrys LPG requirement is imported. 																								The committee also points out that it is an anomaly to charge excise duty on subsidised products. It has come out in favour of continuing the subsidy on LPG and kerosene and notes that the petroleum ministry has urged the finance ministry to extend the subsidy period from three years to five years. 																								The committee also expresses concern over the fact that consumers were hit hard because of higher import and excise duties and sales tax which went up with the increase in prices. 																								The committee is of the view that although under-recoveries on account of LPG and kerosene could go up Rs 12,900 crore during 2004-05, the national oil companies  IOC, BPCL and HPCL  had the capacity to bear the burden as they were enjoying very high refinery margins.																								It has also supported the existing practice of upstream oil giant ONGC and gas major Gail contributing to the subsidy on LPG and kerosene to lighten the burden of the downstream companies which pay international prices for ONGC crude.Crude rate																								Oil prices raced to fresh highs on Friday, carrying US crude over $49 a barrel, driven by escalating violence in Iraq and unabated fuel demand growth from China and India.																								US light crude set a record $49.40 a barrel before easing to $48.80, up 10 cents on the day. Prices have set all-time records in all but one of the last 16 trading sessions and are up nearly $12, more than 30 per cent, since the end of June.																								London Brent crude also set a new record of $45.15 a barrel and at 1530 GMT was up 7 cents on the day at $44.40 a barrel.

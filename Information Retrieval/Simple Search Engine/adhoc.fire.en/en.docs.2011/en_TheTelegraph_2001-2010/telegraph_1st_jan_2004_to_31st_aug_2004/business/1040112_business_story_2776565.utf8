The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Making merry on borrowed money
																								Convinced that it has managed to establish a watertight rule of stringent laws, Sebi, the market regulator, last week took a big measure to turbo-charge the rally that began seven months ago.																								Last Wednesday, Sebi announced it would introduce margin trading and stock-lending, which, for all practical purposes, means badla in a new guise.																								The B-word terrifies retail investors. Oh, its going to prise open the door for the crooks to return to the market, is a common refrain though Sebi insists there are enough checks and balances.																								Badla enables you to go beyond your means while looking for profits. For instance, margin trading is a mechanism where you borrow money to invest in stocks. And stock-lending is just the opposite  its a mechanism where you can borrow stocks. Youd borrow a stock when you think its price has peaked and its going to go down. You profit by selling the borrowed stock, and buying it back when the price has declined.																								These are risky tools and if your call goes wrong, youd lose much more than if you were trading within your means. But whatever the risks, its impossible to stamp out badla from the market, which continued secretly.																								Sebi has now brought the concept out of the closet and hopes to regulate it. The move has already wowed the markets. The sensex  that 6000-pound gorilla  put on another 100 points on the day after the announcement, but experts arent going gaga yet; they are waiting for Sebi to unravel the schemes. Its a positive step, but the devils always been in the fineprint, a broker said. It appears Sebi is going to maintain a tight leash on investors availing of the facilities.																								You never know the cost of compliance could be so high that the schemes dont take off, one broker cautioned. The advice from the market mavens: dont be afraid of the B-word. Badla invites you to go beyond your means, but its the avarice that kills.					 ANIEK PAUL

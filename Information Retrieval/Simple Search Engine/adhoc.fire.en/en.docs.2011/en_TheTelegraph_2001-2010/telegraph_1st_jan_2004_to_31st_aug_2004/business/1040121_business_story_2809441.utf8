 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 FDI hike in insurance put off till polls
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Adsul: Wait and watch																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: The government is likely to take up the issue of raising the limit on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector to 49 per cent through a legislative amendment after the Lok Sabha elections.																								The existing FDI limit in the insurance sector is 26 per cent.																								The increase in FDI limit or the issue of a comprehensive bill on the issue may be taken up after elections, minister of state for finance Anandrao Adsul said here today.																								Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference organised by Oriental Insurance Company and the department of posts, Adsul said, No movement is expected before then.																								Although the department of industrial policy and promotion had finalised a proposal to raise the FDI limit in the insurance sector, the cabinet has yet to approve it. The hike in FDI limit for the insurance sector will also require amendment in the IRDA Act of 1998.																								Analysts feel this could be done as part of the attempt by the Law Commission to work on a comprehensive bill on the sector by merging the Insurance Act of 1938 and IRDA Act of 1998.																								Adsul also said the government will extend budgetary support to Life Insurance Corporation for the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana, which mopped up over Rs 3,200 crore in premium collections. 																								Although the initial response to the Varishtha scheme came predominantly from the urban segment, Adsul said the number of policies sold in rural areas now match that of the cities.																								Expressing concern over insurance companies, which are reluctant to penetrate rural markets, he said, There has to be some penal provision which the insurance regulator can use to curb this reluctance.																								Meanwhile, the state-run Oriental Insurance today entered into a corporate tie-up with the department of posts, which will see post offices across the country selling all the non-life products for the insurance company.

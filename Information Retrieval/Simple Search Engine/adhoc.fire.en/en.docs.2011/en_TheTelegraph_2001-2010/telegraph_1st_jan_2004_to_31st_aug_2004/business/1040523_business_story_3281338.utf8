 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Mahindra BT plans to hire 2000 more
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, May 22: Mahindra British Telecom Limited (MBT) plans to recruit around 2,000 people in the current financial year, taking the headcount to 8,600.																								Professionals with programming skills, customer-relationship management and billing experience and domain expertise will be recruited.																								The company hired a similar number last year.																								MBT is a 57:43 joint venture between automaker Mahindra and Mahindra and UK-based British Telecom. The company provides services to wireline and wireless telecom companies across the globe.																								Jagdish Mitra, head-global marketing and corporate communication, said, For the past two-and-a-half years, we have been investing in people, which has helped the company improve productivity and reduce attrition.																								Last year, we registered a revenue of $130 million and an 18 per cent growth in total income, said Mitra.																								With the telecom industry undergoing rapid changes in the past couple of years, MBT had decided to focus on select customers in different places and deliver according to demand.																								The company had restructured its sales and marketing force in tune with its strategy.																								Of the total headcount, only around 40 people are engaged in marketing activities, said Mitra. Marketing has now gone beyond offering a cheaper and better alternative to providing specific domain and business skills in terms of value.																								MBT earned Rs 600.81 crore last year by exporting to the US, the UK, Australia, UAE, Singapore and Germany. The company plans to enter the Japanese and African markets during the year.

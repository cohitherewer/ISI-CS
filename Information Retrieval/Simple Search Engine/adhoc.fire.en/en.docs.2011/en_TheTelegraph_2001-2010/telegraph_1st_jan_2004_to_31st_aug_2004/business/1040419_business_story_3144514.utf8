The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Retail, small units in Centurion Bank focus
 VIVEK NAIR				 	 Bhandari: Small is beautiful																								Mumbai, April 18: Centurion Bank is refining its strategy on the retail and corporate fronts.																								Even as the bank is considering an entry into new segments in retail banking to offer customers a suite of products, synergy has become an important cornerstone in corporate assets where the bank is looking aggressively at small and medium enterprises (SMEs).																								Shailendra Bhandari, who recently joined the bank as its managing director, told The Telegraph that in corporate banking, Centurion Bank has been focusing less on large companies as the returns are not significant due to the fine spreads prevailing. 																								Bhandari said while the bank had an excellent presence in the SME sector, it would now concentrate on segments having synergy with its other businesses.																								Citing the instance of two-wheeler financing, where the bank is one of the top players and, Bhandari said the bank is now using its strength in this field to increase disbursements to dealers.																								Centurion Bank will come out with a rights issue of 22.69 crore equity at a premium of Rs 3 per share aggregating Rs 90.80 crore. These will be issued in the ratio of two shares for every five held. 																								The bank, in its draft letter of offer filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, said with the completion of the rights issue, it will meet the Reserve Bank of Indias norms on capital adequacy ratio, which has improved from 1.95 per cent last year to over 8 per cent in February.																								In retail assets, the bank was earlier a leader in two-wheeler finance and is still among the top three lenders. Bhandari said the bank has no mad urgency to further improve this position and its focus will be more on a profitable portfolio.																								Centurion Bank is now contemplating a foray into wealth management, credit cards and housing. A new team will also be put into place for this purpose.																								The bank has said on February 6, more than 70 per cent of its loans comprised retail advances. These included financing of two wheelers, commercial vehicles and construction equipment.

 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Rs 489-cr crude shock for Indian Oil
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 20: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has suffered a loss of Rs 489 crore between January and May for not being allowed to raise the rates of petrol and diesel, despite a $6-per-barrel jump in crude prices.																								IOC chairman M. S. Ramachandran said here today, We are selling petrol and diesel at prices that are lower than the cost of the two fuels.																								He, however, did not indicate that the hike in petrol and diesel prices was likely at the next review on May 31, saying any decision on increasing prices will be taken in consultation with the new government.																								Petrol and diesel prices were increased by Re 1 per litre on January 1 this year after which the Vajpayee government had asked oil companies to hold the price-line fearing a backlash from voters in the Lok Sabha elections. 																								Ramachandran said an increase of Rs 4 per litre and Rs 5 per litre in prices of petrol and diesel, respectively, would be required to neutralise the loss. 																								However, the new government would have to decide on the matter. It is unlikely that the new coalition would go in for such a massive increase in prices. The Left parties have already stated that the diesel prices should not be raised and those of kerosene should be lowered.																								Ramachandran also said the national oil companies had sustained a Rs 4,337.55-crore loss on the sale of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene as the prices of these two fuels had not been raised for over a year and budgetary support for the subsidy has been slashed. 																								To ensure normal margins, the price of LPG would have to be raised by Rs 42.61 per cylinder and that of kerosene by Rs 1.49 per litre, he added.

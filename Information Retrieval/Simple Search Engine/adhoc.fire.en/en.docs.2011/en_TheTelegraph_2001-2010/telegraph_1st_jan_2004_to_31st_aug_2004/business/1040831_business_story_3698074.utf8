 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 ONGC goes Down Under
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: ONGC Videsh (OVL) today announced that it had reached an agreement with Canadian major, Anitim Energy Inc, to acquire a 55 per cent stake in an exploration block off the Australian coast. The acquisition will have to be cleared by the Australian government.																								Under the agreement, OVL has acquired the majority stake in the block WA 306 P located in the north-west shelf in the Australian offshore area. The other partner in the block is Magellon Petroleum (WA) Pty Ltd.																								OVL chairman Subir Raha said, The block has a good potential and we expect to spud the first well in the coming few weeks.																								Having already established its presence in eight countries, OVL will now, for the first time, be venturing into the Australian oil and gas industry. The block spread over an area of 4,600-sq km is reported to contain a cluster of drilling prospects. The block forms part of the Browse basin, which has been largely untouched by oil explorers so far.																								Raha said, The stake in offshore block is our first acquisition in Australia and we believe that the opening should pave the way for OVLs participation in many other opportunities in the Australian hydrocarbon sector. 																								Anitim Energy is listed on both the London and Toronto stock exchanges. The company has its corporate headquarters in Calgary and has interests in the North Sea off the English coast, South America, Africa and Australia.																								OVL is riding high on the success of both its Sakhalin and Sudan ventures. However, both the acquisitions were of discovered fields. Emboldened by its success in Sudan, OVL had then acquired a stake in an adjoining exploration block as well.																								Incidentally, the stake in the Sudan oilfield was also acquired from a Canadian company, Talisman, which had to leave the country in haste due to political reasons.

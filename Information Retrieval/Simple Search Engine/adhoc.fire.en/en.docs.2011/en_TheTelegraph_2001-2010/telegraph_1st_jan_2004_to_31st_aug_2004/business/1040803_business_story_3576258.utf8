 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 Telecom under mobile spell 
100 million phone users in seven months
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: Indian telecom industrys date with destiny is just seven months away: thats when it hopes to rack up 100 million telecom users.																								That might sound small beer when you juxtapose that figure against a population of 1 billion: just one in every 10 people will have a phone  mobile or fixed-line.																								But there are other interesting developments that are expected to take place: for starters, India will join a league of about 25 countries that have more mobile phones than fixed-line instruments.																								The country had 75.97 million phone users  42.84 million fixed-line and 33.69 million mobile-phone subscribers  on March 31 this year.																								The telecom revolution that began in 1990 has started to gather momentum and the industry regulator  Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai)  has been keeping a close watch on the developments and stepping in to resolve sticky issues as soon as possible. 																								The regulator feels that the sector needs to grow and a few issues of technology and policy should not be allowed to impede progress.																								Trai chairman Pradeep Baijal says, The growth in the telecom sector is a result of the efforts of all of us  operators, subscribers, the regulator and the government  who kept trying to resolve the issues and did not get bogged down.																								We, as a regulator, have been emphasising the need to ensure a free run for the market forces, while the government helps through policy initiatives. This is important, as it has helped us to bring down telecom tariffs. The statistics speak for themselves and also emphasise the need to continue it, adds Baijal.																								In addition to the fixed-line and mobile users, the number of public call offices (PCOs) in the country has grown to 19.24 lakh on March 31, 2004 from 14.93 lakh in the year-ago period. Last year, 4.31 lakh new PCOs were added.																								However, the village public telephones (VPTs) continue to be a major problem for the industry with just 9000 of these being added during the last one year. At present, there are around 6.07 lakh villages in India with 5.23 lakh VPTs.																								Baijal feels that the answer lies in mobile phones. The technologies that were used for VPTs have failed to deliver the desired results. The private operators form a very small part of the objective since most of the villages had already been covered. Mobile phones have emerged as an alternative and it will be soon reflected in rural areas, he adds. 																								During 2003-04, only 5.22 lakh villages had VPTs whereas about 0.85 lakh villages are left uncovered.																								The regulator has also pointed to the growing usage of internet in the country and the demand for broadband. The internet subscriber base grew by 25.11 per cent in 2003-04 and touched 45.49 lakh in March this year compared with 36.36 lakh during the preceding year.																								About 189 ISPs were operational last year. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) has emerged as the leader with a subscriber base of 11.28 lakh followed by Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) with 7.69 lakh.																								The cafes/community internet centres (CIC) also grew 22 per cent to 10,237 cyber cafes/CICs as on March 2004 compared with 8,388 in March 2003.																								PTI adds: India is holding the eighth five-day Asia Pacific Telecommunity Standardisation programme with a view to establishing regional co-operation in the field. 																								The meeting, organised by the Asia Pacific Telecommunity, is being held in Hyderabad. The department of telecommunications is hosting the event.

 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Amul to scoop up ice cream in Pak
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, April 18: After establishing its sway over the domestic ice cream market, Amul is now planning to storm Pakistan and Sri Lanka.																								The flagship brand of the Rs 3,500-crore Gujarat Co-operative Milk marketing Federation (GCMMF), Amul will soon start to export its ice creams to the neighbouring countries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, said R. S. Khanna, northern region head of GCMMF.																								Amul ice creams are already available in a limited way in Singapore and West Asia.																								Amul, which is a market leader in the organised branded ice-cream market of about Rs 500 crore with a share of 27 per cent, says that one of the prime target before the company is to increase the per capita consumption of ice cream in the country. 																								The per capita consumption of ice cream in India is only about 250 ml per annum, while the average global consumption is 2 litres.																								Interestingly, both Pakistan and Sri Lanka have a bigger per capita consumption of ice cream than India. 																								Hindustan Levers Kwality Walls brand has a market share of 8 per cent, while Vadilal and Mother Dairy (Delhi), which is not a national brand yet, have about 7 per cent each. The rest of the ice-cream cone is occupied by regional players, including Arun in the south and Dinshaw in the west. 																								Amul is also keen to enter the premium segment of the ice-cream market. 																								Some time back, it had launched Utterly delicious premium range of ice creams in the party packs of 1 kg and 750 ml. 																								The brand has recently rolled out 100 ml cup sizes in the premium segment, to tap the value-added product market at a price point of Rs 15.																								So far, most of our ice creams were below Rs 10. Now we are getting into the premium segment, said Khanna. 																								The flavours that are available in the premium segment from Amul includes Litchi, strawberry, Alphanso mango, cheese with almond and date with honey.

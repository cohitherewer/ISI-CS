 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Country roads, take me home
																								Excerpts from the Budget 2004-2005																								I rise to present the budget for the year 2004-05. Every five years, or sometimes sooner, the people of India speak in their collective voice. The message is usually unambiguous and clear. Elections 2004 were no different. The peoples vote against one coalition  and the vote in favour of another coalition  was a vote for change. As the Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, said in his address to the Nation two weeks ago, the people have sought a change in the manner in which this country is run, a change in national priorities, and a change in the processes and focus of governance. I shall make every effort to be true to that mandate. CMP elements																								The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has given to itself, and to the people of this country, a common minimum programme. The government has since adopted it as the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP). The programme spells out seven clear economic objectives: 																								1) maintaining a growth rate of 7-8 per cent per year for a sustained period; 																								2) providing universal access to quality basic education and health; 																								3) generating gainful employment in agriculture, manufacturing and services, and promoting investment; 																								4) assuring 100 days employment to the breadwinner in each family at the minimum wage;																								5) focussing on agriculture and infrastructure; 																								6) accelerating fiscal consolidation and reform; 																								7) ensuring higher and more efficient fiscal devolution.																								The UPA government began its journey in May this year. However, I may note that one-quarter of the year has elapsed and, by the time the budget is passed and the President gives his assent to the Finance Bill, nearly one-half of the year will be over. The government has to shift gears; and even if we are able to do so quickly, it would leave us only about six months to achieve our objectives for this year. We have therefore decided to adopt an innovative approach. 																								In addition to the gross budgetary support (GBS) of Rs 135,071 crore provided in the interim budget, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.10,000 crore. This, and some other additional allocations, will raise total plan expenditure to Rs.145,590 crore in the Budget Estimates for 2004-05. Fiscal responsibility																								The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 has streamlined the Budget presentation process. Under the FRBM Act, I am obliged to wipe out the revenue deficit by 2007-08. However, the NCMP has proposed that we do so by 2008-09. In my view, 2008-09 is a more credible terminal year; it will also coincide with the term of this the government. Growth prospects																								Growth will be sustained by increased production and value addition in agriculture, a marked improvement in industrial production, and continued buoyancy in the performance of the services sector. The government will follow a 5-year road map to achieve the NCMP objective of bringing about rapid growth with stability and equity. Poverty amp; jobs																								The poor will have a first charge not only on the additional sum of Rs 10,000 crore of GBS that I propose to provide today, but also on the entire Plan funds that the Planning Commission will reallocate. Antyodaya Anna Yojana																								I propose to continue, and expand, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. At present, 1.5 crore families are covered. These families are provided with 35 kg of foodgrains per family per month at a highly subsidised price of Rs 2 per kg for wheat and Rs 3 per kg for rice. In the current year, I propose to cover 2 crore families. Public distribution system																								We shall address the weaknesses in the system and strengthen public distribution. I shall return to this subject a little later.Food for Work programme 																								Work has begun on the National Employment Guarantee Act. The object is to guarantee 100 days of employment in a year to one able-bodied person in every poor household. The Bill will take into account the experience gained in Maharashtra. Pending the enactment of the new law, I propose to launch a Food for Work programme in 150 districts classified as most backward and identified as areas in immediate need of such a programme. Allocations under different schemes will be pulled together to support the Food for Work programme. There are substantial funds totalling over Rs 6000 crore under SGRY, SGSY, SJSRY, REGP and PMRY. Thrust areas																								1) Doubling agricultural credit in three years, accelerating the completion of irrigation projects and investing in rural infrastructure; 																								2) Providing farm insurance and livestock insurance; 																								3) Improving agricultural product markets, and promoting agri-businesses; 																								4) Drinking water for all; 																								5) Expanding water harvesting, watershed development and minor  irrigation and micro-irrigation schemes; 																								6) Enhancing investment in industry  public and private, domestic and foreign  to create new jobs; 																								7) Creating space for small-scale industry to thrive and grow; 																								8) Electricity for all; 																								9) Universal access to telecommunication facilities; 																								10) More housing for the poor; 																								11) Access to medical care through health insurance; and 																								12) Encouraging savings, and protecting the savings of senior citizens; Investment																								I believe that the key to growth is investment  public and private, domestic and foreign. It is therefore my intention to considerably enhance investment in all sectors of the economy. However, fiscal prudence and financial discipline will remain the overarching objective. I shall also take into account the availability of resources and the absorptive capacity of various sectors. Education 																								The NCMP mandates the government to levy an education cess. I propose to levy a cess of 2 per cent. The new cess will yield about Rs 4000-5000 crore in a full year. The whole of the amount collected as cess will be earmarked for education, which will naturally include providing a nutritious cooked midday meal. Technical education																								ITIs are the training ground for skilled manpower. The government proposes to launch a programme in the central sector to upgrade 500 ITIs over the next 5 years at the rate of 100 ITIs a year. Appropriate infrastructure and equipment will be provided, the syllabi will be upgraded and new trades will be introduced. This is an area where I welcome chambers of commerce and industry to join hands with the government and create a public-private partnership model for designing and implementing the scheme. Education loan																								An education loan scheme has been in operation since April 2001 under which loans up to Rs 7.50 lakh and Rs 15 lakh are available for professional courses within the country and abroad, respectively. The requirement of collateral was dispensed with for loans up to Rs 4 lakh. I am happy to say that commercial banks have now agreed to waive the need for collateral for loans up to Rs 7.5 lakh, if a satisfactory guarantee is provided on behalf of the student. Healthcare 																								The Universal Health Insurance Scheme (UHIS) now in operation is skewed in favour of the non-poor. As a result, only a very small number of families below the poverty line (BPL), actually 11,408 till May, 2004, have been covered. BPL families seem to avoid the scheme due to their inability to pay the premium. I, therefore, propose to redesign the scheme and make it exclusive for persons and families below the poverty line. The revised premium would be Rs 165 for individuals, Rs 248 for a family of five and Rs 330 for a family of seven, without any reduction in benefits. To offset the reduction in premium, I propose to enhance the premium subsidy from Rs 100 at present to Rs 200 for an individual, Rs 300 for a family of five and Rs 400 for a family of seven. The cost to the exchequer will be Rs 40 crore in a full year. If the money is fully spent, the number insured will rise to about 10 lakh. 																								I propose to introduce a new group health insurance scheme through public sector non-life insurance companies. The insured will be members of SHGs and other credit linked groups (CLGs) who avail of loans from banks or cooperative institutions. Under the group health insurance scheme, the premium will be Rs 120 per person, but the insurance cover would be for a sum of Rs 10,000. The NCMP also emphasises the need for an accelerated AIDS control programme. Efforts will include improved surveillance through the setting up of more sentinel sites and use of primary health centres to monitor HIV/AIDS, public awareness campaigns, promotion of safe sex through the use of condoms, prevention of drug abuse and distribution of disposable syringes. The allocation for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is Rs 259 crore. Agriculture economy 																								The agriculture sector requires massive investments. It is my intention to double the flow of agricultural credit in three years. We have made a beginning by announcing a comprehensive policy on agricultural credit on June 18, 2004. The government has entrusted the implementation of the policy to the public sector and private sector banks, the regional rural banks (RRBs) and the cooperative banks. Each RRB has a sponsor bank. I propose to hold each sponsor bank squarely accountable for the performance of RRBs under its control. Rural Infrastructure 																								The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme was introduced in 1996-97 and was allotted large funds year after year. The programme is being restructured. Truly last mile projects that can be completed by March 2005 will be given overriding priority, and other projects that can be completed by March 2006 will also be taken up in the current year. Next year we shall move the goal-post to March 2007, the year after to March 2008, and so on. I have provided a sum of Rs 2800 crore to the AIBP this year. 																								The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund was established in Nabard in 1994-95. Five months ago, a decision was taken to close the RIDF and establish, in its place, another fund with slightly different objectives. Many state governments and many honourable members have opposed this. In deference to their wishes, and in tune with my own thinking, I have decided to revive the RIDF and a corpus of Rs 8000 crore will be provided during the current financial year. Water bodies 																								We have been warned that the biggest crisis that the world will face in the 21st century will be the crisis of water. I propose an ambitious scheme to repair, renovate and restore all the water bodies that are directly linked to agriculture. In the current year, we shall begin with pilot projects in at least five districts, and we shall select at least one district in each of the five regions of the country. The estimated cost is Rs 100 crore. Funds for the five pilot projects will be drawn from existing programmes such as SGRY, PMGJSY, DPAP, DDP and IWDP. 																								Farmers belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes rarely benefit from water harvesting schemes. The government will launch a nationwide scheme that will cover one lakh irrigation units at an average cost of Rs 20,000 per unit. Nabard will lend the money on easy terms and no margin money will be charged from the borrower. The government will provide a 50 per cent capital subsidy through Nabard, and estimate for the scheme is Rs 100 crore. Flood control 																								Thousands of lives and thousands of head of cattle are lost every year due to floods. Floods are perennial in Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The NCMP envisages full Central support to flood control works in inter-state rivers and international rivers. A programme of flood control and anti-erosion will be launched in the current year. Rs 30 crore has been allotted. Diversification																								The time has come to encourage our farmers to diversify into areas such as horticulture, floriculture and oilseeds. The government proposes to launch a National Horticulture Mission. The goal is to double horticulture production from the current level of 150 million tonnes to 300 million tonnes by 2011-12.																								Oilseeds is another critical area. Last year, we produced 25 million tonnes of oilseeds, but we also imported $2.5 billion of edible oil. The government will facilitate farmers to diversify into oilseeds by promoting superior seed-technology and through an appropriate policy of price support. Research and development 																								The allocation towards agricultural research for 2004-05 is Rs 1000 crore, and I propose to make further allocations during the course of the year. The Small Farmers Agri-business Consortium was set up in 1994. Although SFAC started functioning from 1998, its corpus stands at a meagre Rs 10.95 crore. 																								In my view, SFAC should provide venture capital to projects and must be run, preferably by a banker, on purely business lines. The MS Swaminathan Research Foundation has identified 13 districts where there is a huge potential for agri-businesses and an appetite for investment of nearly Rs 170 crore. The Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) was incorporated in December 2002. The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS), which insures the yield or crop, is in operation since Rabi 1999-2000. AIC is redesigning the scheme. We shall continue with the scheme and make another evaluation. 																								Meanwhile, a pilot scheme insuring farm income (as opposed to crop) has been launched in 19 districts across 12 states during rabi 2003-04. Government has decided to extend the scheme to Kharif 2004 in order to assess its feasibility. I wish to add that a weather insurance scheme appears to be more promising, at least in the design. AIC is introducing the scheme on a trial basis in 20 rain gauge stations in the current season. Inter-Institutional Group 																								I am glad to announce that IDBI, IDFC, ICICI Bank, SBI, LIC, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank have formed an Inter-Institutional Group. They will pool their resources on a callable basis, and a sum of Rs 40,000 crore will be made available as and when necessary. Initially, airports, seaports and tourism will be the target sectors of the IIG. Drinking water																								More than 75,000 habitations are yet to be provided adequate drinking water. The government intends to bring all drinking water schemes under the umbrella of the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission. The Accelerated Rural Water Supply Progamme has been allocated Rs 2610 crore. It will focus on renewal of water sources and on serving uncovered and partially covered habitations. A provision of Rs 151.25 crore has been made for the Urban Water Supply Programme. Rural housing 																								I propose to raise the allocation for Indira Awas Yojana to Rs 2247 crore and, if more money is needed, it will be found within the enhanced Plan outlay. A subsidy upto Rs 10,000 and loan up to Rs 40,000 are provided to eligible households. The Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme was launched in August 1997 to give a boost to rural housing. The scheme deserves further stimulus. I am happy to announce that the National Housing Bank has offered to reduce the rate of refinance by 25 basis points this year. RBI has agreed to revise the norms of re-payment for rural housing loans, so that the instalments coincide with crop cycles. Industry																								I propose to establish an Investment Commission. The commission will have the broad authority of the government to engage, discuss with and invite domestic and foreign businesses to invest in India. It will be chaired by an eminent person. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board has played a useful role. The government believes that many of the functions of FIPB could be put on the automatic route, and leave FIPB as a one-stop service centre and facilitator. The government proposes to set up a National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council. Foreign investment																								The NCMP declares that FDI will continue to be encouraged and actively sought, particularly in areas of infrastructure, high technology and exports. Three sectors of the economy fully meet this description  telecommunications, civil aviation and insurance. Capital markets 																								Foreign Institutional Investors have shown a marked preference for India over other emerging markets. In order to carry forward the process of making the Indian capital market strong and attractive, I propose to:																								1) Make the procedures for registration and operations simpler and quicker for FIIs; 																								2) Raise the investment ceiling for FIIs in debt funds from $1 billion to $1.75 billion; 																								3) Allow banks with strong risk management systems greater latitude in their exposure to the capital market; 																								4) Create an alternative trading platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to raise equity and debt from the capital market; and 																								5) Initiate steps to integrate the commodities markets and the securities markets. Public sector 																								In 2004-05 the government will provide equity support of Rs 14,194 crore and loans of Rs 2,132 crore to Central PSEs. Major investments will be made in PSEs falling in the sectors of power, telecommunications, railways, roads, petroleum, coal and civil aviation. I propose to establish a Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE). The board will advise the government on the measures to be taken to restructure PSEs. 																								In order to extract value for its holding and to compensate the effect of dilution, the government intends to piggy-back on the public issue of NTPC and disinvest approximately 5 per cent of its holding. This and some other cases which are under examination are expected to yield Rs 4000 crore. As long as the government retains control over the PSE, and its public sector character is not affected, the government may dilute its equity and raise resources to meet social needs. 																								Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd will be given financial support for restructuring. A rescue package of has been worked out for Indian Telephone Industries, and it will be given Rs 508 crore to remain out of the BIFR. SSI sector 																								The ministry of small scale industry has identified 85 items that can be safely taken out of the reserved list. I have reviewed the Capital Subsidy Scheme, and I propose to raise the ceiling for loans under the scheme from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore. The rate of subsidy will also be raised from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. A provision of Rs 135.24 crore has been made for promotion of SSI schemes.VAT 																								I urge all States that have not yet passed the relevant VAT legislation to do so before the end of 2004. In order to give comfort to the states, I propose to evolve a formula for determining the compensation for the loss of revenue, if any.Pension reform 																								A defined contribution pension scheme has been introduced with effect from January 1, 2004 for the central government employees recruited on or after that date. A suitable legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the scheme will be introduced in Parliament. Securitisation Act 																								The constitutional validity of the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 has been upheld by the Supreme Court, except Sub-Section (2) of Section 17. In the wake of this judgement, many banks have pointed out practical difficulties likely to arise in speeding up the recovery of non-performing assets. Interest rates 																								I am convinced that, in the larger interests of the country, we should maintain a benign interest rate regime that appropriately balances the legitimate claims of the savers and borrowers. I do not propose to make any change in the existing rates of interest on small savings instruments. 																								Consequently, PPF, GPF and the Special Deposit Scheme will attract 8 per cent interest this year. For senior citizens, I propose to introduce a new scheme called the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme offering an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. For all other citizens, I propose to continue the government savings bond which will carry an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum. The Varishta Pension Bima Yojana may no longer be necessary since the new savings scheme will cover senior citizens adequately. Defence fund																								I propose to increase the allocation for defence to Rs 77,000 crore which includes an allocation for capital expenditure of Rs.33,483 crore. Taxes 																								My tax proposals on direct taxes are expected to yield a gain of Rs 2000 crore. On the indirect taxes side, they are broadly revenue neutral. 																								Mr Speaker, Sir. The countries of the world, India included, have set for themselves the Millennium Development Goals. Our date with destiny is not at the end of the millennium, but in the year 2015. Will we achieve those goals? In the eleven years that remain, it is in our hands to shape our destiny. Progress is not always on a linear path, nor is it inevitable. Two thousand years ago, Saint Tirvalluvar said: Aran Izhukkathu Allavai Neeki Maran Izhukka Maanam Udayathu Arasu 																								(They are good rulers who observe ethics, commit no crime and walk the path of honour and courage) 																								If we bring thought and passion to our governance, and walk the path of honour and courage, we can make the future happen. And this century will be Indias century.

 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Shippers want tide turned with tax cut 
 S. P. S. PANNU Load factor 																								New Delhi, June 27: The shipping ministry wants finance minister P. Chidambaram to slash the corporate tax on shipping to global levels in order to provide a level-playing field to the domestic companies. The income tax on seafarers, which has caused an exodus of talented Indian sailors to serve under foreign flag vessels, is another issue that has been highlighted on budget-eve.																								The shipping ministry has made a strong case for switching over to the tonnage tax system followed in most advanced countries where shipping companies pay tax rates between 0 per cent and 2 per cent. This is in sharp contrast to the over 30 per cent corporate tax that domestic companies like SCI have to cough up.																								The contention of the ministry is that Indian shipping companies have to compete in an international environment and the high tax levels are proving to be a handicap vis--vis other maritime countries which have specially-devised tax schemes to promote shipping. This disadvantage is reflected in the fact that the Indian merchant fleet has been dwindling over the years. 																								The ministry has pointed out that the high tax rate has affected the generation of funds for acquisition of Indian ships. Despite a significant improvement in the trading environment during the year, the strength of the Indian shipping fleet has declined from 6.8 million GRT (gross tonnage) in March 31, 2003 to 6.18 GRT on March 31, 2003. This had fallen further to 6.17 million GRT in June 2003.																								The share of Indian ships in the carriage of the countrys overseas trade has been declining over the years despite the increase in the total value of cargo. 																								The fact-sheet prepared by the ministry highlights the golden phase of the shipping industry from 1961 to 1985 when the gross tonnage went up from a meagre 0.95 GRT to 6.5 million GRT due to various incentives provided by the government. Clearly, the fortunes of the Indian shipping industry have been reversed 20 years down the line with the gross tonnage being less than what it was in 1985.																								The shipping ministry has also argued that the finance ministry has been overlooking the economic importance of the shipping industry which rakes in net foreign exchange earnings of over Rs 4,000 crore every year. Besides, shipping activities have a high economic multiplier effect where 62.1 per cent of the gross freight earnings constitute net value addition to the countrys GDP.																								The exodus of good sailors to foreign shipping companies is another problem area. While officers and men serving with Indian shipping companies have to pay income-tax, those who join foreign companies are treated as NRIs and do not have to pay any tax. The much larger tax-free pay packet has resulted in talented seafarers ditching Indian companies to join foreign firms.

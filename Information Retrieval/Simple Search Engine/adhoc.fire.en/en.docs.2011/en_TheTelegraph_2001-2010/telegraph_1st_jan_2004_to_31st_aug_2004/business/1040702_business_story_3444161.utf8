 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Hardware units seek sops to fight imports
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, July 1: The Council of Electronic and Hardware Industries Association wants a a modification in the Electronic Hardware Technology Parks of India (EHTP) scheme to permit 100 per cent domestic tariff area (DTA) access to all IT products.																								Industry representatives, including Cetma, Elcina, Mait and Tema, have also requested exemption from income tax for a 10-year period for manufacturing units with export obligations. They want sales to EHTP to be treated as deemed exports.																								The industry feels that the move is essential to deal with import duties and sales tax on inputs and raw materials to face competition from China and the Asean countries.																								Under WTO, raw materials and capital equipment will continue to attract duty, while the end product enjoys a zero-duty status. EHTP is the only route to make IT hardware manufacturing viable in the zero-duty WTO regime and should serve as a platform for domestic manufacturers to compete with imports, Mait executive director Vinnie Mehta says.																								The hardware industry is estimated to reach $69 billion by 2010. The domestic market is estimated at $44 billion, while exports amount to $25 billion. Investments in hardware manufacturing, however, stands at Rs 1300 crore.																								Mait, the apex body of the hardware industry, has recommended a uniform 8 per cent duty structure for IT products and also adhere to the phaseout plan of the IT Agreement (zero duty on 217 items). Raising depreciation to 100 per cent from the existing 60 per cent will also boost consumption from the corporate and small and medium business segments.																								The representatives also requested abolishing withholding tax on R amp;D exports, which should be treated on a par with software exports, and income tax exemption for earnings from technology or intellectual property licensed to overseas customers.																								IT manufacturing and R amp;D are critical for an exponential growth in the sector, said Mehta. At 100 per cent growth every year, India can have over 10 million PCs in the next two years and 100 million by 2009.

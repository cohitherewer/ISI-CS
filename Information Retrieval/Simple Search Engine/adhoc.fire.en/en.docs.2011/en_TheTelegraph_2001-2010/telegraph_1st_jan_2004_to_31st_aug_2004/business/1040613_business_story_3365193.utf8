 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 All in a row																								New Delhi, June 12: Dabur International, the global face of the pharmaceuticals major, is planning to snap up brands and companies in the overseas markets.																								The company, a Dabur India subsidiary formed in September last year, came into being with the acquisition of Redrock Limited, a UAE-based firm through which Dabur used to sell its products in West Asia. 																								Sources said Dabur International would acquire more firms abroad based on the need and strategy fit for products in the particular markets that Dabur wants to enter. 																								The company is also planning to enter into joint venture agreements in Pakistan and Nigeria. Dabur Internationals joint venture in Bangladesh called Asian Consumer Care Private Limited has already become operational. 																								Dabur International has devised a flexible strategy which will be finetuned to the need of the relevant international market that the company wants to enter.																								In West Asia, the company wants to build and rebuild brands and customise products for these markets. 																								With the acquisition of Redrock, Dabur now has production facilities in Sharjah. Redrocks West Asian rights for the Wakefield brand has also been transferred to Dabur.																								In the CIS countries, Dabur will focus on healthcare products, mainly Chyawanprash, Hajmola, Pudin Hara and Lal Dantmanjan. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the range of personal care products, mainly hair care products like shampoo and hair oil, will be sold. 																								Dabur International is also negotiating with some US retailers to set up ethnic counters for Daburs healthcare products. However, the company is tightlipped about the retailers it is in talks with.																								According to CEO Arvind Kumar, Dabur International is the vehicle for the parent companys international business and Dubai, where Dabur International is based, is considered to be the main hub for overseas operations.																								Daburs international business, which includes exports from India, contributed 9.6 per cent to the parent companys consolidated sales during the last financial year and Dabur India is expecting its international business to contribute a larger share to its overall sales and profits in the current year.

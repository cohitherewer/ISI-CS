		 Monday, March 22, 2004  Q amp;A				 Parents property
																																																																																													I am a 60-year-old housewife living in a property inherited from my parents 25 years ago. What would be my tax liability if I sell the property? 																																																																																													How should I invest the money received from the sale benefits?																																																																													Bani Dubey, Burnpur
																																																																																													Youd be liable to pay tax on long term capital gains if you profit from the sale. If you do not know the cost of the property, you should first have the property assessed and its fair value as of April 1, 1981, determined. Youd then have to derive the current equivalent of the 1981 fair value by adjusting for inflation. If you sell your property at a price higher than the current equivalent of the 1981 fair value, youll be liable to pay tax on the difference. To avoid paying the tax, youd have to invest the profit either in a capital gains bond within six months or in a residential property. You have three options for the latter. You can buy a property within two years, or construct one within three years from the date of sale. You could also avoid paying the tax if you have invested an amount equal to or higher than your profit, in a residential property within a year before the sale. If youre unable to invest your profit before filing income tax return for the year in which you sell the property, you should put the money in a capital gain deposit account scheme with a nationalised bank. 																																																																																													We would not be able to offer you suggestion on how to invest the money unless we have an idea of how much it is, and what your needs are.																																					PPF rollover																																																																																															Can I keep the money invested in a Public Provident Fund account for more than 15 years and will it earn an interest?																																																																													K Majumdar, Khardah
																																																																																													Yes, on maturity, you can reinvest your PPF deposit for five-year terms as many times as you want. You need not deposit more money in your account to extend its maturity. You would continue to earn interest at the applicable rate on the deposit.																																					Unending wait																																																																																															I had redeemed units of Master Growth more than a year ago, but did not receive the payment for it. Despite sending several reminders to UTI Investor Services, I have not received the redemption cheque yet. Please help. 																																																																													Harapriya Kar, Cuttack
																																																																																													We forwarded your complaint to UTI Mutual Fund. It said a duplicate cheque (warrant no. RP200049C00751788) dated March 15, 2004, for Rs 13,970 has already been despatched.

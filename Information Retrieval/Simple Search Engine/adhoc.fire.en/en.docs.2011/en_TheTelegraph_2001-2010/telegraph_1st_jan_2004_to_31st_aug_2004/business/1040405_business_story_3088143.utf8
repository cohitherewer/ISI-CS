 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Sheen wears off gold jewellery investment
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 4: Gold jewellery is losing some of its sheen as an investment vehicle as domestic consumption is on a declining trend.																								A study carried out by rating agency Icra says in recent years, gold jewellery consumption in India is facing increasing competition from white and brown goods as alternative investment vehicles. 																								The study points out that gold demand peaked at 659 tonnes in 1998. It was 598 tonnes in 2002 and declined to 459 tonnes in 2002. 																								Demand has gone down in recent years because of a slowdown in agricultural production and a significant increase in gold prices from January 2002.																								The war in Iraq and concerns about terrorism have also resulted in rising gold prices. It is the up and down movement in the dollar which has been attributed as the main factor behind the price increase in gold.																								Domestic gold jewellery expenditure in terms of the value of the gold content purchased, peaked at Rs 30,200 crore in 1998, (Rs 311 per capita) when total Indian gold demand was 775 tonnes. Since then expenditure has declined to Rs 27,900 crore (Rs 284 per capita). 																								India accounts for 20 per cent of global offtake in any one year. The study says Indias off-take of gold jewellery per capita is low as compared with other countries.																								Future growth in gold jewellery business is likely to be driven by exports to the US and other markets. Exports of gold jewellery has increased from Rs 3,500 crore in financial year 1999 to Rs 7,300 crore in financial year 2003.																								However, there is a silver lining in the first nine months of the calendar year. Jewellery gold demand has increased from 316 tonnes in January-September 2002 to 367 tonnes in the same period in 2003. This is partly due to a better-than-average monsoon and broadly stable prices.

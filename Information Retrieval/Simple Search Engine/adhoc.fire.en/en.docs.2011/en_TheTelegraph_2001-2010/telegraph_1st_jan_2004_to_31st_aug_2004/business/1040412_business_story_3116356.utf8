Does alaska with its fabulous glaciers, great wildlife and fascinating native culture beckon you? Then the only way to experience the rugged expanse of Alaskas coastline is by cruising. 																								A cruise takes you where road and rail cannot  through the glorious Inside Passage with its historic towns and deep blue fjords to the glacier-filled Gulf of Alaska where you can experience days of unforgettable whale sightings and witness the awesome power of glaciers.																								Princess Cruises offers you this spectacular sea experience  aboard the most luxurious Princess cruise ships. 																								The Gulf of Alaska cruise, also known as the Voyage of the Glaciers, is a memorable seven-night cruise on any one of four ships  Dawn, Island, Sun or Coral Princess. It shows most of Alaskas coastline, including the Glacier Bay National Park, College Fjord, Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway and also the Inside Passage. This is a one-way itinerary, either northbound  from Vancouver to Whittier, or Southbound  from Whittier to Vancouver. 																								The Inside Passage sailing is a seven-day roundtrip from Seattle on the Diamond or Sapphire Princess and shows Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Victoria, B.C. and Tracy Arm Fjord. 																								The promotional price for the one-way itinerary and the round trip is $399 and $649 per person for double occupancy and interior stateroom. And if seven days on a cruise does not satisfy your cravings, then you can opt for a Princess Alaska cruise tour which will combine another four to nine days on land.					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Wockhardt gets ready to pop bonus, stock-split pills
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Khorakiwala: Divide amp; rule Mumbai, Feb. 5: Wockhardt  Ltd is considering a bonus issue and a split of its shares  with a face-value of Rs 10.																								The board of directors will meet on February 12 to take a call on both issues. The share of Habil F. Khorakiwalas company rose 6 per cent from previous days Rs 699.75 to close at Rs 741.90 on a day when the BSE sensex finished in the red. The share had touched an intra-day high of Rs 760.																								Analysts said the plan follows similar moves by Dr Reddys and Sun Pharmaceuticals. These companies have split the face value of their 10-rupee shares to Rs 5. 																								Till now, this trend was more pronounced among infotech companies, with Wipro and Infosys splitting their shares some years ago. More recently, a clutch of automobile companies, including Ashok Leyland, had lined up plans to split the face-value of their shares.																								One of the arguments in favour of a stock-split is that it will increase the liquidity of the companys shares, which will have a better circulation on the bourses.																								Only 36,479 Wockhardt shares changed hands today despite increased investor interest, reflecting a lack of adequate number of shares. According to analysts, a better floating stock ratio will also attract more foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who currently hold a mere 1.11 per cent stake in the company. Local institutions, on the other hand, hold around 7 per cent stake.																								Recently, consumer durables major Mirc Electronics announced a stock split from Rs 10 to Re 1.																								Analysts expect a similar division in the share price of Wockhardt. With fast strides made in the biotech sector, the company has been pro-active in growing both through the organic and inorganic routes.																								The Khorakhiwalas hold 69.41 per cent of the drug majors shares. Persons acting in concert hold another 4.54 per cent, taking the total promoter holding to 73.95 per cent.																								In December, Wockhardt was granted five years of exclusive marketing rights for its topical antibacterial drug Nadoxin (nadifloxacin) by Indian Controller General of Patents and Trademarks. 																								It thus became the first domestic pharmaceutical company to receive an exclusive marketing rights grant.

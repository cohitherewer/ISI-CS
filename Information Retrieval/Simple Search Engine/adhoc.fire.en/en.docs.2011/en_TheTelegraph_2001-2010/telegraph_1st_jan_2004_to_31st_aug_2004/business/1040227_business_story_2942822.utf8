The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 United Bank poised for 40% jump in net
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 26: United Bank of India (UBI) expects to post a 40 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 425-450 crore in the current financial year, chairman and managing director Madhukar said.																								The UBI chief, scheduled to retire on February 29, said the bank would be able to wipe out its cumulative losses of Rs 1,600 crore by the next financial year.																								In April-December, the bank has already posted a profit of Rs 242 crore against Rs 305 clocked in the full year to March 2003. 																								The capital adequacy ratio, an indicator of a banks financial strength, stood at 16.63 per cent against the Reserve Bank of Indias stipulated 9 per cent and up from 10.40 per cent in 2001.																								The Calcutta-based UBI, earlier labelled as a weak bank, had predominantly been in the red until two years back with the government advising closure of 50 of its 1,300 branches.																								A task force formed by the Confederation of Indian Industry had earlier recommended the liquidation of the bank. This task force was headed by K. V. Kamath, managing director and chief operating officer of ICICI Bank, the countrys largest private bank.																								Without any government assistance, we have been able to achieve a turnaround and book profits, said Madhukar who will be replaced by Prakash Singh, executive director of the Punjab and Sind Bank.																								UBI today opened a new branch in Noida after almost 30 years. The opening of a branch is a psychological victory for it helps us reinforce the fact that we are no longer a weak bank, he said. 																								In the last financial year, the bank was successful in reducing its losses by Rs 500 crore. We expect to reduce our losses by another Rs 500 crore this fiscal, he said, adding that the net non-performing assets have been halved to 5.4 per cent in the last two years.																								We have been able to recover Rs 1,200 crore due to inter-branch unreconciled items which helped us overcome our losses, Madhukar said. The bank is on an upward growth-curve and will soon start expanding its network of branches, he added.																								The bank, a relatively late entrant to retail lending, will aim to boost its retail loans to around 15 per cent of total loans by the next fiscal, said bank officials. They comprised around 10 per cent of its total loans of Rs 9,000 crore as of now.																								Indian banks have reported strong earnings growth in recent years on bumper bond trading profits and a boom in retail lending stoked by interest rates, which are now at three-decade troughs.

 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Bid to win back foreign investors
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, June 2: Finance minister P. Chidambaram is slowly but steadily bringing foreign investors back into the Indian equity markets. 																								His conference with JP Morgan, a big-ticket foreign institutional investor, has managed to turn it into a believer in the Indian markets again. 																								India story remains intact, says a report penned by JP Morgan which was also reiterated by Arup Raha, head of equity research at JP Morgan.																								JP Morgan was the first institutional brokerage to receive a call from Chidambaram. The exercise will continue tomorrow when several FIIs, including heavyweight CLSA, troop into the city to hold meetings with the finance minister.																								Bharat Parajia, head of sales with CLSA Singapore, and several analysts will fly down from the island state. Meetings with DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak Mahindra (partner of Goldman Sachs in India) and JM Morgan Stanley have also been scheduled.																								Representatives of Capital International are also expected to call on the finance minister.																								FIIs are worried about the statements made by the Left parties on divestment and other reforms. 																								Significantly, the figures issued by the market regulator reveal that in the past three days FIIs have been net buyers after having sold for the most part of May. 																								FIIs like JP Morgan are heartened by the new bevy of ministers led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram. 																								They will keenly watch the governments first budget to ascertain the direction of the reforms process. 																								Interestingly, Morgan Stanley had only recently downgraded Indias stock market weightage. It is to be seen whether the FII changes its stance after tomorrows meeting.

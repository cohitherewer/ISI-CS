The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Trai asked to lift fetters on Net telephony
				 Open Access 																								New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): Internet service providers (ISPs) have asked the telecom regulator to permit unrestricted internet telephony, saying that in return they could consider contributing up to 5 per cent of their revenues from such services towards universal service obligation (USO).																								Unrestricted internet telephony will help achieve the socio-economic objectives of the government towards delivering better quality of life to citizens... Restricting internet telephony will run counter to the national policy itself, Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) said.																								In its response to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) consultation paper on accelerating the growth of internet and broadband, the association said that worldwide there was no precedence of imposing USO contribution on internet service providers.																								However, considering the urgency of increasing ICT penetration in the country, internet service providers could consider contributing towards USO not exceeding 5 per cent of the adjusted gross revenue from unrestricted internet telephony, it said.																								At present, PC to PC internet telephony is permitted everywhere, while PC-phone internet telephony is allowed for calls routed outside India. 																								On the issue of reduction of direct cost to users of internet, the association said that usage volume would definitely increase if tariffs charged by the access providers are reduced, since the dial-up charges constitute about 80 per cent of the total cost of dialup access cost currently.																								It is estimated that with 50 per cent reduction, the volumes would almost double, ISPAI said.																								The association said there was ample scope for reduction in dial-up charges by the access providers.																								Trai has already said in its notification on tariff order dated December 3 that there is an incremental revenue for the basic operators by way of dial-up revenues. Hence, there is an inherent incentive for the basic operators to take steps towards enhancing the internet usage and traffic, ISPAI said. MTNL price cut																								Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) has slashed its lease line and data circuit prices by around 30-50 per cent. 																								The reduction in prices, effective from January 1, is to offer bandwidth at competitive prices and retain the existing customers of the company, MTNL officials said.

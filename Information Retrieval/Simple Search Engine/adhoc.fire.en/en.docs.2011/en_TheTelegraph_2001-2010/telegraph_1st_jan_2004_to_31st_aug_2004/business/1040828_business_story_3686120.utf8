 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Wimco reduces share value
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 27: Wimco Ltd plans to reduce the face value of its shares to Re 1 from Rs 10 apiece to set off about Rs 46.80 crore from the total accumulated losses of Rs 53.23 crore on March 31.																								The board decision, taken at a meeting held today, will now be put before the shareholders for approval. The match making company can then bring down its nominal equity capital by 90 per cent from Rs 52 crore at present.																								The board approved the proposal to reduce the nominal and paid-up value of shares from Rs 10 to Re 1 apiece and utilise the amount to set off some part of the losses, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).																								On the BSE, the Wimco share displayed volatility as it hit an intra-day high of Rs 45 and a low of Rs 37 after it had opened at Rs 43.80. The companys share, however, ended weak at Rs 40.																								Wimco had earlier obtained a permission from Bombay High Court on a petition for utilising Rs 22.66 crore in the share premium accounts for adjusting against the accumulated losses of Rs 69.16 crore in the books of the company on March 31, 2003.																								Apart from these efforts to prune its losses, the company has also offered a voluntary retirement scheme to its employees at the Ambarnath factory in Maharashtra. In the first quarter of the current year, Wimco posted a loss of Rs 1.23 crore on net sales of Rs 35 crore. On the other hand, for the year ended March 31, 2004, while sales was placed at Rs 149 crore, the company posted a loss of Rs 7.15 crore.																								Wimcos Swedish parent, Swedish Match, had challenged the order of the securities appellate tribunal (SAT) to make an open offer to the minority shareholders of the company at Rs 35 per share and pay the penal interest at 15 per cent per annum for delay in making the offer.																								The apex court recently passed a judgement on a case wherein it ruled that the inter-stake transfer between the joint promoters made the takeover norms applicable. The court opined that the acquisition of shares by Swedish Match triggered the Sebi takeover norms.

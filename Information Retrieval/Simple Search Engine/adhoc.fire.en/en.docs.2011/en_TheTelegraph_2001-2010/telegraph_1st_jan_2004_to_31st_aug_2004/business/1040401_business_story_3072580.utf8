 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 PTC ups rates, power board to pay more
 SUTANUKA GHOSALCalcutta, March 31: The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) will have to pay more to buy power from Power Trading Corporation (PTC) during the evening peak period. 																								Effective midnight today, PTC will charge Rs 3 per unit from the board against the earlier rate of Rs 2.65.																								According to a bilateral agreement signed with PTC, the board will pay Rs 3 per unit from April 1, 2004, said M. K. Roy, member (commercial) of the board.																								WBSEB now buys 50 MW of power from PTC during the evening peak period.																								The board will have to pay higher if it crosses its drawal limit of 50 MW. 																								Depending on our frequency, PTC may charge us as high as Rs 6 per unit, Roy added.																								The move will eat into the revenues of the board which is trying hard to correct its financial health and post profits.																								Moreover, the board will have to think twice before it approaches PTC for more power during severe shortfalls if one of its generating units breaks down.																								WBSEB sells power to PTC during the off-peak period. It earns nearly Rs 300-350 crore through export of surplus off-peak power.																								The trading transactions of PTC now cover all the five electricity regions of the country. PTCs major trading partners include West Bengal, Damodar Valley Corporation, Uttaranchal, Delhi, Haryana, Malana Power Company, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa and Andhra Pradesh. 																								PTC has signed deals with time frames varying from three years to three days, thus progressively putting into shape the concept of a spot market in the domestic power sector. 																								The company has also been able to put into effect a variety of concepts like time-of-the-day trading involving power flows for specific time bands each day during the contract period. 																								As a result, the same customer can sell and buy power in the course of a day. One can buy power when in deficit and sell power when in surplus. 																								PTC has worked out a payment security system for buyers. Payment can be done in three ways  a) direct payment, b) payment through letter of credit and c) escrow or access to revenue stream of the state electricity board (SEB).																								In the event of any default in payment, the corporation may stop supply and find alternative buyers.																								Liability of fixed charges and fuel take or pay, if any, continues even after stoppage of supply for a definite period or till PTC finds an alternative buyer.

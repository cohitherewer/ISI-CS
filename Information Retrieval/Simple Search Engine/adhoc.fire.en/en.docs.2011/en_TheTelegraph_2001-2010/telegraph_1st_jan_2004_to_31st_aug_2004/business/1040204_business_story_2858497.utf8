 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 3: Shipping companies can now hope to set sail on profitable waters. Finance minister Jaswant Singh today accepted a long-standing demand of the industry when he announced the imposition of a tonnage tax scheme.																								The proposal, if implemented, would have a direct, positive bearing on the balancesheet of shipping companies, analysts said. 																								Imposition of tonnage tax means tax will now be levied on tonnage or the asset capacity carried by the company during a period instead of being levied on profits. It is charged as a flat rate on the gross registered tonnage of shipping companies. 																								The system will help companies mitigate their tax burden in this highly cyclical industry. 																								Sources said the move would also see domestic shipping companies acquire more vessels. It will also help the ship breaking industry.																								Industry sources said that while tonnage tax has been a long-standing demand of the industry, its implementation would not only benefit existing companies but also see the entry of new players.

 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Merrill Lynch, D amp;B join feel-good bandwagon
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 20: While DSP Merrill Lynch today revised the gross domestic product (GDP) estimates in 2003-04 to 8 per cent from 7.3 per cent, Dun amp; Bradstreet (D amp;B) said the corporate sector is bullish about demand prospects for this quarter.																								The merchant banker, which based its higher forecast on the back of strong GDP numbers for the second quarter, raised the growth rate in 2004-05 to 7.3 per cent from 6.5 per cent. This will be due to a strong momentum in services and a good monsoon this year resulting into a higher industrial growth.																								It estimated that the growth momentum will accelerate with GDP averaging over 8.5 per cent per annum in 2005-07, a growth rate that is highest since 1989.																								We expect a turnaround in the investment cycle in 2004-05 supported by a sharp increase in infrastructure spend, a turnaround in the capex cycle and rising domestic demand supported by the buoyancy in consumption, DSP Merrill Lynch said in a report released today. 																								It added that the total investment spend is likely to rise 60 per cent to $208 billion by 2006-07. On the other hand, capital formation in the economy is likely to rise from an estimated 21 per cent of the GDP in 2003-04 to 24 per cent by 2007.																								The power, retailing, telecom, cement, capital goods, autos and financial sectors are expected to be prime beneficiaries of a strong economic growth, it said.																								According to DSP Merrill Lynch vice-president (research) Rajeev Varma, the total spend for infrastructure will increase almost 62 per cent to $76 billion between 2004 and 2007. The power sector is likely to be the largest contributor accounting for almost 25 per cent of the total spend, followed by oil and gas and roads.																								On the other hand, leading business information provider D amp;B said its business expectation survey for the first quarter of the calendar year 2004 reveals that business confidence has improved significantly over the previous quarter.																								The composite business optimism index, which measures the pulse of the business community, for the quarter rose 12.6 per cent to 148.8 from 132.2 in the previous one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Day traders prefer to stay away from ring
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, May 17: The recent volatility on the bourses saw day traders keeping away from the market, but todays mayhem sent a clear signal for them to stay away from the market till it achieved some stability.																								The atmosphere of the market since the first exit poll was somewhat conducive for day traders to operate since the volatility provided opportunities to make gains, but today was a complete no-no, said Chandravadan Desai of CD Equisearch.																								In a normal scenario, day trading constitutes around 25 per cent of the total volume of the market and it has been reduced to 5-10 per cent since the first election phase, said brokers at Lyons Range. In the present market scenario, only actual buyers and sellers come to the forefront and the gamblers stay away.																								According to Ajit Khandelwal of BNK Securities, day traders enter the market after assessing properly and judging the market movement. But todays market did not give any opportunity to traders for assessing or judging sentiments. It is suicidal for these traders to operate on a day when trading has to be stopped, because one never knows which direction the market may take after trading resumes. 																								Day trading is actually ideal in a range-bound market where the upper and the lower limits can be gauged. But since the first exit poll, the market has reacted haphazardly, without giving any proper indications of the actual direction. Many day traders could have profited by short-selling, where they expected the market to fall and thus sold the shares at higher prices without any physical delivery and buying when prices dipped due to heavy selling.																								According to many, heavy selling across the bourses was to cover up for margin trading where brokers sold off shares since buyers were not in a position to bring the funds required to cover the losses. This situation may also lead to a payment crisis where the brokers will have to meet up the shortfall in funds on behalf of the investors.																								As for the reason behind this crash and the huge compounding effect, every individual associated with the stock market blamed the Left parties for making irrelevant statements, which had a direct impact on this carnage.																								The statements made by the Left parties could have been more refined. It went against the market sentiments and resulted in a massive erosion of shareholders wealth, said Desai. A similar view was shared by Ajit Day of Dayco Securities. The statements made by the left parties triggered this huge crash on the bourses, he said. There cannot be any other major reason, since the fundamentals, which were looking so good, cannot change within a month, he added.																								Investors are scared that the economic policies, which will be implemented by the Congress-led government, will be opposed by the Left front at every step. This is bound to prove detrimental for reforms and may result in a slowdown of economic growth. The statement regarding the removal of the disinvestment ministry also affected market sentiments. As a result, it not only resulted in the fall of the PSU stocks, but had an all-pervasive effect.

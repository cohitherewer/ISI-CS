 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Upbeat Bertelsmann eyes acquisitions
				 	 Bertelsmann chairman Gunter Thielen addressing a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Berlin, March 30 (Reuters): German media giant Bertelsmann is returning to the acquisition trail after posting a 20 per cent rise in underlying 2003 earnings on Tuesday, helped by cost cuts and bumper Christmas sales at music division BMG. 																								Europes biggest media firm said it was eyeing acquisitions after it sold assets to cut debt last year, and forecast a further increase in core earnings in 2004 even as sales stagnate for another year. 																								We rely on growth from within, on creativity and innovation, and on acquisitions to strengthen our core business, chief executive Gunter Thielen said at a news conference in Berlin. 																								The current year has already shown promise, thus we expect that Bertelsmann will continue to increase its operating results, he added. 																								Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) at Bertelsmann were 1.123 billion euros ($1.37 billion) as cost cutting in all divisions helped offset a sales drop of 8.3 per cent to 16.8 billion euros. 																								Artists, including pop queen Alicia Keys and rap group Outkast, helped propel BMG, the unit being merged with Sony Music, to EBITA of 227 million euros in the second half-year, and nearly stable sales, despite a global music industry slump. 																								We have seen BMG catching up tremendously in the last quarter after we still had an operating loss in the first six months of the year, said chief financial officer Siegfried Luther. 																								Net profit fell sharply to 154 million euros from 928 million euros last year when it booked large gains from the sale of its AOL Europe asset to Time Warner. 																								Luther said the group, which spans television, books, music, magazines, printing and services, had cut debt enough so that it now has 2 billion euros of financial headroom it could use for acquisitions in the next three years. What is important for me is that Bertelsmann is now again able to act if opportunities arise, Luther said.

 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Ministry go-ahead for HPCL pipeline
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 11: The petroleum ministry today gave the go-ahead to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) for its Rs 1,300-crore Mundra-Delhi pipeline project. The 1,000-km pipeline will be laid from the Gujarat coast to carry petrol, diesel and kerosene to the north.																								Hindustan Petroleum is going in for a new pipeline as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is converting its Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline from a product pipeline into a crude oil pipeline to feed the expanding capacities of its Panipat and Mathura refineries.																								Currently, there is a shortage of petroleum products in the north which is a high-demand area and a neat chunk of the petrogoods comes from the 27-million-tonne Jamnagar refinery owned by Reliance Industries through the IOC pipeline. Once the Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline is converted there will be a further shortfall of these products in the north.																								HPCL is also picking up products from the IOC refineries as part of the hospitality arrangement among public sector oil companies. However, fierce competition has broken out among the oil companies with the winds of liberalisation sweeping through the petroleum sector.																								HPCL officials disclose that IOC gives preference to its own marketing network and often keeps them waiting when they are in need of quick refills. This arm-twisting will stop once we have our own infrastructure in place, a senior HPCL official told The Telegraph.																								The Mundra-Delhi-pipeline is scheduled to be completed in three years and will run through Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana before it enters Delhi. The pipeline will have a capacity of carrying around 6 million tonnes of petroleum products a year.																								Petroleum products could be imported at Mundra or alternatively the pipeline could have a link with the Jamnagar refinery as well. Since it is being built on the common-carrier principle laid down under the government policy, Reliance could use the pipeline if it is prepared to pay the transport charges, the HPCL official said.																								The pipeline could thus come as a boon for Reliance as at the moment the company is completely dependent on the Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline which will not be available once IOC converts it into a crude pipeline.

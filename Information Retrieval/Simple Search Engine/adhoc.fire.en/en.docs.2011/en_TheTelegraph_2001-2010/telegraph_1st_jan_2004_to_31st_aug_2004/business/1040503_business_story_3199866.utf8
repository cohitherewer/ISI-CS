 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Local oil firms to fuel Shells retail venture
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Going places 																								Calcutta, May 2: Royal Dutch-Shell has drawn up a long-term retailing plan for India and is in talks with Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) and Reliance to procure petrol and diesel for its requirement.																								Sources said Shell India, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch-Shell, has decided not to make any investment in the refining sector in the short term. But it is keen to make a foray into oil retailing in the current financial year for which it needs to have sourcing tie-ups.																								MRPL and Reliance are planning to jack up their production capacity in a phased manner over the next few years in their refineries at Mangalore and Jamnagar, respectively.																								The company is in talks with a couple of domestic refiners for a long-term supply of petrol and diesel. But the discussions are still at a very early stage and we may not be able to provide any further details, a senior Shell official said.																								The third largest oil company in the world is not interested in setting up refineries in India because the current refining capacity is at least 10 million tonnes higher than the existing demand.																								Shell feels that setting up another refinery will only spark unnecessary competition in the country, where the current demand is 107 million tonnes.																								Rather, we should invest in the retail sector for strong brand positioning, the official said.																								Shell has plans to set up 2,000 petrol pumps across the country for which it has submitted an application with the central government last week.																								The Shell retail network, when in place, will be the second stand-alone oil marketing company after the Calcutta-based IBP, Indian Oils subsidiary.																								Shell is also not much in favour of importing petroleum and diesel as it may not be cheaper than sourcing the products from Indian refiners.																								Shell had been earlier given a licence to sell petrol and diesel with a pre-condition that it had to either furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 500 crore or make an investment of Rs 2,000 crore in oil infrastructure to begin transport fuel retailing.																								The company has informed the petroleum ministry last week that it had invested more than Rs 2,000 crore in constructing its 2.5 million tonnes LNG import and regassification terminal at Hazira in Gujarat which make it entitled for the licence.																								The company is planning to come up with its first petrol pump in the current financial year itself.																								For the entire network, the company may have to invest over Rs 1,000 crore, sources said.

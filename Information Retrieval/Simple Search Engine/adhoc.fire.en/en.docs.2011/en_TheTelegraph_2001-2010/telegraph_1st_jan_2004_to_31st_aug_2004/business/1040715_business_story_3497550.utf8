 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Pharmacia-Pfizer merger swap ratio fixed at 1:5
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 14: A swap ratio of one share of Pfizer India Ltd for every five of Pharmacia Healthcare has been fixed for the merger of the two companies.																								The amalgamation will create a pharmaceutical major with a presence in cardio vascular, nutritionals, anti-infectives, cough preparations and oncology segments. 																								While Pfizer India posted a total income of Rs 515 crore during the year ended November 30, 2003, the topline of Pharmacia Healthcare stood at over Rs 30 crore.																								While Pharmacia Healthcares shares have a face value of Rs 5 apiece, Pfizer Indias stand at Rs 10. The merger announcement saw the Pharmacia Healthcare stock dipping over 10 per cent to Rs 102.85 from its previous close of Rs 114.65. Market analysts said the drop was to adjust for the swap ratio. Pfizer India also dipped to Rs 451.25 from its previous close of Rs 455.																								Pfizer Inc had acquired Pharmacia Healthcare in an April 2003 global merger. While the operations of the two companies were integrated in the same year, a legal clearance was awaited.																								Following the global merger of Pharmacia Corporation and Pilsner Acquisition Sub Corp, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc, from April 16, 2003, Pharmacia Corporation became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Pfizer.																								Consequently, Pfizer Inc indirectly owned 75.10 per cent of Pharmacia Healthcare.																								The legal merger recently became a certainty when Pfizer Indias top management said at its annual general meeting that while Pharmacia Corporation has merged with Pfizer Inc globally, the board would consider a legal merger of the company with Pfizer India. As part of the move, Pfizer India stopped operations at its Ankleshwar plant.																								It was also pointed out that the legal merger would be a win-win situation for both companies with Pharmacias strong product portfolio giving Pfizer a larger market share.

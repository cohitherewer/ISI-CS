 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Indian Oil, Reliance to ink sourcing deal
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 N. G. Kanan, director (marketing), IOC, in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, May 21: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has agreed to source petroleum products from Reliances Jamnagar refinery. This is the third time that the product-sourcing contract will be signed between the public sector oil major and Reliance.																								IOC director (marketing) N. G. Kannan said both Indian Oil and Reliance have, in principle, agreed to forge a marketing tie-up which will be signed shortly.																								According to the agreement, IOC will source 4.3 million tonnes of diesel from Reliance compared with its earlier off-take of 1.28 million tonnes.																								There are no hitches now and the agreement is going to be a win-win situation for both the companies, he said.																								Reliance has agreed to give considerable discounts on diesel that IOC is going to source from Jamnagar refinery, Kannan added.																								In fact, the off-take price from Reliance will be lower than IOCs own production in some refineries, he said.																								Reliance will also benefit from the agreement as it would have lost Rs 1,800 per tonne if it exported the products.																								On the companys marketing strategy to combat competition, Kannan said IOC has embarked on a total branding exercise to achieve a distinct identity in the market.																								The company has already commissioned Leo Burnett and Rediffusion to prepare the roadmap for the branding exercise, he said.																								Till date we have two brands  Servo and Indane. But, we have now decided to brand all our products, he added.																								IOC, which has achieved a 2 per cent growth year-on-year in the last fiscal, has also decided to invest Rs 1,350 crore this year in retail network and Rs 1,250 crore in the LPG segment.																								The company will also invest around Rs 2,000 crore in two phases in Bengal. In the first phase, a Rs 1,500-crore hydro-cracker unit will be set up in Haldia refinery, while in the second phase, the company will spend Rs 350 crore to upgrade product profile. The remaining amount will be invested in retail networking.																								Kannan said the merger between IOC and its subsidiary IBP will be completed in the next six months and due diligence will start shortly.																								He said the merger would benefit IOC in every aspect as there will be significant savings. The IBP brands will continue to exist even after the merger takes place, he added.

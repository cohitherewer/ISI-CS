 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Inflation flares up to 5.5%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 18: The rate of inflation went up sharply to 5.55 per cent for the week ended June 5, fuelled by a 5 per cent increase in vegetable prices and a substantial hike in manufactured items and fuels used for power generation and fertiliser production.																								The rate is likely to shoot up further in the coming weeks due to the June 15 hike in prices of petrol, diesel and LPG which will have to be factored into the estimates. The increase in diesel prices is likely to impart a cost-push effect to inflation as it is used widely as an input in the transport and farm sectors.																								The government had raised the petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 and Re 1 per litre, respectively, and that of LPG, by Rs 20 per cylinder.																								According to official statistics, the point-to-point wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose for the fourth consecutive week by 0.52 per cent from the previous level of 5.03 per cent. The index was 5.36 per cent in the same period last year.																								WPI surged 0.6 per cent to 182.7 points in the first week of June with indices of primary articles, fuels and manufactured products going up. It was at 173.1 in the corresponding period of the previous year.																								The Centre revised upwards the final figure to 4.57 per cent for the week ended April 10 against the provisional level of 4.40 per cent. The final WPI stood corrected at 180.8 points in the second week of April compared with the provisional figure of 180.5 points.																								The index of primary articles group was up 0.4 per cent to 186.9 points due to costlier food articles, even as non-food items became cheaper. The index was 181.6 points in the year-ago period.Scare on markets																								Fears of a rising inflation rate spooked markets, which see this as a possible precursor to hardening interest rates.																								The sensex slid 70 points to close at 4769.99 compared with Thursdays 4839.88. It opened weak at 4833.84 and gradually moved downwards to an intra-day low of 4750.73.																								Analysts fear that statistics would be worse next week as the price hikes in oil and coal will be adjusted only next week.																								The volume of business was low as institutions and retail investors largely stayed on the sidelines. Infosys, Wipro, Bhel and HDFC registered marginal gains.

 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Jai Balaji to raise Rs 100 crore
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb.2: Jai Balaji Sponge Ltd (JBSL) plans to raise Rs 100 crore through private placement to part finance its Rs 260-crore expansion proposal of the Durgapur plant. The company is planning to treble the plants capacity from 1.05 lakh tonne to 3.55 lakh tonne.																								This is the second time JBSL is raising money to fund its expansion proposal. The company remained the first steel firm to have raised Rs 10 crore through an initial public offering last year. The fund was mobilised to enhance the plant capacity from 60,000 tonnes to over one lakh tonne.																								According to managing director Aditya Jajodia, the latest expansion strategy has been mooted to match the demand trend in the booming steel market. 																								After a prolonged recession, now whatever you produce is sold without any problem. In fact, we are not able to cater to clients demands with our existing capacity, he adds.																								The company is setting up a 12-MW captive power plant, which will be based on waste gas. It has decided to set up another 30-MW captive power plant in the second phase of the expansion plan. 																								Jajodia also pointed out that the company will be in downstream steel production with a 3-lakh-tonne capacity. The entry into the downstream sector will help JBSL to complete its integration between sponge-iron and steel-making. 																								The company has registered a 90 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 4.92 crore during the first nine months ended December 31, 2003, compared with Rs 2.59 crore in the corresponding period last year.																								Turnover increased 69 per cent to Rs 93 crore during the reporting period as against Rs 55 crore in the corresponding previous period.

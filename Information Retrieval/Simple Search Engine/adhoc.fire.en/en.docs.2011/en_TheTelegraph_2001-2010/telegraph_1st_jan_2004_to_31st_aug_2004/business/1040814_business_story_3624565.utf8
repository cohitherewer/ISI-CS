 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 LIC sniffs scope abroad
 A STAFF REPORTER LIC managing director R.N . Bhardwaj in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Aug. 13: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is looking at expanding its international operations. It has conducted preliminary studies in six overseas markets.We have seen business potential in Botswana, Seychelles, Madagascar, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and Maldives, managing director R.N . Bhardwaj said on the sidelines of a two-day insurance seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								The expansion in Botswana, Seychelles and Madagascar would be done through the corporations Mauritius office and that of Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and Maldives would be through the Fiji office, said Bhardwaj.																								This is part of LICs strategy to generate a 5 per cent premium income from offshore operations, which has increased from 0.49 per cent in 2000-01 to 1.21 per cent in 2002-03 and 2.21 in 2003-04.																								We plan to increase our offshore premium income to 5 per cent from the current level of 2 per cent in the next two to three years, said Bhardwaj.																								Initially, the corporation plans to expand its operations in the new countries through brokers. And once it obtained substantial business, it would establish separate outlets and look for joint ventures.																								We already have a branch at London where all the operations are outsourced. At present, the branch is undergoing restructuring and once it starts functioning we can make a foray into the European market. We will decide on whether to operate it as a branch or opt for a joint venture, Bhardwaj said. 																								To be successful in the European market, one has to offer a competitive product, he added.																								On the issue of LIC holding more than 10 per cent stake in both UTI and Corporation Bank, while the Reserve Bank of Indias proposal is to cut the promoters stake to 10 per cent, Bhardwaj said the financial institutions may not face any problem. It is still under discussion and it may not affect the financial institutions holding more than 10 per cent stake in any entity.																								LIC is examining proposals from a couple of large foreign companies, including CapitalOne, to launch credit cards. According to Bhardwaj, various issues relating to relationship, data, additional benefits and technology have to be worked out before a final decision can be reached.

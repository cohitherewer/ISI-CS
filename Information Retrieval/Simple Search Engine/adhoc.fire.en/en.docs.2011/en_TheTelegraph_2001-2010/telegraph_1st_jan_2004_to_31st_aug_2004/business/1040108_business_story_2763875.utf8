 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Fight-back in sensex see-saw
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 7: The Bombay Stock Exchange witnessed volatile trading today on alternate bouts of buying and selling, which saw leading pivotals came back strongly after nestling in the red for most part of the day. The sensex swung 113 points during the day before ending 13 points higher at 5957.02.																								The volatility, ahead of announcements of the third quarter results by blue chip companies in the next two to three weeks, was attributed to a cautious approach by bull operators who have built up large positions in the past few sessions.																								A direction will become apparent after Infosys announces its third quarter results on Friday.																								Investors were also heartened by the continued support from foreign institutional investors. 																								The BSE benchmark 30-share index opened higher at 5970.35 and later moved erratically in a wide range between 5985.30 and 5870.55 before ending at 5957.02 against yesterdays close of 5943.64, a gain of 13.38 points.																								Market watchers said local institutions led by UTI were big sellers today. 																								Among the major pivotals that gained were Bhel, Grasim, L amp;T, Reliance, Tata Power and Tata Steel.																								The losers were Bajaj Auto, Dr Reddys, Bharti Tele-Venture, HDFC, HLL, ICICI Bank, MTNL and Tata Motors.																								The market is expected to undergo correction in continued volatility before the quarterly corporate results are announced this month. 																								In the specified list, 50, including 16 index-based counters, registered sharp to moderate gains, while 145 others closed with losses.																								The volume of business was relatively low at Rs 3115.17 crore from Rs 3393.06 crore yesterday. 																								Reliance spurted by Rs 11.40 to Rs 579.65, Grasim by Rs 51.65 to Rs 1050.25 and ONGC by Rs 18.50 to Rs 902.15.

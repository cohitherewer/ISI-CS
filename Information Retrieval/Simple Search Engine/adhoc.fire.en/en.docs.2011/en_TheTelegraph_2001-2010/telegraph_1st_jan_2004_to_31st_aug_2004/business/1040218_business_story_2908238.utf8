 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Many twists in endgame on final terms of share offering
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 17: The sale of government equity in six listed companies will see a lot of last-minute improvisations by the disinvestment ministry in consultation with merchant bankers to discover an appropriate price for private investors.																								Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said it is probably for the first time in the history of primary markets that merchant bankers are trying to discover a price for shares that are already listed on stock exchanges.																								Several permutations and combinations are being worked out by the ministry in consultation with the merchant bankers with differential pricing for small investors as an option. 																								Every company will be looked at separately for the price discovery, a disinvestment ministry official said. Ultimately, the pricing will be based on the confidence level of leading merchant bankers, he added.																								For instance, CMC with a low floating stock and a lower number of shares on offer may not get a discount that IPCL may entail, he explained.																								The equity divestment in each of the six companies will be different.																								On the retail shareholders being given a lower quota of 25 per cent of the total shares on sale, the official said this was only a notional figure. It could even be increased depending on the demand from small investors, he added.																								Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has informed the bourses that some shares will be reserved for its shareholders, indicating that different strategies are being adopted by the companies.																								Indian Oil and Gail (India) Ltd, who are shareholders of ONGC, will not have the same fortune.																								The price band will be announced one day before the bids open. In IPCLs case, it is February 19, CMCs is February 22.																								On Wednesday, the disinvestment ministry will give its recommendation to the finance ministry for its approval, Shourie said. 																								Prior to this meeting, the disinvestment ministry will discuss internally the issue of differential pricing.

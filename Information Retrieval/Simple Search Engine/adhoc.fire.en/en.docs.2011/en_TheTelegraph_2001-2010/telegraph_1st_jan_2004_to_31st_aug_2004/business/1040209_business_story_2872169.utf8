		 Monday, February 09, 2004  Q amp;A				 Its all about trust
																																																																																													I had invested in Unit Trusts Childrens Gift Growth Fund in November 1987. The bond matured in March 2003, but I havent received my money yet. Could you please help?																																																																													D. C. Goswami, Jorhat
																																																																																													We had forwarded the details of your deposit to Unit Trust of India. It said a cheque for Rs 21,609.89, dated March 18, 2003, was sent to your daughter, Pranali Goswami  the beneficiary of the deposit  to an address in Guwahati. But it could not be delivered. We suspect Unit Trust sent it to a wrong address. Unit Trust has promised to send another cheque through its Guwahati branch within a week. We gave Unit Trust your address in Jorhat that you had mentioned in your email.																																					Missing link																																																																																															My US-64 units were converted into US-64 bonds and US-2002 units. In a statement issued in November 2002, Unit Trust said it had allotted 725 units of US-2002, but did not send the US-2002 certificate. Could you please check what happened?																																																																													Amitabh, Jamshedpur
																																																																																													Unit Trust has clarified that it has stopped issuing unit certificates. It issues a statement of holding instead, which it sent to you in November 2002. Its a standard industry practice, and the statement is all youd need to sell the units.																																					Refund riddle																																																																																															I deposited an income tax refund cheque for Rs 509 drawn on the RBI, Calcutta, in my bank account a couple of times, but each time it was dishonoured. The Reserve Bank sent a slip along with the cheque saying: Advise not received. Please present again. I cant understand what this means. How do I realise the amount?																																																																													K. Datta, Calcutta
																																																																																													The income tax department insists it had sent the advise to you along with the cheque. You should have deposited the advise along with the cheque. If you hadnt received the advise  a yellow sheet of paper that measures the same as the cheque  it must have been misplaced. The department sends the advise along with the refund order if the tax refund is less than Rs 1,000. If it is more than that, the advise is sent to the RBI directly. If you receive a refund cheque for an amount more than Rs 1,000, it is advisable that you wait for a week before depositing the cheque in your bank account because the advise takes time to reach RBI. Youd now have to contact the I-T circle that had issued your refund order, to obtain a fresh advise and a new cheque. Issuing a new cheque and advise, the I-T department says, shouldnt take more than a fortnight.

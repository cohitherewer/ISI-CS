 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Marans perfect 10 for infotech
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 26: Communications and information technology minister Dayanidhi Maran today unveiled a 10-point agenda for promotion of information technology in the country with a focus on next generation mobile wireless technology and e-governance. 																								The government will soon set up a centre for excellence for next generation mobile wireless technologies. Efforts would be made to make India the worlds hub for outsourcing skilled manpower in the IT sector, Maran added. 																								I have plans to help the country leapfrog from the current generation of mobile telephony to the next fourth generation (4G). The 3G standard has been evolved, but has not proved cost effective. India has an opportunity with its large market and high technical skills to be a significant player in this field, he said.																								At present, India is using the technology of GSM (2.5G) and code division multiple access (CDMA) for mobile telephony. 																								The minister promised to expedite the convergence of technologies and penetration of personal computers to help promote cyber connectivity to every citizen. While the convergence of information technology, communications and media technologies as part of the convergence bill would be examined at an appropriate time, it would not be a stumbling block in IT penetration. 																								Maran promised to bring transparency in administration and to make it more citizen-centric. He stressed that the government would focus on promotion of e-governance and speedy implementation of a national e-governance plan. 																								Broadband connectivity to all at the most reasonable cost also appears on the governments priority lists. Broadband is an always-on internet connection with a minimum speed of 256 kilobits per second. 																								Marans initiative to promote the Indian internet domain name should find supporters in the Swadeshi lobby of BJP. I shall bring about a significant improvement in the Indian internet domain name (dot in) with a greater market focus to proliferate the internet. We will encourage major multinational companies to host their mirror sites in India and also encourage Indian companies to host sites to promote business and trade in India, the minister said.																								The government will also focus on implementation of the latest internet protocol Ipv6 by 2006. This protocol is capable of effectively managing the various security threats on the internet. 																								The minister also emphasised the need to concentrate on cyber infrastructure protection and assured that efforts would be made to promote the use of digital signature in the financial sector, judiciary and education. 																								Maran also promised to revitalise the Media Lab Asia to help provide seamless communications facility to rural areas. This is aimed to help micro enterprises to double the village GDP in a few years. The government will promote development and availability of low-cost personal computers and communication access devices to increase internet penetration by 10 times in a few years. 																								Extending healthcare services to remote areas using telemedicine, distance education will also be promoted, he said. 																								There will be efforts to increase the deployment of language computing solutions in the government, industry and society to help the disadvantaged sections. We will accelerate dialogue with state governments, linguists, research and development labs and industry to achieve this objective, the minister said.

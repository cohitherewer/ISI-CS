The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Cash cry from animation
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, April 11: The animation industry is wooing venture capitalists for financial help to compete in the global market and establish a strong domestic presence.																								Investments in TV animated series are coming down. Television networks demand a high quality at a low cost. As a result, the programmes are co-produced and take a long time to get into the final stages of production. The cost of production being high compared with live action, it becomes difficult for Asian countries to fully fund an entire TV series, Bangalore-based jadooWorks COO Ashish Kulkarni said.																								According to estimates, a 22-minute live action episode for TV costs between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 4 lakh, while an animated episode will cost around Rs 20 lakh.																								Toonz Animation creative director Atul Rao shares Kulkarnis concerns. The industry is battling large budgets, while delivering quality products. It has become necessary to find financing strategies to remain competitive and independent. This is another area where the IT industry can help. 																								Animation houses are concerned about a lack of corporate and project funding for Indian themes and original IP creation.																								Many feel that collaborating with global houses for animation projects will help reduce risks and costs. There is also a need to achieve international standards in organisation, delivery and quality.																								The industry is also concerned about the lack of government support. It is only recently that software apex body Nasscom has voiced its support for the Animation Producers Association of India (APAI).																								Nasscom predicts that the animation industry will grow by 300 per cent to reach $1.5 billion by 2005 from $0.6 billion at present and $5 billion by 2008. Animation is placed under IT services and comes under the STPI umbrella.																								It is high time that the government work on a policy for the industry and promote creative talent by starting a long-term degree course in animation, said Kulkarni. We have been into talks with several animation schools who plan to tie up with animation training institutes like MUV Technologies, Maya Entertainment, Zica, Animaster and Toonskool.

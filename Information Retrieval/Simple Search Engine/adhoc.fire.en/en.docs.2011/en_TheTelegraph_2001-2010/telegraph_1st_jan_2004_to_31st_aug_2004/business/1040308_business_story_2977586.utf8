The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Mobile makers burst into activity
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, March 7: The Indian Cellular Association (ICA) is working on a detailed position paper to create a long-term manufacturing base for mobile handsets. The report will be presented to various stakeholders in eight weeks.																								A committee, comprising representatives from the association, industry and the ministries of telecom, commerce and finance, will be formed to study the market and suggest ways to encourage manufacturing. 																								The association members include major players like Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Siemens, Motorola and LG.																								ICA president Pankaj Mohindroo said at least three companies were considering the option of setting up manufacturing units. He, however, declined to give further details on the companies.																								A few months ago, Nokia had considered setting up a unit in the western part of the country. The project was shelved as the numbers did not justify the investment. 																								It is estimated that the handset market will cross the $3.3-billion mark this year. Of this, $1.8 billion will flow from the GSM segment, while $1.3 billion will come from the CDMA players. 																								The fall in handset prices due to duty cuts has not only helped expand the market, but has also reduced the grey market share to a mere 20 per cent.																								The customs duty collection has gone up from below Rs 50 crore in 2001 to over Rs 700 crore in 2002, despite the reduction in duties. 																								The association has also pleaded with the government to reduce the duty component on parts, spares and accessories, the market for which is expected to grow from Rs 220 crore in 2002 to over Rs 4,250 crore in 2007. 																								There are over 30 accessories, components and parts that are replaced at regular intervals for use with mobile handsets. Duties on these items vary between 30 and 35 per cent. The legal market share for accessories is a mere 5 per cent.

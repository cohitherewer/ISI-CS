 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Daimler dumps Mitsubishi bailout plan
				 	 In a jam																								Stuttgart/Tokyo, April 23 (Reuters): DaimlerChrysler AG is pulling the plug on its stake in Mitsubishi Motors, leaving the German-US companys bid to become a global car maker in disarray and casting doubt over the Japanese firms future.																								DaimlerChrysler said late on Thursday it would not inject new funds into a proposed capital increase and rescue plan for Mitsubishi Motors Corp after it failed to reach an acceptable deal with other shareholders in the Mitsubishi group.																								We couldnt find a solution that satisfies our own shareholders, DaimlerChrysler chief financial officer Manfred Gentz told newspersons on Friday.																								Though DaimlerChrysler is ending financial support for Mitsubishi Motors and may reclassify its 37 per cent stake as available for sale, Gentz said the German firm had not yet decided to seek a buyer for its stake.																								Gentz said he saw no reason for an immediate write-off of the stake but could not specify the decisions impact on 2004 results. He said the US Chrysler unit would continue to co-operate with Mitsubishi on new vehicles and car production.																								As far as our Asian strategy is concerned, we have to reconsider what has to be changed and what cannot be, he added.																								DaimlerChrysler shares shot higher as investors expressed relief at what appeared to be the end of its costly entanglement with the struggling Japanese carmaker. They were trading up 7.8 per cent at $38.66, and several brokers upgraded the shares to buy.																								It looks like some members of the management or supervisory board eventually decided to stop throwing good money after bad, said Heino Ruland, auto analyst at Frankfurt brokerage firm Steubing AG.																								The decision came at an extraordinary meeting of DaimlerChryslers supervisory and management boards on Thursday, just two weeks after chief executive Juergen Schrempp defended his global strategy in front of angry shareholders.

 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Finolex lines up capex
																								Calcutta, June 6: Finolex Industries, the flagship company of the Rs 2500-crore Finolex group, has embarked on a massive expansion drive to double its production capacity from 1,30,000 tonnes to 2,80,000 tonnes.																								The company, which is one of the largest manufacturers of PVC (poly vinyl chloride) and related products, will invest Rs 500 crore in the expansion.																								Finolex needs to produce more to meet supply commitments in the domestic and international markets, where PVC products, especially pipe and fittings, are fast replacing those made of metal.																								Contractors favour PVC products because they last more and cost less than iron or ductile pipes. The demand is expected to double in the next three to four years and we want to be ready to cater to the need, sources said.																								Of the Rs 500 crore to be invested, Rs 350 crore will come from long-term debt and the remaining from internal accruals. The Finolex group is cash rich with large reserves. Its debt-equity ratio is so low that borrowing funds will not be a problem, the sources added.																								Finolexs debt-equity ratio will rise from 0.12:1 to 1:1 after the expansion. Since the brownfield expansion will cost the company much lower compared with a greenfield option, the return on capital employed is going to improve substantially from the existing 14.7 per cent once the project is complete.																								Finolex Industries has plants in Pune and Ratnagiri. The brownfield project, however, is going to be implemented at Ratnagiri, which is closer to the sea.																								Proximity to the sea provides us with strong benefits in terms of transport costs, both for raw materials and finished products. We are confident that after the expansion, we will be much ahead of other players not only in the PVC segment but also in the cable business, which is carried on through Finolex Cable, they said.																								Finolex Industries has already set up an open sea cryogenic jetty close to its factory in order to bring crude, a basic raw material for PVC.																								Another advantage for the company is the captive consumption of over 45.000 tonnes of PVC for manufacturing pipes and cable insulators.																								Finolex Cable is undoubtedly the market leader, particularly in the light-cable segment. The focus is also on the telecom-cable segment. Hence, the captive consumption of PVC insulators are rising day by day, they said.

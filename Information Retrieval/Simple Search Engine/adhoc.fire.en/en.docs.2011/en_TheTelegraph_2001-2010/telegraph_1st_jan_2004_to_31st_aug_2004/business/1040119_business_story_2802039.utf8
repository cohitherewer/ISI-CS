The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Small enterprises bask in feel-good afterglow
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: The flush of optimism that has suffused big business houses is spreading across the industrial landscape with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) equally gung-ho over their business prospects this year.																								Its all a part of the feel-good sentiment that has been sparked by strong fundamentals that underpin one of the best economic growth rates in the past decade.																								A Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) snap poll on the export trade prospects of SMEs shows that exports will be higher in the next six months.																								Sixty-five per cent of the respondents to the poll said they envisaged an increase in export volumes over the next six months; 10 per cent felt the market would be stagnant and another 10 per cent saw a decline in exports.																								That comes on the top of a previous snap poll of India Incs CEOs that showed a robust anticipation of a double-digit growth this year. According to the last CII CEO snap released in December, 74 per cent of the respondents expect their sales to grow more than 10 per cent, while a similar number expect their growth in profits also to be in double digits.																								The SME survey also highlights various issues, including the impact of volatility in the foreign exchange markets, dismantling of the quantitative restrictions and the preparedness of the Indian small industry to face the competition in the international markets. However, in value terms, 58 per cent respondents to the SME survey expected export value to increase, 29 per cent expected it to remain the same, whereas only 6 per cent felt it would decrease in the next six months.																								The survey also highlights that an encouraging 84 per cent of the respondents foresee an increase in the growth rate of exports. Of this, 26 per cent respondents expect the growth to be between 0 per cent and 10 per cent, 21 per cent say it will be between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, while 37 per cent of the respondents feel it will be greater than 20 per cent.																								However, only 16 per cent of the respondents expect a decline in the rate of growth of exports in the next six months. Seventy-one per cent of the respondents said they had maintained status quo after the dismantling of the quantitative restrictions in 2002.

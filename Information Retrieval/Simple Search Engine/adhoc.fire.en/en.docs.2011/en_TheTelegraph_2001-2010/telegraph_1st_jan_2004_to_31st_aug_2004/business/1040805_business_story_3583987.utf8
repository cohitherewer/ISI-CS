 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Fillip for coffee growers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Heady brew 																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: The year 2003 has been declared a distress year for coffee and normal for tea, based on their average annual domestic price in relation to a price band for these commodities that the government has just come up with. 																								The band represents the threshold below which a price stabilisation scheme will come into effect for growers who contribute to the corpus along with the government. The aim is to provide financial relief when prices of these commodities slip below a specified level.																								Since 2003 was a distress year for coffee, member-growers may withdraw up to Rs 1,000 from their savings bank accounts during 2004-05. The trust managing the price stabilisation fund in the commerce ministry has announced the 2003 bands for coffee, tea and rubber. It declared the year as a boom year for rubber.																								The government launched the price stabilisation fund scheme in April 2003 for the benefit of tea, coffee, natural rubber and tobacco growers. As no tobacco grower was enrolled under the scheme during 2003-04, the band for tobacco has not been fixed.																								The band for each commodity has been calculated on the basis of moving average of seven years of international price. The year can be categorised as boom, normal or distress for a commodity, based on the relationship of average annual domestic price to the band.																								Under the price stabilisation fund, the trust or members who have been enrolled under the scheme up to March 31 would make a prescribed contribution to the savings bank account of beneficiaries.																								The trust will deposit Rs 82.25 lakh for 8,225 coffee member growers at Rs 1,000 each. It would deposit Rs 9.31 lakh for 1,861 tea growers at Rs 500 each. The 16,240 rubber growers would deposit Rs 162.40 lakh at Rs 1,000 each.																								The scheme is based on the principle of contribution from growers and from the government, depending on boom/normal/distress years. There is a provision for withdrawal by the growers during distress years.																								The contribution of the participant growers as well as that of the government would be credited to the savings bank account opened with a nationalised bank. 																								The contribution of the participant grower/government in the account and withdrawal would be decided with reference to the price band fixed and announced every year.

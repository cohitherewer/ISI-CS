The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Last resort of hidden costs gone
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY Keep your worries at bay 																								Calcutta, June 13: Developers of timeshare tourism projects have decided to do away with the utility charges slapped on customers while they are visiting resorts.																								To introduce international standards and practices in the emerging timeshare and vacation projects, the apex body of promoters  All India Resort Development Association (AIRDA)  has directed the members not to indulge in aggressive marketing and offer a 10-day period for getting refunds.																								AIRDA chairman and principal adviser B. S. Rathor told The Telegraph that the association has initiated a number of self-regulatory measures, including a refund facility and abolition of utility charges.																								There have been complaints from customers about arbitrary utility charges slapped by certain resorts without prior information, Rathor said.																								Customers can now lodge their complaints on AIRDAs helpline website  www.airda. info.ORG  and the association would ensure that the complaints are attended to within two days, Rathor added.																								The association has asked the government to classify the resorts to promote domestic leisure tourism as is done for star category hotels to attract inbound international visitors.																								The Union tourism ministry has been deliberating on the issue for quite some time. It feels that a classification is required to standardise facilities and services to attract domestic and foreign leisure tourists  prime customers of vacation properties, Rathor said. 																								The UPA government might come up with the classification criterion in two to three months, he added.																								The classification is done primarily for foreign visitors. However, the 375 million domestic tourists far outnumber 2.8 million inbound travellers, of which 90 per cent are business visitors. On the other hand, there are nearly 10 million outbound travellers, many of them tourists and could be attracted to domestic tourism in specialised resorts.																								The concept of timeshare tourism started in early nineties and soon such resorts mushroomed all over the country.

 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Swinging sensex ends in the red
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 25: Volatility was the order of the day as share values seesawed on certain political pressures and rising crude oil prices. 																								The sensex oscillated in a huge range of 167.92 points during the day and analysts expect equity values to repeat this behaviour over the next day or two, although the volatility may not be as pronounced as it was today.																								Brokers said the markets lack a clear direction and this will only come after the common minimum programme (CMP) is announced.																								The index opened on a weak note and continued to fall on concerns over the impact of the rising crude oil prices. Some analysts even felt that Mondays salute to the appointment of P. Chidambaram as finance minister was an over-reaction on the part of the markets.																								Oil worries apart, political concerns soon took centre stage with the DMK refusing to join the new government. This saw the sensex slipping to the days low of 4976.01, a 147.22 points drop over the previous close of 5123.23. The index had opened marginally weak at 5117.52.																								However, the situation dramatically improved when news filtered in that the Prime Minister had decided to allocate cabinet berths to the DMK as promised.																								The news brought back life into the markets and the sensex climbed to an intraday high of 5143.93. However, with market players unwinding positions at these levels, the sensex closed at 5102.22 against Mondays close of 5123.23, a fall of 21.01 points or 0.41 per cent.																								Auto stocks were the worst hit with Maruti and Tata Motors recording sharp falls. While Maruti dropped by Rs 19.15 or 4 per cent to Rs 454.95, Tata Motors ended at Rs 428.95, a Rs 15.55 fall. 																								Surprisingly, the BSE PSU index, which has been battered consistently, gained over 21 points. Other indices such as the Bankex ended in negative territory. While tech counters, including Infosys and Wipro, gained with the rupees fall, oil stocks suffered losses as concerns mounted over the impact of the rising global crude oil prices.

 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 India Inc finds market hungry for more IPOs
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND SRINJOY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, April 7: The mega public issues have scooped up Rs 18,000 crore from the capital market in the past few weeks, but corporate India has reckoned that the appetite for IPOs hasnt been sated as yet. India Inc is lining up over 50 big issues this fiscal with the hope of raising close to Rs 50,000 crore.																								Investors in India havent been spoilt for choice on such a scale since the early 1990s. In the financial year just ended, a mere 23 firms had ventured into the public-issue market and managed to garner less than Rs 20,000 crore through this route. In 2002-03, just six firms had managed to raise a little over Rs 1,000 crore through public offers.																								Things have changed. IPOs are no longer no-gos, said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Capital, one of the largest fund marketers and brokerages in the city. 																								But that doesnt mean that it will be easy to raise money. People are now far more bothered about the fine print in issue prospectus ... about the intrinsic value of the issue. It is no longer possible to whip up the mad frenzy for stocks that was seen in the 1990s when firms with no capital and no pedigree walked away with tonnes of money from the capital market, said K. K. Sengupta, a leading merchant banker.																								We are seeing a new breed of investors entering the market who are better educated and better informed, added Bajaj.																								However, analysts agree that though the retail investors are trickling back into the market, it is still the foreign institutional investors who have actually set the cash registers ringing. 																								The line-up of new issues looks impressive: TCS (Rs 4,000 crore), NDTV (Rs 100 crore), SET India (Rs 200 crore), Shoppers Stop (Rs 100 crore), Central Bank of India (Rs 300 crore), NTPC (Rs 400 crore) and Hutchinson Max Telecom (Rs 400 crore).																								On the regulatory side, the market is safer, more efficient than it ever was and the book-building process has replaced the fixed-price regime. Moreover, the majority of the funds are being raised by state-run firms and blue-chip firms instead of lowly-rated firms or fly-by-night operators, said Icra managing director P. K. Chowdhury.																								However, what is still worrying for security marketers is the fact that interest in IPOs are still driven by the stock boom and not solely by the companys fundamentals. 																								What remains unchanged is that with growing buoyancy, retail investors are still chasing price and not value, which means the fundamentals of the company go unnoticed, said Prithvi Haldea, who tracks the primary market.																								The corollary is obvious: if the sensex tanks, the IPO market will also come crashing down. That is why both retail investors and the FIIs are being choosy about their investments.																								If you notice the FIIs and retail investors have been investing in firms whose pricing has been low. High-priced PSU issues were soaked up by state-run financial institutions, said Sengupta. 																								Fundamentals and pricing remain the key to most investment decisions still and these remain strong areas for most of the paper being offered. 																								Most IPOs being sold here have a price-earnings ratio of less than 10. This is considered conservative by global standards where P-E ratios of up to 17 are par for the course.																								Even the ONGC IPO, which grossed about Rs 10,000 crore, had a P-E ratio of less than 10, a fact that has turned the sale into a political hot potato, said Sengupta. 																								Fund advisors are able to pique the FII interest in the IPO market because of the fact that the total new paper being issued accounts for just about 2 per cent of India Inc.s market capitalisation. 																								Foreign funds do not find such an exposure as too risky, especially when they soak up to 7-8 per cent of the total capitalisation in many markets by scooping up new issues.

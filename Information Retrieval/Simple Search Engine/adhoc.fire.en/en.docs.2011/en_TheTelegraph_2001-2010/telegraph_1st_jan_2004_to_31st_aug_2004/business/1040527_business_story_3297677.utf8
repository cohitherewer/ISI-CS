 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 RBI allows AllBank to pay 20% dividend
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 26: Allahabad Bank today declared a 20 per cent dividend for 2003-04, after obtaining an approval from the Reserve Bank of India.																								The bank had earlier sought permission from the regulator for declaring dividends. According to the new guidelines, the bank has been able to lower its net non-performing assets (NPA) below 3 per cent at 2.37 per cent.																								However, the bank has failed to achieve the other stipulation of maintaining an 11 per cent capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for the past three consecutive years.																								The banks CAR fell below 11 per cent only in 2001-02. 																								Consequent to the declaration, shareholders will receive 100 per cent more by way of dividends in 2003-04 as the bank had issued only 10 per cent dividend last year. Earnings per share of the bank has shot up to Rs 13.37 from Rs 5.89 in the previous year. Similarly, the book value of the banks share has increased to Rs 44.76 during the year from Rs 33.76 per share a year ago.																								The bank had come out with its maiden public issue at par one-and-a-half years back. The Rs 100-crore IPO was a runaway success. With this payout, the bank feels that it has met the expectations of its shareholders.																								The bank is also planning to come out with another Rs 100-crore public issue for increasing its tier-I capital from 6 per cent to 8 per cent.

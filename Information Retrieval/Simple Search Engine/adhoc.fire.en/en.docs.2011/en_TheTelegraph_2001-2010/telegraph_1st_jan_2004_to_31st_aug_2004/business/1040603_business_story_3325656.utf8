 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 IFCI merger takes new turn
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 2: The governing body of IFCI Ltd today took stock of the due-diligence process being carried out by investment banker SBI Caps.																								The diligence programme is being done on behalf of state-run Punjab National Bank as the earlier government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party had proposed to merge IFCI with the bank as a final bailout measure.																								However, the merger has run into rough weather helped by a change in the government and protest from the term-lenders employees union.																								The diligence process is on as it will help us in seeking partners or financial investors, said the official. He added that the board rejected all other proposals submitted by various departments which included the offer of a one-time pension option plan and the move to bring the benefits of IFCI employees on a par with Industrial Development Bank of India.																								The board has rejected both these proposals, he said. The term-lenders day-to-day management is at present run by two executive directors after the retirement of chairman and managing director V. P. Singh.

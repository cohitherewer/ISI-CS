 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Task force to hardsell health sector
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 10: A high-level task force has been constituted by the ministry of health and family welfare to bring in the moolah to the health sector in India.																								A task force has been constituted by the health ministry to make India a competitive destination for the healthcare sector, Union minister for health and family welfare Sushma Swaraj said here today at a session on the healthcare sector at the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas here today. Swaraj said suggestions would be invited from relevant experts in the field and an action plan would be drawn only after inputs have been gathered from the experts and the members of the task force.																								We have an action-oriented target. Next year, we dont want a session on how India can become a competitive destination in the healthcare sector. We want to celebrate having done so, she said.																								Talking about the governmental initiatives in the health sector, Swaraj said, Even though the private sector has come up in a big way in the healthcare sector, nothing big has really come up from the public sector in terms of setting up of hospitals and healthcare services, since the establishment of the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). 																								Keeping this in view as a major public sector initiative, the government has taken the decision to open six All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the backward states, which are underserved in the healthcare sector. 																								These six states are Orissa, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Uttaranchal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. It is part of the Pradhanmantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna which was launched in July last year at Bhubaneswar in Orissa. 																								As part of the programme, upgradation of existing facilities in one medical institution will be done in Calcutta, Lucknow, Trichy, Jammu, Hyderabad and Ranchi. 																								Addressing a gathering of expatriate doctors and healthcare professionals, Swaraj said that the key to make India a competitive destination for healthcare is to go in for ilaaj jo sasta ho aur achcha ho (treatment that is affordable and of good quality). 																								Sharad Lakhanpal, president of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) said more than 5 per cent of all doctors in the US are Indians and that AAPI supports 14 free clinics in India with a budget of $200,000.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 26: In India, the deal between Sanofi and Aventis is expected to leverage on the strengths of a strong research back-up, apart from a product portfolio covering thrombosis and cardio-vascular drugs and vaccines.																								Both companies have signed a deal to create what will be the worlds third-largest pharmaceutical entity after Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. However, there is little indication at this stage about how the nature of the Indian operations will change as a result of the merger.																								Among the two, Aventis is a listed entity while Sanofi-Synthelabo (India) is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Sanofi. Aventis officials were not available for comment.																								The major therapeutic groups in which Sanofi specialises are thrombosis, where the company has Fraxiparine safety syringes, Tykid and Plavix. In the area of cardio-vascular drugs, Sanofi has Cordarone, which is effective against arrhythmia. In neurology, its brands include Valparin, a broad spectrum anti-epileptic, and Jumex for treating late-stage Parkinsonism.																								Sanofi also has in its fold medicines to treat benign breast disease, vaginal infections and Fortagesic a dual-acting analgesic. In India, Sanofi-Synthelabo started operations in April 1997 and it has a workforce of over 200, spread across functions like sales/marketing and human resources.																								The Indian subsidiary had earlier said its intention of launching 8-10 formulations from the strong product pipeline of its French parent. Officials also talked about considering new molecules for registration in India from its research base. It recently forged an agreement with Pfizer for co-promotion of its product, Daxid.																								On the other hand, the product portfolio of Aventis includes cardio-vascular drugs such as Clexane. It also has a presence in metabolics through its brands Amaryl, Daonil and Lantus. In vaccines, Rabipur is well known. Other key products include Combiflam, Novalgin, Baralgan and the ubiquitous Soframycin skin cream.

 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Farm sector needs to grow at 4%
																								Mumbai, Aug. 30 (PTI): Advocating a four per cent annual growth rate for the farm sector, the Reserve Bank today warned that the low agricultural growth rate of 2.5-3.5 per cent will hamper expansion of industrial and services sector, creating a hurdle to attain 7-8 per cent growth rate for the countrys economy.																								It is imperative that agricultural growth rate is enhanced to around four per cent per annum as the critical minimum to sustain an overall growth trajectory of the economy at 7 per cent and more, RBI said.																								If farm growth was to continue at a long-term average of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, it would be difficult for industry and services to grow in the range of 9-10 per cent which would be necessary to attain the overall growth rate of 7-8 per cent.																								The spread of insurance against crop losses, development of commodity-derivatives market to minimise the impact of price uncertainties and facilities for meeting the entire  not merely credit  needs of the rural economy are necessary to attain higher growth in agriculture.																								Calling for diversification in crop pattern and broad-based agro development, the central bank said such practice would cater to the changing consumption pattern, reduce imports and take advantage of Indias competitive strength in various agricultural products. Co-op banks																								The RBI has placed seven district central co-operative banks (DCCBs) under directions by prohibiting them from granting loans, advances and accepting fresh deposits as on June 30, 2004.

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Calcutta, April 18: Iran has lifted its four-year ban on import of Indian tea in a decision effective from April 15.																								This happened following a visit to the country by the Tea Board chairman . K. Das and deputy secretary in the commerce ministry, Priya Kumar, last week. 																								The move will cheer the Indian tea industry, which has been trying hard to make substantial inroads in the West Asia and North Africa (Wana) countries for a long time in an attempt to shore up its faltering exports. India sold 173 million kg of tea in overseas markets in 2003, less than the target of over 200 million kg.																								Irans tea market is pegged at 110120 million kg annually. Of this, 50-55 million kg is produced locally, while the remaining portion is imported from countries like Sri Lanka and India, from where it mainly buys Assam orthodox and quality Assam CTC varieties. 																								Industry officials said in the 1980s, Iran used to import 15-18 million kg of tea from India but pruned it to 5-6 million kg in the 90s. Four years ago, it banned imports, though a small volume was known to be smuggled in.																								The end of the ban has not been a boon all the way. A steep duty of 80-82 cents per kg has been slapped on tea shipped from India. Industry officials sought to play down this, saying Iranian firms were paying $2 more per kg on tea reaching through the smuggled route. This has led them to believe that the duty is not too high. It suits our pockets, said an Indian tea exporter. 																								The industry expects to export 10 million kg of tea to Iran in the current year. This will mainly be done through private deals, the industry officials said. 																								Sources said the State Trading Organisation (STO) of Iran, which was earlier engaged in buying tea from India and Sri Lanka, is being privatised. The organisation, whose officials have traditionally come to India to sign deals, will now limit itself to distribution. 																								Indian producers also have to contend with competition from Sri Lanka, which saw the freeze on its tea exports being withdrawn along with that of India. 																								India can step up the production of orthodox tea, which is known to be highly popular in the Iranian market. 																								The Indian Tea Association (ITA) will send a delegation to Iran soon so that producers at home can clinch export deals with private companies in that country. 																								The delegation led by Tea Boards Das visited Cairo and Dubai, in addition to Tehran. Sources said contracts have already been clinched in Egypt. Good response is expected from Dubai too, sources said. 																								The visit of an Indian tea delegation to Pakistan has been rescheduled. The team will now go there next month.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT On shaky ground 																								New Delhi, July 1: Maruti 800, the city runabout, saw sales tumble 18 per cent in June but still managed to wrest its pre-eminent position as the countrys biggest selling model from stable-mate Alto.																								In May, the Maruti 800 was toppled from its perch by the Alto  the first time it had ever conceded its numero uno status in the past 20 years.																								Vehicle sales for the month of May were, therefore, an aberration when the Alto model clocked higher sales of 10,373 units against the Maruti 800s sales of 10,016 units.																								Sales of Alto in June stood at about 8,100 units against the M-800s 10,761 units.																								Maruti Udyog, 54.2 per cent owned by Japans Suzuki Motor Corp, said cumulative sales for the month rose 9.8 per cent to 39,574 units from 36,038 in the year-ago period but were down 10.5 per cent from the previous month.																								The countrys biggest automaker also said sales of its three compact cars  the Wagon R, Zen and the Alto  leapt 82 per cent to 18,768 units, while the combined sales of its Omni and Versa vans rose 7 per cent to 4,888 units.																								Sales of its Baleno and Esteem sedans grew 17 per cent to 1,252, while Gypsy and Vitara multi-utility vehicles nearly trebled to 746 units.																								The New Delhi-based automaker, which has a 47 per cent market share in the 9-lakh Indian car market, reported a 30.3 per cent increase in vehicle sales in the year to March 2004. It mainly competes against Hyundais Santro and Tata Motors Indica models.																								The rise in sales had been fuelled by an 8 per cent production tax cut by the government (which enabled it to cut the sticker price by about 5 per cent), low interest rates and attractive finance and discount schemes from banks and automakers.																								The automakers shares are currently trading at Rs 398 and have more than trebled since its listing in July last year through an initial public offer, when the government divested nearly 25 per cent of its equity.

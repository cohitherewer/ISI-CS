 VIVEK NAIR				 	 Smooth sailing																								Mumbai, July 8: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram brought cheer to the domestic shipping industry with his announcement of the much-awaited tonnage tax  a move that is set to positively impact the bottomlines of these companies.																								Presenting the Union budget for 2004-05, Chidambaram said shipping companies would now have the option of paying the tonnage tax or normal corporate tax on profits.																								The shipping industry has demanded the levy of a tonnage tax to make it competitive. Tonnage tax will also induce more ships to fly the Indian flag. I propose to accept the request, he said.																								The move, which is expected to further inflate the bottomlines of domestic shipping companies saw the industry welcoming the change. 																								Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd managing director Vijay K. Sheth pointed out that the introduction of a tonnage tax is a development which the industry has been waiting for. It would provide a level-playing field and that would be advantageous for the consumers, he added.																								Sheth also said its introduction comes at a time when the shipping sector is on an upbeat mood with the market being optimistic both on the tanker and dry bulk sector and with most of the Indian shipping companies on an expansion drive.																								Essar Shipping Ltd managing director Sanjay Mehta said the tonnage tax will provide the shipping sector a level-playing field vis--vis international shipping companies and with such a right taxation environment for seafarers, Indian shipping companies can be globally competitive. 																								This is the first time that the government has made a cohesive move to synchronise the shipping industry and port infrastructure, which would provide a competitive edge to the maritime industry, he added.																								Tax will now be levied on tonnage or the asset capacity carried by the company during the period, instead of it being levied on profits. It is charged as a flat rate on the gross registered tonnage of shipping companies. 																								Apart from aiding the bottomlines, the introduction of tonnage tax is also expected to result in domestic shipping companies acquiring more ships.																								According to Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) director R. K. Mitra, the finance ministers proposal to introduce tonnage tax is not only poised to increase the tonnage of the domestic shipping industry, but could also lead to participation by foreign investors in the sector.																								Earlier, the high level of taxes was an issue that deterred foreign investors from investing in joint ventures. But the tonnage tax will attract foreign investors, he added.																								Even as Chidambaram left it to the shipping industry to either pay the tonnage tax or normal corporate tax on profits, details pertaining to the extent of the former is still awaited. It is likely that once a shipping company opts to pay one of these taxes, it cannot change over to the other tax for a stipulated time period, Mitra said.

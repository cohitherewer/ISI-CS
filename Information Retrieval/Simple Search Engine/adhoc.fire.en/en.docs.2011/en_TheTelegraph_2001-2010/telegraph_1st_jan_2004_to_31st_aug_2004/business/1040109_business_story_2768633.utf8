The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Sparks ignited for Friday flare-up
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 8: Dalal Street was on its toes for a Friday frenzy after a throbbing Thursday saw the sensex zoom to a record high and the government dish out a platter of tax dollops that was too late for the market to feast on.																								Markets started on a firm note, but with no inkling of the bonanza that was to come late in the afternoon. The sensex opened at 5992.10, rallied to an intra-day high at 6118.62 before ending at the all-time record high of 6108.54, a smart gain of 151.52 points, or 2.54 per cent. NSEs Nifty closed 51.80 points or 2.70 per cent at 1968.55.																								Through of all this, however, the markets were driven by Wednesday announcement allowing margin trading and stock lending on bourses. Few had anticipated that the long-planned pre-poll boosters would unspool the way it did a little after three this evening.																								The markets will be on fire Friday, said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. There is another potential propeller: Infosys third-quarter numbers, due to be released by Friday noon.																								Dealers and investors, buoyed by todays spectacular gains, were left ruing the fact that reports of the tax cuts came in so late. Had the announcement come early in the day, indices would have soared into stratosphere.																								Its an election-oriented move, said a fund manager affiliated to a leading mutual fund. The government is preparing for elections and it seems they are pulling out all stops to win over people, Kejriwal added.																								Hard questions appeared lost in the din and cacophony of the bull charge. How will the government offset the losses on account of duty cutbacks? Will the fiscal deficit widen? As these questions plagued some minds, there were others who reasoned that fresh consumer demand arising out of tax cuts would more than offset the decline in revenues.																								On the BSE, gainers outnumbered losers 3.5:1. Around 1694 shares advanced, while 485 declined. In the specified group, 177 shares, including 28 from the index, registered a sharp to moderate gains; 20 others closed with losses. The rally was spread across sectors. Among the major gainers were index stocks including SBI, ITC, Bharti Tele-Ventures, Larsen, ONGC, Bhel, Grasim, Satyam, Zee, Infosys and Reliance, which went up smartly. 																								The past few days have seen the tired markets getting its bounce back after a spate of positive news on the economy front. The Planning Commission and Reserve Bank of India, and Sebi allowing margin trading and securities lending were propellants for the market to rally. 																								PSU stocks were in the limelight and the ones that appreciated the most. It closed up 4.53 per cent at 4361.89 following strong gains in the banking and oil and gas stocks. The broad-based BSE-100 index jumped 104.88 points to 3297.19 from its previous close of 3192.31.

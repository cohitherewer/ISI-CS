The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 TCIL to call bids for sale of Hexacom stake soon
																								New Delhi, April 11 (PTI): Telecommunication Consultants India Limited (TCIL) will issue next week expressions of interest for selling its existing 30 per cent stake in Rajasthan cellular service provider Hexacom.																								The invitation will be followed by a pre-qualification round and financial bids, a senior TCIL official said. SBI Caps has been appointed as advisers to the sale.																								TCIL has also received a notice from Shyam Telecom to decide whether it would like to exercise the right of first refusal in the recently signed deal sale of its 67.5 per cent to Bharti for a consideration of Rs 430 crore.																								The public-sector company has 30 days to take a decision, for which it will convene a board meeting soon. 																								While the chances of TCIL exercising the right seems remote, the board will send its opinion to government.																								Earlier this month, Bharti signed a Rs 430-crore cash-cum-share deal with Shyam Telecom to buy its 67.5 per cent stake in Hexacom, provided TCIL refuses to buy the shares and other regulatory approvals come in. 																								The consideration of Rs 430 crore includes the premium for majority shareholding and greater representation on the board. 																								The deal is proposed to be funded through equity shares of Bharti Tele-Ventures for Rs 75 crore, optimally convertible redeemable debentures for Rs 300 crore and the remaining portion in cash.																								According to Bharti, the acquisition will give it a presence in Rajasthan and spread its network across the country. Bharti also intends to consolidate its stake in Hexacom when the opportunity to do so comes its way.																								The move comes after Bharti made a pitch to acquire TIWs 27 per cent stake in Hexacom but lost out to Shyam Telecom  which exercised its right of first refusal to acquire the Canadian majors equity shares.

 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Berger mulls merger 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 26: Berger Paints India Ltd will explore the feasibility of amalgamating Berger Auto and Industrial Coatings Ltd, a 100 per cent subsidiary, with itself in the next board meeting, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.																								The board will meet on August 31 to consider the amalgamation proposal. 																								Earlier, Berger Paints said it expected to turn around its loss-making subsidiary by the end of the current fiscal. 																								In 2003-04, Berger Auto recorded a sales of Rs 25.7 crore. The subsidiary suffered a loss of Rs 1.5 crore, partly due to high initial costs of customer development in the automobile segment. Several measures have been adopted to reduce cost and increase the production of decorative products to improve operating results. 																								Berger Auto was set up in May 2001 as a 50:50 joint venture between Berger Paints and ICI Limited, after taking over the motor and industrial business of ICIs factory at Rishra. In 2002, Berger Paints acquired the 50 per cent stake held by ICI in Berger Auto.

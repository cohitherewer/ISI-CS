 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Gupta: Flexible																								Calcutta, July 20: Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) is open to the idea of divesting its stake in Bharat Overseas Bank following the recent guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.																								According to S. C. Gupta, chairman and managing director of Indian Overseas Bank, At present the banks stake in Bharat Overseas Bank is an investment.

Once the RBI implements the guidelines, IOB will follow the normal valuation procedure and would appoint an advisor of the stature of SBI Capital Markets to carry on the modus operandi and determine the pricing, Gupta said.																								The banks first quarter results are due shortly. Gupta said IOBs results in the April to June quarter will be better compared with the results of the corresponding period last year. It has targeted a growth rate of 17 to 18 per cent for the current fiscal, with an increase of Rs 3,500 crore as advances.

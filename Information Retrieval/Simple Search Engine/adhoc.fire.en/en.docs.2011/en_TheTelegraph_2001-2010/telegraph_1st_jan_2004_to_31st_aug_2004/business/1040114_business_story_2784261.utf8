 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Bengal SOS call to NTPC 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Jan. 13: The West Bengal State Electricity Board wants to rope in the National Thermal Power Corporation as a partner in the Rammam Hydro Power project (stageI). A proposal has already been sent to the corporation. WBSEB is unhappy with the pace at which Sri Vasabi Industries, the developer to the project, is working. 																								The board has also asked NTPC to participate in the proposed 600-MW greenfield Turga hydel power project at Purulia. The total cost of the project is pegged at Rs 1,500 crore. 																								WBSEB has also approached the corporation for participation in the 90-MW (3x30MW) Rammam Hydro Power Project (stageIII). 																								The 36-MW Rammam Hydel Power project (Stage-I) was awarded to Sri Vasabi Industries, a private entrepreneur, in June 1999. The cost of the project is Rs 279.40 crore. 																								However, board officials are unhappy with the pace of work. The developer is under constant persuasion for progress of work. But nothing has happened as yet, said a senior WBSEB official.																								Dipak Ganguly, member (operations) of WBSEB, said, NTPC has already entered hydel power generation. So we have approached it for these projects. They have asked for some data. However, nothing has been finalised.																								NTPC is setting up its first ever hydro-electric project in Himachal Pradesh. The 800-MW Kol Dam Hydro Electric Project in the Bilaspur district will be set up at an estimated investment of Rs 5,300 crore. The project involves construction of a 163-metre high rock-fill dam across the river Sutlej. 																								Ganguly added that the board has carried out a pre-feasibility report of the Turga hydel power project. This will be followed by a detailed project report (DPR).																								WBSEBs eagerness to rope in NTPC is based on recent announcements by the Centre for developing hydro-electric power projects. The Union power ministry has been authorised to sanction expenditure of Rs 10 crore on survey, investigation and preparation of feasibility report for new hydro-electric projects in the central sector.																								An expenditure of up to Rs 50 crore can be incurred for preparation of a detailed project report, pre-construction activities and land acquisition. However, these are subject to approval by a committee of the Public Investment Board (PIB) on cite clearance from the ministry of environment and forest and after the commercial viability of the project has been established. Proposals involving expenditure above Rs 50 crore would require PIBs approval.																								Bengal has a potential of generating 2841 MW of hydel power. The state is already generating 300 MW of hydel power and more projects that would together generate 936 MW of power are under construction.

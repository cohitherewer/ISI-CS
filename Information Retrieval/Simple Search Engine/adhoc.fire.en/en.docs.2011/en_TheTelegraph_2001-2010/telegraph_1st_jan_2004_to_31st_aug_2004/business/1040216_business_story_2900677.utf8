 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Banks shrug off threat from ECBs
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, Feb. 15: Local banks are unruffled at the prospect of companies rushing for cheap overseas funds following a recent relaxation by the Centre and an upgrade by international rating agencies.																								These banks are pinning their hopes on industrial pick-up to meet their loan disbursal targets. While leading nationalised banks have predicted a credit growth of 13-14 per cent in 2003-04, they are expecting a 15-16 per cent growth next fiscal.																								It is not a major worry for us, Canara Bank chairman and managing director R. V. Shastri said. He feels that an upturn in industrial activity will fuel credit growth and only a few companies will be looking overseas for cheap funds. 																								Shastri is envisaging a credit growth of 13-14 per cent for the bank in this fiscal and over 15 per cent next year. Other bankers also expect a clear upward trend in credit demand emerging over the next few months.																								Indian companies have been accessing external commercial borrowings (ECBs) in the past. We dont expect it to be a major threat as far as our credit growth is concerned, he added.																								Last month, Moodys Investors Services raised the countrys long-term foreign currency rating to investment grade Baa3 due to reduction in external vulnerability, rising foreign investment and vibrant economic growth.																								Earlier, the union finance ministry permitted foreign loans up to $500 million with an average maturity of five years through the automatic route.																								With overseas funds coming at attractive rates due to the rating upgrade, it is expected that there will be a flurry of ECBs from domestic companies. 																								More than $2 billion is predicted to be raised in the coming months. Some companies in the pipeline include Bharti Cellular, Jindal Power and Steel, Power Finance Corporation and National Hydro Electric Corporation. 																								Recently, State Bank of India chairman A. K. Purwar had indicated that the increased diversified options for companies has affected the banking sector.

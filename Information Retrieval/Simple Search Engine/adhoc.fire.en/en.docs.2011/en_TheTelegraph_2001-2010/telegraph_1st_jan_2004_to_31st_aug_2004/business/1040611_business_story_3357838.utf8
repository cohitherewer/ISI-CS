 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 10-digit numbers from Tata Indicom
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 10: Tata Indicom today announced that it is shifting to 10-digit numbering, in line with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trais) mandate for universal access licence for mobile operators.																								The number change will be implemented in the Maharashtra circle from midnight of June 10 and will be applicable to all Tata Indicom mobile customers across the country in the next few days.																								Some of the circles such as Andhra Pradesh have already seamlessly shifted to 10 digits from the earlier eight. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) had earlier said it is difficult to differentiate between landline numbers and wireless-in-local-loop (WiLL) mobile numbers because both have eight digits, whereas GSM phones have ten digits. The new number plan for WiLL phones is required as tariff charges for mobile phones are more than landline numbers.																								Tata Indicom has been assigned the 92 series by the department of telecom (DoT), the statement said. 																								Since Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra fall under different telecom circles, calls among Tata Indicom customers across these circles will be considered as STD calls.																								The numbering plan will be implemented across the remaining circles over the next 10 days. The company will provide customer service to ensure smooth migration.																								Tata Teleservices is informing its customers about the number change through personalised SMS, advertisements, sales channels, call centres and interactive voice response.																								Maharashtra circle chief operating officer Y. V. L. Pandit said, Tata Teleservices is the first universal licence service provider to announce the 10-digit numbering plan in line with Trai regulation. Tata Indicom customers can now be reached from any phone in Maharashtra, without the caller needing an STD facility. Customer accessibility is enhanced as we offer roaming facility and calls from our mobile phones across the circle attract only local call rates.																								The Tata Indicom numbering series across India will change from the existing format of the STD code followed by the telephone number to a new 10-digit number starting with 92.

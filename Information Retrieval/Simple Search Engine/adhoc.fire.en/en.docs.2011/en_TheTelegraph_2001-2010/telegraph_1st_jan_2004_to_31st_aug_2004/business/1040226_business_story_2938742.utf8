 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Liquidity worries pull down sensex
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 25: Mounting liquidity worries due to a slew of mega issues and selling by domestic and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) saw the sensex plummet 116 points.																								The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) PSU index nose-dived by around 3.7 per cent, reflecting the losses suffered by those shares. Key shares like Reliance Industries, State Bank of India, Tisco, Tata Motors, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Grasim, ACC and Hindustan Lever showed sharp losses due to selling pressures. 																								The IT, FMCG and bank shares also closed in the negative territory																								The 30-share BSE index recorded an intra-day low of 5606.86 after opening at 5746.79 and hit an intra-day high of 5746.79, thus oscillating in a 140-point range. The index later ended lower at 5618.15, a net fall of 116.29 points or 2.03 per cent from the last close.																								The current bout of selling is mainly to invest in the ongoing stake sale offers by the government, according to market analysts. 																								Though some of these offers have not elicited an enthusiastic response from investors, analysts feel that the forthcoming offer from ONGC, touted as the largest issue ever to hit the domestic capital market, will add to the liquidity shortage.																								Another cause of concern among analysts is the spurt in FII selling. Maybe FIIs are also interested in investing in these issues and so they are selling now, a broker said. 																								According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) figures, while the foreign investors made net sales of Rs 168 crore on Monday, it increased to Rs 270 crore the next day.																								However, the companies in which the government is divesting its stake saw rampant selling today. Among them, shares of IPCL finished lower at Rs 185.85. Similarly, Dredging Corporation shares plummeted to Rs 460.85 and that of Gail lost by over 5 per cent to close at Rs 196. Shares of ONGC lost 6 per cent to close at Rs 670.25.																								The volume of business was relatively low at Rs 2,479.51 crore, down from Rs 2,890.72 crore yesterday.

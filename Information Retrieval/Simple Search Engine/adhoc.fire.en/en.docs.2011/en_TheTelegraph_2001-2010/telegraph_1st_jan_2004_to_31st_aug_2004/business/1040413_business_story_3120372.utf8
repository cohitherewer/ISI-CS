 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 CII charts10-point action plan for 10% growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mahindra: Thinking big																								New Delhi, April 12: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) today floated a 10-point action plan to help the country attain a 10 per cent growth rate.																								According to CII president Anand Mahindra, the agenda will provide the necessary impetus to sustain the current growth rate and establish India as a super-power.																								The government must deepen and accelerate reforms to facilitate rapid infrastructural expansion and also execute major infrastructure projects speedily, efficiently and in a transparent manner, CII said.																								The agenda pertains to reforms in infrastructure, agriculture, entrepreneurship/self-employment, value-added tax, foreign relations, manufacturing, governance, fiscal management and exports.																								The key element of the infrastructure policy should be to ensure energy security, he said. This could be done in close co-operation with the US, Japan and China, he added.																								Science and technology should be harnessed to start the second agricultural revolution, he said. The time is ripe for multi-cropping, processing and adding high-tech value in the food chain, he added.																								The apex chamber has recommended focus on primary education with quality upgradation and faculty improvement.																								The CII also feels that the government should devise schemes for self-employment through vocational training. Generation of employment is extremely important in view of the countrys demographic profile, CII said.																								According to the agenda, priority must also be accorded to providing healthcare at affordable prices to combat diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria. More attention should be on water, including conservation and interlinking of rivers and easy access to drinking water for the common man.																								The industry body has strongly advocated the implementation of value-added tax across the country. Implementation of value-added tax across the country will make India a lucrative common market, benefiting farmers, consumer industries and other segments of society, CII said.																								The new government should aim at consolidating the measures already taken to build new relationships across the globe for mutual benefits, specially focusing on the developing world. 																								Manufacturing was a key to continued growth, the chamber said. It suggested that several measures were needed to bolster the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. The aim should be to build hundreds of Indian MNCs and increase the competitiveness of corporate India, according to CII.																								On the fiscal front, there should be constant efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit, the apex chamber said.

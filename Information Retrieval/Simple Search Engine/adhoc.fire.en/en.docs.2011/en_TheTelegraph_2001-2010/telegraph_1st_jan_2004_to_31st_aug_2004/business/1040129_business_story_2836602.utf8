 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Jan. 28: The Tatas are open to the idea of diluting their stake in Tata AIG General Insurance Company once the government increases the foreign direct investment limit from 26 per cent to 49 per cent in the insurance sector.																								Managing director Dalip Verma said, The Tatas are open to the idea of offering extra stake to AIG within a certain limit once the government liberalises FDI in the insurance sector. However, the Tatas will remain in this sector.																								The paid-up capital of Tata AIG General Insurance is Rs 125 crore in which the Tata group holds 74 per cent and the rest 26 per cent is held by AIG of the US.																								The company has earned a gross premium income of Rs 270 crore in April-November 2003. We hope to achieve a gross premium income of Rs 350-360 crore in 2003-04, Verma said.

The company also hopes to achieve a similar growth.																								Overseas travel has increased substantially over the years and this has helped the travel insurance business, he said. 																								The general insurance sector is also witnessing a natural growth in all its lines of business, he added.																								Tata AIG General Insurance plans to come out with a whole gamut of employment related insurance products soon. It has also filed an application with the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority for a medical insurance product.

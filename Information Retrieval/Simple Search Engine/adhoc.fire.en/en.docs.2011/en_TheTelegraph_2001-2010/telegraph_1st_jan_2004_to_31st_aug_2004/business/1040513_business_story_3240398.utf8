 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 12: Symphony Services Corporation plans to build a 400,000-square feet campus in Bangalore and double its staff strength by the year-end.																								The company is a pioneer in technology-based business transformation outsourcing in India. 																								A study conducted by the company on captive cost and productivity revealed that pure captive, off-shore centres do not reach cost and productivity parity with off-shore services firms until they reach a manpower strength of at least 1000.																								The study also revealed that captive centres generally operate at low productivity levels for the first several years due to start-up inefficiencies and learning curves. 																								Symphony Services client base includes companies like Siebel, Manugistics, Autodesk, Schering-Plough, Viacom, La Quinta and IRI, among others.

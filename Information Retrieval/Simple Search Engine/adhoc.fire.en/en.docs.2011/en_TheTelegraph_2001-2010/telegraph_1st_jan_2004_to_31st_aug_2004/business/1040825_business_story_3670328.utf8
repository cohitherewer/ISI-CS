 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Sumitomo takes on Mitsubishi in bank buy
																								Tokyo, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc laid out a $29-billion bid for UFJ Holdings on Tuesday, challenging a rival offer by Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG) to form the worlds biggest bank.																								The Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (SMFG) offer, which valued UFJ at a 23 per cent premium to its closing stock price, puts pressure on MTFG to come up with attractive terms for its own merger plan.																								MTFG  UFJs preferred merger partner  has not yet said how much it would be willing to pay for UFJ, the smallest and weakest of Japans top four banks.																								It seems like a pretty aggressive bid, Barclays Capital analyst Jason Rogers said of the SMFG offer. This is more or less a takeover bid as opposed to a merger.																								UFJ said it would consider the SMFG bid with the help of outside consultants, but added that it had no intention of changing its plans to merge with MTFG.																								UFJ, more than 30 per cent owned by foreign shareholders, could come under pressure from investors to accept SMFGs offer if MTFG does not trump the SMFG offer.																								The rare Japanese takeover battle comes as the banks are trying to clear up years of accumulated bad debts and are seeking new ways to boost profit and reduce dependence corporate lending. The loser would rank a distant third among Japans banks behind the new entity and Mizuho Financial Group.																								MTFG agreed earlier this month to take over UFJ, which has made a loss for the past three years, in a deal that would create the worlds biggest bank by assets.																								SMFG said on Tuesday it would offer one of its shares for every common share of UFJ, valuing UFJ at around 3.2 trillion yen ($29.13 billion) at current share prices, based on 5.09 million UFJ common shares outstanding.																								It said the offer would be good for one month.																								Analysts have said they expect MTFG to offer 0.3 to 0.5 of its shares for every UFJ share, valuing UFJ at between $14 billion and $24 billion.

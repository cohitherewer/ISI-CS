The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 LIC looks at life without props
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, June 23: The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) top brass is debating whether it is time to have government guarantees on the sum assured and bonuses lifted. The move may be a precursor to a major restructuring exercise that the insurance monolith, with 16 crore policies under its belt, is contemplating.																								The end of government guarantees, as provided under the LIC Act, 1956, is in tune with a Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India proposal. Sources said the suggestion to carry on business without government support has been discussed at the corporations highest rungs.																								The issue was set aside as elections were round the corner. But with the new government in place, we thought of taking it up again. The consultant has suggested that our company is strong enough and does not need government guarantees, a senior LIC official said.																								Once the LIC top brass arrives at a consensus on the issue, they will approach the government. It will need an amendment to the LIC Act, 1956, the official added. LIC pays the government a substantial amount as dividend.																								Banks went through a similar restructuring few years back, deciding to treat loans with government guarantee as non-performing assets if they were not serviced on time.																								LIC, poised to achieve the Rs 10,000-crore solvency margin laid down by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA), is of the view that time is now ripe for a re-look at government guarantees.																								Though the solvency margin may be a strong cushion to assure policyholders of the insurance majors capability to meet liabilities, removal of government guarantees might call for an increase in its existing paid-up capital  which is only Rs 5 crore now.																								Meanwhile, the corporation has initiated steps to implement another Deloitte Touche suggestion  of setting up four strategic business units (SBUs). These will oversee international operations, pension and group schemes, real estate and alternative channel businesses. The special units will enjoy functional autonomy, but will not be spun off into separate entities.

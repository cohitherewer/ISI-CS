 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Sebi remains a silent spectator
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Bajpai: Far from the madding crowd																								Mumbai, May 17: While Dalal Street bled profusely, the capital market watchdog  Securities and Exchange Board of India  which has been on high alert and held a crucial meeting with stock exchanges could do little to stop the carnage. 																								At the Sebi headquarters, its top brass, including chairman G. . Bajpai and whole-time member T. M. Nagarajan, were abroad. While officials were initially reluctant to speak, A. K. Batra, another whole-time member, later sought to allay fears and said the market was likely to stablise during the next few trading sessions.																								Batra who held a high-level meeting attended by stock market officials and U. K. Sinha, joint secretary, ministry of finance, warned manipulators of stringent action and said there was no need to be alarmed.																								Batra, while pointing out that there will be no payment crisis for the stock market settlement cycles, reiterated that the regulator was concerned about the integrity of the market and the safety and interest of investors.																								In case we find instances of market abuse, the regulator will take strong action, he added.																								Ruling out a full-fledged inquiry into the volatilitly, Batra said that an analysis of data available as of now does not warrant such a step. He added that the risk management systems of the stock exchanges are robust.																								Pointing out that while the payment for settlements of last week was smooth, Batra confidently said the regulator did not envisage any problem for Mondays settlement as well.																								The fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and nothing has taken place to alter the view about its strengths, he added.																								Ravi Narain, managing director of the National Stock Exchange, said there are no issues over payments and the exchange has actually collected Rs 360-370 crore in the form of trade margins even on a volatile trading day. 																								Only yesterday, the market regulator had gone on record saying that it held a special survelliance meeting last Friday and it had directed the stock exchanges to remain extraordinarily watchful of any unusual market movements and report immediately. After the 330-point loss last Friday, Sebi called for data from exchanges on Friday for analysis and examination.																								On the intra-day liquidity facility made available by RBI for meeting payment obligations, banking sources said none of the banks took advantage of the same today.																								The banks were having enough liquidity and there was no need to take advantage of the facility made available by the central bank, they said.

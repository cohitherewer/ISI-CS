 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 India Inc sure of reform drive, wary of Left turn
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, May 13: India Inc believes that a change at Raisina Hill will not slow down reforms. But many are wary about the role that will be played by the Left who look to either join or support the Congress government from outside. Amit MitraIf a Congress-led government comes to the power, I think it will be stable and not volatile, said Swati Piramal, director of Nicholas Piramal India. Personally, I thought the BJP would make a better government and I am disappointed for Vajpayee.																								Many felt that the change in the government would not impact policy. Amit Mitra, Ficci secretary-general, said, Both the Congress and the BJP-led NDA are in favour of reforms. There is no looking back ....The Left has done massive privatisation in Bengal. There is no anti-reform outlook at all.N. SrinivasanN. Srinivasan, director-general (designate), CII said, We are confident that economic reforms will be the priority of the next government as election manifestos of both the BJP and the Congress were indistinguishable in terms of their economic policies.																								Agreed Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD, Biocon India: There is no question of any rollback of reforms. Whichever government comes to power, it will have to carry forward the process. The Left is progressive on certain kinds of reform. However, the government will have to focus on infrastructure development (both rural and urban). Kiran ShawThere was a deep sense of relief that it wasnt a hung Parliament  a prospect that had held out by the exit polls. Said Adi B. Godrej, chairman of the Godrej Group, I am very buoyed by the political progress. At least there are signs of a stable, definite government. The crisis of having a hung Parliament could have been very disastrous. However, one will have to wait and watch what role the Left Front will play. The chances that the reform process might slow down quot;.Adi GodrejStock market takeover tycoon Abhishekh Dalmia was equally apprehensive about the role of the Left parties in framing the economic reform programme for a Congress-led coalition government. 																								Assocham president Mahendra K Sanghi said, The fabric of democracy have been strengthened by demonstrating the power of vote by the people.																								Rahul Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bajaj Auto, said, The results are surprising. The experience of the corporate sector had been very good with the NDA, so we would have been more comfortable with them. However, there is a possibility that the new government might go slow in the areas like disinvestment and labour reforms.Rahul BajajHe added, If the NDA had come back to power, the limits on foreign direct investment might have been raised further. But with a new government coming in, this might not happen. Banking, insurance and the telecom sectors have been demanding a hike in the FDI limits.																								Arun Bharat Ram, vice-chairman and senior managing director of SRF Ltd, said, My feeling is that economic reforms will continue. But some of the issues that we were hoping to take up  like labour reforms and disinvestment  will be watered down, even if they are taken up. This is likely to happen as the Congress will have to take the support of the Left parties to form the government. The imprint of the Left parties on these issues is bound to show on the common minimum programme (CMP).Arun B. RamUday S. Kotak, vice-chairman and managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said, We are very delighted and relieved to have a stable government. For any kind of economic reforms in India, one will have to see it with a long-term perspective, be it the Congress or the BJP. One thing is for sure, there will no selloff of profitable PSUs.																								Bharat Forge chairman Baba N. Kalyani said, We expect the Congress to continue the reform process. We would like the new government to focus on infrastructure and foreign direct investment. Uday KotakRakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director, Bharti Enterprises, said, The ongoing reform is irreversible. The country will have to move ahead in that direction, whether they like it or not.																								The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) hoped the new government would look into the problems of exporters who had been hit hard by the appreciating rupee.

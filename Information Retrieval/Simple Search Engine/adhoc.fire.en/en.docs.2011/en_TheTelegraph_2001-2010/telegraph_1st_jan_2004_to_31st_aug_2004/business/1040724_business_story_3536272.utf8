 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Leela in Rs 900cr expansion 
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, July 23: The Leela group plans to spend close to Rs 900 crore over the next three to four years on its new projects spread across Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Udaipur.																								We have estimated an investment of approximately Rs 300 crore for our Delhi hotel, Rs 200-250 crore each for our Chennai and Hyderabad projects, and Rs 70 crore for the Udaipur proposition. We have already spent Rs 20 crore on renovating the Mumbai hotel, The Leela Palaces and Resorts chairman and managing director Vivek Nair said.																								It is learnt that the chain bought the Udaipur property, which originally belonged to Mahindra Holidays, and was being constructed by Hiranandani Constructions.																								The Leela group intends to establish its presence in Delhi by 2007 even as it weighs a number of options for its project in the capital.																								Nair said the first option would be to purchase a privately leased plot in south Delhi. But this is an option that presents some difficulties because the Delhi government will still remain the real owner of the land.																								The second option before the premium hotel chain is to bid for the three to four five-star hotel sites that the government will put on the block before the Asian games to be held in 2010 in India. If it so happens, we will definitely bid for it, said Nair.																								He also expressed a strong desire to bid for ITDCs Janpath hotel in Delhi if it is put on the block. Former tourism minister Jagmohan had proposed to build a paryatan bhavan in place of this hotel to serve as a one-stop shop for all tourism activities.																								However, this plan might be scrapped with the change in government. If the hotel is put for sale, we would like to go for it, Nair said.																								About six months ago, the Leela group had thought of entering into a management contract with a Gurgaon-based investor  believed to be Ambience Builders  but had since dropped the idea. The deal didnt go through. We are not looking at this option anymore, said Nair.																								The hotel group has been scouting for property in south Delhi and had struck a deal in 1996 with Hudco for a prime location. At that time, the luxury hotel chain had bought 3.5 acres of land put up for sale by Hudco for which it paid Rs 163 crore.																								However, problems arose after the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) refused to approve the sketches prepared by the chain for nearly two years.																								Sources within the hotel chain said, The explanation given to us after we purchased the land was that Hudco had filed their own revised layout plan. Since our plot was a part of the entire area, we were denied permission to build the hotel until Hudco got its clearance. The Leela group said the second breach of trust occurred when they were denied permission to mortgage their property in order to raise funds from banks and financial institutions.

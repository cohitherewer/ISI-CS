 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, July 14: The Birlas and R. S. Lodha have played a major role in shaping the affairs of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). But just when they are squaring off for an unprecedented battle in Indian corporate history, the industry forum has turned squeamish about playing a mediatory role in the messy battle.																								At Ficci, we discuss only policy issues. This isnt a policy issue. If two people have a dispute, a misunderstanding or a difference of opinion, the chamber will not feel constrained to intervene, Ficci president Y. K. Modi told The Telegraph.																								Ficci was established at the initiative of late G. D. Birla and Lala Shriram in 1927. The Birla clan has provided four presidents: late G. D. Birla in 1929, B. M. Birla (1954), K. K. Birla (1974) and S. K. Birla in 1990.																								Lodha, a chartered accountant by profession, is a past president as well and was the first professional to assume that position with the strong backing of the Birla factions.																								According to Ficci tradition, past presidents are accommodated as special invitees at all important events. At present, the federation only has two patron members: K. K. Birla and Charat Ram. The Birlas are one of the biggest contributors to the federation.

 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Banks line up equity buyback
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 25: Public sector banks plan to approach the United Progressive Alliance government with their equity buyback proposal.																								Reserve Bank of India sources said, Banks have discussed the equity buyback issue among themselves. They strongly feel that the government should approve the buyback as they have excess capitalisation.																								Earlier, the NDA government had decided against the buyback of equity in banks on the ground that it would impact the capital requirements under the new Basel Capital Accord.																								At present, most PSU banks have a tier-I capital adequacy of 11-12 per cent and some have even higher. Consequently, the banks are in a position to meet the capital requirements prescribed by the new Basel accord.																								An earlier move to restructure capital with PSU banks buying back their equity from the government had been scuttled with the finance ministry insisting on a hefty premium due to high market prices of their stocks. The banks demanded that buyback should be on a par.																								A senior official of a public sector bank said, We will tell finance minister P. Chidambaram that the equity return should be on a par since much of the recapitalisation done earlier was not through cash infusion but by placement of recapitalisation bonds with the banks with a 10 per cent coupon. When the capital is bought back, the government would also have to extinguish bonds.																								Bank officials said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chidambaram are familiar with the banking scenario. The prudential norms in the banking sector were first introduced in the country under Manmohan Singh, they added.																								State-owned banks like Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank and Bank of Baroda have been seeking buyback of equity to improve their book values and earnings per share which eventually reflects on their market value and also because they have excess Tier-I capital on their books.																								The officials also said the high cost of capital is evident from the large amount of interim dividends paid out by some of the public sector banks. Some of the top banks have paid the equivalent of about 25 per cent dividend.																								Besides, the officials said the dividend demands were partly responsible for the keeping lending rates high.

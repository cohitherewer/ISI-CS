 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: State-owned Oriental Insurance Company has notched up a 400 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 316.74 crore during the financial year 2003-04. In the year-ago period, gross profit stood at Rs 454.33 crore, while the net stood at Rs 63.99 crore.																								This is more than five times increase in our net profit for 2002-03 due to change in strategy, said Raj G. Vishwanathan, financial advisor of Oriental Insurance, while announcing the results.																								Officials claim that a focused strategy of profitable growth and huge gain in stock market operations have contributed to this phenomenal growth.																								S. L. Mohan, chairman-cum-managing director of Oriental Insurance, said the company was now concentrating more on bottomline than topline growth, that is, in areas where growth is profitable.																								Portfolios, which contributed the most to the insurance company, are motor insurance with a premium of Rs 1,207 crore (41.67 per cent), fire Rs 175.68 crore (18.47 per cent) and miscellaneous heads, including health and personal accident that contributed Rs 76.29 crore (23 per cent).																								The non-life insurer has also tied up with banks such as Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Dena Bank and State Bank of Saurashtra. The insurer had recently roped in department of posts (DoP) for the distribution of its products in semi-urban and rural areas in seven states.																								The greatest achievement in 2003-04 was the tie-up we have entered with the DoP and you will soon find 1.5 lakh post offices selling insurance policies of Oriental, said Mohan.																								Gross premium income grew marginally by 1.1 per cent to Rs 2,899.74 crore in 2003-04, while net premium was up by 7.09 per cent at Rs 2,033.03 crore.																								This was mainly due to loss of a few large reinsurance driven accounts. On net basis, we had a healthy 7.1 per cent growth, Vishwanathan said.Monnet Ispat shines																								Monnet Ispat has reported a 250 per cent jump in net profit to Rs 17.43 crore for the quarter ended June 30 from Rs 4.98 crore recorded in the corresponding previous quarter. 																								Sales increased 105 per cent to Rs 99.03 crore from Rs 48.31 crore in the year-ago period, a company release said.

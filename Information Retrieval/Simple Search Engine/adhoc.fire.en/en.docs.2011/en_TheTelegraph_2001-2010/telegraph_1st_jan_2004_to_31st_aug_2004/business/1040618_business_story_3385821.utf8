 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 FIIs see positive sign in petro-price hike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Pump-primed 																								Mumbai, June 17: Foreign institutional investors are cheering the government for its decision to go ahead with a balanced price hike in oil and LPG, a step they feel is in the right direction.																								The Opposition may flog it, but investors are all praise for the move, which comes at a time when the markets are in a bearish mode.																								The cut in excise duty and the rise in LPG prices came as a surprise and were seen as positive steps. For some, they indicated the direction the Union budget would take on July 8.																								However, investors are restraining their enthusiasm for the time being as memories of rollbacks by the NDA government are still fresh in their minds.																								A key risk could be opposition from the Left parties which want a modest Re 1 litre price rise in diesel and gasoline while keeping LPG and kerosene prices unchanged, said Merrill Lynch in a report to its clients. Any rollback will be negative for the stocks, the report warned.																								Morgan Stanley, another leading FII, said, The government has reaffirmed that we are not completely back to the administered pricing mechanism era.																								Contrary to common belief, the petroelum minister did not announce a series of bold measures, the report added.																								The governments measures do not spell a doomsday scenario for the Indian oil and gas sector as was feared by the market. Instead, we believe the measures would lead to an inflow of Rs 97 billion (Rs 9,700 crore) for the industry, given the current situation, Morgan Stanley said.																								Since June 14, FIIs have been net buyers in the Indian equity markets, albeit in a small way which is not comparable to their bulge-bracket buying some months ago.																								On June 14, FIIs invested around Rs 127 crore and the following day the net buying was pegged at Rs 109.20 crore. On June 16, it was a modest sum of Rs 6.40 crore amidst low volumes. 																								Analysts also point to some late buying that took place today, which saw the sensex reversing its trend by end of the trading session.

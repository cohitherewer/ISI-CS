 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Turf tussle over Reliance oil
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Chaturvedi: Hard bargain																								New Delhi, March 30: The national oil companies are determined to protect as much of their turf as they can over the ticklish issue of lifting more diesel and petrol from Reliance Industries at import parity prices.																								Sources say that a meeting held in Mumbai on Saturday under the aegis of petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi failed to resolve the issue. Senior oil company officials told The Telegraph that discussions were still on and no final settlement has been reached as yet on the issue.																								The petroleum ministry had softened its stand following increasing pressure from Reliance Industries, which wants to sell more to the public sector oil companies than they are willing to pick up from the Jamnagar refinery.																								While the oil companies had earlier stated that they were not willing to pick up more than 1.2 million tonnes of diesel from Reliance, this figure has now been increased to 3.7 million tonnes following the softer stand of the government. This is far short of the 6.2 million tonnes of diesel that the public sector oil companies have marketed for Reliance in 2003-04.																								The national oil companies had, in their industry logistics plan for 2004-05, drastically slashed the amount of petrogoods that they were willing to market for Reliance as the refining capacity of the public sector oil companies has gone up and their products had to be given priority.																								Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd has increased its output from 6 million tonnes to 9.69 million tonnes and similarly the capacities. Indian Oil Corporations Chennai refinery and Bharat Petroleums Mumbai refinery have also gone up.																								At the heart of the matter is that prices realised in the domestic market are about Rs 1,000 per tonne higher than what the Indian refineries get in the export market. This price difference arises as domestic prices are fixed on an import parity basis which includes a notional 10 per cent customs duty that would have been charged if these goods were imported.																								This results in higher profits for the refineries.																								However, the public sector oil marketing companies face a problem as more often than not they are not allowed to hike the prices of petroleum products, which are considered politically sensitive by the government.																								The public sector oil companies are therefore willing to pick up products from Reliance only at realistic prices. Although Reliance has reportedly offered a discount of around Rs 200 per tonne, this is not considered sufficient in view of the mark-up of Rs 1,000 per tonne in the domestic market.																								Earlier, the petroleum ministry had supported the national oil companies in their decision to slash the quantities to be lifted from Reliance. The stand at the time was that Reliance had been given two years to build their own retail marketing network and should have started its own filling stations by now. However, under persistent pressure from Reliance, the ministry wants the public sector companies to be more accommodating.

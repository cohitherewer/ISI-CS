 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Shrimp import curbs to be contested 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The government thinks it has a strong case to contest the US trade commissions preliminary approval for the imposition of anti-dumping duties on shrimp imports from India.																								Stating this here today, ministry of commerce special secretary S. . Menon said India has a strong case as mainly tiger shrimps were being exported from here which are not available in the US. 																								The exports were in an unprocessed frozen form and Indian shrimps generated at least one million jobs in the US food processing industry.																								We are all geared up to fight the case. The industry has already hired lawyers for this, Menon said.																								He explained that imports accounted for 80 per cent of shrimps consumed in the US. Any move to curtail imports will, therefore, adversely affect their processing industry, he added.

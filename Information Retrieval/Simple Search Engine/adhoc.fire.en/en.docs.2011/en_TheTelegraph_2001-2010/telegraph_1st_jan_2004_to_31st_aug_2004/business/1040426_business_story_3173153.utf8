 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 VSNL to use Bharti facility for trunk calls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mittal: Sky is the limit																								New Delhi, April 25: Bharti Infotel Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharti Tele-Ventures today signed a Rs 500-crore deal with Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited to share the national long distance network. 																								This is a first-of-its-kind agreement between two telecom players in the national long distance sector.																								Telecom players worldwide offer their infrastructure facilities to other operators for meeting the local objective of rural connectivity and increasing teledensity. In India, cellular mobile operators are already sharing their infrastructure since the past three years.																								According to the agreement, VSNL will have the right to use Bhartis national long distance backbone for 15 years. The Tatas-owned company will pay the operational and maintenance cost for the network.																								VSNL will have the right to primarily use 1,00,000 dark fibre kms of the national long distance network, which is less than 20 per cent of the capacity currently available with Bharti.																								Bharti Tele-Ventures joint managing director Rajan Bharti Mittal said, Bharti has always been a strong advocate of the sharing of infrastructure on mutually beneficial terms to optimise investments. This applies not only to its long distance network, but also to other facilities like cell sites for mobile operations.																								It would reduce the cost for the sharing parties, thereby helping us in deepening the market and exploring the massive potential of the telecom industry, said Mittal. 																								While senior company executives of Bharti and Tata were non-committal about a drop in STD rates for the consumers, they hinted at possible bulk schemes with lower tariffs. 																								Bharti Infotel Limited president Badri Agarwal said, This deal with VSNL is a major step towards the implementation of the best global practices. Given that the network capacities available with Bharti is extensive and more than sufficient for its usage and projected growth, this sharing agreement with VSNL will result in an optimised use of Bhartis existing network capacity.																								For Bharti Infotel, this would result in higher revenues, reduction in operating costs, savings in finance costs and a significant improvement in cash flows without impacting the availability of capacities in any way, said Agarwal. 																								Bharti Infotel is a leading provider of access, long distance, data and corporate solutions, and has telecom infrastructure with 23,000 route kms of optic fibre cable network complemented by the undersea cable network i2i. The 3,200-km i2i cable network is a 50:50 joint venture between Bharti and SingTel.

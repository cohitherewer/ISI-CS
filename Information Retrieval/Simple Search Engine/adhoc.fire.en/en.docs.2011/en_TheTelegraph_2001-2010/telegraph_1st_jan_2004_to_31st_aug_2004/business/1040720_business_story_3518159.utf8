 Tuesday, July 20, 2004  Business Briefs																								 New Delhi, July 19: The board of Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) will, for the third time, meet here tomorrow to decide on interest rates to be offered to its 3 crore subscribers this year, even as trade unions demand higher returns. During the last two meetings of the board  comprising members from employers, employees and governments (both Centre and state)  a consensus could not be arrived at due to the simmering differences between the EPFOs offer of 8 per cent interest rate and trade unions demand for 12 per cent. The central board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation, which offered 9.5 per cent return in 2003-04, held that any returns over 8 per cent will be unsustainable and also ruled out differential rates.

Cognizant is the only company that has been clubbed as promising and one that shows potential in specific areas.																								In 2003, CRM consulting and systems integration revenue was approximately $8 billion.																								The research report focuses on consulting and systems integration services provided by these companies from conception through implementation of CRM activities. 																								This includes vision and strategy, business consulting, business transformation, development, configuration, and rollout of packages and custom CRM software.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Black diamond 																								New Delhi, July 7: Progress in the infrastructure sector  covering telecom, posts, roads, power, civil aviation, water supply and sanitation  will crucially depend on the ability to enforce user charges, exploit new technologies, private sector production and a regulatory framework to foster competition.																								The survey states that lack of adequate infrastructure has been not only constrained the growth of performance of the economy, but has also induced significant costs in terms of welfare loss.																								A strong need to increase the volume of voice telephony and internet connectivity has suggested the government to take measures to increase internet user base and tele-density.																								 The survey has stated that a concern for policy is the stagnation of internet use both dial-up and broadband. One problem inhibiting dialup internet use is the lack of flat fee unlimited access tariff plans for fixed telephony.																								It has pointed that the sustained growth in number of lines at the same rate as last year and the next year will take result addition of about 150 million lines by end of 200506.																								Still the tele-density will be only about 14 by end March 2006. But there is a good possibility of obtaining faster growth to achieve a tele-density of 17 by the end of 2005-06 based on growth of mobile phones. The number of internet subscribers grew by 15 per cent from 3.6 million to 4.2 million in March 2004.																								The survey has termed the long overdue spectrum policy on the allocation of this scarce resource to be a major factor which will shape the future of telecom industry as the trend is towards mobility with high data services.Civil aviation policy																								The wide-ranging recommendations of the high-powered Naresh Chandra Committee would be used as inputs to draw up a comprehensive civil aviation policy, the survey said. 																								The document said the committee was set up to prepare a roadmap for the civil aviation sector that would provide a basis for a national policy.																								Describing the trends in air traffic as encouraging, it said the domestic traffic had grown by 9.3 per cent last year over that of previous year.

 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, June 28: Private banking in India is evolving  by leaps and bounds.																								BNP Paribas, an upper crust global private bank, today announced its plan to offer advisory services for its high networth clients in buying and selling art and acquiring real estate for investment purposes.																								The French bank advises its clients in Europe on all forms of art  classical or modern. Michel Longhini, chief executive officer of BNP Paribas Private Bank (Asia), says, We advise our clients. Some of them buy and sell through us; others take advice to keep abreast of the market and there are some investors who take advice but deal on their own. Ultimately, we are more interested in maintaining the relationship with our clients.																								Upper crust banks specialising in private banking like Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro are also thinking of offering specialised services, say industry sources. However, a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: At this moment, we are not offering these specialised services.																								While Indian laws are slowly evolving to allow Indian money to be invested abroad, its still early days. BNP Paribas may have experts to evaluate a Monet, Picasso but it will have to start from scratch to develop an idea about Indian art. BNP Paribas officials are confident they will get Indian experts who are known for their integrity to advise its clients.																								BNP Paribas, says Sharad Sharma, head of private banking in India, will enlist support from very reliable valuers of art who are aware of the Indian art scene. It is the largest bank in the Euro-zone in terms of net income and market cap with 14,000 corporate and institutional clients and 20 million individual clients.																								India has 61,000 high networth investors worth not less than Rs 4.5 crore individually, a recent study revealed.																								Adding to the number are the prosperous non-resident Indians from Europe and South East Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia etc). Most of them, industry sources say, are Sindhis and Punjabis with a smattering of south Indians.																								Longhini said most of the Indian investors he has come across are very sophisticated. They have a single-minded purpose. They want good yields and are willing to take a call on complicated derivative products. Unlike the affluent ethnic Chinese, who prefer to invest closer home, the Indians are comfortable anywhere in the world as long as the returns are attractive enough.																								BNP Paribas some years ago had exited from retail banking in India to concentrate on private banking here.																								Interestingly, BNP Paribas which has a presence in eight cities have found unusual trends among the affluent investors from Calcutta.																								The high-networth investors in Calcutta (mostly Marwaris) are the traditionally rich people. Private bankers like Sharma find they are migrating to specialised private banks to invest their funds.

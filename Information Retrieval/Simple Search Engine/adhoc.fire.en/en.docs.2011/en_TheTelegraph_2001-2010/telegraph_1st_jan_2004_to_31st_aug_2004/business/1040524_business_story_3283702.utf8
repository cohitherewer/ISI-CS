 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Telecom majors ring in vehicle-tracking system
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, May 23: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Bharti have successfully implemented a vehicle-tracking system that will address the fleet management needs of the logistics sector.																								The fleet management product is part of an effort by mobile service providers to explore new business opportunities through utilisation of the nationwide connectivity infrastructure.																								While BSNL has entered into a tripartite agreement with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharti is using its solution to manage Transport Corporation of Indias (TCI) fleet.																								Both products use global positioning system (GPS), a satellite-based radio navigation and time distribution system that broadcasts position and timing data round the clock across the globe, co-ordinating with three of a constellation of 24 satellites orbiting the earth.																								The global system for mobile (GSM) communication is a wireless data network protocol, which when integrated with GPS, is able to update the current location of the system under investigation. 																								Rajiv Sharma, CEO of broadband and data group, Bharti Infotel, said, The solution tracks the location of vehicles and sends an SMS to the central data server. The longitudinal and latitudinal position of the vehicle is determined from the SMS and mapped on digital roadmaps using geographical information systems (GIS).																								Customers are given a registration number and can obtain locational information through an internet portal.																								Moving vehicles can also notify in case of a crisis using an SOS switch through a two-way communication. The fleet server at the control station can create databases of vehicle registration and driver details and also alert the client in case of an emergency.																								Moreover, fleet owners can keep tab on the routes taken by a driver, the speed at which he travels, the number of unscheduled stops and the time the engine is left idle.																								Bharti plans to reach out to over 200 companies and fleet owners and expects a revenue of Rs 50 crore from the venture.																								After successfully implementing the arrangement with IOC and eLogistics, BSNL has issued a directive to all its circles to strengthen infrastructure along state and national highways before the commercial launch.

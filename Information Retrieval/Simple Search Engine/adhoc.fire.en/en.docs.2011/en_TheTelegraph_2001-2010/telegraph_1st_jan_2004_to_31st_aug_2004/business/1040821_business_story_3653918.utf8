The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 ONGC poised to strike gas in east 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Raha: Bullish																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is on the verge of a large gas discovery on the east coast after Reliance.																								An ONGC executive said the data available with the exploration group suggests high reserves of gas in the deep waters off the east coast.																								If the indications are anything to go by, we are quite hopeful of striking a major gas find in this region, he said.																								ONGC chairman Subir Raha also sounds quite optimistic about striking major fuel reserves in this region where the company is currently working on a number of wells.																								Our team is working hard. I think I will be able to give you good news soon, he said.																								Currently, three drilling ships are working in the region and one of them can go to a depth of about 1800 metres.																								The company is also bringing Belford Dolphin, the technology-intensive drill ship, to explore up to a level of 3000 metres in the deep waters.																								ONGC has budgeted for 47 deep water exploratory wells on the east and west coasts.																								The director-general hydrocarbons (DGH) has estimated a reserve of 11 billion tonnes of oil and oil equivalent (BTOE) in the countrys deep water basins.																								In over 45 years of exploration in India, the company has established reserves of nearly six BTOE onshore and in shallow waters, an ONGC executive said. 																								Of these initial in-place reserves, only two BTOE is recoverable. Nearly 0.9 BTOE has already been produced and as of now, ONGC holds 1:1 BTOE proven recoverable reserves in the domestic assets, he added.																								The company has, however, set a strategic goal of doubling the reserves from six BTOE to 12 BTOE by 2020. And of this six BTOE, four will come from deep waters and two from onshore and shallow waters, he said.																								The strategic goal of accreting four BTOE reserves in deep waters should lead to an establishment of a recoverable reserve of one BTOE, considering a very conservative 25 pert cent recovery factor.																								At the price of $20 per barrel, the targeted recoverable reserves have a value of $140 billion in the next two decades, sources said.

 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Full throttle on pay-and-use highways
 M RAJENDRAN				 Toll Tale 																								New Delhi, Jan. 1: The government plans to collect toll from more roads and may raise the existing levy in a few sectors as part of its initiative to improve the road sector in India.																								The toll collection is expected to go up to about Rs 2,000 crore annually and the amount will be used to maintain the roads. The tolling potential of the Golden Quadrilateral alone is estimated to be at about Rs 1,000-1,500 crore a year. This constitutes about 3-5 per cent a year of the cost of four-laning this network.																								More importantly, this level of toll could take care of operations, maintenance, and minor upgradation of the quadrilateral, freeing up scarce budgetary resources for other network expansion and upgradation. 																								An annual review of the tolling undertaken by the ministry of surface transport says that to sustain the momentum gained in the road sector, there is a need for strict tolling and also expansion of the tolling on the roads that are attracting heavy traffic yet are not tolled.																								The last two years have been good for the sector and though none of the highways has reached break-even, there are enough indications that the road users are willing to pay for better quality or roads. This sentiment has to be encashed, said a senior official in the ministry of surface transport.																								We are in the process of identifying the roads in the country and a decision to expand and also to examine whether there should be a marginal hike in toll on existing roads would have to be taken based on the inputs we get, sources added.																								According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, China requires an estimated investment of $150 billion over the next 15 years or so towards the development of its National Trunk Highways System. Tolling and other user charges are expected to address only 50 per cent of these needs. Hence, there is a gap between demand and supply of resources.																								The Chinese propose to bridge this gap with the use of public-private partnerships. 																								Tolling is a specific user fee and there is no reason as to why viability needs to be seen in terms of full construction and maintenance funding. We can use tolls to complement budgetary funds or to pay only for maintenance or a combination of the two. We should, as in the case of China, look at the entire spectrum of financing strategies for highways, picking and choosing the appropriate mix, said Bharti Gupta Ramola, who heads the infrastructure practice in PricewaterhouseCoopers Financial Advisory Services Division in India. 																								Yes, it is true that if tolls were set at a level so as to recover the full cost of construction, maintenance and expansion of highways, tolls would be considered high in an economy like Indias. However, international comparisons show that pursuant to a cabinet decision in 1997 tolls for four-laning of highways have been set at levels well below that in other countries, including countries in the region like China, said Ramola.

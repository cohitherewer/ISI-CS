 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 NDTV shares fly off shelves
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 21: New Delhi Television Ltds (NDTV) initial public offering got off to an impressive start as the issue was lapped up within minutes of the opening. 																								This made merchant bankers optimistic about bumper issues like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) which will hit the market in May and June.																								By the end of the day, NDTVs wholly book-built issue was oversubscribed 3.3 times. Merchant bankers expect more investors in the coming days, attracted by the price band of Rs 63-70 per share. 																								NDTVs Rs 109-crore issue opened today coinciding with a general uptrend in media stocks on the bourses. Merchant bankers said the whole issue was oversubscribed within 15 minutes of the opening of the offer.																								Shares of TV Today, which competes for viewership with NDTV, gained almost 1 per cent to close at Rs 146. 																								Investors on the National Stock Exchange have bid for nearly 57 million shares against only 17.3 million shares on offer.																								Unlike recent IPOs, the NDTV issue is open only to local investors as the government permits only 26 per cent stake to be owned by foreigners.																								NDTV claims to be the foremost English news channel in the country and a close second to Aaj Tak in Hindi. Investors are also betting on a quick appreciation of investment for lucky allottees, as they draw a similar movement in the share price like TV Today, the owners of Aaj Tak that saw its shares gaining 100 per cent on listing. It fell afterwards as profit taking shaved part of the gains.																								Merchant bankers are also expecting big-ticket IPOs like TCS to hit the markets sooner than expected.																								The best time to strike is when the iron is hot. Infosys, Wipro and MphasiS have issued generous bonuses in the midst of a snowballing outrage expressed by American politicians on outsourcing. The confidence shown by Indian promoters of tech companies is expected to rub off on TCS to prepone the date of its IPO.

 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Shipping sees growth anchor in tonnage tax
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Smooth sailing																								Mumbai, July 11: The finance ministry has stipulated that shipping companies opting for tonnage tax will have to earmark 20 per cent of their book profits from core activities into a separate reserve account.																								According to the government, the tonnage tax reserve account should be used to acquire new ships, the deadline for which has been fixed at eight years. Industry analysts said while the move is along expected lines, the tax will increase the tonnage of the shipping industry.																								According to the Finance Bill, a company should own at least one ship with a minimum tonnage of 15 tonnes to qualify for the scheme. 																								The government has given shipping companies a timeframe of three months commencing from October 1 to opt for the scheme.																								This proposal has, however, brought some discomfiture to the industry with sources pointing out that finance minister P. Chidambaram should have given them more time in moving over to the new regime.																								The government has also stipulated that once a company shifts to the new scheme, there is a lock-in period of 10 years. If a company thus opts out, it is barred from re-entry for a decade.																								A company could qualify for the scheme if it is formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and India is its place of effective management. While the company should primarily be in the business of operating qualifying ships, the Centre has clarified that shipping contracts in respect of earnings from pooling arrangements can also qualify for the scheme.																								Industry analysts feel that the new regime would see shipping firms paying close to 2 per cent of their profit as tax. At present, shipping companies, after availing deduction under section 33 AC, pay close to 7 per cent tax on their profit. There is also a stipulation that if any ship acquired is sold within eight years of purchase, the entire revenue will be added back as profit in the year of sale. However, according to the tonnage tax system, only capital gains will be taxed.

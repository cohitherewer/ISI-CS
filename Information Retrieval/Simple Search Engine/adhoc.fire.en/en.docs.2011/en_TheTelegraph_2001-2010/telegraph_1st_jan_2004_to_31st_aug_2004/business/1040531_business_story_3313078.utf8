The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 ABC top-slot for Businessworld 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 30: Businessworld has emerged as the largest circulated business magazine in the country. According to the latest ABC report (July-December 2003), Businessworld has registered a circulation of 1,46,532, a 22 per cent rise over the previous period (January-June 2003).																								Business Today, its main competitor, has relinquished ABC membership, while Business India did not file its returns for the period. The last audited figure (ABC January-June 2003) for Business Today and Business India are 1,24,647 and 75,673, respectively.																								In January-June 2003, Businessworld became the fastest-growing business magazine, registering a growth of 10 per cent compared with only 3 per cent recorded by Business Today and 4 per cent by Business India. 																								Sandip Ghose, vice-president, Businessworld and The Telegraph, said, It was apparent from the last two ABC reports that Businessworld was well on its way to become the leader. It had already overtaken Business Today and Business India in the top eight metros. Businessworld is expanding through aggressive brand-building activities and marketing initiatives.																								In the past, there was plenty of talks on our alleged chronic absenteeism from ABC. Businessworlds success in the latest ABC survey should silence our detractors now, he added.																								Santanu Biswas, corporate manager, ad marketing, said, Businessworlds superiority in circulation numbers is clearly reflected in the quality of its readership. It is also the fastest-growing business magazine in SEC A1, with an overall readership growth of 75 per cent, according to the National Readership Survey (NRS) 2003, over NRS 2002.																								Repeated studies continue to reiterate Businessworlds quality of reach. The Decision Makers Survey 4 conducted by AC Neilson ORG-MARG put the magazines average issue readership among decision-makers at 42 per cent, way ahead of its main competitor Business Today at 37 per cent. Moreover, according to the Print Passion study done by ATG/MCI of GroupM Media and IMRB International on new insights into reader involvement, Businessworld has the highest score among all business magazines, he added.

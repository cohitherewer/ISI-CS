 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 ONGC keen to buy Bina refinery pie
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Fuel for growth 																								Calcutta, April 11: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is eyeing a 26 per cent stake in the Bharat Petroleum Corporation-promoted (BPCL) Bina refinery.																								Sources said talks with BPCL and the government to buy a slice of equity in the greenfield refinery coming up in Madhya Pradesh, are under way. The process of evaluation of the project is on and the final decision will be based on this, they added.																								ONGC, the largest profit-making company in the country, is seriously looking at downstream (refinery) projects to emerge as an integrated oil major.																								It already owns 72 per cent of Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals (MRPL), which is producing over 9.6 million tonnes of petroleum products.																								The logic behind the acquiring a stake in Bina is that ONGC, which has decided to set up a country-wide retail network soon, will be able to source petroleum products in line with its requirement in the central and northern regions. MRPL, based in the south, is used to cater to the demand in that region.																								A senior ONGC official said no concrete decision on buying a stake in the Bina refinery has been taken. However, he said the company is keen to source products from various refineries. Any possible participation in Bina would be part of this quest.																								The greenfield refinery was envisaged in 1995 with a project cost of Rs 5,277 crore. But the venture is now expected to cost Rs 6,354 crore because of delays.																								The project was initially planned as a joint venture between BPCL and Oman Oil, each holding 26 per cent. But sources say the Oman firm refused to pick up its share of the equity, insisting it would stay with 2 per cent. ONGC is considering filling that slot.																								Meanwhile, Bharat Petroleum has sought fiscal concessions from government to make the project viable in a competitive market. It has requested the Madhya Pradesh government for the waiver of entry tax on crude and the deferment of sales tax for 15 years. 																								It also wants relief in electricity duties and royalty on construction material. According to a conservative estimate, the sales-tax respite alone would save Rs 400 crore annually.																								The Bina project comprises single-point mooring, a crude oil terminal with connecting sub-sea and onshore pipeline at Vadinar in the Gulf of Kutch. There will be a 935-km crude pipeline from Vadinar to Bina.

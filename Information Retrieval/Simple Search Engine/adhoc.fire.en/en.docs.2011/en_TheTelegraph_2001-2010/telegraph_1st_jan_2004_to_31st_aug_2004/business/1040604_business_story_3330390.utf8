 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Captains spot no reform iceberg
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 3: Over a sumptuous spread, finance minister P. Chidambaram gave the captains of corporate India a taste of his brand of reforms. The dessert will come early next month, to be spooned out as proof of the pudding that was promised today.																								The leading lights of India Inc radiated after the pow-wow with the man who holds the countrys purse-strings, convinced that Chidambaram, who spun a dream-budget seven years back, would do an encore.																								The reforms boat is steady, Chidambaram told the throng of barons that included Reliances Mukesh Ambani, RPGs Harsh Goenka, Adi Godrej, Sterlites Anil Agarwal and Tata top gun R. Gopalakrishnan.																								The reassurance helped quell the frission of fear running through corporate corridors on the pace of reforms, seen under fire from the Left parties supporting the government that Chidambaram is part of.																								My view is that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram are like Gavaskar and Tendulkar in a cricket team. What better team can u get? Ambani said in comments that best showed how far the finance minister had succeeded in calming frazzled reform nerves.																								Baba Kalyani of Bharat Forge, Ajay Piramal of Nicholas Piramal India, Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon, Sajjan Jindal of Jindal Iron and Steel Company and Anand Mahindra were also united in their belief that the FM-PM duo would play a long innings for liberalisation.																								Upbeat about sustained growth in the months ahead, Ambani predicted a surge in investment over two years, worth thousands of crores. The optimism on reforms came with a tinge of doubt on divestment. 																								The Reliance boss said his talks with the finance minister gave him the impression that HPCL would not be divested. He, however, said one should not say goodbye to raising resources. Whether the number is Rs 15,000 crore or Rs 20,000 crore, I still think that money can come in through sale of shares.

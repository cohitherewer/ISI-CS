 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Debt recast puts strain on bank equity funding
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Figuring a way out																								Calcutta, July 2: Banks are seeking a relaxation in the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) scheme so that loans converted into equity are treated separately and not brought under the 5 per cent cap on overall equity investment.																								At present, banks are allowed to invest 5 per cent of their total advances in equity. With CDR schemes now in place, banks are frequently facing the possibility of breaching this limit.																								A core group of the CDR cell has submitted a recommendation to the Reserve Bank on the issue. The core group comprises representatives of IDBI, ICICI Bank, State Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, IBA and the executive director of the Reserve Bank.																								The banks have also approached the Indian Banks Association (IBA) in this regard.																								The group has asked the central bank to do away with the existing system of case-by-case scrutiny and permission. The regulator looks into each case of debt-converted equity and decides whether to treat it as investment in equity or suggest a waiver. 																								In May 2001, in the wake of the stock market scam, the RBI had capped banks total equity investments at 5 per cent of the advances.																								Total equity investment of a bank includes direct investments in shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, convertible bonds and debentures, IPO financing and advances to individuals/brokers for investment in equity shares.																								Financial institutions like IDBI, LIC and GIC, which are not bound by the rules of the central bank, have benefited from the conversion of debt into equity in several companies. 																								However, banks have shied away from the proposition. Banks are required to take a case-by-case approval from the RBI in order to do so and they have to closely monitor their level of equity investments and ensure that it falls within the permitted limit, banking sources said.																								Senior officials of the CDR cell said this is acting as a stumbling block. The CDR mechanism till date has been a runaway success in India. The major achievement of the cell had been the restructuring of the Rs 40,000-crore debt of the steel industry. The benefit of conversion of bad debt into equity is that the lenders who hold a substantial stake would get management control in the entity, which could go a long way in reviving the unit. 																								Since conversion is done only in the case of listed companies, the bank/financial institution can liquidate its holdings when prices go up, a banker said. The option that is currently exercised by most banks is to sacrifice the loan, provide for the same from profits and wait for the borrower to repay.

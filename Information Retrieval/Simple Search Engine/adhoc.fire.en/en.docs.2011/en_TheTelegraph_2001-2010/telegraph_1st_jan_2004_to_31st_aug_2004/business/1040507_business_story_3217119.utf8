The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Broadband to help fixed-line rebound
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bengal IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, May 6: The broadband buzz is getting louder. The service is being touted as the next big revenue churner that could help fixed-line operators bounce back. 																								Despite a mere 3 per cent growth last year, fixed-line telephony could make it big by riding piggyback on the potential demand for broadband services. Fixed service providers could generate revenues by creating franchisee models of operation for broadband or DSL (digital subscriber line) services, said D. P. S. Seth, member of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).																								He was speaking at a telecom meet organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) together control 95 per cent of the last mile connectivity. Private players need to strike an alliance with these companies and cable operators to deliver broadband services, Kishor Chaukar, chairman of CII Telecom Committee, said.																								Recently, Tata-controlled VSNL entered into an alliance with Bharti to use its national long-distance (NLD) network.																								Earlier at a meet in the city, BSNL chief V. P. Sinha said that broadband as an alternate revenue stream would be crucial for the survival of the company over the next few years. 																								The current broadband penetration in India is 0.02 per cent against 67 per cent in Korea. Trai has set a target of 20 million broadband and 40 million internet subscribers by 2010.																								Seth reprimanded cellular service operators on failing to provide adequate network coverage and limited utilisation of spectrum.																								The service level offered is far from optimum, he said. Network performance has fluctuated and congestion has caused communication problems. The regulator intends to take action so that operators cannot get away with poor service.																								On spectrum utilisation, Seth said although there is need for more spectrum, what is available can be stretched with the right mix of technology.																								Mobile telephony grew 160 per cent last year and it is felt that the huge demand has resulted in capacity saturation.																								The country has set a target of 100 million mobile subscribers by December 2005 against 34 million as on March 2004. Therefore, around 3 million subscribers would have to be added every month.																								Seth urged Bengal IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee, who inaugurated the CII Telecom East meet, to allow operators right of way in exchange of bandwidth. Indicom launch																								Tata Teleservices will roll out its Indicom service in Bengal and Calcutta by the end of 2004. The company has already acquired the license for the two circles, said Kishor Chaukar, MD of Tata Industries. 																								The company offers basic, internet-broadband, dial-up-and NLD services. Telephone services include wireline, fixed wireless phones and CDMA mobile.

																								Mumbai, Aug. 23 (PTI): Citigroup has raised the offer price for e-Serve International Ltd, an IT-enabled services company, to Rs 975 per share from the earlier offer of Rs 800.																								Citibank Overseas Investment Corporation would accept all the shares validly tendered at exit price of Rs 975 or those tendered below the exit price, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today.																								The shareholders of the company were invited to submit bids via the reverse book-building platform.																								A total of 53.22 lakh shares were validly tendered at or below a price of Rs 975, the company said.																								After acquisition of these shares, the public stake in e-Serve would fall below the limit specified in listing regulations. 																								At a later date, the company would be delisted from the stock exchanges.																								Earlier on April 12, 2004, Citigroup had made an offer to acquire the Indian shareholding in e-Serve International, a company of which it already owns 44 per cent, in a reverse book-built issue estimated to be worth Rs 550 crore. 																								e-Serve handles the banks myriad back-office jobs and is likely to get more work. It offers business process outsourcing services to Citigroup companies in more than 25 countries. 																								Set up in 1992, the firm was one of the earliest in the business to take advantage of costs and emerge as one of the top five outsourcing firms in the country.

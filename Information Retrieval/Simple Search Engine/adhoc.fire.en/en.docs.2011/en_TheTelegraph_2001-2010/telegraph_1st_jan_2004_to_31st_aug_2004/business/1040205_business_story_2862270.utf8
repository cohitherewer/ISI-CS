 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Maruti fuels Suzuki profit drive
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: Maruti Udyog has helped its parent Suzuki Motor Corp of Japan record solid operating profits in the first nine months of the year to March 2004.																								Suzuki, Japans biggest small carmaker, and 54.2 per cent majority-owner of Maruti, said it has benefited from its presence in India and the Asian subsidiaries performance, which has made up for flat demand in Japan.																								Group operating profit during the April-December period stood at $657.7 million while net profit came to Rs 40.48 billion yen (1 yen = Rs 43.02), which puts it on track to achieve record profits for the full year.																								For the full year to March 31, Suzuki, owned one-fifth by General Motors Corp, maintained its forecast of a 13 per cent climb in net profit to a record 35 billion yen although net profit in the first nine months has overshot the full-year forecast.																								No comparisons from the year before were given since Suzuki, Japans fourth-largest auto maker by market value, is reporting quarterly figures for the first time.																								In the nine month period to December 2003, Marutis net profit rose year-to-year 315 per cent to Rs 385 crore while total income was at Rs 6763.9 crore. 																								Maruti is ranked among the top 20 car sellers in the world and is credited with creating the small car market in India. Its models account for nearly 59 per cent of the countrys overall passenger car market.																								The carmaker, which has its factory in Gurgaon, currently makes 10 models and imports the Grand Vitara sports utility vehicle as a fully-built unit. During the nine month period to December 2003, it has reported a 30.3 per cent rise in sales to 3.28 lakh units over the corresponding period last year.

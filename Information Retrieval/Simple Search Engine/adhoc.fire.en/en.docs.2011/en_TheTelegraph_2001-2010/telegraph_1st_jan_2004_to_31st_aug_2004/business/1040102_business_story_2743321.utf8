 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Stocks on a song, Sebi hits note of caution
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 1: Markets roared off the block with a 76-point sensex gain on day one of the new year, but the excitement of hitting 6000 points was tempered by a Sebi caveat that shares had galloped too fast too soon.																								Chairman G. . Bajpai warned that the sharp rise in the stock market was under close surveillance for abnormal movements. We are watching market activity closely as it seems to have grown too fast, he said here tonight.																								But with another peak only 85 points away, Dalal Street has already started reaching for the bubbly as the index settled at 5915.47  reviving visions of another boom era when it hit 5933.56, on February 11, 2000.																								Everything is going the way the markets want them to  a record 8.4 per cent second-quarter growth, $100 billion in the forex kitty. The confirmation that the economy is in great shape made shares of steel, cement and automobile and even FMCG firms top draws. Most of these industries had not caught up with the rally. ACC, Gujarat Ambuja, Lever and SAIL sizzled. Mirroring gains in the 30-share index, the NSE nifty leapt 1.7 per cent to a post closing high of 1912.25 points.																								To make sure that rogues do not run amok in the boom, the market regulator said it had put in place monitoring mechanisms to detect any violations by market participants and would take strong action against those found guilty for breach of regulations, Bajpai said.																								He urged retail investors to watch the shifts in the market. They should take informed decisions by studying the risks and rewards associated with investments.																								The market cops circumspection came hours after his organisation put FII investments at $7.59 billion last calendar year. The figure includes debt and shares. Of this, $1.40 billion poured in last month alone.

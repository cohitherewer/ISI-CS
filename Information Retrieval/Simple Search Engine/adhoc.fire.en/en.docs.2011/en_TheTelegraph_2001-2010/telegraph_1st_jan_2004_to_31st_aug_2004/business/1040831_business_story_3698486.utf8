 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Rating agency for small units from Jan
New Delhi, Aug. 30 (PTI): A credit rating agency, exclusively for the small-scale sector, will start functioning from January, according to Sidbi chairman V. K. Chopra.																								The agency, to be promoted by government-owned banks and Small-Scale Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), will also have an established player in the field as a partner.																								Apart from Sidbi, the other promoters are Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Canara Bank.																								Chopra, however, did not disclose the name of the rating agency that will be taken on board for the project.																								The credit rating agency for the small-scale sector will have an office each in Mumbai and Delhi apart from one of the SSI clusters to begin with, Chopra said.																								Such an agency is the first step towards increasing the flow of credit to the small-scale sector as its share in the total advances by the banks has come down to 11 per cent in 2003-04 from 17 per cent 1998-99.																								Banks have been reluctant to lend to the small scale units as they account for a significant share of their bad loans. With a rating agency for the sector, banks will be able to identify viable projects for funding. New policy on anvil																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said if policies of the past have not worked well for the small-scale sector, they should be discarded and asked the SSI ministry to expedite the proposed single law and curtail inspector raj.

 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Aug. 14: Even as a national biotechnological policy is on the anvil, the issue of bio safety and risk assessment for biotech products are the primary issues that will determine the proliferation of these products in the country.																								There should be built-in safeguards in the proposed biotech policy, like insurance cover, to insulate farmers from any failure of GM (genetically modified) crops, said leading agroscientist M. S. Swaminathan, who is the head of a task force on agricultural biotechnology. 																								Swaminathan, who has recently submitted a report charting out a roadmap for a second green revolution, thinks that the single window regulatory body on biotechnolgy to be put in place by January 2005 will go a long way to help the cause of safe biotech products in India																								Swaminathan, who heads the National Commission on Farmers, feels that the science of biotechnology and GM crops should maintain the rigours of strict regulation.

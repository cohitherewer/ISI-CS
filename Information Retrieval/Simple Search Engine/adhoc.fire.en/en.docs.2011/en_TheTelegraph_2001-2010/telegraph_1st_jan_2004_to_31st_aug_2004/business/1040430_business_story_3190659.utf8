 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Lever licks price-war wounds
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 29: Price-warrior Hindustan Lever (HLL) came out bruised from a battle where it crossed swords with rivals who pulled no punches in offering cheap fare.																								Its first-quarter bottomline was down 23 per cent at Rs 294.88 crore from Rs 382.92 crore same time last year. Operating profit declined 13.7 per cent to Rs 359 crore, mainly due to price cuts on premium fabric wash and shampoos. Pre-tax profit at Rs 370 crore was 25.8 per cent weaker, dragged down by treasury income and interest cost (Rs 29.64 crore) on bonus debentures.																								The profit figure shocked markets, which had expected dour numbers but not as bleak as it finally turned out. The Lever share saw wild swings, scraping the bottom at Rs 139.15 at one point before bargain hunters helped it close at Rs 143.95, down 90 paise from its last finish.																								Officials were quick to shrug off the numbing numbers, saying they would do all it takes to boost Levers market-share across a host of product categories.																								Our business is totally focussed now. We will not hesitate to make financial commitments to defend and strengthen our market position in the face of competition, chairman M. S. Banga told reporters in its first-ever press conference to discuss first-quarter results.																								I have no doubt that brilliant marketing will spur growth in fast moving consumer goods, he added. Underplaying one of the sharpest profit slides at Lever, Banga cited a Goldman Sachs report on the high potential of the Indian economy to predict a 14 to 15 per cent growth in market size over the next few years. 																								We are excited and well keep a lions share of the market for ourselves, he added, pointing to consumer spends on FMCG products that are expected to rise from the current level of 4 per cent of household expenses.																								The tepid sales growth of 3.5 per cent in home and personal care  the companys mainstay  was blamed on price reductions. Officials said this was evident in the volume growth of 7 per cent in the segment. Other income fell to Rs 71.35 crore from Rs 148 crore. 																								Analysts, however, saw tough times continuing for Lever. Stiff competition and higher raw material costs could eat into profits in the coming quarters. 																								The consolidation is over. However, pricing pressure continues, an analyst tracking the FMCG segment said.

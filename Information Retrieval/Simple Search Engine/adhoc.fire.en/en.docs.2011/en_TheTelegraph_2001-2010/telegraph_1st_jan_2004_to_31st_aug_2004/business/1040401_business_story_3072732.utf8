 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Sebi to probe ONGC share allotment fiasco
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Arun Shourie: Ready with a quick fix																								New Delhi, March 31: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will investigate the over-allotment of shares to retail investors, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said here today.																								Sebi will probe the issue of over-allotment of ONGC shares to retail investors to find out if there was any culpable mistake, Shourie said. The regulator will also decide who will bear the consequent losses.																								The minister said that 52 high net worth individuals were over allotted 3 lakh ONGC shares following the public offer.																								Twelve of these investors had volunteered to surrender the excess allotment. Sebi will probe and decide on the over-allotment of one lakh shares to the remaining 40 retail investors, he said.																								On Monday, the registrar to the ONGC issue over-allotted shares mainly in the high net worth investor category leading to freezing of depository transfers of these shares by National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) 																								Issue registrar MCS Limited informed NSDL on Monday that it had over allotted nearly 4 lakh ONGC shares by mistake, mainly in the high net worth investor category. 																								Stating that it was for Sebi to find out whether the registrar or lead manager was responsible for the goof-up and if it was a culpable mistake, Shourie said no issue would be made if the over-allotment was due to an error.																								However, Shourie assured action if there was foul play involved in what has so far been termed as a possible human error. If the responsibility is to be fixed, we will. It is not under the cover of collective responsibility that anyone can escape, Shourie said.																								The minister said the entire public offer process for the sale of 10 per cent equity in ONGC was complete and the proceeds of Rs 10,542 crore was deposited in the government account. 																								Disinvestment secretary Dhirendra Singh said there were enough shares in escrow to take care of any contingency. Shourie also said that plea by the investors that they did not know about the over-allotments did not stand.																								He said, Everyone knew the basis for entitlement...It was in the press, and merchant bankers knew it. Those involved are large investors, who are very well-informed.																								ONGC is setting up a helpline where investors can lodge their grievances relating to mismatch of shares and what was being credited to them, the minister said. He ruled out the likelihood of a litigation arising out of the over-allotment of shares to the high networth individuals.

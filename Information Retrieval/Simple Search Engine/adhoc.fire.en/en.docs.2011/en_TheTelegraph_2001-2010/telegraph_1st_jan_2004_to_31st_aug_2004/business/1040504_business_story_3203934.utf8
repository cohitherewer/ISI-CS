 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 DoT contests Reliance claim
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, May 3: Reliance Infocomm is the countrys largest mobile telephony service provider. But how many subscribers does it really have? The company claims it is 7 million  and growing. 																								However, a couple of canny officials at the department of telecommunications (DoT) have said if they work back from the revenue figures that the company had submitted to DoT, it comes to only 2.6 million.																								The DoT officials calculations are based on a pretty technical  if a little arcane  formula. The whole controversy rests on the average revenue per user (ARPU)  a metric that establishes how much a company earns per subscriber. 																								Recently, Reliance vice-chairman Anil Ambani said the ARPU for its telecom service was Rs 523 a month. 																								However, Reliance had reported to DoT that its revenues from the telecom services worked out to Rs 1,686.38 crore during 2003-04. 																								DoT officials said Reliance ARPU for the full year would work out to Rs 6,276 (Rs 523 x 12). If the revenue of Rs 1,686.38 crore was divided by the ARPU for the year, the subscriber base would be just 2.6 million.																								A senior Reliance spokesperson said, We have submitted to DoT that the telecom subscriber base is 7 million and the ARPU is Rs 523. We have not submitted a revenue share of any amount to DoT.																								However, sources in DoT said, The revenue share works out to only Rs 1,686.38 crore based on the quarterly average gross revenue (AGR) details they have submitted to DoT and the total subscriber base submitted to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) during the financial year. If the companys revenues are only Rs 1,686.38 crore, then the company has only 2.6 million subscribers.																								Reliance, in its presentation available on the companys website, claims its total customer base is 7 million. ARPU is calculated on a monthly basis. This is multiplied for 12 months to get the yearly ARPU. 																								During the investors call on April 29 for the annual results of the company, SSKI Securities sought to know from the Anil Ambani the extent of debt provisioning for Reliance Infocomm.																								Ambani said that the ARPU was Rs 523 for the financial year 2003-04 and MoU (minutes of usage) was 342. He also added that the total bad debt provision was Rs 435 crore, which is about 15-20 per cent of their revenues. 																								Going by Ambanis figures, the revenues should have been Rs 6,276 (the full year ARPU) multiplied by 7,000,000  to give Rs 4393.2 crore.																								The operators submit a quarterly report on the revenue share to DoT and on the subscriber base every month to Trai. However, the quarterly as well as the total gross revenues submitted by Reliance to Trai shows a different picture (See chart).

 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Foreign flavour in commodities
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 9: The Forward Markets Commission (FMC), an apex regulatory body for domestic commodities and futures market, has set up a sub-committee to encourage foreign participation in the commodity market. The Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), in association with other commodity exchanges, had submitted this proposal to the FMC a few months back. 																								The commission is extremely proactive in developing the commodity market in India, said Multi Commodity Exchange of India managing director Jignesh Shah. He was speaking at a conference organised by the Association of NSE Members of India (ANMI).																								According to Shah, India being an agrarian economy can emerge as the commodity hub of the 21st century and increased foreign participation will hasten the process. The commodity market touches almost 90 per cent of the total economy and therefore, the growth prospect in terms of volume is tremendous. In six months, the volume on the MCX touched Rs 250 crore per day and by the end of this fiscal, it is expected to reach Rs 1,000 crore per day. Subsequently, in three years, the total volume should be around Rs 10,000 crore per day.																								Although organised futures trading in other industrial commodities such as aluminium, copper, lead and tin existed for over a century, there were no future contracts for steel even one-and-a-half months back. The London Metals Exchange has been trying to introduce a steel futures contract for the last three years, but the MCX emerged as the first-ever commodity exchange in the world to offer online steel futures trading and has already achieved a turnover of 1,000 tonnes per day. 																								The MCX has also taken a lead in the bullion futures contracts by constantly registering highest volumes and turnover. Of the total trading volume witnessed on all on-line multi-trading commodity exchanges in the country, the MCX accounts for over 85 per cent of the total trading volumes, thereby emerging as the preferred exchange for the bullion market.

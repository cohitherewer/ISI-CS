 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Buzz on cheap calls to US gets weaker
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 9: Telephone calls to the US will not cost less than Rs 5 a minute  a shimmering prospect that arose on Monday when Data Access quoted a rock-bottom fee of Rs 1.69 a minute to handle international calls arising from Bharat Sanchar Nigams network.																								BSNL officials said such a call rate was a very distant possibility and added that only grey market operators could offer such cut-price rates on calls with a dubious voice quality.																								Data Access had offered the rock-bottom quote in response to a BSNL tender seeking call rate quotations from international long distance operators. The Siddhartha Ray-owned company had quoted the lowest rate for international calls to the US, Canada and the UK, which together constitute more than 60 per cent of the calls made from India.																								All international calls of BSNL are now routed through Videsh Sanchar Nigam. However, BSNL isnt in a rush to sign the deal with Data Access and has given VSNL the opportunity to match the settlement rate offered by Data Access and Reliance Infocomm.																								The settlement rate is the cost paid by companies like VSNL in India to international carriers like AT amp;T that carry forward the calls emanating from India to foreign countries.

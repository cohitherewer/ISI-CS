 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 British firm checks out of Plaza Hotel
																								London, Aug. 13 (Reuters): British firm Millennium amp; Copthorne sold out of New Yorks Plaza Hotel in a $675 million deal on Friday, bidding farewell to a fabled Fifth Avenue address which was running up losses. 																								The 97-year-old hotel has hosted some of the worlds biggest stars, including Hollywood celebrities Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones who held a wedding reception there. 																								However, the Plaza Hotels returns were not good enough for Millennium amp; Copthorne, which has a policy of selling assets it considers as non-core. The Plaza ran up a pre-tax loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 2003.

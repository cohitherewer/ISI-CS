 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Banks hail verdict
 OUR BUREAUX																								April 8: Bankers were gung-ho but industry was a little worried by the Supreme Courts verdict which paved the way for the resumption of debt recovery proceedings against wilful loan defaulters. 																								Banks and FIs had initiated proceedings after the Securitisation Act was passed in 2002 to recover dues of Rs 20,000 crore before the entire process was snarled in litigation.																								IBA chief H. . Sinor said the move will accelerate the procedure of recovery, thus helping the banking system as a whole. 																								CII president Anand Mahindra said, While the Act gives sufficient teeth to the creditors, we hope the banks will implement the act in a judicious way. 																								Industry welcomed the courts decision to strike down section 17(2) of the act as unconstitutional. The provision required companies to deposit 75 per cent of the liability if a defaulting company wished to appeal against the order of attachment of its assets. However, the banks will continue to have the right to take over the assets. 																								We are happy that the section has been done away with, said Ficci president Y. K. Modi.																								Kalpana Morparia, deputy MD of ICICI Bank, said, Its a landmark judgement for the Indian financial system. India has upheld the sanctity of the contractual obligation between debtors and secured creditors.																								The move will put pressure on defaulters and will be a tool to realise the dues by disposing of the defaulters security, said S. S. Kohli, CMD of Punjab National Bank. 																								We are relieved that the validity of the act has been upheld, said K. Cherian Varghese, CMD of Corporation Bank. 																								Bankers feel the act could help them reduce 20 per cent of their NPAs. Assocham said the judgment failed to address the needs of borrowers who were unable to pay for reasons beyond their control.

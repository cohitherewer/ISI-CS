 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, June 19: The countrys apparel exports will continue to rise and will not be adversely affected by the end of the quota regime in December. The targeted apparel exports for 2005  the first year of the quota-free regime  is $5.5 billion, which is half a billion dollars more than the target for this year.																								Preetam Goel, chairman of the exhibition advisory committee of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said, Even as the quota regime comes to an end, the sum total of Indian apparel exports will be on the positive side.																								The export figure for calendar year 2003 was approximately $4.8 billion, he said.																								Chinese textile exports is more than three times Indias, but that does not mean the Indian apparel industry is badly placed in terms of exports. India can concentrate on its areas of strength to reap in foreign exchange through apparel exports, Goel said. In plain terms, apparel refers to ready-made garments, including hosiery.																								The unique selling proposition of the Indian apparel exports includes hand embroidery and the use of special fabrics like cotton crepe and also the fact that India is open to taking small orders.																								The country already exports to many countries which does not have the quota system and apparel exports there are doing well and competing with Chinese products.																								This year when AEPC organises its 33rd annual garment fair  IIGF  between July 21 and 23, it expects participation of about 275 exporters from all over the country. Last time there were about 200 exporters. We will get around 800 buyers from overseas, even though we have invited about 22,000, Goel said.																								We expect exports business worth $30-35 billion from this years fair, he added.																								The fair, which will be the last one in the quota regime, is organised by the AEPC with support from the ministry of textiles and four other major associations pertaining to the apparel export and manufacturing associations.																								The Multi-Fibre Agreement, which has been the framework for international trade in textiles and clothing for 20 years since 1974, has been replaced with the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC).

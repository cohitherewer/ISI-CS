 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Steel prices seen to move up in February
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 Another push 																								Mumbai, Jan. 19: Steel manufacturers are readying for another round of price hikes on the back of firm input costs. Early this month, the industry had jacked up prices by over Rs 1,000-1,500 per tonne. 																								Although a final decision is expected only later this month, industry circles expect an increase in product prices in February as prices of inputs  iron ore, sponge iron and scrap  have spiralled. Rising input costs have affected international hot rolled coil (HRC) prices too.																								Iron ore prices have gone up by 20 per cent. Keeping the input cost in mind, we cannot rule out another hike next month. However, the quantum cannot be ascertained now, an official of a leading Mumbai steel company said. 																								An official at Jindal Steel amp; Power (JSPL), the largest producer of coal-based sponge iron in the country, agreed that prices are likely to remain firm due to a variety of reasons like rising iron ore prices, less availability of scrap and increasing demand. 																								Interestingly, this forecast has come despite the largesse bestowed by the union government earlier this month when it brought down peak customs duty to 20 per cent and removed the special additional duty. The general feeling was that these measures would help Indian steel companies maintain the price or even roll them back. 																								Industry sources feel that though they will have to check frequent price rises, higher realisations are expected due to rising overseas prices. Moreover, domestic prices are lower than landed costs of imported steel. Therefore, the incentive for high imports is relatively low, the source added.																								The recent changes in custom duties are unlikely to put any major downward pressure on sponge iron prices. We anticipate prices to either rise in line with the overseas prices or hold on to their current levels, said Sushil Maroo, vice-president (finance) JSPL. 																								The previous hike of around 7 per cent came after a marginal increase in prices of HRC during November. HRC prices have climbed to over Rs 22,000 per tonne from under Rs 15,000 per tonne in 2002.

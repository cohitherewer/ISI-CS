 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Bengal to gain
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: ONGC plans to invest substantially in Jharkhand and Bengal, where the company is working on projects of coal-bed methane (CBM) and underground coal gassification (UCG).																								Company manager A. K. Biswas said the investment in the CBM alone can go up to Rs 10,000 crore in the next 15 years.																								Earlier, chairman Subir Raha said the commercial production of CBM will start in the next financial year.																								We have called for international bids from the operators who can take the responsibility of turn-key development. The contractors have to bring in specialised rigs, while our own geo-scientists will work on the development, he said.																								Raha also said the bid will be finalised in the next few weeks.																								The chairman is optimistic about the potential of UCG as a source of energy.																								India has merely 0.4 per cent of the worlds total gas reserves although it has 15 per cent of global population. UCG, if properly tapped, can go a long way in benefiting the country, he said.																								The company will sign an MoU with Stochimsky the Russia-based leading UCG producer for this purpose.																								ONGC is also working on another MoU with Coal India Ltd for the project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Polyester upturn in sight
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, April 4: The polyester manufacturers are upbeat as they feel the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) will help the industry to go on an upswing.																								The demand-pull emanating from the readymade garment industry is expected to be more visible from the second half of this fiscal, sources said. This will not only raise the demand for the commodity, but also have its impact on prices as well.																								The effects of the phasing out of the quota regime is already being felt in the textile industry. While majors like Raymond have announced expansion plans worth Rs 200 crore, others like Zodiac, Arvind, Welspun and Alok Industries are also planning similar moves.																								This year has been better than the last. Though polyester prices have virtually remained the same, by the end of this fiscal, we expect better demand for our products. We believe that the phasing out of the MFA will lead to a demand-pull for products down the value chain, said a senior official of Indo Rama Synthetics India Ltd.																								To cash in on this rising demand, Indo Rama is doubling its polyester capacity to 6 lakh tonnes from the existing level of 3 lakh tonnes. The expansion would make the company the largest manufacturer of polyester in a single location, officials said.																								While the company is investing Rs 900 crore at present, the removal of quotas is expected to catapult it to a Rs 5,000-crore company by 2006-07.																								Indo Rama, which commenced operations in 1989, has an integrated polyester unit near Nagpur in technical collaboration with Toyobo, Japan and DuPont, USA. Next year, the company may also look at the possibility of manufacturing value-added products, including drawn texturised yarn and fully-drawn yarn.																								Prices of partially oriented yarn are currently ruling at Rs 70 per kg and those of polyester staple fibre are lower at Rs 63 per kg. 																								At their current levels, both these commodities have reduced considerably from their highs of Rs 111 per kg and Rs 95 per kg, respectively, in 1995.																								Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is the largest manufacturer of polyester products in the country at present with a market share of over 50 per cent. Therefore, any upswing in polyester demand and prices is expected to have a major impact on the companys balancesheet next year, industry analysts said.

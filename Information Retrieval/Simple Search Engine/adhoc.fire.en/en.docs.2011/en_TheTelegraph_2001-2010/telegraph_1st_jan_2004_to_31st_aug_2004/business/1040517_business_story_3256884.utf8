 RAJA GHOSHAL Needle pricks 																								New Delhi, May 16: As the new textile regime comes into effect from January 1 and the quota regime disappears, India will face fierce competition from China not only in the world market but on its home turf as well.																								China is likely to corner the lions share of the international textile market once the new regime comes into effect.																								Increased competition, regional bloc agreements, market expansion but without the guarantee of the quota are the prime features that will prevail in the Indian textile industry from January 1.																								A recent study by the credit rating agency ICRA says that China, being highly competitive in textiles and clothing, is likely to acquire a substantial share of the increase in market for the developing countries.																								China is already a large-scale exporter of clothing and holds a share of more than 20 per cent of the world market. The study says that the ability of other developing countries, including India, in coping with China would be crucial for growth in exports from developing countries. 																								It says the increased competition will not only affect India in the export markets but also threaten domestic producers with imports, especially in the high-end premium fabrics and apparel.																								The multi-fibre Agreement (MFA), which has been the framework for international trade, in textiles and clothing for 20 years since 1974 has been replaced with the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC).																								The ATC envisages complete integration of the entire textile sector into the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the end of a 10-year transition period. 																								The recent study brought out by ICRA says that though the new textile regime will result in the market increasing for the developing nations including India, the guarantee of the assured quota will disappear.

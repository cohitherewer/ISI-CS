The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 IA set to rein in losses this year
 OUR BUREAU				 	 The jet lags over																								New Delhi, March 24: The Indian Airlines (IA) board today approved its revised estimates for the current fiscal, showing a substantially lower loss of Rs 41.25 crore for 2003-04 against Rs 196.56 crore suffered in the previous year.																								The board estimated that the company would end the current year with an operating profit of Rs 15.25 crore, a release said. It also approved the budget estimates for 2004-05.																								In this fiscal, IA rationalised some of its flights by delinking some stations. The airline provided a direct connection to Vadodara and Rajkot from Mumbai. Independent connections have been provided to Lucknow and Varanasi from Mumbai and Delhi on a daily basis.																								The company had been suffering losses in the past three years primarily on account of a massive price hike of aviation turbine fuel since March 2000 and the aftermath of events such as the 9/11 attacks, SARS outbreak and Iraq war.																								While aviation turbine fuel prices were largely stable in 1996-2000, varying between Rs 14,500 and Rs 15,200 per kilolitre, they rose to Rs 18,000 per kilolitre by the end of March 2000, touching an all-time high of Rs 25,200 in March 2003. 																								Aviation turbine fuel is currently priced around Rs 21,500 per kilolitre.																								Budget estimates for 2004-05 indicate an operating profit of Rs 16.50 crore, but the final outcome of these projections would depend a great deal on the price of aviation turbine fuel.																								The budget estimates for 2004-05 is expected to be better than the current financial year due to an improvement in traffic and general health of the economy, coupled with an anticipated increase in capacity and improved utilisation, it said.																								In the current summer schedule, IA has already increased its frequency of A-320 airbus on the Delhi-Mumbai route.

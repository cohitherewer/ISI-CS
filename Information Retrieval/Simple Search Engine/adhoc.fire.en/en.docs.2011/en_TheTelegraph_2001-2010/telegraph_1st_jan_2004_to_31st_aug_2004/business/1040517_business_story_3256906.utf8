 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 SCI rocks Andaman shipping contract
 S. P. S. PANNUTurbulence ahead 																								New Delhi, May 16: Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) appears to have left the Andaman and Nicobar (A amp;N) Islands in the lurch.																								The public sector shipping company had bagged the contract to run the 18 vessels of the A amp;N administration but failed to take over the operations even a year after signing the deal.																								Sources say the shipping ministry has had to come to the rescue of the A amp;N administration after receiving a complaint that the condition of the sea-going vessels which provide the vital link between the islands and the mainland has been deteriorating as SCI was not keeping up its end of the deal. 																								SCI had participated in the tender floated by the A amp;N administration and had emerged as the L1 bidder willing to undertake the task at the least cost.																								The ministry is reported to have issued a directive to the SCI authorities to honour the contract and take up the repair and maintenance of the 18 vessels as well. It is of the view that the maintenance of the vessels is also essential as they have to meet the statutory requirements of the ISM code. 																								These vessels provide the vital lifeline to the inhabitants of the islands. They are used for passenger services between the island and the mainland and for the movement of passengers between the islands as well. 																								These vessels are also used to transport essential supplies of FCI foodgrains, kerosene oil, diesel, and cement from the mainland. In fact, the islands are critically dependent on the mainland for all commodities as nothing is produced locally. Apart from fruit and fish, all the food products are also shipped from the mainland.																								Sources disclose shipping secretary D.T. Joseph had visited the A amp;N islands to get a first-hand feel of the situation and the island administration had discussed the issue with him.																								The Car Nicobar Island was reported to be facing a crippling diesel shortage and the shipping secretary had to instruct the director-general of shipping to find a solution to the problem.																								He is also reported to be of the view that the government staff posted at the islands were working in a remote area under tough conditions. The secretary is reported to have issued instructions that the ministry should do its bit by taking up all proposals of the A amp;N administration on a high-priority basis.

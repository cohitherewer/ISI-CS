The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Tea wages to stay firm
 A STAFF REPORTER Pick and choose 																								Calcutta, June 17: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today ruled out any reduction in wages of tea workers.																								We appreciate your problems and we will always extend our support to you for resolving them. But we cannot allow any trimming of the daily wages of workers, Bhattacharjee said in course of a meeting with a delegation from the Indian Tea Association (ITA) delegation. Led by C.K Dhanuka, the ITA delegation met the chief minister this evening at Writers Buildings.																								The delegation, also representing the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), shared its concern over the slump in tea exports and other problems plaguing the tea industry with the chief minister.																								Exports have gone down by 10 per cent in the last year, Dhanuka said, adding that Bengal accounts for only 20 per cent of the 180 million tonne total Indian production. The internal consumption has, however, gone up by 2.5 per cent in recent times, he pointed out.																								 The tea industry is going through a crisis. We are having regular discussions with them, Bhattacharjee said after the meeting. The chief minister reportedly assured the delegation of all assistance in boosting production.																								According to him, the current wage rate of Rs 45 daily is not feasible for the industry, since wages account for over 50 per cent of the cost of production.																								 Incidentally, at $1.62 per kg, the Indian cost of tea production is highest compared to its other Asian competitors. According to a study conducted by the Indian Tea Board, the cost of production of tea in Sri Lanka is at $1.23, Kenya at $1.16, Vietnam at $0.96, Malaysia at $0.84 while Indonesia is the cheapest at $ 0.58.																								Apart from daily wage, tea workers are also allotted free housing and healthcare facilities and subsidised ration, Dhanuka added.																								The Ficci team also appraised Bhattacharjee of its forthcoming programmes.

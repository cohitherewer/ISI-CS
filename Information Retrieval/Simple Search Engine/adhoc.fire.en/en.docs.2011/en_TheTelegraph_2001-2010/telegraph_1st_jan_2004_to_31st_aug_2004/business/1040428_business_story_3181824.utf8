 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, April 27: The fierce competition among national oil companies seems to be leading to an excessive number of petrol filling stations in the country.																								Bharat Petroleum chairman-cum-managing director S. Behuria said here today that in the last two years, the public sector oil companies had set up over 4,000 petrol pumps. The race was still on as another 2,400 retail filling stations have been planned this fiscal.																								As a result, the average sales per petrol pump have come down from 200 kilo litres per month to 165 kilo litres per month, a fall of almost 20 per cent.																								Behuria said oil companies would have to probably close down some of the loss-making filling stations and relocate others. 																								However, the national oil companies will not be allowed to close all the filling stations in the remote areas as the government has made it mandatory that at least 10 per cent of the new outlets have to be set up in such far-flung regions to supply petro goods to consumers.																								The competition among the public sector oil companies has picked up after the deregulation of the petroleum sector and for the first time branded petrol and diesel has been introduced in the market.																								With private sector companies such as Reliance, Essar and multinational Shell also having obtained permission to set up retail chains, the public sector oil companies have stepped up the pace of opening new outlets to make things more difficult for the new entrants.																								The public sector oil companies have a head-start as they have already occupied all the prime locations in the metropolises, large cities and big towns. There is no more space in these hot spots for new entrants to move in.																								It was for this reason that there was hectic lobbying by the private companies for the privatisation of IBP, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum. Some of these private companies have set up large refining capacities but do not have retail sales outlets. The easiest way out for them is to take over the lucrative public sector companies.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 7: Indian industry is upbeat over the 10 per cent industrial growth target set by the government. However, a spike in interest rate, decline in public investment and apprehensions about a year-on-year sustained growth are some factors that continue to bother corporate honchos. 																								Sunil Kant Munjal, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said, Despite significant improvements in the competitiveness of Indian industry over the last decade, industrial growth has not exceeded 6.4 to 6.5 per cent in the last two years.																								The share of manufacturing in GDP, which is currently as low as 17 per cent, needs to be increased urgently. Investment in manufacturing must be stepped up by giving the right signals to the investing community, he added. Expressing concern about the decline in public income in the farm sector, he urged for private sector participation in rural economy. The reforms path includes rapid development of agro-processing sector and legislative changes to help create a common national market in agriculture product, Munjal said.																								Welcoming the action agenda proposed in the survey, Ficci president Y. K. Modi said, We are gratified that the survey has placed high priority to overhauling the tax regime and the need for addressing the roadblocks in the way of Indian industry.																								Assocham president Mahendra K Sanghi suggested that the government should focus on means of curtailing high and unproductive administrative expenditures. 																								PHDCCI president Ravi Wig doubted whether monsoons would be good for successive years. He was also worried about the Centre-state deficit, which is 10 per cent of GDP, and inflation.

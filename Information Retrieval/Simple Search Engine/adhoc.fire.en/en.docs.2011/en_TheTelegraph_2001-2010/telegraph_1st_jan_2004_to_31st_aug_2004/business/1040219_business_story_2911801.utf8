 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Singapore offers trade prop
																								New Delhi, Feb. 18 (PTI): Reflecting the Aseans growing interest in India, Singapore today expressed its desire to be the main trading hub for the country in the same way as Hong Kong was to China for its trade with South East Asia.																								The analogy of Singapore becoming for India what Hong Kong is to China is very relevant and we are working on the modalities to achieve it, visiting trade and industry minister George Yeo said today.																								Asserting that the contentious issue of rules of origin in the proposed free-trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries would be sorted out soon, Yeo said, The talks are in the final stage and the FTA would be implemented by the middle of this year. Stressing that financial services, education, tourism and healthcare offered strong commonality of interests, Yeo said India should improve flight connectivity and infrastructure facilities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Tough bargain on revenue sharing in tea 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Budding hope 																								Calcutta, April 26: The tea industry has appealed to the Union commerce ministry against the governments decision to share tea sale proceeds between small growers and manufacturers on a 60:40 basis.																								The government directive has become effective from April 1. 																								The industry appreciates the governments efforts to ensure a fair deal for growers when the money from the sale of leaves is shared. However, the 60:40 formula specified for the eastern and northeastern tea-growing areas seems unfair. 																								The big tea manufacturers in this region own gardens and procure leaves from growers in very small quantities.																								These established tea gardens with factories to process their leaves and manufacture tea buy leaves from growers for four reasons. These are: If the processing capacity is more than the availability of leaves from their own gardens; if the availability of tea leaves falls short in a particular year; to bring down the cost of tea by using a cheaper variety and to meet their commitments within a time frame.																								Suresh Bansal, president of the Tea Association of India, said, We feel there is an anomaly on the price sharing formula. Therefore, we have approached the commerce ministry to reconsider the matter.																								Bansal said, Tea manufacturers who own tea gardens put in their very best through all the stages of leaf plucking, manufacturing and marketing in order to obtain the best possible price for their finished product.																								In the letter submitted to the commerce ministry, the association has said that the credits for better price realisation should go to the manufacturer instead of the growers who simply sell their green leaves.																								In these days of liberalisation, specifying a formula for sharing prices would be anachronistic. The association would, therefore, request you to leave this matter to the market forces to decide in strict conformity with the supply-demand position, the letter added.

 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Shipping boss in the dock over data row
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 How well anchored are we?																								New Delhi, May 10: Shipping secretary D. T. Joseph has pulled up the director general (DG) of shipping for causing a major embarrassment to the country by furnishing wrong information to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on the reception facilities available at Indian ports.																								Sources say the shipping secretary brought up the issue at a meeting held here recently. He is reported to have issued instructions that the DG should doubly check information before sending it to the IMO so that there are no embarrassing contradictions between the ground realities and the data provided to the agency.																								Sources say the shipping secretary is also of the view that there is excessive concentration of power in the Mumbai-based office of the DG shipping and there is a need to delegate some of these powers to the offices at other ports. This issue came up in connection with the drawing up of new efficiency parameters to evaluate the performance of Indian shipping.																								Joseph is keen to develop better dry docking facilities at Indian ports so that more foreign ships can come in for repairs. At the moment, the picture is so dismal that even big Indian ships go to foreign shipyards for repair.																								Shipping ministry sources disclose that the DG shipping has been asked to draw up a new dry docking policy for the country on a high priority basis. The policy is expected to set minimum standards that have to be maintained at Indian dry docks so that ships calling at Indian ports are confident that they can get reliable service.																								With the exception of Cochin, all the other 20 shipyards in the country are either running into losses or merely breaking even. Due to a lack of orders, the present capacity utilisation of Indian shipyards ranges from a meagre 20 per cent to 50 per cent. Indian shipping companies such as SCI and Great Eastern have also placed their orders for new ships with South Korean shipyards. These companies also send their larger ships for repairs outside the country as the indigenous shipyards are too small.																								The shipping ministry is keen to reverse this trend. It has been estimated that an outlay of Rs 2,800 crore would be required for upgrading the existing shipyards in the public sector over the next 10 years, while the private shipyards would need an investment of Rs 1,200 crore.																								The ministry has earmarked Rs 200 crore for modernising the Hooghly Dock and Port Engineers Ltd.

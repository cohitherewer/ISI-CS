 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 9 : The government of Myanmar has agreed to let Gail and ONGC-Videsh pick up a stake in the A-3 offshore exploration block that was originally awarded to Daewoo International Corporation of South Korea. 																								The Indian companies had got the green signal during discussions with the Myanmar government and Daewoo last week in Yangon. Both Gail MD Proshanto Banerjee and ONGC-Videsh MD RS Butola participated in the talks.																								The Indian consortium expects a sizeable stake in the block which is situated adjacent to another gas bearing block  A1. However, the commercial terms of the agreement are being worked out.

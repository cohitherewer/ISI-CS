 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Strategy session for Sao Paulo trade meet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 9: The group of ministers on WTO met here today under the chairmanship of defence minister Pranab Mukherjee to draw up the new governments strategy on contentious trade issues to be taken up with the West, including the $4-billion US subsidy on agriculture.																								The ministers will place their proposal tomorrow before the cabinet committee on WTO headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which will give the finishing touches to the strategy. 																								The hectic exercise comes on the eve of the Unctad meeting to be held at Sao Paulo in Brazil from June 13-18 where commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath will lead the Indian delegation.																								The Sao Paulo meeting is considered important as it is a precursor to the WTO general council meeting likely to be held in Geneva next month in an attempt to break the deadlock following the collapse of the Cancun talks last year.																								Kamal Nath told reporters that India was committed to protecting the national interests and livelihood of its farmers and the broad strategy was being fine-tuned in view of the new EU-US proposals on agriculture.																								The thrust of the countrys stance would remain the same and the changes that were being made to the strategy were to address the issues that arise in the light of the EU-US proposals																								Mukherjee, who had led the Indian delegation to the Marakkesh meet in 1994 that established the WTO, is considered to have a good grasp of the subject. Similarly, finance minister P. Chidambaram who attended todays meeting has also dealt with the issue during his earlier stint as commerce minister.

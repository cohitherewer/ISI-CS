 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Alls not well																								Mumbai, March 2: Outsourcing may not be cheap after all. Companies save less than they think from offshoring due to hidden costs, an Hewitt study says.																								The study adds to the rising political and societal tensions in the western economies over outsourcing. 																								While leaders in many companies are satisfied with their global sourcing efforts and will continue to invest aggressively in offshoring, they must do a better job of addressing human capital costs and issues to maximise value, a recent study by Hewitt Associates  the global human resources outsourcing and consulting firm  said. 																								For example, less than half of the companies analyse the tax environments of considered countries. Only three-fourths measure the impact on supply chain costs and only 34 per cent assess the cost of plant or office.																								Mark Arian, corporate restructuring and change practice leader for Hewitt Associates, said, Its economics 101. 																								In the early rush to migrate to lower-cost centres, companies have been grabbing people to fill seats. As a result, the supply of workers greatly exceeds demand. However, demand will quickly catch up, he said.																								As their operations mature, companies that have invested heavily in offshore markets will see projected profits disappear if they have not explored issues like scaling, future opportunities for labour arbitrage, developing leaders and retaining workers, he added.																								Among the challenges listed by Hewitt are people-related expenses, including training needs and cultural issues. These issues are generally not examined when companies decide on outsourcing their work.																								Hewitt found that most companies (88 per cent) evaluate labour costs and analyse potential return on investment (79 per cent). However, less than four in 10 analyse the local economic / political climate, and only a one-third routinely examine the impact of global sourcing initiatives on the community or other stake holders (34 per cent).																								Fewer still (32 per cent) look at the impact of employee/union representation considerations at home or in the location to which they will be moving operations.																								With more than three-fourths of companies indicating that their global sourcing arrangements are permanent, its clear that global sourcing is a fundamental and permanent change in the way business is conducted, added Arian.																								Many companies are choosing to build an infrastructure in their new locations and add services as needed. However, for most companies, the model is still new so there are challenges, especially in the areas of accurately assessing costs and concerns around talent.																								Hewitts study showed that the percentage of jobs being outsourced will almost double in the next three years with an average of 13 per cent jobs at each company currently relocated and an additional 12 per cent considered for relocation within the next three years.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 27: After slashing its pre-paid tariffs, Hutch has followed up the act by extending the same benefits to its post-paid subscribers. 																								The new tariffs will allow post-paid users on the Talk 150 plan to make local calls to any GSM mobile at 99 paise per minute and long distance calls for Rs 2.25 per minute to GSM, fixed and WLL phones. 																								All existing and new users can avail of the scheme by paying a monthly rental of Rs 25 for each subscription.																								Those who do not want to avail of the special rates, will still pay a lower rate of Rs 1.69 per minute for local calls instead of the existing Rs 2.49 per minute. Long distance calls to all phones  GSM, fixed and WiLL  will be charged at Rs 2.99 per minute irrespective of distance. Earlier STD calls cost Rs 2.99 and Rs 4.99 beyond 500 km. 																								The new tariffs are applicable for Mumbai, Calcutta and the south.																								The move less than two hours of BSNL announcing major tariff cut for its post-paid users.																								Speaking about the new Hutch flat rate tariffs, chief marketing officer Harit Nagpal, said, It is difficult for subscribers to differentiate between Hutch and non-Hutch numbers, especially with the allocation of the new numbering series in all circles. To avoid confusion, Hutch has introduced uniform rates for all mobile calls within the same circle and all long distance calls within the country. 																								Hutchison Essar has licenses for 13 circles in India.

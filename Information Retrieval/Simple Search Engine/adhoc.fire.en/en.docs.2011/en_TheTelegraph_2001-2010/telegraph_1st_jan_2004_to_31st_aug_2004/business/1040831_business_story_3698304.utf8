Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 30: National Insurance Company Limited has taken a hit of Rs 152 crore for providing claims liability to Reliance Infocomm during 2003-04. The net profit has sharply gone down by 47.23 per cent to Rs 71.23 crore against Rs 135 crore in 2002-03.																								In May last year, NIC had entered into a three-year contract with Reliance Infocomm to provide cover against loss of wire sets. The contract also included transit and default cover. Reliance Infocomm paid a premium of Rs 64 crore to NIC, which had to settle claims of Rs 152 crore, mostly against default bills. The total number of claims settled by NIC is 1.32 lakh.																								Chairman and managing director H. S. Wadhwa said, The claims liability of Reliance Infocomm is not the lone factor for reduced profitability. We have provided for Rs 57.50 crore against our voluntary retirement scheme. NIC has also provided for Rs 1,258.71 crore for its unexpired risk in 2003-04 compared with Rs 1137.88 crore in 2002-03, in the process adding Rs 120.83 crore to its reserves.																								Wadhwa said NIC has already purchased reinsurance cover known as alternate risk transfer (ART). But the company could not avail of the relief as the auditors are not comfortable with the ART concept.																								The NIC management has decided to take up the matter with the statutory authorities. National insurer GIC has already accepted the obligatory reinsurance cession related to the Reliance business, which is going to provide financial relief to NIC under this head.																								According to the reinsurance contract, the claim liability of Rs 152 crore is spread over four years and the annual net liability will not be more than Rs 40 crore. Under the contract, the recovery from reinsurance will be effective in excess of Rs 30 crore, subject to a limit of Rs 123 crore.																								Wadhwa said in the current fiscal, they have not received any claim from Reliance as the company has shifted to pre-paid mobile schemes. 																								Last year, NIC had received a premium of Rs 186 crore from the entire Reliance group.																								The company has earned an investment income of Rs 662.69 crore in 2003-04. The company aims to earn a premium of Rs 4360 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 3423 crore in 2003-04.																								Gipsa plan																								The General Insurers Public Sector Association (Gipsa) has appointed A. F. Ferguson to carry out a study of manpower in the four public sector insurance companies and work out a strategy to grow in the face of the tough competition from private players.

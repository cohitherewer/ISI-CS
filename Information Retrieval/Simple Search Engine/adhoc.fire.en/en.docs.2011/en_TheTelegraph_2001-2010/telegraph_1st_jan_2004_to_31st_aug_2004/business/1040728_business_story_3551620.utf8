 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Common minimum garb on plan panel projects
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Finance minister P. Chidambaram with Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, July 27: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has asked the Planning Commission to re-prioritise projects in line with the governments national common minimum programme (NCMP). 																								Chidambaram held discussions with Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Other members and advisers of the panel were also present.																								We discussed the issue of rearranging priorities and providing enough money to achieve NCMPs objectives. The allocation of the additional spending of Rs 10,000 crore (announced in the recent budget) was also discussed, Chidambaram, said.																								Other prime suggestions from the finance minister includes revitalising the role of the think tank and re-allocating funds from the redundant schemes that can be weeded out. 																								The finance minister has also suggested that some centrally-sponsored schemes be transferred to the states. Implications of an expanded sarva shiksha abhiyan, mid-day meal scheme and food-for-work-programme were also discussed at the meeting.																								Chidambaram said the government wanted the Planning Commission to think ahead and advise on what the government should do in the next budget. quot; 																								The finance minister said, quot;No radical changes are immediately possible but it can be expected by the end of next year.																								Ahluwalia has said the Rs 10,000 crore given to the Planning Commission for allocation to various agencies was sufficient. 																								Ahluwalia said, Schemes which are more efficient will be given more funds. We also discussed transferring mid-day meal schemes to the states while retaining other welfare programmes for the Centre to implement.																								Many of these issues have been informally discussed earlier between the new plan panel, which includes Montek Singh Ahluwalia and members such as Syeda Hamid, Abhijit Sen, Anwar-ul Hoda and ministers who are ex-officio members.																								The government is keen to ensure that restructuring of the plan is politically acceptable as it could otherwise ignite a spat with alliance partners.

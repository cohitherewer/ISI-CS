 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Iron ore exports to China surge
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, May 23: India has become the second largest exporter of iron ore to China during the first three months of 2004. The country exported 13.4 million tonnes, a rise of over 60 per cent compared with the exports in the corresponding period last year. 																								Australia continued to be the largest exporter of iron ore with 18.1 million tonnes during the period under review compared with 13.5 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year. 																								The other key supplier this year is Brazil at 10.4 million tonnes.																								In March alone, China imported 19.1 million tonnes of iron ore. Its total imports in the first three months of 2004 were almost 51 million tonnes, 48 per cent up, says Jim Lennon at Macquarie Research-Metals and Mining.																								The sharp increase in iron ore exports from India to China has raised quite a few eyebrows in the domestic steel industry, which is in dire straits following Chinas drastic cut in coking coal imports to India.																								While we have been liberal in exporting our iron ore to China and Japan, we are scouting madly for coking coal and coke, an industry watcher said. 																								China, which used to export about 12 million tonnes of coking coal till about a year back, exported only 2 million tonnes last year much to the crisis of the Indian steel companies.																								State-run companies like Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam (RINL) have been forced to cut down production only due to lack of coal supply.																								A proposal has been made to the government for some kind of barter arrangement with China, whereby coking coal can be made available against iron ore. A move, which even the countrys largest private sector steel plant, Tata Steel, has been considering. 																								The country is home to worlds finest iron ore which can be used for getting coking coal. But unfortunately, it has always been a one-way traffic which goes against the countrys fortune, felt steel industry insiders.																								Iron ore exports used to hover around 29 to 38 million tonnes per year until 2002. But ever since the Chinese demand picked up, total exports have gone up phenomenally from India. 																								The countrys installed capacity for iron-ore production is expected to rise to 135 million tonnes from the existing 90 million tonnes at the end of the Tenth Five Year plan. The total demand, during this period, has been estimated at 122 million tonnes.

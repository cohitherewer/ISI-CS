 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 HR leasing comes of age
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, July 19: Next time you are recruiting for a short-term project, dont waste your time taking interviews. Get in touch with a human resource outsourcing company that will provide you with the right kind of people.																								The $140-billion HR outsourcing industry is looking at India to tap the huge manpower potential here.																								The first step is to sign up clients and study their requirements. The second step is head hunting through our internal database and online job sites that are also our channel partners. The third step is to finalise the team for the client and prepare a legal tripartite agreement according to the pay scales and HR policies of the client, said Ashok Reddy, managing director of TeamLease, the only Indian company in HR leasing.																								The Bangalore-based company has already acquired 6,400 associates and plans to cross the 15,000-mark by March next year. It caters mainly to four verticals  ITeS or BPO, manufacturing, FMCG or retail and financial services, which includes banks, mutual funds and insurance companies.																								TeamLease clients include Dr Reddys, Sify, Ingersoll, Pfizer, Dupont and Reliance Infocomm.																								Globally 2-3 per cent of the workforce is leased, says Reddy. With just 6,400 associates, we have just scratched the surface of the barrel.																								Global companies like US-based Manpower, UK-based $4.3 billion Kelly Services and 16.3-billion euro Adecco have all made their presence felt in India.																								Around 55 per cent people are deputed for sales and marketing, 15 per cent for finance support, 15 per cent for customer support and the remaining in engineering support and services.																								Almost 15-20 per cent of the people get absorbed into the company they work for. 70-75 per cent were shifted between projects and 10 per cent may face a lag period, he said.																								We do not maintain a bench and do not charge customers a mark-up to sustain one. The general confidence is that the broad client base and multiple assignments would enable us to seamlessly move people from one assignment to another.																								Speaking on service charges, Reddy says it is structured as a percentage of the CTC (cost to company) and varies between 10 to 25 per cent.

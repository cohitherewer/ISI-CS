 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Twist in will war: Birlas want receiver
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug 12: New fronts are opening in the battle of wills between the countrys first business family and its once-trusted chartered accountant. The Birlas, along with their friends, today filed in Calcutta High Court a suit for the appointment of a receiver who would look after the assets of the MP Birla group while legal skirmishes in the inheritance battle continue.																								K. K. Birla, G. P. Birla, Kashinath Tapadia (brother of the late Priyamvada Birla) and Pradip Kumar Khaitan are party to the petition, which is primarily aimed at keeping R. S. Lodha from interfering with the assets that have been left to him in Priyamvadas purported will.																								The Birlas have closed ranks against Lodha to fight his claim that Priyamvada bequeathed all assets of the MP Birla group to him. Lodha has already moved a petition to have the will probated (authenticated) and lodged another plea to get caveats from the Birlas quashed.																								Though there was no confirmation from the Birla family on the filing of the suit, sources in Calcutta High Court said they had done so. The move is part of the game-plan for a protracted legal battle. The matter will come up for hearing sometime next week, the source added. 																								This is the first legal salvo fired by the Birlas since the inheritance row erupted. So far, they had only been filing caveats and affidavits, the source said, adding the inclusion of people not directly related to the family is significant. 																								In the suit, the Birlas have argued that the assets of the MP Birla group could not be vested in an outsider like Lodha. According to the source, the family is categorical that Lodha has no right to the property till the matter is settled. Therefore, a receiver is a must. 																								On Wednesday, Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad, and Yashovardhan filed affidavits in response to a petition from the Lodhas to have their caveats rejected.																								The filings were made in accordance with an earlier order of Justice Kalayanjyoti Sengupta of Calcutta High Court in connection with the controversy over of Priyamvadas will. The Birlas argued that though the management control was clearly delineated in group companies, they were part of the larger family. They are also believed to have sought a court order rejecting Lodhas claim to execute Priyamvadas will.

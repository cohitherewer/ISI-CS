 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 New plants to raise SPS output
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 18: The Calcutta-based SPS group is setting up two greenfield steel plants in Orissa and Himachal Pradesh for Rs 430 crore to raise capacity from one lakh tonnes to four lakh tonnes.																								Of this, Rs 380 crore will be spent on the Jharsuguda plant in Orissa, which will house a sponge-iron making unit, billet caster, power plant, blast furnace and rolling mills. In Himachal Pradesh, the group plans to set up a billet caster and rolling mills with an initial investment of Rs 50 crore.																								The group eyes a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore by 2005-06 compared with a turnover of Rs 300 crore achieved in 2003-04.																								SPS group managing director Bipin Vohra said the first phase of the new facility at Jharsuguda will be completed in 2004-05, while the project in Himachal Pradesh will be started once the entire land is acquired.																								Currently, the group is in the process of acquiring land in both the states, he said.																								SPS Sponge Iron Ltd, wholly-owned by the SPS group, has planned a public issue sometime in July to raise Rs 40 crore to improve the debt-equity ratio. The company will charge a premium of Rs 10 on the face value of Rs 10 per share, Vohra said.																								In the first phase, the company will spend Rs 122 crore in Jharsuguda to set up the sponge-iron making facility as well as the billet caster. The power plant, blast furnace and rolling mills will be set up in the second phase, expected to be completed in the next one year.																								The company is also setting up a ferro-alloy unit in Jharsuguda in a joint venture with Motex India. The total investment for the project has been estimated at Rs 80 crore, Vohra said.																								The group has decided to enter into the mining sector and has already applied for iron-ore mines in Orissa and coal mines in Bengal and Jharkhand. Vohra said having own mines will help the group source its raw materials at ease and help increase the margins.																								The group will use the facility in Himachal Pradesh, which will have a capacity of one lakh-tonne of finished products, to tap the lucrative market in the north. The company is also investing substantially in its original plant in Durgapur to double the sponge-iron making facility to two lakh tonnes. Besides steel making, the SPS group is set to enter into building construction sector in a big way starting with projects on over 7 lakh square feet area in and around Calcutta.

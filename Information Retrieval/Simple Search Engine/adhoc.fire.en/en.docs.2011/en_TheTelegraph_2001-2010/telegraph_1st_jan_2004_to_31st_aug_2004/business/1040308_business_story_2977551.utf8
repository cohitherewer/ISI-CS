																								RECENT SALES FIGURES of private insurers indicate unit-linked insurance policies are stealing the march over traditional with-profits life policies. And to catch up with the trend, insurance companies  including Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)  have lined up a series of unit-linked products for launch over the next few months.																								A unit-linked insurance policy can be loosely described as one that offers a life cover, but functions like a mutual fund. In such policies, the premium is invested in a fund of the investors choice after deduction of charges. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) requires unit-linked policies to offer investors a choice of three funds: debt, balanced and equity.																								In a debt fund, the premium is invested entirely in bonds, while in an equity fund, the premium goes only into shares. Premium paid into a balanced fund is invested in both shares and bonds. The beauty of unit-linked policies is you can watch your money grow.																								In case of death ahead of maturity, the nominee receives the higher of the value of the fund into which the premium was invested or the sum assured.																								These policies offer the same income tax rebate as traditional policies  if you are looking to save tax they are just as good as the policies of yore.																								Private insurers like ICICI Prudential Life, Birla Sun Life, Om Kotak Mahindra, HDFC Standard Life and Aviva have been offering unit-linked insurance policies from the beginning. The players joining the bandwagon now are Tata AIG and LIC. While Tata AIG is in unveiling its new unit-linked policy, Invest Assure, next week, LIC proposes to introduce two in a few months.																								At present, LIC has only one unit-linked policy in its portfolio  Bima Plus. Whereas Bima Plus is a 10-year policy, the new ones will have a longer maturity  say 30 years. LIC says, one of the new policies will be a pension plan.					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

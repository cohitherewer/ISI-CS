 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Govt issues seven-year bonds to UTI
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 23: Bonds worth Rs 362 crore have been issued today to the Unit Trust of India comprising the assured return schemes, which will help meet the shortfall in redemption of these high-interest bearing instruments.																								The UTI bonds would be issued at par to the administrator of Specified Undertaking of UTI for meeting their liabilities arising on account of shortfall in assured return schemes, said a government statement.																								The bonds would carry an interest rate of 6.1 per cent for a term-period of seven years. The investment in the UTI bonds would not be reckoned as an eligible investment for the purpose of statutory liquidity ratio, the statement added.																								UTI was divided into two in August 2002, after repealing the UTI Act of 1964 as there was a cash shortfall which led to the fund being unable to meet redemption pressures.																								While, UTI-1 comprises assured return schemes numbering 15, UTI-2, now known as UTI Mutual Fund, is composed of the net asset value schemes and is run by an asset management company.

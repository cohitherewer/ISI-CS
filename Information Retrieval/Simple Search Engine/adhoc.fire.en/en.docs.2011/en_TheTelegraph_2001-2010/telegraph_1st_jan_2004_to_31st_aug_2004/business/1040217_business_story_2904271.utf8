 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Reliance seeks Naiks help
																								New Delhi, Feb. 16 (PTI): Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today petitioned petroleum minister Ram Naik against state-owned oil companies plan to cut purchases from its Jamnagar refinery by over 60 per cent from the next financial year due to the increase in public sector refining capacity.																								RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani met Naik seeking a two-year extension of his companys agreement with state-owned oil retailing firms after the current one expires next month, official sources said here.																								State firms  Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and IBP  plan to cut diesel, petrol, LPG and kerosene purchases from Reliance to just 4.3 million tonnes in 2004-05 from 11.3 million tonnes of fuel bought during the current fiscal, due to the expansion of Mumbai refinery of BPCL and Chennai refinery of IOC and recognition of Mangalore refinerys full capacity.																								Both Naik and Ambani refused to discuss the deliberations of the meeting.																								That (extension of product purchase agreement with RIL) is to be done by the oil companies. Negotiations are on and I am sure issues will be resolved, Naik said.																								Ambani, who also had a 30-minute discussion with petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi prior to his meeting with Naik, said Our executives are on the job.																								Lower product offtake by state-owned oil firms will force RIL, which is yet to put in motion its ambitious retail network of 5,849 petrol stations, to tap the unlucrative export market.																								RILs main concern is diesel, whose purchase the state-owned firms plan to cut to just 1.3 million tonnes from the current 6.2 million tonnes.																								Sources said public sector oil companies plan to take just 0.3 million tonnes of petrol and kerosene each and 2.4 million tonnes of LPG from RILs Jamnagar refinery next fiscal																								This fiscal, they are lifting 0.6 million tonnes of petrol, 2.3 million tonnes of kerosene and 2.2 million tonnes of LPG.

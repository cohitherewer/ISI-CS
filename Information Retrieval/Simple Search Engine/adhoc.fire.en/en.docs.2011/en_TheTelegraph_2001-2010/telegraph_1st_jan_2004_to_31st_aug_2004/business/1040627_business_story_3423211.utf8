 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 For new CSFB boss, client is god
																								New York, June 26 (Reuters): Brady Dougan, who is replacing ousted John Mack as chief executive of investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston, has spent the last four months visiting far-flung staffers and selling them on a plan to double profit by 2007. On Friday, he came in from the cold.																								Dougan addressed throngs of CSFB bankers in a town-hall style meeting held in the firms auditorium in New York on Friday morning  one day after Wall Street learned of Macks removal and Dougans ascendance.																								Mack did not attend, even though he technically heads the firm until July 12. A source familiar with details of the shake-up, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mack had been surprised not only by the timing of the boards decision to remove him, but also by Dougans promotion.																								But according to people who were present, Dougan praised Mack for having returned CSFB to profitability and sketched out his vision for strengthening the firm in the months ahead.																								In March, Mack essentially demoted Dougan, dispatching him to various offices around the world to act as messenger for a strategy to boost profit. It was a role Dougan didnt want and it prompted Dougan to consider other options, including starting a hedge fund with bankers from Goldman Sachs.																								Brady said we need to focus on clients, and we need to be able to go out there and reassure them that they are our number one priority, said one of the sources who attended Dougans address.

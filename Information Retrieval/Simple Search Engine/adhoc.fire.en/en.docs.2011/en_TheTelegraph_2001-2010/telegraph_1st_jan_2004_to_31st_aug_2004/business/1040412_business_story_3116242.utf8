 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 H-P zooms in on small enterprises for growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 11: Hewlett-Packard India (H-P) is realigning its strategy to gain a major share of the estimated $1.5-billion small and medium business market.																								Currently, H-P has a market share of around 30 per cent in the small and medium business segment and 14 per cent across all categories. We expect the market share to go up to 35 per cent and the addressable share to 17 per cent in the next three years, said Sameer Dhingra, country manager, small and medium business, Personal Systems Group (PSG).																								IDC projects a 19-21 per cent growth for the Indian small and medium business market, while H-P has been growing at around 25 per cent.																								The company has adopted a multi-pronged approach to trigger growth. H-P is restructuring itself into a segment-led organisation rather than a product-led one, explains Dhingra.																								H-P has categorised itself into four major divisions  customer solutions group, image and printing group, total solutions group and personal systems group.																								The customer solutions group will focus on end-user products. Imaging products like printers will come under the purview of the image and printing group. The retail chain will also be supervised by this group. The total solutions group will focus on high-end customers, consultancy and storage business. The personal systems group will concentrate on developing the small and medium business market and also build the channel network.																								We have already identified 300 cities to add to the distribution area list in the next three years. We are in the process of identifying channel partners from within the existing base and also strengthen the corporate sales force, said Dhingra.																								H-P plans to pick partners from the unorganised sector also, which has a 60 per cent presence in smaller towns and cities.

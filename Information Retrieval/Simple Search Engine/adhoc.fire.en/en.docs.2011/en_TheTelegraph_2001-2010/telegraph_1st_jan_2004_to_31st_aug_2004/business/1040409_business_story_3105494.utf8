 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Software stars shower bonuses 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 8: Wipro Ltd today announced that its board would consider a bonus issue on April 16, even as MphasiS BFL recommended an additional share for every share held. MphasiS also declared its fourth quarter results.																								These moves follow Infosys Technologies announcement that its board would consider either a bonus issue or a stock split on April 13. Stock market analysts have similar expectations from Infosys and Wipro  a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1. Wipro will also consider fourth quarter results on the same day.																								The announcement by Wipro saw investors scrambling for its shares, which opened at Rs 1,475, reached an intra-day high of Rs 1,550 and ended at Rs 1,464.80, registering a gain of Rs 48 over its previous close.																								However, MphasiS BFL shares did not attract too many buyers. While the bonus announcement was initially received well by the market, the share came under heavy selling pressure as its fourth quarter earnings turned out to be below expectations.																								The MphasiS share opened at Rs 599, shot to an intra-day high of Rs 660, but ended at Rs 574.50, registering a sharp loss of Rs 20.85 over its previous close.																								The company posted a lower net profit of over Rs 18 crore for the quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 19.97 crore in the year-ago period. Revenues, however, increased to Rs 64.9 crore from Rs 56.45 crore in the same period.																								The group posted an annual net profit of Rs 98.5 crore (Rs 66.92 crore), while revenues increased to Rs 580.5 crore (Rs 429.26 crore).																								MphasiS chairman and managing director Jerry Rao said while software net margins have been maintained at over 20 per cent for the second consecutive year, BPO services revenue and profit growth continue to be robust.																								The company has projected a 45 per cent growth in net profit and 40 per cent in revenue for the year ending March 31, 2005.																								The group added 12 new clients, including one in the BPO services segment.																								The total headcount in the group was 6.278, an increase of 1,049 in sequential quarters. While onsite billing rates increased marginally, offshore rates were kept at last-quarter levels, the company said.

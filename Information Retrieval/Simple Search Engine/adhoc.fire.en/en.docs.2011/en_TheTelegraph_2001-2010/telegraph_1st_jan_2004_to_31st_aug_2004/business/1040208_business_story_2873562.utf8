 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 Paper industry in $1bn clean-up act
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 7: The Indian paper industry needs to invest around $1 billion in the next five years to comply with the global environmental norms agreed upon at the Kyoto protocol. 																								The industry has already signed a corporate responsibility agreement with the Union forest and environment ministry to conform to the new environmental norms by 2008. This means investing in new technology worth $1 billion, said Pradeep Dhobale, president of the Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association (IPPTA).																								The industry has already started implementing stringent environmental norms in a cost-effective manner. However, it feels that the government should provide fiscal incentives in terms of tax and excise exemptions.																								About 400 delegates from within the country and abroad took part in a two-day seminar on environmental technologies and management in the pulp and paper industry here. The seminar, organised by the Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association (IPPTA), discussed the challenges the industry is facing in terms of funding, technology, raw materials and customs duty. Experts presented 27 technical papers on different aspects of the paper and pulp industry.																								Manab Mukherjee, Bengal minister for environment and information technology, said that to adhere to the global environmental norms the industry needs to maintain high cleanliness standards in the production process. Otherwise they would have to close down, he added.																								The industry has demanded the immediate clearance of a new forestry policy that will give mills access to vast areas and wastelands for pulp wood plantations. Only three states  Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh  have started offering wastelands to the industry for plantation. 																								Dholale said the industry had initiated a dialogue with the Prime Ministers Office, the Planning Commission and the forest and environment ministry to adopt a national policy for making land available to the industry. He said this would make way for huge rural employment all over the country.

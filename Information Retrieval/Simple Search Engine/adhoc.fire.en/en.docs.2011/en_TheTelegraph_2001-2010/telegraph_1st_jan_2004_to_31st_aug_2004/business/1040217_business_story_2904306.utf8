The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 NRC plot up for grabs
 ANIEK PAUL																								Calcutta, Feb. 16: G. P. Goenka-controlled NRC (previously called National Rayon Corporation) has decided to sell off or develop, in partnership with a leader in the real estate business, a 400-acre plot it owns in Kalyan near Mumbai.																								Property brokers say the plot could fetch up to Rs 400 crore in an outright sale, and that could well be the biggest real estate deal this year. NRC chairman G. P. Goenka refused to quote a price.																								Real estate prices in some areas of Mumbai, especially the suburbs, have gone up by as much as 50 per cent in the last one year  thats a big jump.																								Hence, we decided to sell off the 1.25 crore square feet plot (400 acres to be accurate) we own in Kalyan, or develop it in partnership with a leader in the (real estate) business  whichever gives the best value, Goenka told The Telegraph.																								At present, NRC is trying to establish which of the two possibilities will be most profitable for the company. Goenka said the management was discussing both the possibilities with the big boys of real estate in Mumbai.																								The G. P. Goenka group ran into rough weather following the collapse of its fertiliser business from which it used to earn over Rs 800 crore.																								The group flagship Duncan Industries has not been able to repay thousands of fixed deposit holders and is persuading institutional lenders to restructure its debts. The sale of the property at Kalyan would significantly boost its financials.																								Stock market operators appear to have got a whiff of NRCs plans. A Mumbai-based broker and jute baron Arun Bajoria have been accumulating shares in the company over the last few months. Both have substantial interests in real estate.																								Goenka, on the other hand, has pared his stake in the company. He has over the last two months sold 34 lakh shares in NRC, and owns 57.61 per cent of the companys shares at present, down from 67.15 per cent in mid-December.																								Market mavens were speculating on a partnership amongst the three  Goenka, Bajoria and the Mumbai-based broker  for developing the property in Kalyan. The stake acquisition in NRC, Lyons Range sources said, was part of a larger deal that involves the 400-acre plot.																								But Goenka denied. He said: Yes, I am told that some big brokers have been snapping up shares from the market, but I have no formal agreement with them. If they have any interest in becoming a partner in developing the property, they are welcome to make a formal offer.

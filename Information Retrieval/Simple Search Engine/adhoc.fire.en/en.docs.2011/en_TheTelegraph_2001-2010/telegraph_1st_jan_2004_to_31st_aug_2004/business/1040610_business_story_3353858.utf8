 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Reliance Energy sets buyback price at Rs 525
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 9: Reliance Energy Ltd (REL) today fixed a maximum price of Rs 525 for its share buyback plan, for which it will spend up to Rs 350 crore.																								However, the buyback price fell below market expectations of over Rs 600 per share, which was the price at which a preferential allotment was made to two foreign institutional investors. This resulted in the REL scrip plummeting Rs 20.55 or 3.8 per cent to 540.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.																								The share opened at Rs 565, hit an intra-day low of Rs 516.55 and closed at Rs 540.05, with 11.76 lakh shares being transacted.																								The buyback price is at a 12 per cent premium to Rs 463 per share on May 31, the day on which a notice to consider share buyback was issued to stock exchanges.																								The buyback will reduce outstanding shares and consequently increase earnings per share and improve return on net worth and other financial ratios.																								Addressing shareholders at an annual general meeting, chairman and managing director Anil D. Ambani said the board is considering an initial allocation of up to 10 per cent, which is roughly Rs 350 crore. It is not necessary that we have to spend the full amount, he added. The buyback provisions allowed the company to employ more than Rs 2000-3000 crore.																								The annual general meeting was marked by protests outside the venue by consumer groups demanding a reduction in tariffs and a few employees asking for better work climate.																								To develop environment friendly power sources, REL is planning to implement up to 500 MW of wind-based projects in phases in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.																								RELs proposed capacity will constitute more than 20 per cent of the total installed capacity of wind energy in the country, which is around 2,400 MW at present, he said. REL is also exploring hydro projects in Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Arunachal Pradesh.																								On the recent order of MERC whereby REL will receive a refund of around Rs 373 crore, Ambani said, The order is a vindication of our stand that Tata Powers claim for sharing of standby charges in the ratio of 50:50 was untenable.																								The company will deploy a substantial portion of its total resources to create assets at the grassroots level, with capital productivity and cost competitiveness receiving the highest emphasis. REL will also build new assets at per unit capital costs that are significantly lower than the global peer group ensuring superior life cycle returns on its investments.

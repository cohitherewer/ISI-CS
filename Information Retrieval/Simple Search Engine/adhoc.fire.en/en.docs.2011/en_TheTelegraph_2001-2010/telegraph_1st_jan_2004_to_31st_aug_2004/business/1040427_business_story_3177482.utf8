 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Hindalco net profit up 21% at Rs 222 cr
 OUR BUREAUX				 	 Birla: Growth gains																								April 26: Hindalco Industries has reported a 21.31 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 222 crore for the fourth quarter of 2003-04 compared with Rs 183 crore in the year-ago period.																								While revenues from its aluminium business leapt 25 per cent to Rs 874.3 crore (Rs 698.2 crore), the copper segment generated Rs 1,028.7 crore, a 62 per cent rise over the corresponding quarter last year.																								Managing director D. Bhattacharya said the company is now planning to expand its copper smelting capacity to 5 lakh tonnes from 2.50 lakh tonnes at an investment of about Rs 1,200 crore. The expansion is likely to be commissioned in the next 24 months.																								Bhattacharya said its copper business acted as a drag on the quarterly performance, which could have been better otherwise. This was largely due to a stagnant local demand which hit domestic need for copper.																								Bhattacharya said the demand-supply gap of 2 million tonnes with a major growth in China would have a positive effect. While a growth of over 5 per cent in global demand is expected during this calendar year due to the economic recovery, domestic demand is also expected to improve with the power sector playing an important role.																								Bhattacharya said at a time when the domestic demand for copper has been disappointing, the company could successfully weather this difficulty by increasing volumes and using a competitive cost structure. The cost of producing the metal is now almost one-third of its original cost.																								The global demand for aluminium is poised to post around 6 per cent growth, he said. Apart from international market, the outlook in the country is also encouraging. Aluminium consumption is expected to grow by 7 per cent this fiscal due to a strong demand from the electrical, transport and construction sectors.																								Hindalco will now leverage the synergies with subsidiary Indal, acquiring additional copper and bauxite mines apart from evaluating various growth opportunities in aluminium through organic and inorganic routes. 																								Analysts here expect Hindalco to express its bid when the government invites strategic investors for Nalco.																								For the year ended March 31, 2004, the company posted a net profit of Rs 838.9 crore, up from Rs 582.1 crore in the previous year. Net sales jumped to Rs 6,190.9 crore (Rs 4,985.6 crore).HCL Tech payout																								HCL Technologies today announced a 100 per cent dividend for the third quarter ended March 31, 2004. The infotech major has reported a 58 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 125.81 crore during the reporting quarter.																								It had announced 100 per cent dividends each for the previous two quarters.																								The companys gross revenue was up 39 per cent at Rs 647.24 crore during the quarter, a company statement said.																								HCL Techs consolidated net income stood at Rs 125.8 crore during January-March 2004 against Rs 60.3 crore a year earlier, posting over a 100 per cent growth. 																								However, sequentially, it dropped by 64 per cent over Rs 351.3 crore reported in the October-December quarter.

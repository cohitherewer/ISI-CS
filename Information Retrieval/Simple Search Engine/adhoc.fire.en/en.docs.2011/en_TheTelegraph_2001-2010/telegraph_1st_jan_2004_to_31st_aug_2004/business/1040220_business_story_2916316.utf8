 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Private insurers lobby for primary market access
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 19: The private insurance companies are hopeful that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)  the stock market regulator  would soon register them as qualified institutional bidders, paving way for them to invest in initial public offering (IPO) of shares.																								Shikha Sharma, managing director of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance  the leading private insurance player in the country  said the industry was lobbying the stock market regulator for registration as qualified institutional bidder.																								And though the market regulator has agreed to allow private insurers to invest in the primary market, it has not issued a formal clearance yet.																								We expect Sebi to allow us to invest in IPOs soon, but its unlikely to happen ahead of the issues opening next week, she said.																								Life Insurance Corporation of India  the state-owned insurance behemoth  however, is registered as a qualified institutional bidder.																								The insurance industry is witnessing a discernible shift in investment appetite with more people seeking to invest money in shares. Insurance companies now allow investors to decide which assets to invest their funds in.																								Six months ago, a little over 50 per cent of the money went into 100 per cent debt funds, about 15 per cent into pure equity funds and 35 per cent in balanced funds (or those that invest half in shares and the other half in bonds). But now, about 50 per cent goes into balanced funds and 35 per cent into pure debt funds, Sharma said.ICICI Prudential																								Shareholders in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance  ICICI Bank, which owns 74 per cent, and Prudential, which holds the rest  are set to invest Rs 50 crore more towards the firms equity capital to fund growth in business. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has an equity base of Rs 625 crore at present.																								The proposed infusion of funds will not change the ownership pattern. But even after the government has allowed domestic investors in insurance firms to divest stake in favour of foreign partners, ICICI Bank might not be willing to dilute its holding in its life insurance subsidiary, Sharma said.

 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Year-end rush for insurance plans wanes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 4: Insurers report a mad scramble for insurance policies in the last quarter of every fiscal (January-March), but the seasonal spike is just beginning to wear off a bit.																								Ideally, insurers would like to even out the seasonal variations over the year but a lot of bunching up at the end of the year occurs when people scurry to beat the tax axe. They reckon that education and aggressive marketing could change the mindset of the people. No one denies the end-of-the-year syndrome in insurance buying  but many insurers say the sharpness of the spike is tending lower.																								The seasonality factor of buying insurance policies at the fag end of the year is still there. It will not change soon. But the trend certainly shows that masses have started realising the fundamental behind purchasing an insurance cover. In years to come, one will see the number of people rushing for insurance at the year-end going down significantly, said Shikha Sharma, managing director, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.																								While insurers unanimously agree that motivation behind purchasing an insurance policy for most is tax saving incentive instead of risk protection, they believe the answer to the problem of seasonal variation is right education.																								Industry sources said that Life Insurance Corporation of India, earns nearly 45 per cent of its new premium business in January, February and March.																								A senior official from a private insurance firm said, The volume of new business achieved by LIC during the fourth quarter have already dropped by a percentage or two.

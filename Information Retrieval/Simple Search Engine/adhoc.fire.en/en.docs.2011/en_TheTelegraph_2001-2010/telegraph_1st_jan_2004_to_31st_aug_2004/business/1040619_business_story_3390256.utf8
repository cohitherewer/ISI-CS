 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Maran ready to ring in telecom policy revamp
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Maran: Time for change																								New Delhi, June 18: Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today hinted at a review of the telecom policy and a possible initiative towards convergence.																								Inaugurating the Cellular summit 2004: Expanding the cellular market, Maran said, It is now almost five years since the New Telecom Policy 1999 was announced. The telecom environment has changed and the service-specific licensing framework is giving way to unification of licences. New areas and services are emerging everyday.																								The policy has to take notice of the rapidly changing telecommunication technologies and communication requirements and define a roadmap for the future, Maran said.																								The minister also asked private cellular mobile operators like Bharti and Hutch to extend their networks to rural population on a priority basis. While assuring the private cellular industry about the governments support in terms of tax concessions and other sops for their growth, the minister reiterated the need to bridge the digital divide.																								It is important to provide telecom facilities in rural areas so that villagers have access to information necessary for their day-to-day working, Maran said.																								In fact, the impact of telecommunications would be more pronounced in areas that lack communications facilities. Telecommunication facilities can considerably alter their conditions, he said.																								He said the government and private operators were morally bound to provide universal access to telecom services at affordable prices. The minister pointed out that it would be difficult to bring everyone in the country within the reach of a telephone unless both, the government and private sector, work together. 																								Our starting point must be to recognise the fact that digital divide has to be bridged by making telecommunication revolution reach every corner of India at affordable prices.																								The minister expressed concern about the quality of telecom service offered by private and public sector telecom firms. 																								I receive complaints from consumers on the reliability, quality of service and billing. It is the customers who judge the industry and their satisfaction should be our goal, he said.

 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Special Asian rating for reinsurers 
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, Aug. 12: Asian re-insurers are working on a plan to introduce a rating system to facilitate business between different countries in the continent.																								We are trying to make optimum utilisation of the capacity in Asia and bring latest technical knowhow to reinsurers here, said General Insurance Corporation chairman P. C. Ghosh. 																								India, China, Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia have agreed to the proposal. An Indian rating agency will present the modalities of the rating procedure to all other Asian countries. 																								We had given the option to all the Indian rating agencies and CARE went for it, said Ghosh. CARE will formulate the basis of the rating system.																								Asian reinsurance companies have a tough time getting business from developed countries. Most of them are assigned very low ratings by Standard and Poors because of the overall poor sovereign rating of the countries to which they belong.																								GIC has been assigned an A (excellent) rating by AM Best  an international rating agency, and AAA by CARE for its strong asset base and large reserves. AM Best has also assigned similar high ratings to other Asian reinsurance companies. 																								Thus, a special rating system for the Asian countries will help them conduct business with each other.																								In 2003-04, GIC posted a profit of Rs 1,038 crore with a total business income of Rs 4,000 crore. The company paid a 30 per cent dividend, which amounted to Rs 67 crore. The company is projecting a growth of 10 per cent for the current financial year.																								Although GIC is the sole reinsurer in India, it is gearing up for a liberalised insurance market in India, where the presence of multiple reinsurers would be taken for granted. 																								GIC is trying to create a larger clientele base so that it emerges as the preferred reinsurer and insurers opt for it by choice.

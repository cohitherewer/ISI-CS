 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Tyre makers gear up for price hike
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, April 27: World rubber prices are expected to remain firm due to limited supply and strong demand  a situation that will prompt tyre manufacturers to raise prices.																								Natural rubber prices, which have risen nearly 33 per cent from last years prices of Rs 39,170 per metric tonne to Rs 58,000 per metric tonne, are projected to rise further.																								The shortage of rubber supply will continue as the demand graph is more than the supply side, said Ajay Kapila, vice-president of J. K. Industries Ltd. 																								What we plan to do is raise prices by around 5 per cent since it is not possible to pass on the entire cost to consumers, he said.																								Analysts foresee a shortage of natural rubber supplies in the near-term and said demand from emerging countries like India, China, Brazil and Russia would support these higher prices.																								Equally worrying is the depletion of rubber stocks in the country, which could lead to a possible stock-out position, seriously affecting tyre production and leading to a further spurt in natural rubber prices, said Raghupati Singhania, chairman of Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association.																								Natural rubber constitutes around 42 per cent of raw materials required for tyre production  an industry worth $2.2 billion and comprising around 70 per cent of bus and truck tyres.																								Apollo Tyres Ltd, which recently tied up with Europes largest tyre maker Michelin, also said the rise of natural rubber prices has affected the companys profitability. We plan to increase prices by around 7 per cent which would come into effect from next month onwards, chairman and managing director Onkar S. Kanwar said.																								Most tyre manufacturers profitability has been affected by the rise. Margins are under tremendous pressure which would partially be offset by higher volumes, said Kanwar.																								In the third quarter (Oct-Dec) of the year ended March 31, 2004, Apollo posted a 25 per cent rise in sales to Rs 390.02 crore from Rs 310.95 in the year-ago period.

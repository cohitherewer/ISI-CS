 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Leash on current accounts
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 watch tower 																								Mumbai, Aug. 24: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked banks to ensure more discipline in case corporate customers or big borrowers approach them for opening current accounts. 																								Generally, a consortium of banks provide credit to corporate customers or big borrowers. Sometimes a multiple-banking arrangement is also worked out to fulfil their credit needs.																								In a notification issued today, the central bank clarified that banks will have to inform the consortium leader (where there is a consortium) or the banks concerned (in case of multiple-bank arrangement) when corporate borrowers approach them for opening current accounts.																								RBI said banks might allow prospective customers to open current accounts in case no response is received from the bankers or the leader of the consortium within a fortnight. 																								According to the central bank, if a response is received within a fortnight, banks should assess the situation on the basis of the information provided by the bank concerned. 																								RBI, however, clarified that banks need not seek a formal no objection from the consortium leader or the banks concerned.																								Banks are advised to be guided by the need for effective due diligence in these matters as also the objective of customer satisfaction and ensure that suitable arrangements are in place for prompt and serious attention to references received from banks in this regard, it said.																								In a separate circular, pertaining to dematerialisation of primary dealers (PDs) investment in equity, the central bank said they should convert all their equity instruments into dematerialised form by December this year and thereafter make all fresh investments only in dematerialised form. 																								In an earlier circular, the central bank had directed the PDs that they should hold bonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in dematerialised form. In case of equity instruments, it was then advised that it would be permitted to be held only in dematerialised form from a date to be notified by the Reserve Bank in consultation with Sebi.																								RBI later decided, after consulting the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), that PDs should hold all their equity investments only in dematerialised form by the end of December 2004.

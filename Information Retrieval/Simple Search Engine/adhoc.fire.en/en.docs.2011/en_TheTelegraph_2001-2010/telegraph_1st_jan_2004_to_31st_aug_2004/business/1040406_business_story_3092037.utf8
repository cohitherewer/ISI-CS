 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Khaitans rope in Big B to recharge Eveready
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL The biggest USP in town 																								Bangkok, April 5: Eveready Industries India Limited has roped in Amitabh Bachchan to promote its range of batteries and torches. The deal, struck a few days back, was announced at a conference of the companys sales team here on Sunday.																								According to vice-chairman and managing director Deepak Khaitan, it is a two-year deal between Big B and Eveready. Khaitan did not disclose the amount that would be paid to Bachchan.																								We will rebuild our brand Eveready, which will be hundred years old in 2005. It is the largest brand in the lead-acid battery segment in India and Big B is the best vehicle for promoting it, he said. 																								With the appointment of Bachchan, Eveready will divert almost the entire advertising and promotion budget towards television and other media channels. He, however, made it clear that the company would not engage Bachchan in events, including public appearances. It would be too costly. Also, it will be difficult to draw up a schedule. We had a half-an-hour meeting and it took some time to organise that, Khaitan said.																								On Bachchans request, his photograph will not be used on product packaging. However, it might be used on more than 1000 Eveready vans that distribute products in India. In the mid-nineties, Eveready launched its first major advertisement campaign with the famous slogan Give me red. 																								According to Khaitan, Big B is acceptable all over India and this deal will provide a major boost to Eveready. Brand Amitabh Bachchan actually transcends all barriers in India to encompass the north and the south. He appeals to both the young and the old. This quality is needed to promote the Eveready brand. This is why we signed him up, he added.

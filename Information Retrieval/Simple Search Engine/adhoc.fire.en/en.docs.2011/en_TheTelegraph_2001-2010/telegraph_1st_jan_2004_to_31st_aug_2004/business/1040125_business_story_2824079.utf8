 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Jan. 24: Century Plyboards will float a rights issue to part finance its Rs 26.25-crore project to diversify into laminate manufacturing.																								Deputy managing director Sanjay Agarwal said the company would issue 19,51,152 shares of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 30 to raise Rs 7.8 crore. 																								The ratio for the proposed rights issue is two shares for every five shares held. Currently, the companys shares are hovering at Rs 50 per share on the Calcutta Stock Exchange.																								Agarwal added that State Bank of India has already sanctioned a loan of Rs 13.5 crore for the project. The remaining Rs 1 crore would be generated by internal accruals.																								The promoters have also decided to absorb the unsubscribed portion of the rights issue to complete the project in six to nine months.																								The company has submitted its proposal to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.																								We have become the largest plywood manufacturer in the country within two decades of our operation. We felt that we should go into other related areas, the most important being the laminate unit, Agarwal said.																								The laminate unit will be able to make two lakh sheets of Sunmica. Sunmica is used heavily in the furniture segment.																								Land for the laminate unit already been acquired. While the civil work is nearing completion, machines are being installed now, Agarwal said.																								Century is also planning to enlist on the National Stock Exchange, he added.																								Once the laminate project becomes operational, the companys target is to double its turnover in 2005-06 from this years expected turnover of Rs 130 crore. The company registered a turnover of Rs 115 crore in 2002-03. 																								The company has an advertising budget of Rs 6 crore for its brand building exercise, he said.																								Agarwal added that the company has plans to diversify to other items linked to building construction. It has already done a thorough market survey for a cement unit.																								It is too early to zero in on any particular industry. But we are looking at several things now, including cement. We would be able to give a concrete picture about our future diversification plan in the next few months time, he said.

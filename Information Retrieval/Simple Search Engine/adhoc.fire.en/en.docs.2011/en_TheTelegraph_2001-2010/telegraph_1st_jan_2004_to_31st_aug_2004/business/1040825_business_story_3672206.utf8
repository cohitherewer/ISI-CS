 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 New bank laws to be tough on defaulters
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 24: The finance ministry is readying amendments to two crucial banking laws  the Securitisation Act-2002 and the Debt Recovery Tribunal Act  which deal with corporate defaulters owing over Rs 1,00,000 crore to banks and financial institutions. 																								In his budget, finance minister P. Chidambaram had hinted at necessary amendments in the Securitisation amp; Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (Sarfasi) to help the banks recover their sticky assets.																								The government wants to ensure a time-bound process so that the banks can sell or liquidate the assets before they get devalued with time. The borrowers may be given 30 days to repay their dues or face seizure of assets, sources said. 																								The Supreme Court had struck down the provisions of the Securitisation Act which allowed the defaulter to pay 75 per cent of its dues before approaching the debt recast tribunals (DRT) for a review. The finance ministry is working on a scheme which will ensure that the defaulters do not get away with non-payment of dues, RBI sources said.																								The DRT Act is being strengthened so that banks can settle their dues at the tribunal level. A stringent time-frame for settling cases at the DRT level is being worked out. The borrower as well as the lender (banks and FIs) will have to work within a definite time frame, RBI sources said.																								A minimum deposit of 25 per cent of the dues may be made mandatory before a fresh appeal to the DRT. The government does want to adopt a soft stand on corporate defaulters at a time when a large number of farmers are reeling under debt burden and are literally paying back with their lives. 																								The amendments will be drafted in the light of the recent judgement of the Supreme Court in the Mardia Chemicals case. The government will not take any chances about cases of corporate default dragging on in litigations, RBI sources added. 																								The amendments will help a bank dispose of assets it has seized. A banks bad debt has a heavy bearing on its transaction costs, thereby affecting both their lending interest rates and profitability. 																								The government is assured that the Supreme Court judgement in the Mardia case is basically sound as it upheld the Securitisation Act, which allows the lender to serve a 60-day repayment notice to the defaulter. If the borrower fails to pay up, the bank can take over the company and its assets. In the Mardia case, the apex court had allowed the defaulter to go to the debt recovery tribunal for redressal before it paid up 75 per cent of its dues. 																								Senior bankers said, The Indian Banks Association has also approached the finance ministry to look into the Securitisation Act so that the banks can recover their sticky assets and show a cleaner balance sheet.

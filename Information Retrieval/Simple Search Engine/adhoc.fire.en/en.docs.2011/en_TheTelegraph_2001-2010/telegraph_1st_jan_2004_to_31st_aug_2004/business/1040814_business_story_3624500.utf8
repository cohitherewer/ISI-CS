 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Lodha: Stepping down																								Mumbai, Aug. 13: Lodha amp; Company today offered to step down as auditors of Indo-Gulf Fertilisers Ltd, an AV Birla group company, after which, the group announced its intention of appointing S. R. Batliboi amp; Company.																								These changes are seen as an impact of the feud between the Birlas and the Lodhas over the purported will of Priyamvada Birla. There are reports that the Lodhas will not be retained as auditors across the Birla group companies.																								Hindalco, an AV Birla group company, had voted the Lodhas out as branch auditors in its annual general meeting, while Grasim Industries allowed them to continue due to a short lead time.																								Recent unconfirmed reports said Harsh Lodha, the younger son of Rajendra. S. Lodha, will be asked to resign from the board of Indian Rayon and Industries, another AV Birla group company. 																								On the other hand, the BK Birla group has indicated that it would not retain Lodha as its auditor in two group companies  Mangalam Timber and Mangalam Cement.																								The annual general meeting of Indo Gulf Fertilisers, scheduled for August 10, was postponed as the board wanted to take a view on Lodha amp; Company continuing as its statutory auditor.																								One of the proposed ordinary resolutions at the meeting was the re-appointment of Lodha amp; Company as statutory auditors.																								In a communication issued to the bourses, Indo Gulf said, Lodha amp; Co, the auditors of the company, who had office till the conclusion of the next annual general meeting, vide their letter dated August 7 have expressed their desire not to offer themselves for re-appointment as the statutory auditors of the company, which is taking necessary steps to appoint another auditor in their place.

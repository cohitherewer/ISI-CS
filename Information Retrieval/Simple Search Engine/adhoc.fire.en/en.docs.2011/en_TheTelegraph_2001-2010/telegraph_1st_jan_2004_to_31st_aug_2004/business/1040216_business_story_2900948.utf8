The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 No room for new CellOne users
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 Harsh on the ears 																								Calcutta, Feb. 15: Calcutta Telephones has stopped giving new CellOne mobile connections due to a saturated network.																								The network capacity has been taken up by existing customers. It is not possible to add new subscribers and maintain proper service at the same time, said a senior Calcutta Telephone official.																								Currently, there are 26,697 CellOne subscribers of which 22,625 were there before the change of network from C-DOT to Ericsson switches.																								We have already received an allotment for network expansion, added the official. The capacity will be increased to accommodate one lakh subscribers. New connections are expected to be given from the first week of April, he said.																								Calcutta Telephones is also upgrading its infrastructure by adding 54 cell sites to the existing 87 at a cost of around Rs 32 crore.																								In July, the capacity is expected to be increased to accommodate another 25,000 subscribers, for which funds have already been allotted.																								The demand for CellOne connections, the cheapest GSM service after the rate-hike by AirTel and Hutch, has increased considerably. This is evident from the list of subscribers who have already paid Rs 500 to enlist for the service.																								Officials said people from the fringe areas of the city are more interested and the list is likely to get longer with CellOne stopping new connections. Calcutta Telephones is also beefing up its distribution network. The company has two distributors to set up retail shops across the city.

 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Escap sees slowdown in growth 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 16: The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (Escap) today forecast a slowdown in GDP growth for fiscal 2004 at 6 per cent.																								However, the study says that GDP growth is expected to rise to 6.6 per cent in 2005 and to 6.7 per cent in 2006. Escap also revised upwards its growth projection for India to 8.1 per cent for fiscal 2003, from the earlier 7.5 per cent.																								The revision comes after taking into account the growth on the back of a double-digit farm sector growth in the third quarter, said Nagesh Kumar director-general, research and information system for the non-aligned and other developing countries, while releasing the economic and social survey for 2004. The Escap survey, prepared on the ba\sis of data available in December, had pegged Indias GDP growth at 7.5 per cent. It revised the growth figures subsequently to 8.1 per cent after collating the data of the third quarter (October-December) during which the economy clocked 10.4 per cent growth.																								The 8.1 per cent growth (revised) comes after a 4.3 per cent growth estimate for fiscal 2002. Escap has attributed the significant recovery in 2003 primarily to a bumper foodgrain harvest and sustained performance of the industrial and services sectors. Fiscal and monetary incentives in the budget for 2003 has also been named as a positive influence. 																								The survey predicts that inflation is expected to come down slightly. It has forecast an inflation rate of 4 per cent in fiscal 2004 against the inflation forecast of 4.8 for fiscal 2003. Inflation estimate of fiscal 2002 was also 4 per cent. The rate of inflation is seen to dip further to 3.5 per cent in 2005 and 3.0 per cent in 2006.																								The survey predicts a slowdown for the countrys agricultural sector as well. It says, Indias agriculture sector is expected to slow down after its impressive performance in 2003. The survey points out that India has achieved the highest growth rate in south Asian sub-region in 2003. 																								Escap has predicted a lower than average 6.2 per cent growth in the Asia Pacific region in 2004. This, even as Indias economy grew faster than the Asia Pacific region taken as a whole during 2003. It predicts that during 2005 and 2006, India will once again score more than the average growth of 6.0 per cent expected in the region.

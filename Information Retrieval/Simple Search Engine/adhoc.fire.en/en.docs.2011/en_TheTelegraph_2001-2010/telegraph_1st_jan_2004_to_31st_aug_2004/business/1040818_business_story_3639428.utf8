 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Heyer to leave Coke next month 
																								New York, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Coca-Cola Cos president and chief operating officer Steven Heyer will leave the company on September 1 after missing out on the top job in May, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday, citing an internal memo.																								Heyer has held talks with White Plains, the New York-based Starwood Hotels amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc, about becoming CEO, but no agreement has been reached, the newspaper said, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation.																								Coke announced Heyers departure from the company in early June, soon after E. Neville Isdell was named the replacement for Douglas Daft as chairman and CEO. 																								In a memo to Coke employees last week, Isdell said effective September 1, the eight executives reporting to Heyer would instead report to him, the newspaper said. 																								Between now and the end of August, Steve will continue to work on a number of projects that he and I have agreed he should finalise before leaving, Isdell wrote, according to the newspaper.

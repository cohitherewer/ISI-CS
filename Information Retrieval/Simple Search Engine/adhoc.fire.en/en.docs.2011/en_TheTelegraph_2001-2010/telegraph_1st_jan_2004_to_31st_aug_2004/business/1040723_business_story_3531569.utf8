 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Boost to housing finance mortgages
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 22: The Reserve Bank today allowed banks to include in their priority sector loans, investments in mortgage-backed securities for home finance.																								The relaxation follows representations made by banks. The central bank has, however, set some conditions. One of them is that the pooled assets should consist of direct housing loans which meet the priority-sector definition. Moreover, securitised loans should have been disbursed directly by housing finance firms.																								The mortgage-backed securities should also satisfy the conditions in the RBI circular issued in May 2002. The central bank says loans to be securitised should be those that have been given to individuals for acquiring/constructing residential houses. 																								These should have been mortgaged to the housing finance company by way of an exclusive first charge. The assets securitised this way should carry an investment-grade rating from any of the credit rating agencies.																								Securitisation is a process through which illiquid assets are packaged, converted into tradable securities and sold to investors not involved in the deal. Such securities are referred to as asset-backed securities (ABS).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Stock juggle hides the home truth
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Feb. 27: Stock shuffle spells double trouble.																								The government sent out a directive and the state-run financial institutions scrambled to scoop up shares of public sector firms that were being divested in the primary market.																								It restored a sense of calm in North Block, which went into a state of panic just two days ago when it appeared that the book-building process for the IPOs were in danger of collapse because of lack of bids.																								But there is a real danger now that some of that feel-good sentiment, which has been restored in the primary market, may be dissipated in the secondary segment of the capital market.																								Finance ministry officials now fear that the prop-up action ordered after a high-level meeting earlier this week, may actually scupper a key pre-election objective of the BJP-led central government: spread good cheer in the bourses to keep its middle-class voters happy.																								They fear that financial institutions, along with other significant players, have been selling holdings in scores of companies that do not make up the 30-share BSE sensitive index  the most widely regarded bellwether of bourse sentiment  to help prop up the primary market and to fund their buying operations, leading to high levels of volatility in the market. 																								We may be sucking out the feel-good factor in a bid to make these issues and the sensex shine, said senior North Block officials. 																								Otherwise sound firms like Thermax, Sundaram, Pfizer, Macmillan, Vadilal, ITCs International Travel House and Dhampur Sugar have fallen by as much as 4 to 10 per cent in the course of just one days trading even as the Bombay share index bounced up 100.39 points to close at 5,667.51 points, after slumping to its lowest close in two months, 5567.12 points, on Thursday.																								Trading volumes in shares, which do not impact the BSE index and which slumped today, were fairly large. Over 3.7 million shares in Tata Power were traded, 1.26 lakh shares in Pfizer, some 36,746 shares in Glaxo Smithkline and over 27,000 shares in Indian Hotels. 																								Companies that are lowly-weighted in the sensex were also traded in large volumes and ended up as losers. These include Hero Honda, rank 26, where over a million shares were traded, Hindalco (rank 22) saw 1.83 lakh share sold, while Dr Reddys (rank 28) saw 2.16 lakh shares traded. 																								Trading in SAIL shares was also huge which ended marginally down. However, the scrip saw two-way trading. 																								Independent merchant banker K. K. Sengupta says, There has been an attempt to support the sensex and a bid to prop up public issues of companies like Dredging Corporation and IBP and this seems to have led to sales in other scrips.																								Market analyst Prithvi Haldea said, Our markets are shallow and thin. Any significant trading leads to volatility. However, he added that only the market regulator could say who was responsible for the volatility.

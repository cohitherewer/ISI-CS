 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Escorts loan plan goes ahead
																								New Delhi, May 12 (PTI): Brushing aside opposition from Anil Nanda, the Escorts board today decided to go ahead with a plan to mortgage shares of Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre to raise Rs 100 crore. Anil, who had earlier described the move as illegal and wholly improper, did not attend the meeting, an Escorts spokesperson said.																								Anil, at loggerheads with his elder brother and Escorts chairman Rajan Nanda on the issue, said he would think about further steps. I thought I did the appropriate thing by sending a letter of dissent. I took a position six months ago, he added.																								The board put Anils letter on record before ratifying the decision of the borrowing committee, which had cleared the plan to pledge assets and shares of the centre with Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).

 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 ONGC, Gail revise offer documents
																								New Delhi, Feb. 4 (PTI): Following an assurance of support from Sebi, the government will submit to the market regulator, within a week, the revised offer documents for divestment of equity in six PSUs, including ONGC and Gail. 																								After a high-level meeting between disinvestment ministry officials, merchant bankers and legal advisers, it was decided that the public issues for sale of governments residual stake in IPCL and CMC would hit the market on February 16 and remain open till February 24.																								The ministry has opted to reschedule the time-table clubbing one big and one smaller PSU, while ensuring that no two PSUs from the same sector hit the market at same time, sources associated with the deal said. The time-table lists IBP and Dredging Corporation issues for February 26, which would close on March 2. The two oil PSUs ONGC and Gail have been slated for March with ONGC said to open on March 3 while Gail would commence on March 13.																								The regulator has asked the government to resubmit the documents for sale which have now been termed as sale documents instead of red herring prospectus.

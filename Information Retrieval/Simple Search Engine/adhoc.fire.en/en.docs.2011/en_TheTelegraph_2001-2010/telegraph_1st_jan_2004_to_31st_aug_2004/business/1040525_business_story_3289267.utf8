 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Soren holds out hope for shut collieries
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Coal, mines and minerals minister Shibu Soren in his office in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, May 24: Jharkhand leader Shibu Soren who took over as coal and mines minister here today said he will try to reopen shut collieries besides attempting to revive sick public sector firms under him.																								Soren, who feels the governments biggest challenge was to generate employment, said he would examine the techno-economic viability of collieries which have been shut down in Bengal and Jharkhand. 																								We cannot give up millions of rupees of investment just like that ... nor put so many people out on the streets. There has to be a proper evaluation, he said. 																								More than 200 collieries are shut in the region and this is a major cause for concern for the people in both the states.																								Soren, who was expecting the steel and mines portfolio, was stumped by last minute changes to accommodate Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan who had reportedly expressed his unhappiness with the chemicals and fertiliser portfolio that he was being given. 																								Paswan was given steel in addition to chemicals and fertiliser, while Soren had to take coal and mines. The tribal leaders close aides say he was unhappy at the prospect of having to run the coal ministry which they said he had described as potentially dangerous and rife with a level of corruption which he would be unable to cope with. Soren has been facing bribery charges in a case where it is alleged that he sold his partys support to the Narasimha Rao government for money.

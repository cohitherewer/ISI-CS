 RAJA GHOSHAL 				 Open book 																								New Delhi, Jan. 4: The long-standing demand of chartered accountants to allow multi-disciplinary firms seems to be a lost case as of now as the CA amendment bill does not address it at all.																								The council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) had been seeking permission for multi-disciplinary firms consisting of lawyers, company secretaries and cost accountants in addition to practising chartered accountants as partners to offer value-added services. 																								However, the government does not seem to be in a mood to agree to this for the time being. The cabinet recently cleared the proposal to introduce a comprehensive legislation that will amend the Chartered Accountants Act of 1949, Cost and Works Accountants Act of 1959 and Company Secretaries Act of 1980 to usher in greater transparency and to harmonise the rules governing these three apex professional bodies. The administrative machinery for all three is the department of company affairs (DCA).																								ICAI president R. Bupathy said, The multi-disciplinary firm agenda has not been addressed at all in the CA amendment bill, even though the Naresh Chandra Committee had mentioned it in its report. Those who know the world of accounting and auditing agree in one voice that multi-disciplinary firms should be allowed as it gives the clients a plethora of related services under one roof. It is beneficial for both the clients and of course, the firms. 																								Umesh Sehgal, partner in a Delhi-based law firm H. S. Sehgal and Associates, said, In the absence of legal multi-disciplinary firms, what happens is a nexus between lawyers, chartered accountants and company secretaries who refer their clients to each other.																								A multi-disciplinary firm can be a more profitable venture, where such network is structured into one service providing entity, said Sehgal. Another ICAI move, which has been scuttled is the corporatisation of the CA firms. 																								The CA firms could be corporatised subject to the government amending section 25 of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, ICAI had contended.

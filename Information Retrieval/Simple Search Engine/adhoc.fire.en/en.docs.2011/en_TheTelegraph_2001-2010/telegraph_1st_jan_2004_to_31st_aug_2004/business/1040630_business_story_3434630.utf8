 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 EPF panel for cut in payout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Cloudy forecast 																								New Delhi, June 29: A sub-committee of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) board today recommended a cut of 1.5 percentage points from the current payout of 9.5 per cent.																								The recommendation made by the finance and investment sub-committee is unlikely to be accepted by the EPF board, which meets tomorrow.																								The sub-committee, set up by the board of trustees of the countrys largest provident fund, said a higher return on this scheme is not in line with the lower interest regime and leads to a mismatch in the overall interest rate of 6-7 per cent offered on term deposits.																								The difficulty in offering a higher interest rate on EPF, which manages a corpus of more than Rs 90,000 crore subscribed by about 3 crore employees, is because 80 per cent of the fund is invested in the 8 per cent Special Deposit Schemes (SDS) offered by the central government.																								Currently, the earnings from investments made by the EPF stands at 9.1 per cent, slightly higher than the SDS returns because the remaining 20 per cent is invested in bonds which has a higher yield-to-maturity.																								The finance ministry has long been urging the EPF trustees to offer lower rates on member accounts in line with the government and central banks policy of soft rates but the trustees have been resisting moves to lower rates.																								Last year, the trustees rejected a finance ministry proposal to cut the rates, saying the scheme would continue to offer a higher rate of 9.5 per cent because it had enough reserves and earnings.

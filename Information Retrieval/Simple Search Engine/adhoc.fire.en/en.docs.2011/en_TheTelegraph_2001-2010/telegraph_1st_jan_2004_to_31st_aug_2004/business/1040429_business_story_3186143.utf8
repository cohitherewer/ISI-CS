The centre will employ around 2,000 people.																								Announcing the launch of the Indian operations, Cal Killen, vice-president, Unisys Global Services, said, It is our first offshore centre specifically set up as a cost centre for doing offshore work for Unisys clients.																								These plans form part of the companys expansion programme in the country.

The NYSE-listed company, which has 37,000 employees, has been present in India for many years working with third-party vendors such as Hexaware, NIIT and Tata Infotech. It operates with offices in Mumbai and Delhi. Its key clients include Air-India, State Bank of India and ICICI. 																								Unisys will recruit directly for its technology centre as well as through its local partners with a focus on highly qualified software engineers and data processing staff for business process outsourcing.

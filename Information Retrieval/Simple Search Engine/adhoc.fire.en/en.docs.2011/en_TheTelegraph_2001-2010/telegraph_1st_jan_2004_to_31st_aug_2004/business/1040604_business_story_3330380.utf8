 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Revisions on hold till June 15
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 2: The government is unlikely to raise the prices of petroleum products before June 15 and could even wait till the budget is presented in the first week of July. 																								Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today welcomed Opecs decision to increase oil production by 2 million barrels per day from July 1. The governments decision to wait before going in for a price hike based on the April-May prices of international crude has been vindicated by Opecs move, Aiyar said. 																								The Saudi Arabian ambassador who was present at the press meet said his country was committed to bringing down international crude prices to the $22-28 per barrel price range.																								Aiyar said the government expected international prices of crude to come down with the Opec decision to raise output and it would now study the exact impact before taking a decision on the domestic prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene.																								He said the normal practice among oil companies was to go in for a fortnightly price revision. Going by that yardstick, there was enough time till June 15 for the government to work out the impact of the Opec decision.																								The Indian prices of petroleum products have a significant amount of taxes, levies and cess built into them, which should be rationalised, he said. This fiscal component of the price of petroleum products will be considered in the budget.																								Aiyar said the coalition partners of the government and the Left parties would be consulted before a final decision is taken on the price issue. Their broad approach on the issue would also have to be incorporated, he added.

 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Dial M on mobile for telecom makeover
 M. RAJENDRAN Switching preferences 																								New Delhi, March 7: Come September, the mobile mania will have resulted in a telecom makeover with the number of cellphone users in India topping fixed-line users.																								The telecom transition will catapult India into the league of about 50 countries that have made the makeover, including Finland, Brazil, South Africa, and Sweden. At present, there are 31.4 million cellphone users and 52.5 million fixed-line users.																								The gap will further widen by 2008 with the fixed-line subscriber base touching the 55-million mark, while that of mobile phones will sprint ahead at 130 million. The increased value-added services on the mobile and data flow will provide the necessary impetus to the growth of the mobile market in India.																								ABN-AMRO executive director (telecom and media Asia) Vijay Chopra said, The elephant is on the dance floor and the band is playing a mobile tune. Get on that dance floor with the Indian elephant!																								Wireless has been the principal engine for telecom growth in the country as is worldwide. In India, the wireless subscriber base has galloped from 1.6 million in 1999 to about 30 million in 2004.																								During 1999-2003, two out of each new telephone subscribers were wireless. As a result, wireless accounts for more than 40 per cent of the total telephone subscribers at present against about 9.5 in 2000.																								According to telecom analysts, wireless subscribers are likely to grow exponentially with about 2 million new customers being added per month in 2005 to the 2.5-million base. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman Pradeep Baijal said, We stand vindicated about the growth of wireless in India. The trend of people going mobile will continue and decisions taken by the regulator that were criticised are being accepted as the instruments for growth for mobile phones and increase in teledensity.																								Nokia chairman and CEO Jorma Ollila lent credence to Trais claims. When we entered the mobile market we had a vision  voice goes mobile. Mobility will continue to play a fundamental role in the growth of telecom worldwide and especially in India. This is important as India continues to be one of the fastest growing markets for mobile phones.

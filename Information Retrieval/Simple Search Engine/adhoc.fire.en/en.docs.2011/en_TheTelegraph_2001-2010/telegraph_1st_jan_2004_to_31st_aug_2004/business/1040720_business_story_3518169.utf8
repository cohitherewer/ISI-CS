 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Competition act to be amended
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: The Centre today told the Supreme Court that it would amend the Competition Commission Act so that the body would not be headed by a bureaucrat.																								On this submission, the court asked the Centre to file its amended affidavit in six weeks and fixed further hearings after that.																								Attorney-general Milon Banerjee informed the court that statutory changes would be made keeping in view the courts observations made during the hearing on a petition challenging the legality of the act.																								The apex court had severely criticised the move to make a bureaucrat the head of the commission to discharge judicial functions. It indicated that only a judicial person could head such commissions.																								Commerce secretary Dipak Chatterjee was widely tipped to take over as the head of the competition commission on retirement  a move that now appears to have been scuttled.																								Banerjee said suitable changes in the law on the competition commission would be made and the new government is seriously considering the observations made by the court during the hearings on a petition challenging the law.

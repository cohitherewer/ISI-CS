 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Logic for Birla exclusion
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Arun Jaitley, who is representing the Birlas, at Calcutta High Court on Wednesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: Priyamvada Birla took great care to keep members of the Birla family and her relatives away from the assets of the MP Birla group after her death.																								After naming Rajendra Singh Lodha as her sole successor who would take over the management and ownership of the group in her purported will of April 18, 1999, she made a subsequent codicil (explanatory statement) on April 15, 2003, to avoid any confusion or ambiguity. The registered will had three witnesses  Madan S. Vaidya, P. L. Agarwal and Mahabir Prasad Sharma. 																								According to legal experts, the codicil, which Lodha has filed with his petition to authenticate the last testament of Priyamvada, will play an important role in the battle between the Birlas and the Calcutta chartered accountant.																								The codicil explains the rationale behind the exclusion by saying the MP Birla group was built by Priyamvadas husband, with his own business acumen and resources, and independent of the larger Birla family. 																								It is my keen wish that the MP Birla group continues to fly high on its own, without any future interference or involvement of any of my relatives, including the Birla family members and my brother K. N. Tapuriah, she states in the codicil attached by Lodha.																								From the four houses in her name to the charitable trusts, from the philanthropic organisations to her collection of paintings and other artefacts, Priyamvada details how she wants her assets to be managed by Lodha. 																								She even gives him instructions on how deities are to be kept. The deities may continue either in the four houses or may be shifted for regular puja elsewhere within the group, as you may think fit, the document states. 																								Her houses in Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi and Allahabad would be part of the MP Birla group. Lodha has been given the discretion to use, let out or dispose them, but Priyamvada makes it clear that the properties were not for use or occupation by her relatives. 																								I would clarify and reiterate that none of these houses are meant for use by any of the three sisters, Nandini (Nopany), Jyoti (Jyotshna Poddar) and Shobhana (Bharatia) and for whose benefit I have set up appropriate trusts, she wrote in her codicil. 																								Challenging the will  cited by Lodha as the last testament of Priyamvada  the Birlas said the couple wanted to use all their assets for charity. However, the codicil passes on the philanthropy baton to Lodha. It also gives him control of Bombay Hospital, the M P Birla Planetarium, Belle Vue Clinic and South Point School.

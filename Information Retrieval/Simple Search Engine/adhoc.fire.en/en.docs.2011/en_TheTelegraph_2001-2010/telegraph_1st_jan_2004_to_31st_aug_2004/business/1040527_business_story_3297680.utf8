 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Ford maps out small-car route
 SRINJOY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, May 26: Ford India Ltd, the local subsidiary of US-based Ford Motor Co, plans to launch a small car within the next two years, which is expected to compete with Toyota Motor Corps Daihatsu range.																								Its still on the drawing board but we plan to introduce the car by 2006, sources said. Although Fords expertise lies in the mid-sized car segment, the small-car plan is to counter Toyotas foray.																								Early last year, Toyota Motor Corp chief Sachio Yamazaki had said that the Japanese automaker may consider the models of its small-car subsidiary, Daihatsu, for the Indian market. 																								We are exploring various options for the best possible car for the Indian market, he said. The last model, which Toyota introduced in India, was the 1.8-litre Corolla at a sticker price of nearly Rs 10 lakh in January 2003. 																								Sources also said Ford India is currently working on a new-look version of the popular Ikon model. Ford continuously strives to increase the features on its cars while maintaining the price at its existing level. It also introduces new models, Vinay Piparsania, director of sales operations told The Telegraph.

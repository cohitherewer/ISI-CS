 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Panel to settle row over aircraft tax
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Patel: Peace-maker																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Congress-led government will set up an inter-ministerial panel to resolve the row over the proposal to slap a 48 per cent tax on lease rentals of aircraft, which has snagged plans by several airlines to rent aircraft and expand their services.																								State-run Indian Airlines plans to bring in about nine Airbus 320s, while Sahara has plans to bring in another four this year followed by an equal number next year.																								Both these airlines as well as the smaller airline  Air Deccan  have protested to civil aviation minister Praful Patel that the tax will make dry leasing and flying any kind of commercial aircraft unprofitable.																								Sources in these airlines say their chief executives as well as the head of Jet Airways met civil aviation officials today to discuss the issue.																								The losses that these airlines will have to bear because of this impost is being calculated at between $6 million to $25 million.																								Sources said these airlines have also approached the Prime Ministers Office and are also lobbying other cabinet ministers to see to it that the tax is rescinded.																								Only one airline is not hit by the impost  Jet Airways  as it owns its entire fleet and has no plans to rent any aircraft.																								IA has some 62 aircraft of which about 15 are leased. Both IA and its sister airline  Air-India  have plans to rent aircraft to take care of rising demand for air travel till it is able to buy new planes.																								The problem for these two state-run airlines is that though they have identified the aircraft they want to buy, the actual placing of orders will take a long time because the buys will have to be vetted by the government at various levels.

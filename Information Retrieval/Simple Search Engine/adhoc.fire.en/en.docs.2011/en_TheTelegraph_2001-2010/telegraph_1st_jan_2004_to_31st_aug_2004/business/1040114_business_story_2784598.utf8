 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Cheap-float sign sends petro shares on the skids
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Mumbai, Jan. 13: Shares  of oil and gas companies floundered today on the buzz that  the planned share offers of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation  (ONGC) and Gail will take place at a steep discount to the  market price.																								There are growing expectations that the government will offer its shares at rates much cheaper than the current price in a bid to lure as many retail investors as possible and keep the feel-good sentiment intact.																								This anticipation left oil stocks on the list of the days worst performers. The slide in BPCL, IOC, HPCL and ONGC shares dragged down the BSE PSU index, which finished in the red at 4189.76, a drop of 41.02 points.																								BPCL opened at Rs 511, but closed the session at Rs 483.60 against its previous finish of Rs 508; Hindustan Petroleum ended weak at Rs 460.70 compared with its previous finish of Rs 475.25. 																								Indian Oil was tottering at Rs 531.25 after opening at Rs 550.70, a Rs 16 loss over its last finish, while ONGC wound up at Rs 846.05 after starting at Rs 877.																								The Centre has been insisting that it will be able to offload its 10 per cent stake in Gail and ONGC by March. 																								It is not a strategic sale of equity. The government is only selling its 10 per cent stake to the public. Therefore, it is felt that this should be done at a price that is attractive for the retail investor, brokers said.																								There were even whispers of an ONGC share-split, a move that would make shares more affordable for the small investor, but officials later said it was not on cards. 																								The PSU pangs were not reflected in the BSE sensex, which still finished at a historic high of 6132.97. IFCI ripples																								The plan to merge IFCI with Bank of Baroda was greeted by a sharp spurt in the share price of the PSU bank. The excitement was heightened today by a bank statement indicating it would not be averse to the union. 																								BoB shares finished at Rs 249, up from Rs 242.20 on Monday; the IFCI scrip ended a tad lower at Rs 22.50, though it has been gaining after the merger buzz was heard.																								The government has said it would kick off the revamp of IFCI by first transferring its bad assets to an asset reconstruction company, and then merging the good asset-laden IFCI with a large nationalised bank.

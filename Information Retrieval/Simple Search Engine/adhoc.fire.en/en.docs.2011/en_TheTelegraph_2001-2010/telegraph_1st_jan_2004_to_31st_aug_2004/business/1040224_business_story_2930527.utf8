 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 SAIL plans to boost output levels
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 23: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is planning to add seven million tonnes of fresh capacity by 2010 to take its total output level to 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA).																								The company has constituted a high-level committee to prepare a business plan that will focus on strengthening the long and cold-rolled products in order to tap the niche market.																								SAIL director S. K. Roongta said that long products would continue to have a strong demand in the domestic market given the boom in the construction sector. At the same time, we would like to have a meaningful presence in the cold-rolled sector where we are currently not very strong, he said.																								Roongta hinted that the company is also planning to set up a state-of-the-art cold-rolling plant in its integrated unit at Bokaro.

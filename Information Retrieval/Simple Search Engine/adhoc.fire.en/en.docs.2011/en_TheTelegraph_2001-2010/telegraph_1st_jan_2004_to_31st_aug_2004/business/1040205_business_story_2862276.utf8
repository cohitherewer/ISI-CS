 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 S amp;P upgrades Tata Motors 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 4: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today raised its long-term corporate credit rating on Tata Motors to BB from BB- with a stable outlook. 																								S amp;P said the rating is based on sustained improvement in the companys businesses and finances since it suffered losses in 2001 and 2002. 																								In the past two years, Tata Motors has cut its operating costs, divested unrelated businesses, got equity infusions and halved its debt burden, the rating agency said. On December 31, the companys debt was Rs 1,700 crore ($374 million) compared with Rs 3,400 crore on March 31, 2001. 																								As a result, production levels required to achieve a breakeven have come down, it said. An improvement in the performance of Tata Motors has also been driven by 25-30 per cent growth in sales volumes in the past two years, partly due to the cyclical upswing in the commercial vehicles business. 																								S amp;P Asia-Pacific Corporate and Infrastructure Ratings Group director Sharad Jain said, Vulnerability of Tata Motors cash flows to a cyclical downturn in the commercial vehicles markets remains the main constraining factor in its rating.																								He, however, added that the financial impact of a cyclical downturn is expected to be less severe than that of the last one in 2001 and 2002. In April-December, Tata Motors posted revenues of Rs 10,630 crore and a net income of Rs 520 crore. 																								Although the domestic car market remains intensely competitive, the risks related to Tata Motors car business have lessened with an increased acceptance of Tata cars, Jain said. 																								Improvement in car sales also has partially offset the companys exposure to cyclical variations. Empirically, business cycle has had less effect on demand for cars in India compared with its effect on demand for commercial vehicles, S amp;P said.

 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Tata Chem net up 12%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 8: Tata Chemicals has posted a 12.18 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 220.53 crore in 2003-04 against Rs 196.58 crore in the previous year. However, its fourth-quarter net profit slumped 50.61 per cent at Rs 29.65 crore.																								Announcing the results, managing director Prasad Menon said, Our main businesses have done well.																								The board of Tata Chemicals has recommended a dividend of Rs 5.50 per share of a face value of Rs 10, resulting in a total payout of Rs 133.47 crore, up from the previous years Rs 112.08 crore.																								However, this years results cannot be strictly compared with that of the previous fiscal, as the merger with Hind Lever Chemicals Ltd resulted in a dilution of paid-up equity by around 19 per cent, he said. Net sales rose 66.36 per cent to Rs 2,544.15 crore for the year under review against Rs 1,535.27 crore in the previous year.																								These results have been achieved in a demanding external environment wherein prices of key commodity inputs such as coal, coke and ammonia as well as freight rates touched record highs, Menon added.																								Soda ash sales volumes in 2003-04 improved 3 per cent over 2002-03, enabling the company to sustain its leadership position with a market share of 33.3 per cent.																								Tata Chemicals total soda ash exports amounted to 128,000 MT, a 26 per cent increase over the previous financial year.																								Soda ash manufacturing operations were considerably impacted by record high prices and limited availability of key inputs like coal and coke. Menon said due to the high import dependence of some of these raw materials, this effect was further accentuated by the appreciation in ocean freight rates.																								Tata Chemicals is increasingly looking at expanding the number of products to retailers. The company recently launched test-marketing of cooking soda under the brand name, Samundar Cooking Soda, in the southern markets. It has now been extended to Delhi and Gujarat. The company is also offering crystal salts under the Samundar Crystal Salt brand. 																								Menon said the cooking soda market is currently monopolised by the unorganised industry. 																								Tata Chemicals is trying to brand the segment as a market leader in edible salt segment with Tata Salts market share standing at 41 per cent in 2003-04. It has lined up a Rs 250-crore capacity expansion plan that will include debottlenecking its Babrala-based fertiliser plant and setting up a new unit.

 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 AT amp;T exits, Idea gets new partners
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 1: A consortium led by Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte (STT) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd is set to acquire the 33 per cent stake held by AT amp;T Wireless Services Inc of the US in Idea Cellular in a deal estimated at about $250-350 million.																								The other two stake holders of Idea  the AV Birla group and the Tata group  are also likely to lose their hold with their stakes being reduced as and when the new partners bring in additional resources. Until then, the Birlas and the Tatas will continue to hold their 33 per cent stake in the cellular service provider.																								A broad agreement has been reached under which STT and Telekom Malaysia will jointly buy out the one-third stake of Idea Cellular. The transaction is expected to close in the next few weeks. The AV Birla group and the Tata group continue as shareholders in Idea, the cellular firm said in an official statement.																								The announcement is expected to help the companys plan for an early initial public offering (IPO).																								Sources in Idea said: The companys long-pending decision to enter the capital market through a public offering will be decided soon. The company is evaluating the proposal and a decision is expected to be taken after the formalities of this new development are completed.																								Idea Cellular, which acquired Escotel Mobile Communications Ltd and Escorts Telecommunications Ltd early this month, will have footprint covering 11 telecom circles and provide services to around 60 per cent of the countrys population.																								The company will have the incumbency advantage in as many as seven circles that would entitle Idea to an additional 2 per cent reduction in licence fees for four years from April 1, 2004, which has been granted only to the first and second incumbent operators in non-metro circles.																								Idea Cellular Ltd, formally known as Birla Tata AT amp;T Communication Limited, is the cellular operator in the circles of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi (Metro) under the brand name Idea. The cellular service was launched in the Gujarat circle in January 1997 and in the Maharashtra circle (excluding Mumbai, including Goa) in March 1997.																								Idea has proposed a capital expenditure of about Rs 1,700 crore for the next three years. The resources will be funded out of internal resources and debt. The company is bullish about its revenues and expects to generate revenues of about Rs 1,300 crore to Rs 1,400 crore during the current financial year. Idea expects to generate about Rs 350 crore additional revenues from Escotel.

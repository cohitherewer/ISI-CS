 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 MindTree Consulting lists growth areas 
 M RAJENDRAN																								Bangalore June 21: MindTree Consulting Private Ltd will focus on the health, automobile, fast moving consumer goods, telecom and financial sectors to develop products based on internet technology, web services, data warehousing and business intelligence.																								MindTree was launched in 1999 by 10 industry professionals of Cambridge Technology Partners and Lucent Technologies, led by Ashok Soota, who was then the vice-chairman and president of Wipro. The company now offers application management, including mainframe application development and maintenance.																								MindTree will develop applications that will help companies enhance their enterprise operations. It offers product-development services and designs reusable building blocks for high-tech companies. The international IT-consulting company delivers business and technology solutions through its global software development centres co-headquartered in Somerset, New Jersey and Bangalore. It also services its customers from Singapore, Japan, and West Asia. 																								Our strength is that our employees use their skills in technology, business analysis and project management to approach technology initiatives in a business context, said Krishna Kumar Natarajan, president and chief executive officer of IT services.																								With over 1,100 employees, MindTree has more than 165 customers across the globe. The companys major clients include, Alcatel, Avis Rent-A-Car, Elance, Franklin Templeton, Hindustan Lever, iSpheres, Mirapoint, PowerQuest, Sonoco, and Volvo.																								At MindTree, we have forged a distinct business culture we call OneShore. It describes both  how we serve our clients and how we view our company. It represents our method for global development that achieves a balance of quality, cost savings and localisation, said Natarajan. 																								For every client, the company builds a unified team of software engineers and business consultants who collaborate from start to finish on all stages of a project. It does not have separate camps of front-end and back-end specialists. In addition, projects are always managed on the spot, wherever its clients are located.																								Oneshore also reflects our company culture. We recognise that IT services firms cannot deliver quality and cost-and-time savings unless they commit to integrate disparate people, cultures, business processes and skill sets into a single corporate vision. OneShore represents a complete fusion of global\ resources that enables us to possess many locations, but one vision. And this approach delivers a consistent customer experience, said Natarajan.																								During the last few years, the company has also branched out into offering research and development services. It offers product realisation services to a wide range of industries using its experience and knowledge in diverse domains. 																								MindTree aims to help companies bring products to the market faster, through engineering expertise and re-usable building blocks, known as MindTree Incubated New Technologies (MINTs).

 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Flurry of gilt auctions lined up
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 29: The government today announced two auctions for Rs 8,000 crore  11-year floating rate bonds worth Rs 6,000 crore and 24-year securities for Rs 2,000 crore.																								The floating rate bonds will be issued on a par and will carry an interest rate calculated by adding a spread to a variable base rate. While the spread will be decided in the auction to be conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on July 1, it will remain unchanged during the currency of the bonds, a notification said.																								The variable base rate is the average yield at cut-off prices emerging in the immediate previous three auctions of the government of India 364-day treasury bills.																								According to the government, the base rate for calculation of interest for the first coupon period commencing from July 2, 2004 to July 1, 2005 according to this formula is 4.52 per cent. Thus, the annual rate of interest payable will be 4.52 per cent plus the spread determined in the auction.																								The base rate for the subsequent annual coupon periods will be announced by the central bank on or before the commencement of the related term.																								According to the March 25 notification, about 10-20 per cent of the total marketable dated securities issued by the government in the first half of 2004-05 will be in the form of floating rate bonds. Such bonds are seen to provide hedge against interest rate risk, offering returns linked to short-term yield.																								If the government of India 364-day treasury bill auctions are discontinued during the currency of the bonds, the base rate will be the average yield to maturity rates prevailing for one-year government securities as on the last three reporting Fridays prior to the commencement of the annual interest period, the notification added.																								The Reserve Bank said it would issue close to Rs 36,500 crore of market stabilisation securities in the second quarter of this fiscal.																								The central banks working group on instruments of sterilisation had recommended the setting up of a market stabilisation fund from the governments public account.

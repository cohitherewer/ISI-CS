 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Trai answers call for unified licence
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 23: The telecom industry could set a precedent if operators agree to Trais recommendations for an integrated unified licence regime.																								We have finalised the draft recommendations for a unified licence. To be placed for discussion next month, it proposes a single licence for all telecom services, irrespective of technology, Trai chairman Pradip Baijal said.																								This is the first time that a country is going in for complete unification. Some countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, have adopted a partly unified licence.																								The new regime would make all other licences redundant, integrating services like paging, NLD, ILD and internet telephony under a single authorisation and enhancing the scope of technology application, he said. Baijal, however, conceded that a number of issues have to be addressed before the changeover is implemented.																								Unified licensing aims at promoting growth of new applications and services through simplified procedures that give flexibility and lead to effective resource use. 																								Expressing concern over the 0.02 per cent broadband usage, Baijal said the regulator proposes to drastically reduce prices from the existing $15 per 100 kbps.

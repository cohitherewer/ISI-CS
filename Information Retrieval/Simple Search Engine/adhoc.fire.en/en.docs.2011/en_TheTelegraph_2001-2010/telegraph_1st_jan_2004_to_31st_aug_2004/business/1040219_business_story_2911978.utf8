 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Varishtha interest rate to stay at 9%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mathur: Keeping his word																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: The government is unlikely to change the 9 per cent payout on Life Insurance Corporations Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana.																								The scheme meant for senior citizens has received an overwhelming response. It will continue next year as well, along with the proposed Dada-Dadi bonds, LIC chairman S. B. Mathur said here today.																								Mathur said LIC has no plan to change the interest rate on the scheme. Any decision on the 9 per cent rate will be the governments prerogative, he told reporters at a conference on insurance. 																								Industry analysts feel that the rate on the scheme, launched as a populist measure by a government that now faces elections, will not be tinkered with at this stage. 																								Considering the overwhelming demand, the Centre recently hiked subsidy for the scheme to Rs 150 crore for 2004-05 from Rs 45 crore estimated for 2003-04. According to Mathur, the corporation has already received Rs 30 crore from the fresh funds support.																								The scheme drew 2.60 lakh pensioners who have contributed Rs 4,800-5,000 crore in premiums, which could touch Rs 6,000 crore by the end of this fiscal.																								Mathur said he would soon withdraw Bima Nivesh Triple Cover, the single premium policy, and re-launch it in March with new features.																								Bima Nivesh Triple Cover will be withdrawn on the last day of this month and re-launched as Bima Nivesh on March 1 to avoid any gap. The new policy will have an optional risk cover, said Mathur. LIC also plans to launch a unit-linked scheme on the lines of Bima Plus. We want to come up with more unitised products next year. 																								The scheme will help LIC meet its target of earning Rs 11,300 crore in first premium income and in retaining over 90 per cent market share this fiscal.IRDA warning 																								The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority today warned third party administrators (TPAs) against delayed settlement of health insurance claims and said rules will be tightened to ensure prompt payment.																								We can take action against those TPAs and the insurers can terminate them (in case they break the rules), IRDA chairman C. S. Rao said on the sidelines of the global conference of actuaries, organised by Ficci here.																								Asked whether IRDA would amend rules to ensure prompt settlement, Rao said, Definitely, we will tighten the rules.																								The onus for settling claims is on the insurers. If it is not done by TPAs, it has to be settled by the insurers, he said adding the regulator was discussing with insurers and TPAs the growing incidents of default in settling health insurance claims.

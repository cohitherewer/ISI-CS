 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Record set straight on stock deals
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 30: Deals on bourses will be recorded real time under a new system that kicked off in a limited way on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) today.																								Called straight-through processing (STP), the new regime will, in one fell swoop, do away with the rigmarole of receipts, verification and order matching.																								It will work wonders for institutions, which will see deliveries and payments completed within two days, instead of three at present. A relatively new concept that few markets have embraced so far, STP promises greater efficiency in tracking stock deals, besides reducing costs and minimising market risks that regulators have had to grapple with almost daily.																								The debut has been a cautious one, with Sebi deciding to make STP a must only for institutional deals. To cope with teething problems, it insists that physical receipts and documentation run alongside.																								Globally, bourses have implemented STP to track down transactions and have them processed as they happen. It facilitates seamless passing of financial information electronically, on a timely and accurate basis, to all those involved in a transaction, without manual handling of paper work.																								STP allows electronic capturing and processing of transactions, from origin to settlement, in one go. It will reduce transaction costs and settlement cycles, avoid duplication and set an audit trail, Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman G. . Bajpai said at its launch today. 																								The STP system will help exchanges graduate from the existing T+2 settlement to a T+1 cycle, though Bajpai said no time-frame has been fixed for the introduction of T+1. However, the gains of STP would be reaped fully only if real time gross settlement (RTGS) takes off soon. Many banks are in process of adopting this, and Sebi is in touch with the Reserve Bank to see how far they have gone.																								Straight-through processing could mean an end to a host of problems faced in processing trades. These include glitches arising from delayed receipt of conformation, manual matching, human errors and sending settlement orders.																								If adopted earnestly and implemented decisively, STP could change the face of Indian bourses, making them a bigger draw for the legions of foreign institutional investors. Overseas funds are known to not look only at opportunities that a country presents, but how efficient and risk free its bourses are for operators.

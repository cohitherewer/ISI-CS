 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Stitch in time: Singer forays into consumer durables
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: Singer India, which has been synonymous with sewing machines, has embarked on a major diversification exercise by foraying into the consumer durables market with colour televisions, refrigerators and washing machines. It has also entered the industrial machines market.																								The company was so far selling televisions at its Singer outlets only.																								From September last year, we have entered the multi-brand outlets and the company is soon going to enter the refrigerator and washing machines segment as well, said V.K. Murthy, product head for domestic and industrial sector machines. 																								Apart from consumer durables, Singer also has a home appliance range, which comprise mixies, grinders and food processors. Ultimately, we want to ensure that the turnover from the consumer durables business equals that of sewing machine business, said Murthy. 																								The industrial machines, meant to be used in the garment factories and production units, are already available in India. Until now, they were being distributed by a separate Bangalore-based company. The parent company has now decided to let Singer India do the distribution, said Murthy.																								The industrial machines will be imported from Shanghai, China. The domestic-use sewing machines are made by Singer in India.

 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 P amp;G foams it up with Rejoice price cut
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 27: Procter amp; Gamble (P amp;G) today upped the ante as it slashed Rejoice shampoo prices to match those of rival Hindustan Levers Clinic Plus.																								P amp;G has revised the price of Rejoice to Rs 30 from Rs 39 for 100 ml and Rs 59 from Rs 75 for 200ml, a reduction of approximately 23 per cent.																								P amp;G India marketing and sales director Chester Twigg said, The response to the launch of Rejoice has been encouraging. The new prices are in keeping with our policy to offer world-class brands to Indian consumers at competitive rates. The company has no plans to further reduce the prices of Rejoice, Pantene and Head amp; Shoulders shampoos.																								P amp;G has kept the price of 7.5 ml Rejoice sachets unchanged at Rs 2, similar to the strategy of Hind Lever.																								A price war in the FMCG segment has extended to other products, including detergents and toothpastes. 																								Hind Lever had cut the price of Clinic Plus shampoo some months ago and introduced a promotional offer on the Sunsilk brand to pre-empt P amp;Gs move to lower the price of Pantene. Both rivals are mirroring the same strategy, analysts say. 																								P amp;Gs price cut may spawn another battle for market share and affect the bottomlines of both companies, they added. 																								P amp;G said Rejoice is the largest selling shampoo in Asia (China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam).

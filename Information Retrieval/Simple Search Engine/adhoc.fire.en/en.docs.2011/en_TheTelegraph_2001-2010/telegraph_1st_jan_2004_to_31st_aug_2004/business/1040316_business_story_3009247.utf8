 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Selloff proceeds zoom past target
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 15: Buoyed by the blockbuster ONGC offer that has netted over Rs 10,500 crore, the BJP-led central government today asserted that it will exceed its divestment target of Rs 14,500 crore by Rs 900 crore this fiscal. 																								Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said, All the six issues have been oversubscribed and we have proved the financial analysts, who were criticising it, wrong. The six issues, which were floated this month, would mop up over Rs 14,100 crore, the minister said. 																								Adding the earlier proceeds from PSU stock sales during the fiscal, the government will net around Rs 15,400 crore from the divestment in state-run companies in 2003-04. 																								Shourie also said that in future, divestment need not follow an either-or approach in terms of public offering and strategic sale, both can co-exist. 																								The minister announced that the government has fixed a price of Rs 750 a share for the ONGC offer. This will help the government earn Rs 10,534 crore from the sale of 14.2 crore shares in the corporation, he added. 																								Retail investors would, however, be able to buy shares at a discounted price of Rs 712.50 a share. Over 7.6 lakh retail bids were received for the ONGC issue, which closed last week.																								Rebutting the criticism that mostly state-run financial institutions subscribed to the issues, Shourie claimed that over 16 lakh retail investors have participated in the six offerings. Retail investors would get whatever shares they had applied for, he said. Giving details about the response to the ONGC public offer, Shourie said about 350 affluent investors from abroad had bid for the offer. 																								Besides, 88 per cent investors in South East Asia, 84 per cent in Europe and 67 per cent in the US have also bid for ONGC, the minister said. 																								Stating that the ONGC issue was oversubscribed by 5.88 times, Shourie gave the break-up of category allotments as 46 per cent for institutional investors, 24 per cent for affluent individuals, 18 per cent for retail individual bidders, 10 per cent for shareholders and 2 per cent for permanent employees.

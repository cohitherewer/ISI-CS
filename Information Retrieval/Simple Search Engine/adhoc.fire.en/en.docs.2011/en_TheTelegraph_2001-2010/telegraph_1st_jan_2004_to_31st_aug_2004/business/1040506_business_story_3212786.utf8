 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Cell firms bid to keep frivolous players out
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 5: Cellular operators have asked for a 6 per cent annual licence fee based on average gross revenue in an attempt to erect a barrier to keep out non-serious players. 																								They have suggested that 5 per cent for universal service obligation fund and 1 per cent administrative cost will form the 6 per cent annual licence fee. This should be uniformly applicable to all licensees. 																								The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has suggested that first and second circle cellular licensees, who have been granted a 2 per cent reduction in revenue share licence fee for a period of four years starting April 1, 2004, should continue to enjoy the benefit. 																								COAI has proposed that rollout should not be stipulated in the licence, but rather left to market forces. Thus, there should be no rollout obligations imposed on the unified licensees. Accordingly, there will be no requirement for a performance bank guarantee under the unified licence.																								They have also sought review of the concept of financial bank guarantees and have suggested its removal as they only add to the costs of the end consumers. 																								Cellular operators have said that interconnection should be non-discriminatory and uniform for all access services under a unified licence. Special rules must be applied to operators with significant market power, especially in infrastructure. 																								Except under extraordinary circumstances, direct interconnection between various service providers should be mandatory. The concept of service-specific interconnection should be done away with for access services under unified licensing regime. 																								They have also urged that Trai must examine the costs and benefits of introducing carrier access code/carrier pre-selection before taking a decision in this regard. COAI has also recommended continuation of the existing numbering plan for each service.

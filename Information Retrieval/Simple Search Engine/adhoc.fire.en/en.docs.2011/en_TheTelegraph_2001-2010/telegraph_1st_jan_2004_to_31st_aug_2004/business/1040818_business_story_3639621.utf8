The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 VSNL set to reap Intelsat bonanza
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Net gain																								Mumbai, Aug 17: Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL) will rake in Rs 786 crore from the sale of its stake in Intelsat, a global satellite communications leader whose claim to fame was capturing Neil Armstrongs first step on the moon.																								Zeus Holdings, a four-member consortium of US and UK equity investors, will buy Intelsat in a $5-billion deal. This includes VSNLs 5.42 per cent holding in the firm. 																								VSNL officials were guarded in their initial reaction since they are yet to receive intimation about the takeover. The markets were not as restrained though, with the stock gaining 9.51 per cent to close at Rs 173.15 on the BSE.																								The Tata-controlled long distance telephony operator is expected to pocket a gain of Rs 530 crore on its Intelsat investment, which was valued at Rs 254 crore in July 2001. It came as a surprise to many investors and analysts tracking VSNL, an analyst with an FII said. The money will help VSNL bid for Tyco, a US international telephone major, and help expand its network abroad. 																								Intelsat, 24 per cent owned by Lockheed Martin, runs 25 satellites. The transaction comes at a time when Intelsat is successfully executing its strategies for market leadership in the fixed satellite services sector, said Intelsat chief executive officer Conny Kullman. Once it goes through, this deal will help satisfy our shareholders desire for a strong valuation and allow them to make their investments more liquid, Kullman added. Intelsat had planned a maiden offer, in which VSNL and a few other shareholders hoped to sell their way out. The IPO deadline was extended to December this year.																								Zeus is buying Intelsats shares at $18.75 apiece and taking over its $2-billion debt. If VSNL is going to use the cash for capacity expansion, it will be great, Navin Roy, dealer at Taib Securities. Or they might as well give part of the money back to shareholders, he added. 																								VSNL has committed a Rs 835-crore investment in Tata Teleservices, to be spread over seven years. The government holds 26 per cent of VSNL and the Tatas 45 per cent.																								VSNL was a founder member of Intelsat, a 1964 consortium that owns satellite communication systems. When it was privatised on July 18, 2001, Videsh Sanchar was allotted a 5.42 per cent stake.

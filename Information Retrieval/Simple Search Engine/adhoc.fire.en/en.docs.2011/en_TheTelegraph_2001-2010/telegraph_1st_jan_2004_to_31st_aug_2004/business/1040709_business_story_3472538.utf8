The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Not all that bad, let the fundamentals sink in
																								Tax rates and slabs remain largely untouched, but the 2 per cent across-the-board cess is a significantly large levy and encompasses a much larger gamut of taxes. 																								While there can be no doubt about the importance of investment in education, it is also necessary to see whether industry is getting over-taxed and we are unintentionally killing the proverbial golden goose. 																								Cross subsidy in power ensures that industry pays the highest charges, cross subsidy in railway ensures industry pays the highest for cargo, and the incidence of taxes, surcharge and cess ensures that industry is made to pay for all the inadequacies in the system. 																								Another example of this is the proposed increase in dividend distribution tax for corporate unitholders of debt mutual funds, for which a higher rate of 20 per cent has been prescribed. 																								If competitiveness of industry and manufacturing is important, as the finance minister mentioned in the budget, we are certainly eroding this through a barrage of taxes on industry.																								The tax-to-GDP ratios have improved over the years, but we need to take it up further. 																								Services, constituting 51 per cent of GDP, was thought to be under-taxed  and the gambit has been increased while the rates have gone up from 8-10 per cent. Widening taxes to agriculture would have given Chidambaram more revenue, but would have been politically impossible to implement. 																								There are ambitious targets to reduce revenue and fiscal deficits. Widening the tax rates would have helped in keeping the deficits in check.																								The move to rationalise taxes on dividends is characteristic of budgets authored by Chidambaram, and should perk up the markets. 																								There seems to be some confusion on the turnover tax on securities, which is dampening the markets, but one can be reasonably sure the markets will move northwards, once the fundamentals of the budget sink in. 																								The direct tax proposals rightly demonstrate the focus on rural and infrastructure development as is evident from the extension of tax holidays to agro-processing units, new power projects, telecom sector, housing industry and hospitals in rural areas. 																								The option given to shipping companies to pay tonnage tax or normal corporate tax, should satisfy the long pending demand of the industry and would definitely assist in increasing the competitiveness of Indian shipping.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 BenQ focused on brand makeover
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 22: The Taiwan-based BenQ aims to create a brand awareness in India and position itself as a digital lifestyle company with products ranging from mobile phones, digicams to projectors and LCD TVs.																								Country head Ashish Bakshi said, Having introduced the entire range of digital products in India, we will now focus on brand-building. India is a key growth region for the company. The group expects revenues to grow from $7 billion in 2003-04 to $12 billion this year. We expect a 5 to 6 per cent contribution by the Indian operations to the global revenues in the next four to five years.																								The company has four distinct business divisions  Networking amp; Communication, Imaging Network, Network Display and Digital Media. The BenQ range of products include cellphones, LCD monitors, projectors, plasma and LCD TV, joy books, digital cameras, Joy Bee (MP3 player) and scanners.																								The company has manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, China, Malaysia and Mexico.																								On the prospects of a manufacturing unit in India, Bakshi said the company would consider the proposal once it establishes itself in the country. We are also considering applying the domestic software development skills to our products, he said. However, it is too early to point out the manner in which we will tap this potential.																								BenQ ranks sixth in manufacturing handsets, both CDMA and GSM, globally. It shipped 18 million units last year. Currently, we are concentrating on GSM phones in India, said Bakshi. The company plans to add two phones next month to the existing seven models, which range from Rs 3,500 to Rs 13,000.																								BenQ is in the process of identifying key distributors who could specialise in distributing individual product lines.

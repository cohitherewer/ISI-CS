 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 More shares auctioned
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 5: The allotment fiasco in the ONGC issue is still plaguing the sellers. Today, another 3.25 lakh ONGC shares were auctioned at the Bombay stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange as sellers failed to cough up the shares sold on March 31.																								The sellers might have made a loss of Rs 30-40 per share as a result of this, said a dealer affiliated to a leading institutional brokerage. 																								The ONGC counter on Dalal Street was busier than usual today. It had to do with the 14.25-crore shares divested by the government, which has increased the floating stock from a measly 3.5 per cent to almost 14 per cent.

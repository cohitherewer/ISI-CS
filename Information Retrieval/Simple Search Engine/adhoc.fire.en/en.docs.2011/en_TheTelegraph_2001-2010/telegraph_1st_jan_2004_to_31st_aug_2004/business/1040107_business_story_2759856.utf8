 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Selloff panel wants sale of Ennore port shelved
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Disinvestment Commission today recommended against immediate privatisation of the Ennore port while favouring a public offer for Electronics Corporation arguing that time was not ripe for its privatisation.																								In its 23rd report submitted to the government here, the commission said that in case of Ennore port, divestment should be considered after a period of three years.																								The commission observed that the undertaking incorporated as recently as 1999 was yet to achieve critical size with only two of the 22 berths being utilised.																								In view of this, it is felt that EPL should continue as a government company for a period of three years, by which time the operations are expected to attain critical size, it said.																								The government currently holds a 67 per cent stake in the company with Chennai port holding the remainder which was developed as an alternative to Chennai port due to environmental and other reasons.																								The commission feels that in case of any delay in project implementation, divestment may be considered after an appropriate regulatory framework is installed.																								The report said 51 per cent of equity should be divested in favour of a strategic partner through competitive bidding route while balance shares may be divested five years thereafter. 																								In case of Electronics Corporation, a fully-owned government entity under the atomic energy department, the commission said it should be allowed to continue as a government company for some time. 																								However, the government should immediately divest a portion of its equity by way of initial public offering to ensure greater external scrutiny, it said adding Bharat Electronics model where government retained 76 per cent could be adopted.																								It further suggested ECILs exit from high volume, low technology business where private sector participation exists in favour of strategic, low volume high tech areas.																								It also asked the government to withdraw a part of surplus cash before divestment and obtain exemption from the government for not disclosing confidential and sensitive information.

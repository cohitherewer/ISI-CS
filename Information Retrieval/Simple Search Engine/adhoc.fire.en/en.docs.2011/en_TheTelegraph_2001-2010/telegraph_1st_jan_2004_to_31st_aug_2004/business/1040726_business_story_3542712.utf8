 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Logistics firms eye growth after quotas
 VIVEK NAIR				 	 Boom time ahead																								Mumbai, July 18: Express and logistics companies plan to cash in on the post-quota regime, which will benefit the textile industry, by stepping up investments and transforming themselves into one-stop solution providers.																								According to estimates, total exports from the textile industry is likely to show a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 12 per cent in the coming years.																								In such a situation, it is felt that the withdrawal of quotas would enable express and logistics companies to enhance their business and help the textile industry in gaining a competitive advantage.																								DHL Worldwide Express is looking at the post-January 2005-era with much anticipation, even as it is investing in necessary infrastructure, including setting up of more locations to bring about speedier clearance of freight shipments.																								According to head-marketing Ramesh Natarajan, a DHL-Mckinsey study, conducted earlier, has forecast that the countrys apparel exports is set to grow at a CAGR of 15 per cent after the expiry of quotas.																								DHL, which already serves the pharmaceuticals and auto components industries, is setting up additional service centres and undertaking measures to speed up delivery processes.																								One such measure initiated is the Singapore-Delhi-Cologne cargo flight through which exports to Europe take a transit time of two days only.																								It has set up a 26,000-sq-ft terminal at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in the capital for the purpose. The terminal has a customs-bonded warehouse to ensure speedier clearance of cargo.																								The company plans to set up more such terminals and is now awaiting space in the Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore airports. We are talking with the authorities for finding a suitable space, Natarajan said.																								While the company currently provides logistics, including warehousing solutions, to select global customers, the plan is to introduce comprehensive services to many in India in the next one year, Natarajan added.

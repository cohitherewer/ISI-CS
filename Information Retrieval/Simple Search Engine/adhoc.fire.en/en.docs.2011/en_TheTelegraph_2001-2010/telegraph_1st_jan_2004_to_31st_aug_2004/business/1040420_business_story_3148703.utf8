 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Centre draws up new plan to rein in rupee
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 																								New Delhi, April 19: The North Block has gone into a huddle over the rise of the rupee and is considering more reform measures to move towards full convertibility of the rupee. 																								We are worried. A strong rupee is being marketed by politicians as good for the country but too much of a good thing could be bad. Strong rupee means we become less competitive and ultimately it means less inflow of foreign direct investment and more of portfolio investments, said top finance ministry officials. 																								The rupee rose early today on the back of strong export surge of 17.26 per cent for the year ended March 2004. However, it later succumbed to heavy dollar demand amidst a cash dollar shortage scare, and closed lower at 43.91 against the greenback.																								Despite attempts by the RBI to stem the inflow of dollars from NRIs and through portfolio investments, interest arbitrage, the appreciating rupee (it went up by nearly 10 per cent last fiscal) has continued to attract dollars. 																								Top officials said new strategies will have to devised to cap the surge in rupee value. We will see if we can move towards greater convertibility. This could help take out some dollars, said officials. 																								Obviously this means the government would consider free movement of Indian investments and spending abroad. But to what extent, it is difficult to say right now. We will have to hold talks internally as well as with the RBIs monetary experts. 																								One of the steps being recommended by experts which the ministry is also toying with is letting scheduled Indian banks lend foreign exchange to Indian companies for specific infrastructure projects. These firms have been aggressively accessing foreign exchange loans from abroad. 																								Meanwhile, the government will continue with its policy of intervening through state-run banks whenever it notices strong volatility in the forex market. 																								Over the past year, the central bank has taken steps to discourage arbitrage inflows, which have been putting pressure on the rupee to appreciate and flood the country with cash but this has not helped much. 																								Most bankers and forex traders expect the Indian currency to continue appreciating to Rs 42 to the dollar by the end of this year. However, ministry economists believe the rising rupee will probably be stemmed and will be capped at Rs 43-43.50 to the dollar by the year-end. 																								Wait and see what the RBI does. No Asian currency will rise as fast as analysts are proclaiming, said officials.

 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 ISB lessons for bosses going global
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Power-house																								Mumbai, May 3: The Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB) has launched a special programme for senior executives looking to globalise their companies.																								While Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is buying oil properties worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Bharat Forge has acquired a German forging company and Tata Motors has acquired Daewoo.																								The programme is aimed at domestic companies who have recently acquired businesses abroad or are partnering with foreign companies. Most Indian companies cant afford to have a long learning curve, Shyam Viswanathan, ISB associate dean (executive education), said.																								It will help imbibe the best practices prevalent in advanced countries and will reduce the hassles of a makeover from a local to a global company.																								The programme called Managing Young Global enterprises: MYGLOBE is the first-of-its-kind globally, said ISB. It will enable Indian companies, who have a fair level of anxiety to get their senior executives better prepared to confront corporate issues peculiar to companies they acquire abroad.																								INSEAD, one of the worlds leading B-schools, ISB and five other reputed institutes, namely Asian Institute of Management, Manila, Athens Laboratory of Business Administration (Alba), Athens, Fundacao Dom Cabral (FDC), Brazil, Lahore Institute of Management Sciences, and University of Witwaterstand (WITS), Johannesburg, have joined hands to make this programme a success.																								INSEAD will provide the faculty along with other top business schools across the world  UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Southern California and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 																								It will enable senior executives looking to globalise their companies to shorten the learning curve of managing companies abroad, said Viswanathan.																								When 200 participants share their experiences and learning, the result would be awesome, said Amitava Chattopadhyay, programme director and Loreal Chaired Professor in marketing innovation and creativity, and professor of marketing at INSEAD.

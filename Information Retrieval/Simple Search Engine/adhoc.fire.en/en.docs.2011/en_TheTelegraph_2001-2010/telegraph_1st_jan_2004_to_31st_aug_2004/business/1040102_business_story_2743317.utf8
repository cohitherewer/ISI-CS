 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 SAIL trims debt pile, logs record production
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 1: In an effort to improve its financial health, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has reduced its debt burden by a whopping Rs 3,000 crore during April-December 2003. The improvement in debt position follows swapping of high-cost loans with lower interest debt, resulting in savings of about Rs 300 crore during the reporting period.																								With this, the overall outstanding debt stands at Rs 10,000 crore compared with Rs 15,082 crore in 1999-2000, and the debt-equity ratio has fallen below 3:1 in 2003. The debt recast comes after the navratna PSU turned around, booking a record profit of Rs 760 crore in the first half of 2003-04.																								The company has also registered a 8 per cent growth in production of saleable steel at 8.17 million tonnes, the highest ever in a nine-month period, against 7.56 million tonnes produced in the corresponding period last year. 																								SAIL has registered highest ever production of hot metal at 9.79 million tonne during the period, up by 9 per cent, while crude steel grew by a similar 9 per cent at 9.07 million tonnes.																								The four integrated steel plants of the company at Durgapur, Bhilai, Bokaro and Rourkela have, on an average, operated at 103 per cent capacity during the period to catch up with the rising demand.																								Buoyed by the boom in the steel market, the mild steel sales of the company have gone up by 10 per cent at 7.56 million tonnes in the April to December period.																								SAILs exports reported a significant growth of 62 per cent at 8.6 lakh tonnes against exports of 5.31 lakh tonnes during the corresponding period last year.																								Chairman V. S. Jain said the company has been able to keep its commitment by bringing in all-round improvement in its physical and financial performance.

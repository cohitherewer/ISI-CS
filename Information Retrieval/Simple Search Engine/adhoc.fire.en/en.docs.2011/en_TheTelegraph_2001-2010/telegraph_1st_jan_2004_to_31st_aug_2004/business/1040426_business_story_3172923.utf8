 Watch out for a funds expense ratio, says Chandralekha Tulal																								Every morning Akash makes it a point to track the net asset value (NAV) and the performance of the mutual funds he has entrusted his money with on his favourite website. Every month he diligently pores over the fact sheet sent to him by the fund houses to check the portfolio composition of the schemes.																								If you wonder why he so diligently pores over the numbers, heres what he says: Dont you know that it is the best way to keep track of your investment and see for yourself the returns that you are going to get? 																								And then you tell him that in all probability, his mutual fund does not give him everything it earns as every mutual fund deducts operational expenses from the returns it makes. These expenses include management, distribution, marketing/ promotional and client servicing costs. They are deducted from the returns and then distributed to the investors.																								Thats when he becomes visibly upset and complains that it is totally unfair that the fund houses do not give him the full benefit of the returns. It is the same situation with many investors who do not understand the implication of expense ratio charged to a fund. Lets see what it means and if it is necessarily unfair. 																								The expense ratio is a funds total expenses expressed as a percentage of its average corpus through the year. It is fair and absolutely necessary to charge expenses since the fund is in the business of generating profit for both the investor and the company. While the actual expenses charged might not amount to much, the expense ratio matters when it comes to calculating returns.																								The market regulator has placed a cap on the expenses that can be charged to the scheme and a separate sub-limit on the management fees. Several mutual funds are miffed by Sebis guidelines because it places severe restrictions on the expenses that they can charge to the fund.																								The expense ratio of a scheme is mentioned in the annual report, as a schedule to the balancesheet, of the mutual fund. It is also disclosed in the half-yearly accounts and it is imperative for the investors to keep track as a difference of a few basis points can make a huge dent in the returns. Investors should compare it across similar schemes to check the trade-off between the returns and expenses. If the returns are not sufficient to justify the expenses, then it is better to bid the scheme goodbye. 																								Although expected returns from debt funds are much lower than equity funds, there is not much of a difference in the expense cap  only 0.25 per cent. Thus, the expenses in a debt fund eat away a major chunk of returns based on the expense- return matrix. Again, you expect a lower return in a balanced fund than a pure equity fund as the former invests in a mix of bonds and equities. Logically, therefore, a balanced fund should have a lower expense ratio than a pure equity fund. But often, reality does not bear this out. In 2002-03, the expenses of Birla Balance were 2.31 per cent, higher than the 2.30 per cent charged to the pure equity Birla Advantage Fund.			It is also a crucial element to take into account when picking an index fund as it involves passive management by mimicking a market index, such as the nifty or the sensex. Therefore, the expense ratio may be one of the key factors that determine how much a funds performance deviates from that of the index. 																								Under the Sebi guidelines, expenses as a percentage of net assets decline with increasing corpus. Therefore, there is a perception that it is better to invest in a larger fund. However, smaller funds deliver better returns due to better manoeuvrability. Sometimes, competitive pressures also force funds to charge lower expenses than those allowed by Sebi. In 2002-03, Alliance Income Fund had an expense ratio of 1.75 per cent, Birla Income Plus 1.60 per cent and PruICICI Income Plan 1.59 per cent  lower than allowable limits. Thus, investors can use expense ratios to choose from schemes with a similar track record. 																								It is prudent to check out the expense ratio while investing in a funds IPO as Sebi has a cap on the expenses that can be charged. If the actual expenses exceed that limit, then it has to be absorbed by the asset management company. While evaluating a fund, check the trend in the expense ratio rather than take one years ratio in isolation. It might provide a valuable insight into the funds efforts to pare costs. It will help the investor get an idea of how much his investment is likely to be impacted by the expense ratio.

 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Govt mulls regulator for food processing
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 28: The government will soon formulate a comprehensive law and set up a regulatory authority for the food processing industry. It also plans to set up nearly 500 food processing centres across the country to ensure higher growth.																								The group of ministers under the chairmanship of agriculture minister Sharad Pawar is making all efforts to ensure that an integrated food law is in place and a single regulatory agency is created, Subodh Kant Sahay, minister of state for food processing industries, said.																								I promise the law will soon become a reality and we are working overtime, he added.																								Addressing the issue of adulteration and the consequent loss in the global market, Sahay said around 35 per cent of the products are adulterated. Unless a strict code of conduct is evolved, the industry will not be able to tap the foreign market to its true potential, he said.																								Sahay said infrastructure hurdles remain a huge threat and will affect the long-term interests of the industry in the WTO-integrated environment.																								The existing laboratories and research and development facilities are inadequate and manufacturers have to spend a lot of time to obtain services from recognised testing labs abroad.																								The minister said that the industry should set up zone-wise laboratory facilities to minimise processing time. Despite the fact that the ministry is funding for research and development projects, so far the government has not received any research proposal from the industry, he said.																								In an attempt to promote interface with the industry, the food processing ministry is organising open house discussions across the country to evaluate the region-wise potential.																								D.P. Singh, secretary in the food processing ministry, said the inadequate supply chain characterised with low value addition, enormous wastage, limited packaging facility and storage facility are hurting the sector badly.

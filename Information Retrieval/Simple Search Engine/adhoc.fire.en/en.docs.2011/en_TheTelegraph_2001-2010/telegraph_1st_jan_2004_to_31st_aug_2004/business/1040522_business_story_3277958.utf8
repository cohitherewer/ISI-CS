London, May 21 (PTI): International rating agency Moodys has indicated that it is unlikely to revise Indias rating, but prescribed strong measures to curb fiscal deficit for spurring growth during the Congress-led coalition governments regime.																								Despite the bloodbath on the bourses before Manmohan Singhs name figured as Prime Minister, Moodys said the BAA3 investment grade rating is still secure. It cited strong economic fundamentals as the reason for retaining the rating.																								I dont think anyone should see the apparent change in the government in such black-and-white terms. It could be a repeat of 1999, however, because the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was itself very slow to get going on reforms, Moodys analyst Kristin Lindow said.

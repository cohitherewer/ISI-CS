 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 UTI chairman wants lower tax regime for MFs
				 	 Damodaran: Thinking aloud																								Chennai, June 19 (PTI): Unit Trust of India Asset Management Company today called for a lower tax regime for the mutual fund industry for the benefit of average investors.																								We have to strongly articulate a case for better tax regime that will bring down the costs and thereby benefit mutual fund investors, chairman M. Damodaran said at a seminar on mutual funds here.																								Noting that a vibrant and healthy mutual fund sector was required for the growth of the industry as a whole, he said increasing number of regulations were also putting pressure on the cost of operations of the mutual funds. 																								He said the Indian mutual fund industry would soon be consolidated as the smaller players will be forced to merge with the bigger entities in the days to come.																								The compliance is getting more difficult and costlier and the industry is paying heavily to bear the additional costs, he said at the seminar organised jointly by Assocham, the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi) and the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry.																								He asked investors not to panic when smaller players get merged with bigger entities in the mutual fund business.																								Currently, there are about 30 AMCs in the Indian mutual fund industry and after consolidation, you will have less players, Damodaran said. 																								Hefty returns																								Domestic mutual funds gave a hefty return of 114 per cent on investments in equity during the year 2003-04, much higher than stock market indices, which jumped by 79 per cent during the same period, according to a study done by Amfi.																								The investments by diversified equity funds outperformed the stock market indices by a big margin in the one-year period ended March 2004, said Amfi chairman A. P. Kurien, giving details of the study.																								The study, which was commissioned by Amfi and done by Crisil, also found that over a three-year period from 2002, equity funds have provided a handsome return of 32 per cent compared with a 15 per cent rise in stock market indices during the same period.																								In the five-year period ended March 2004 too, mutual funds gave attractive returns.																								While equity indices grew only by 8-10 per cent, diversified equity funds gave a return of 18 per cent per annum.																								In other instruments too, mutual funds gave better returns to investors, according to the study. For instance, debt funds gave a return of 10 per cent per annum compared with bank deposit rates of 5.5 per cent, Kurien said.

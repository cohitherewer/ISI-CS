 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Gail steps on the gas in eastern region
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee at a press conference in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 15: Gail (India) Ltd has drawn up a Rs 3,800-crore plan to bring natural gas to the eastern region.																								While an investment of Rs 3,000 crore is proposed in a gas pipeline to link Gujarat with Haldia, another Rs 800 crore is being earmarked for coal gassification project in eastern India based on the Chinese model with technology from global major Shell.																								Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee told The Telegraph that the company saw a lot of scope for selling imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the east.																								He said Reliance was planning to transport gas from the eastern offshore Krishna Godavari basin to power plants in Gujarat and its proposed power plant at Dadri near Delhi. As a result, the east would be short on gas.																								Gail, on the other hand, had plans of increasing its gas imports at the Dahej terminal in Gujarat from 5 million tonnes to 7.5 million tonnes and eventually to 10 million tonnes. Additional gas was also expected from the western offshore Panna-Mukta and Tapti gas fields. All this could be transported to the east.																								He said a feasibility report for the 850-km Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline had already been drawn up and the project would be taken up after the 400-km Dahej-Uran pipeline was completed.																								Banerjee said Gail had sounded out prospective buyers of the gas and the response was positive. He said fertiliser and steel units in the east were using liquid fuels, which were much more expensive than gas. These would switch to natural gas; new units would also come up once adequate supplies of gas became available, he added.																								Banerjee said Gail had roped in Shell to help it gassify coal at the pit heads of the Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Central Coalfields Ltd. The technology had been successfully tried out in China, where eight such projects would be going into commercial production this year. The project would help convert the high-ash coal into a value-added product.																								In the long run, Gail also has plans of laying a pipeline from Kakinada to Haldia if big gas finds are made by Indian companies, including ONGC, in the Krishna-Godavari basin.																								Banerjee also disclosed that Gail was taking a relook at the Assam gas cracker unit which, he said, would still need tax concessions and subsidies proposed earlier because the project was of sub-optimal size. A pre-feasibility report has been prepared for the project, which would entail an investment of Rs 2,500 crore for a 260,000-tonne polymer plant.																								As part of the companys big thrust on petrochemicals, it was expanding the capacity of its petrochemicals project at Pata in UP with an investment of Rs 647 crore. 																								The company has signed a technology agreement with Mitsui Chemicals of Japan for setting up the high-density polyethylene plant with a capacity of 100,000 tonnes per annum. The Gail chairman said Pata had been chosen for the new project as it would be cost-effective to expand the existing complex there.																								Gail has also signed an MoU with Haldia Petrochemicals for setting up a joint venture styrene butadiene rubber plant with an investment of around Rs 500 crore.

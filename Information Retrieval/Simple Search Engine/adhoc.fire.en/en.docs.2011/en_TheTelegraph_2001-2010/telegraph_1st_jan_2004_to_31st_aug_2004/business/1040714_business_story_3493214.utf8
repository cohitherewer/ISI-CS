 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Brokers confident of turnover tax respite
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chidambaram with Sebi chairman G. N. Bajpai in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 13: Stockbrokers were upbeat today after talks with finance minister P. Chidambaram on the contentious transaction tax that has thrown stock markets out of kilter after last Thursdays budget.																								The finance ministers body language was positive, said Deena Mehta, former executive director of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) who attended the meeting. He said he would consider the points we raised.																								The government had proposed the imposition of a 0.15 per cent tax on securities transaction in the last weeks budget after scrapping long-term capital gains tax  measures that are expected to drive away with arbitrageurs and short-term traders.																								Small brokers have stayed away from trading to protest against the transaction tax since Monday, leading to a sharp fall in trading volumes.																								These traders, who buy and sell on an intra-day basis, account for nearly 70 per cent of market volume. Total traded turnover, excluding derivatives, on the two big stock exchanges  the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange  has nearly dropped by about 50 per cent.																								We are confident that the finance minister would take our presentation positively for he has assured that he would look into the matter in a positive light, said Mehta.																								In response to a question as to what made her think the finance minister is willing to rework the rates as well as the tax-proposal, Mehta said, He went into great details.																								Finance ministry officials refused to comment, but on Monday, Chidambaram had hinted that he could revisit the rates.																								Analysts said the tax would impact returns on fixed-income instruments and investors who leverage large volumes to convert small margins into modest gains. We have not discussed on the rates but on the difficulties we would face. Its the governments prerogative to tax but there cannot be a flat rate of taxation, Mehta explained.																								She admitted there may be a leakage in the system, when asked if the primary concern for traders is that the implementation of the tax would make it impossible for them to transact using unaccounted money. 																								There are ways and means for the government to prevent it. We have a personal identification number which stores all our details and consequently our transactions can easily be traced, explained Mehta.Sensex slides																								The BSE benchmark 30-share index opened on a firm note at 4961.87 and later fluctuated in a fairly wide range between 4978.49 and 4878.06 before ending the day at 4898.99 against Mondays close of 4944.54, a net fall of 45.55 points or 0.92 per cent.

 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Fabric foray tops Ritspin agenda
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 13: Ritspin Synthetics plans to foray into fabric making and later into garments. We are the most sophisticated yarn-producing unit in the country. We want to advance the value chain and start making fabrics within the next three months, said Mahendra Kumar Mishra, chief executive officer of Ritspin Synthetics. 																								The company will import knitting machines from Germany and expand the production capacity at its Indore plant. Ritspin has not yet zeroed in on the final investment figure, estimated at around Rs 5 to 7 crore. 																								Ritspin has been the largest exporter of viscose yarns for the last two years with a volume of Rs 80 crore in 2003-04. Exports constitute around 90 per cent of the companys total turnover. The company mainly exports to European countries like Spain, Belgium and Italy, Mishra said. 																								We expect a 15 per cent growth in turnover this fiscal, with the total volume exceeding Rs 100 crore. Thereafter, we see a growth of 20 per cent every year. The real growth will be achieved in the post-WTO regime, said Mishra. The company has clocked a 12.5 per cent rise in turnover at Rs 90 crore in 2003-04 compared with Rs 80 crore in 2002-03.

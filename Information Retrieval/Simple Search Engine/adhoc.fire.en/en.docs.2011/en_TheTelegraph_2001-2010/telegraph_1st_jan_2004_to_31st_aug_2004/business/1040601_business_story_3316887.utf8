 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Fertiliser firms face cut in open-market quota
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Fertilisers minister Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, May 31: The government is likely to slash the quantity of fertilisers that manufacturers are allowed to sell in the open market from the current level of 50 per cent of their output as it is hurting poor farmers. 																								Fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan said, We will review this policy. Farmers in Bihar and the northeast region should get required fertilisers.																								Paswan said he has asked ministry officials for the details of the policy. The BJP-led government had doubled the quantity sold by fertiliser companies in the open market from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. 																								I am not taking a final decision. I have asked the ministry to give me the advantages and disadvantages of this policy, Paswan said.																								On the privatisation of public sector companies, Paswan said, The main purpose of the fertiliser companies is not merely to earn profit. We will explore all options. We dont want to shut down companies...for us, divestment is the last option.																								This means the government is likely to explore all available restructuring options to turn around two loss-making firms  Madras Fertilisers Ltd and Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd  which were expected to be put on the block by the previous government.																								I will personally look at these companies, said Paswan, adding that he was not averse to private sector participation in them. But he did not clarify the role of the private sector companies, if they are invited to run loss-making units.																								Asset sale of fertiliser companies, unlike privatisation of the oil-sector, did not attract strong political opposition. National Fertilisers Ltd and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd were among the profitable firms lined up for privatisation by the BJP government.

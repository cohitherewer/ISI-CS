The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Price rise to help tea companies turn a new leaf
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Charting a new course 																								Calcutta, May 8: Tea companies, badly hurt by a downward trend in profitability over the last four years, may turn a new leaf following a recovery in tea prices at the auctions this fiscal.																								The initial shortfall in the crop has already raised prices at auctions.																								Official crop figures released by the Tea Board up to March 2004 indicate an all-India shortfall in crop of 6.56 million kgs. Simultaneously, exports show a surplus of 7.2 million kgs.																								Auctioneers said April has shown a substantial decline, particularly in North India. The arrival of tea at the primary auction centres in North India have slowed down because of a low harvest.																								Supply of CTC tea, a favourite in the domestic market, has dropped by 0.75 million kgs in April and prices are up by Rs 6.94 per kg than the corresponding period of 2003.																								In May, arrivals at auctions show a further decline of 5.8 million kgs against last year.																								Percy Siganporia, acting managing director of Tata Tea, said the present volatility in tea prices is likely to continue and the auction centres are feeling the heat of it.																								In view of the stock position, the prices which have already hardened should appreciate in the coming weeks. We are bullish about the prices, said a senior official of J. Thomas amp; Co, the largest auction house in the country.																								The shortfall in the tea crop has been due to excessive rains in Assam in the beginning of the new season. This has affected the overall production of new season tea.																								The industry expects exports to rise in the current year following the opening up of the Iran market and renewed interest by Iraq. 																								Therefore, in the long run a shortfall in the domestic market may happen, the tea industry official feels.																								The industry feels that in this price recovery scenario, if the tea companies are able to reduce cost substantially then they will witness a major turnaround.																								Siganporia, who is also the additional vice-chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said the present cost structure is not sustainable. We have to enhance productivity and take a relook at the plantations.																								He said continuity in tea means reconstruct the entire cost structure. There are three elements involved in the entire cost structure. These are wage, productivity and land labour ratios. All these areas need to be restructured, he said.

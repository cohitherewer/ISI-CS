 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 PM to hear unions on budget next week
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited trade union leaders for a meeting on June 23 when he plans to hardsell some of the hard-line decisions his government is likely to take in the forthcoming budget.																								This is the first time that Singh will be holding meetings with trade union leaders on economic issues. Sources said he is likely to play a more pro-active role and hold discussions with other interest groups to help his cabinet colleagues hammer out a consensus on various issues.																								His normal style of functioning is, however, described as a hands-off approach. The trade unions hope to use this meeting to persuade Singh to include parts of their own agenda.																								AITUC chief and CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said, We want a new-look budget which will stimulate the markets with huge public investments and create jobs. We will present a roadmap to him in this regard. We will also use this opportunity to make payment of minimum wages compulsory in all sectors.																								Trade union leaders will also try to address the interests of their members by asking for higher interest payouts from provident funds and small-savings schemes.																								Privately, however, they concede they have few hopes of this being met and would be satisfied if the Congress-led coalition government maintains status quo on interest rates.																								The budget strategy will also dominate the meeting of the United Progressive Alliance on June 18, in which finance minister P. Chidambaram is expected to brief the coalition partners on the manner in which the common minimum programme is being carried forward.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
		 Monday, March 15, 2004  Q amp;A				 In the long run
																																																																																													I incurred long term capital loss from redemption of US-64 in June 2003. Can it be adjusted against long-term capital gain from sale of securities in January 2004? Which items are admissible under section 80L? What is the amount of deduction available? 																																																																													A.Banerjee, Calcutta
																																																																																													Yes, long term capital loss incurred in one financial year can be set off against long term capital gains booked in that year.																																																																																													Rebate under section 80L is available on interest on National Savings Certificates (VI, VII, VIII issue), debentures issued by institutions specified by the central government, deposits under National Deposits Scheme, post office MIS, bank deposits, schemes by the central government, financial corporations lending for industrial and housing development, dividends from Indian companies and co-operative societies and income from units of mutual funds. Deductions permissible up to Rs 12,000.																																					In search of agents																																																																																															You recommended debt mutual funds as a relatively stable investment offering better return than bank fixed deposit. Can you please recommend some funds or brokers/agents? Can I find the information online?																																																																													Jayasri Majumdar, Calcutta
																																																																																													Debt funds should be considered if you are looking to invest for more than a year. Historically, they have given a better return than other fixed income instruments but the return is not guaranteed as is their performance. You can check the return generated by 200 top mutual fund schemes in the scorecard that we carry on our stocks page. For further information on schemes not covered by us, you should refer to the fact sheets published by the fund houses at the end of every month.																																					Declaration is enough																																																																																															We have received a number of letters seeking clarification on whether senior citizens with an income exceeding Rs 50,000 a year can file form 15H. No tax will be deducted at source for senior citizens entitled to rebate under section 88B, if they submit a declaration in writing in the prescribed form 15H that tax on estimated total income is nil.

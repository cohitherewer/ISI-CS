 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 P amp;G slashes Pantene price
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, April 1: Procter and Gamble (P amp;G) has slashed the prices of its Pantene brand of shampoos by 16 per cent  a reaction to Hindustan Levers move to cut the prices of its Clinic Plus and Sunsilk shampoo brands by 50 per cent.																								Recently, Hindustan Lever had unveiled its one-plus-one scheme under which it offers a free bottle of shampoo with every bottle purchased.																								Procter and Gamble said the price of Pantene was being pared in tune with market research and the aim is to make it affordable to a large number of consumers. 																								However, market analysts attributed it to competition and a sluggish market for FMCG products. 																								Pantene prices have been reduced by 16 per cent to Rs 51 for a 100 ml bottle and Rs 98 for a 200 ml bottle. At present Pantene is available in six variants. 																								Meanwhile, the company also launched another variant, Pantene hair fall control, here today. 																								Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers have been slashing product prices in an effort to boost sales. 																								Sometime ago, the FMCG makers had started a rate war in the detergents business with Procter and Gamble slashing the prices of its detergent brands, Ariel and Tide, while Hindustan Lever cut the price of its Surf and Wheel detergent powders.																								Procter amp; Gamble had reduced the prices of the large pack sizes of its Ariel and Tide brand by 20 to 50 per cent. 																								Hindustan Lever had followed suit with price cuts for its Surf and Wheel detergent powders.																								Both Procter and Gamble and Hindustan Lever had earlier slashed the prices of their sachets to Rs 1.50 from Rs 3.																								Rahul Malhotra, country marketing manager, Procter and Gamble (India), however, did not say whether price slashing strategies would be extended to the two other business categories in which Procter and Gamble is present  healthcare and feminine products. 																								Procter and Gamble also said prices will not be changed for its other shampoo brands  Head amp; Shoulders and Rejoice.

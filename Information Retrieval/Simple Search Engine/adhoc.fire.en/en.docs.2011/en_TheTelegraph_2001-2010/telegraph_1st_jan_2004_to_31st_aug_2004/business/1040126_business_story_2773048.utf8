 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 25: The Rs 233-crore Elder Pharmaceuticals Ltd is looking at contract manufacturing or outsourcing for multinational pharma companies in order to consolidate its position in the overseas markets even as an expansion in its domestic marketing network is on the cards.																								Elder, which has brands like ShelCal, AM-PM and Tiger Balm, in its portfolio is now planning to expand its product range to new areas that include CNS, cardio vascular drugs and other lifestyle diseases. Elder has firmed up tie-ups with overseas companies to market their products in the local markets.																								According to Alok Saxena, director (international), the stress on domestic market by expanding product portfolio will require a restructuring of its marketing and sales activities. A crucial part of this restructuring will include the expansion of its marketing network to cover semi-urban and rural areas. 																								The company, which has consciously decided not to enter the US market for the time being, exports products like ampicillin, amoxycillin, roxythromicin, azithromicin, clarithromicin, amplodypin besylate, meloxicam among others.

 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 World Bank maps 8% growth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees India Shining publicity drive received its strongest endorsement today with the World Bank saying the country could achieve 8 per cent growth if it pushed ahead with reforms and took appropriate measures to contain fiscal deficit and wasteful subsidies.																								Eight per cent growth is achievable. But India needs to address its fiscal deficit, hike investment in infrastructure and carry out major policy changes to make capital more productive, World Bank chief economist (South Asia region) Shantayanan Devarajan told reporters here. The World Banks forecast comes soon after the Reserve Bank of India projected in early January an over 7 per cent growth this fiscal.																								Since then, research outfits like the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) have come out with upbeat forecasts of 8 per cent growth this year. Finance minister Jaswant Singh recently said these underscored just how strong the fundamentals of the economy were. 																								The country recorded a growth of 8.4 per cent during second quarter of this fiscal and over 7 per cent in April-September last year.																								The finance ministry, Reserve Bank of India, research agencies like NCAER and Crisil have all projected over 7.0 per cent growth this fiscal. Devarajan said the South Asia region might grow 6-7 per cent this fiscal compared with 5.0 per cent in 2002-03.																								If India gets to the 8 per cent growth mark, other countries in the region will also grow 1 per cent higher, he said.																								The World Bank economists said subsidies needed to be better targeted towards the poor, and delivery of education, health and other social services needed to be improved to benefit the weaker sections of the society.																								Devarajan said the government also needed to improve infrastructure and ensure proper imposition of user charges.																								Asked how the government should address the problem of fiscal deficit while improving social services and infrastructure, Devarajan said: Its not about more money to social sector. We have to strengthen service delivery before increasing the funding.																								Most subsidies are going to the non-poor. Failing service delivery has resulted in a situation where the poor are looking towards the private sector for various social services, he said.																								While endorsing the fact that India has been able to reduce poverty levels, the World Bank official indicated that higher growth would lead to further reduction in poverty.

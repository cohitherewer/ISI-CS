 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Foreign firms to go slow
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 4: Foreign firms will gradually evince interest in floating Indian depository receipts, according to analysts. 																								The government has allowed foreign firms to raise funds from domestic markets through depository receipts provided they have a net worth of at least $100 million and average sales of $500 million over three years.																								There will be interest, but in the long term, HDFC Securities research head Jaideep Goswami, said. 																								Foreign majors in the insurance and telecom sectors will look at the Indian depository receipts route as it will help them gain visibility in the country. 																								It will be similar to Indian technology companies getting American depository receipts listed on US bourses, said Goswami.

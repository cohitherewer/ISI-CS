 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Drug firms seek tax sops for research 
 OUR CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, July 2: Pharmaceutical majors are pressing for research and development (R amp;D) tax breaks to stay competitive.																								A key demand of the pharmaceutical sector is the scrapping of customs duty on equipment and consumables meant for R amp;D work.																								The pharmaceutical industry is preparing to face the challenges of a product patent regime post 2005, and looks forward to a comprehensive fiscal package of reforms from the government in order to encourage investments in new drug discovery. This package should enable the industry to offer innovative medicines to patients at an affordable price, said Brian Tempest, joint managing director amp; CEO designate, Ranbaxy.																								The weighted deduction for R amp;D expenditure should continue up to 2010 and should be enhanced from 150 per cent at present to 200 per cent. To improve international competitiveness, this must also allow expenditure incurred for regulatory and legal expenses for patent challenges outside India, as well as for land and buildings for new R amp;D facilities, a Ranbaxy spokesperson said.																								Customs duty exemption for equipment and consumables for use in the R amp;D for pharmaceutical and biotech industry, is another prime expectation from this budget, as these are crucial for the industry to stay competitive, the spokesperson added.																								Consumables used in R amp;D attract the peak rate of customs duty at 20 per cent. Moreover, no Cenvat credit is available for countervailing duty paid on consumables for R amp;D or excise duty/CVD paid on R amp;D equipment.																								A key demand of the pharmaceutical industry is that the Cenvat credit facility should be allowed when research is carried out independently at the premises outside the factory of production.																								In the biotechnology sector, the industry players want the import duty on reagents brought down from 20 to 10 per cent.																								R amp;D is an important aspect of biotechnology. Customs duties of 20 per cent basic plus 16 per cent countervailing duties (CVD) on the reagents and equipment imported for use in R amp;D and manufacture of biotech products make biotech industry unsustainable, says an industry representation sent to the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Markets edgy ahead of Infosys score
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 12: Jitters over whether a strong rupee will weaken Infosys profit hung over the markets as the BSE sensex shed 55 points to end at 5783.79 today.																								Fears of a currency bite into fourth-quarter earnings sent the Infosys stock tumbling 3 per cent; shares of other technology majors that export heavily, also trod water. This, combined with selling in old-economy heavy-weights, kept the markets in the red zone.																								Analysts expect at least a 30 per cent rise in Infosys net profit for the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31. This figure is however, not a major worry. What is a bigger concern is the forecast for the current financial year that the Bangalore-based firm will dish out. 																								There is a feeling that due to the recent appreciation of the rupee, which has hardened over 4 per cent against the dollar, Infosys will go for a modest outlook.																								When the directors of the company hunker down for their keenly watched meeting ahead of the results on Tuesday, many will also be rivetted to another announcement  whether there will be a bonus or a stock split. 																								Though market watchers expect a bonus in the ratio of 1:1, or a reduction in the face-value of the share to Rs 2, it did not drive up the scrip this afternoon. 																								Bonus seems to have taken the back seat for now. The most important part is the guidance, an analyst with a local brokerage said. The Infosys stock opened at Rs 5345, rose to an intra-day high of Rs 5358.85 before ending at Rs 5139.85, a fall of Rs 172.85 over its previous close.																								The slide in Infosys was followed by falls in the stocks like Wipro, which is also expected to consider a bonus on April 16. The share gave up close to a per cent. Hughes Software, which released its numbers, was in the red too. 																								e-Serve International and Mastek were among the few technology firms that ended with gains. Mastek jumped over 7 per cent or Rs 14.85 to Rs 222.40. The gains were attributed to the forecast of a 20-30 per cent growth in net profit for April-June. During this quarter, the group revenue is projected to increase 3-5 per cent.																								Masteks fourth-quarter net profit inched up to Rs 5.77 crore for the quarter compared with Rs 5.4 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Total income increased from Rs 31.25 crore to Rs 34.26 crore. On a consolidated basis, the group posted a net profit of Rs 10.02 crore for the quarter compared with Rs 16.03 crore.BoM shares listed																								The Bank of Maharashtra shares sold in its IPO last month were listed on BSE today. The stock closed at Rs 38.95, up 69.34 per cent over the issue price of Rs 23. The listing was marred by investor complaints about the allotment of physical shares instead of demat ones.

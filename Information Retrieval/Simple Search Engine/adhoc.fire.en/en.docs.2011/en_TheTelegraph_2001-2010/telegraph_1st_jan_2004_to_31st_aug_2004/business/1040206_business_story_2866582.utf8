 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 UTI inks deal to buy IL amp;FS schemes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 5: UTI Mutual Fund will acquire the schemes of IL amp;FS Mutual Fund, which has assets under management of more than Rs 2,500 crore in a deal that signifies the rapid consolidation of mutual funds.																								The price is not known at this stage, but could filter through over the next couple of months. The deal will take the assets managed by UTI MF to over Rs 22,000 crore. 																								IL amp;FS AMC manages 10 schemes against UTI AMCs 41 domestic schemes and four off-shore plans. Announcing the acquisition, UTI AMC chairman and managing director M. Damodaran said: Through this acquisition, UTI MF has consolidated its leadership in the Indian mutual fund industry. The entire acquisition is expected to be completed over the next four months. 																								Welcoming the over 65,000 institutional, high net-worth clients and retail investors of IL amp;FS Mutual Fund into UTI fold, Damodaran said, The investment style and the high level of service standards established by IL amp;FS MF will continue.																								In order to ensure that the transition process is smooth, a joint team of UTI AMC and IL amp;FS AMC officials has been constituted, he added.																								The acquisition is expected to make UTI MFs product range more comprehensive as some of the schemes that are being acquired will compliment its own plans. 																								The Floating Rate Fund, the Dynamic Equity Fund and the MIP of IL amp;FS MF will bridge gaps in UTI MFs portfolio.																								UTI MF has more than 10 million investors, accounting for 85 per cent of the industry, in its numerous schemes. The acquisition of IL amp;FS schemes would enable it to offer the widest product portfolio in the domestic mutual fund industry, excellent institutional and high net-worth relationships and the widest retail reach in the industry.																								Although UTI MF is acquiring only the mutual fund schemes of IL amp;FS, it looks forward to integrating into its human resource pool, some of the high-quality staff of IL amp;FS AMC. This would ensure that the IL amp;FS funds would continue to receive focused attention and the same quality of investor servicing, a UTI release said.

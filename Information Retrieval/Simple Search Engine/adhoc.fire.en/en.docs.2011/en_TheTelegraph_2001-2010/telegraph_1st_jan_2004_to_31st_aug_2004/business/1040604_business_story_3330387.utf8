 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Sebi ticks off JM Morgan Stanley on lapses
																								Mumbai, June 3 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has warned BSE broker JM Morgan Stanley Retail Services Pvt Ltd for alleged technical lapses and asked it to be more diligent in future regarding its activities in the capital market.																								Based on the facts and circumstances, I have thought it fit to reduce the penalty as proposed by the inquiry officer and accordingly, I find that a warning would be adequate, Sebi board member A. K. Batra said in his order on June 2.																								Sebi had carried out an inspection of the brokers books of accounts, documents and other records in November 2000 and was also asked to furnish information regarding its market activities in 1999-2000 and 2000-01.																								During inspection, Sebi had observed certain violations and appointed an inquiry officer. The officer issued a showcause notice to the broker on February 3, 2003 alleging that the broker had committed irregularities relating to the contract notes.																								The broking member failed to maintain proper segregation between the members own account and those of clients and in some instances, there was delay in client deliveries, the inquiry officer said.																								The inquiry officer recommended suspension of JM Morgans certificate of registration for three months.																								The Sebi board member said no prejudice was caused to any investor as a result of the irregularities alleged to have been committed by JM Morgan. 																								Under the circumstances, the imposition of a three-month penalty would not advance the objectives of the Sebi Act or any of the regulations framed under it.Financial statements																								Sebi has asked some stock broking houses to submit their books of account to ensure that the financial statements meet regulatory norms.																								Notice to seek account books is part of a regular activity to inspect books and ensure that they are in order, a Sebi official said today.																								Asked if the market regulator was probing brokers by seeking accounts-related information, he said this was routine job and not related to any inquiry or probe into the recent market crash.																								These checks are conducted on the basis of turnover of the broking house, he added.

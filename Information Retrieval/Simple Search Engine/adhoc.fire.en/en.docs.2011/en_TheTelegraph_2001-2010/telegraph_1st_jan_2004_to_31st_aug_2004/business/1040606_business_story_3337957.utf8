 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Oracle faces new hurdle to PeopleSoft bid
																								San Francisco, June 5 (Reuters): US antitrust officials will head to court on Monday in their bid to block Oracle Corp.s $7.7-billion takeover bid for PeopleSoft in one of the biggest hostile merger battles ever in the technology industry. 																								The US justice department filed suit in February to block Oracle from taking over PeopleSoft. 																								US regulators say a merger would crimp competition and force companies and government agencies to pay more for software that helps them manage finances and human resources. 																								The government fears a merger would leave standing just two big firms  Germanys SAP AG, the No. 1 business software provider, and a merged Oracle/PeopleSoft  to provide complex and expensive software applications for large businesses and governments. 																								People are watching this closely, but at the end of the day many companies know they will still buy these software products, whether its from three companies or two companies, said Albert Pang, an analyst with research firm IDC Corp. 																								The trial, which begins in federal court in San Francisco a year and a day after Oracle launched its takeover effort, is expected to run about a month. PeopleSoft shareholders would also need to approve a takeover even if it were cleared by the judge. 																								European Union antitrust regulators will also be watching the trials outcome. They have issued a statement of objections to the takeover but delayed a final ruling. 																								Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison is scheduled to testify in the case. PeopleSoft chief executive Craig Conway, who was once an Oracle executive, is also expected to testify. 																								The outcome of the trial will rest solely with US district court judge Vaughn Walker, who faces a flurry of arguments from both sides. 																								This is a very complex case but the judge is a sophisticated antitrust person who will look at the facts and come up with the right decision, said Craig Biggio, a former senior justice department antitrust official. 																								The justice department, backed by 10 US states, bears the burden of demonstrating a merger is anti-competitive and would lead to higher software prices. 																								The government argues the so-called enterprise software market has only a few players. Oracle, however, contends the market is global and full of niche players and new entrants, such as Microsoft Corp. which can build enterprise software. 																								In support, Oracle will point to the justice departments decision in April to award a contract to American Management Systems Inc., a small maker of financial management software. 																								Oracle will also emphasise that it and rivals face intense pressure to cut prices in some areas because of increased competition from niche vendors. 																								But on pricing, antitrust officials will argue discount forms created by Oracle sales staff show the company views its primary competitor  and the biggest drag on its pricing power  as PeopleSoft, followed by SAP. 																								PeopleSoft has told analysts that uncertainty over the merger attempt could make existing and potential customers hold off placing orders until an outcome is reached. 																								The company said in April its legal costs were around $55 million since Oracle launched its bid last June, cutting about 10 cents off quarterly earnings per share, and costs would also cut into earnings in the current quarter and beyond. 																								PeopleSoft, which has rejected Oracles advances several times, traded at $17.48 on Friday, about 23 per cent below their 2003 closing level. 																								Oracle has also not escaped market setbacks. This week, Prudential Equity Group cut Oracles rating to neutral from overweight, citing concerns about its ability to grow. 																								Oracle shares traded Friday at $11.07, down roughly 16 per cent from the end of last year.

 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Search begins for NHPC top post 
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, July 15: The Public Sector Enterprises Board (PSEB) has asked the government agencies to send the names of candidates for the post of chairman and managing director of National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC).																								Yogendra Prasad, who is currently the CMD of NHPC, is scheduled to retire on April 30, 2005. However, the decision by PSEB to invite candidates for the post assumes significance since it will thwart any move by Prasad to seek an extension.																								The Centre has allocated about Rs 32,000 crore to NHPC during the Tenth Plan period, of which only Rs 7 crore has been spent so far.																								Considering the emphasis that both the NDA and UPA governments have put on harnessing hydro-power potential, the post of CMD of NHPC gives the incumbent an opportunity to play an important role in the power sector. The hydro-power potential in the country has been identified at about 50,000 MW.																								The last date for nomination of candidates for the post is July 20. The PSEB is likely to shortlist the names of the candidates by September and the interviews are likely to be held by year-end.																								Sources in the power ministry said the state governments of Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh, the two states with hydro-power potential of more than 75 per cent in the country, have urged that candidates from their region should be given preference in view of the potential.																								The first proposal for an extension of two years beyond superannuation of Prasad was recommended by the previous minister of state for power, Jaywanti Mehta. However, it was struck down by the Prime Ministers Office and PSEB chairman C. K. Nair. The second proposal was made from the ministry but it was not taken up since the NDA government had lost the election, said a top official in the power ministry.																								The serious contenders for the post of CMD includes S. K. Garg, current director finance in NHPC, and executive director Vinod Gulati, who has already been selected as director personnel. Among the outsiders, the hot contender for the post is S. C. Sharma, chairman of North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (Neepco). New PESB chief																								RSSLN Bhaskarudu has taken over as the new chairman of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB). Bhaskarudu, former managing director of Maruti Udyog, takes over from T. K. A. Nair who has moved to the PMO, an official statement said today.

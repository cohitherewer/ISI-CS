 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Fee to revenue, govt tunes FM anew
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sound check																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: The telecom regulator has proposed a bailout for private FM radio broadcasters, which is a throwback to August 1999, when a similar package was offered to telecom operators.																								The private FM operators  who, like the telecom operators, had bid huge amounts for their licences  are being offered a revenue-sharing arrangement with the government. 																								Existing FM broadcasters, who have been wailing about crippling licence fees they have to pay with no real revenues to show, will be allowed to migrate to the new arrangement if the government accepts the recommendation made today by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).																								But the big difference this time round is that the government will not stand to lose more than Rs 10 crore if they allow private FM broadcasters to migrate to a revenue-sharing regime. Five years ago, when the telecom players were offered a similar dispensation, the government suffered a Rs 1,900-crore loss.																								The private FM operators have paid a licence fee of Rs 108.08 crore during 2003-04 and Rs 84.07 crore during 2002-03. The licence fee on an average is about Rs 10 crore for the metros, while it varies in the case of smaller cities.																								The telecom regulator has asked the information and broadcasting ministry not to allow news and current affairs programmes on private FM radio and follow the current restrictions.																								Trai has suggested that the restrictions on news and current affairs programmes could be reviewed later and lifted by the government if adequate safeguards are in place.																								Trai, which doubles up as a broadcasting regulator after an amendment to the relevant act, today recommended a revenue-sharing model with a one-time low entry fee to be fixed from the various options offered by the regulator. 																								It has recommended a 4 per cent share of the gross revenue for FM radio broadcasting licences to be issued to private players in the second phase. 																								Trai has not set any caps or restriction on the number of bidders. It has also recommended that companies which had secured licences in the first phase of bidding should be allowed to migrate if they cleared the second phase.																								However, the licensees of the first phase will be required to clear all their dues, withdraw all their pending litigations and should not default on any licensing conditions to get a licence in the second round. 																								A senior Trai official said, They (private FM radio operators) will not be allowed to bid for the second round if they do not clear their dues and withdraw all the existing litigations.																								Trai has recommended that all the conditions should be fulfilled by the existing licensee, effective from the start of the financial year in which the letter of intent was issued to them.																								They could also be given an option to terminate their existing licence within a month against the existing prerequisite of 12 months or to continue with the terms and condition of Phase-I licence.																								The regulator has also recommended that the maximum number of frequencies possible should be allowed in metros, Hyderabad and Bangalore. A minimum of two frequencies should be offered even in the smallest town in order to ensure competition, variety of programming and low entry costs. It has also suggested flexibility in conditions in order to optimise technical specifications.

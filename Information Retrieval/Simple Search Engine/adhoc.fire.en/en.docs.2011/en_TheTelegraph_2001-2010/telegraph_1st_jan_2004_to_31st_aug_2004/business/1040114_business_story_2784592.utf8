 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Tata Power to spin off broadband business
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Tata Power MD Feroze Vandrewala: Far-sighted																								Mumbai, Jan. 13: Tata Power Company plans to transfer its broadband business to Tata Power Broadband Company Pvt Ltd (TPBCL) through a business transfer agreement.																								The broadband division has around 60 clients and provides a backbone for transporting bulk traffic of various providers of internet, data and voice services (call centres).																								The broadband division functions as a carriers carrier and it can leverage better by becoming a company in its own right, an analyst tracking the company said.																								The power utility has so far invested Rs 120 crore in the broadband business and proposes to invest another Rs 30 crore.																								The move assumes significance as BSES, another major private sector power utility, had recently hived off its broadband operations into a separate company. Analysts tracking the company say the proposed spin-off will help the business acquire a sharper focus.																								There is also a possibility that VSNL, Tata groups international long distance operator, may take a substantial stake in the company. The synergies between the broadband operations and VSNL are tremendous, the analyst said.																								Analysts also feel that merging the broadband division with its telecom business in future would be more fruitful than by keeping it with the power utility. 																								The board, scheduled to meet on January 20, will consider transferring the broadband division comprising the business of providing dark fibre and ducts as a category-I infrastructure provider to TPBCL, Tata Power informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today.																								The transfer would also include the provision of end-to- end bandwidth in its capacity as category-II infrastructure provider and provision of internet telephony services as an internet services provider.																								In the Mumbai-Pune region, with about 800 km of fibre network, TPBCL serves all major telecom service providers and other carriers, including fixed, mobile, national long distance, international long distance, internet service providers, call centres, data centres and cable operators with very high speed connectivity.																								The broadband business is said to have turned profitable from the first year of its existence. 																								Earlier, the broadband business had plans of connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad through a national optic fibre network. However, the acquisition of VSNL by the Tata group a couple of years ago changed these plans.																								The Tata Group had earlier explored the option of transferring the broadband business of Tata Power to VSNL, which also happens to be one of Tata Power Broadbands biggest customers.

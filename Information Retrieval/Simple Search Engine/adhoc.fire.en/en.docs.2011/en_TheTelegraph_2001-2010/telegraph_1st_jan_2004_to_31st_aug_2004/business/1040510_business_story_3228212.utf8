The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Uco charts trajectory for 25% growth 
																								Calcutta, May 9 (PTI): Encouraged by overshooting the growth target of 2003-04, city-based Uco Bank has targeted a 25 per cent growth to reach a total business of Rs 75,000 crore during the current financial year.																								The bank is also expecting a 26.58 per cent increase in operating profit to Rs 1,200 crore from Rs 948 crore in 2003-04 and 26.44 per cent increase in net profit to Rs 550 crore from Rs 435 crore last year.																								Ucos vision is to become a bank with Rs 1,00,000 crore worth of business by March, 2007.																								We had set a target of Rs 59,000 crore of total business in 2003-04, but ended up with Rs 60,587 crore. This time we have targeted Rs 75,000 crore for 2004-05, Uco Bank chairman and managing director V. P. Shetty said.																								Giving a break-up, he said, it was expected that deposits in 2004-05 would grow by 18.74 per cent to Rs 46,600 crore from Rs 39,244 crore and advances by 33.06 per cent to Rs 28,400 crore from Rs 21,343 crore last year.																								Investments were likely to grow by 21.80 per cent to Rs 21,500 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 17,662 crore last year.																								To achieve the target a series of initiatives, including networking of the top 200 branches, had been launched that would lead to core banking solutions, the CMD said.																								Apart from traditional areas, we will focus on more fee-based income by diversifying into new areas like bancassurance, agency for collection business, selling of mutual fund products and trading in derivatives, he said.																								Other focus areas would be growth in low cost deposits, more emphasis on small and medium enterprises, more effective credit administration to ensure asset quality and arrest slippage, Shetty added.																								There would be continuous innovation for mid-market products, including relaunching products in the retail segment making them more competitive and customer friendly.

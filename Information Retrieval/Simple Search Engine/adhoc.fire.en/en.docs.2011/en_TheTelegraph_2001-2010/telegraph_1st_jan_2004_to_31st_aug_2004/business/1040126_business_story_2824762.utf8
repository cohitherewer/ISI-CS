		 Monday, January 26, 2004  Q amp;A				 Missing link
																																																																																													I had purchased 100 shares of Janak Turbo Dynamics in 1995. Trading in these shares has stopped, and I cant trace the company. I had written to Sebi about it in 2002, but it did not help. Please help me trace the company.																																																																													S. Sanyal, Madhya Pradesh
																																																																																													I had bought shares in various companies in the early nineties. But most of them are not traded any more. Ive not received dividend from them since 1994. I had written to them but they did not respond. Please advise how I could sell these shares.																																																																													J. C. Daw, Dhanbad
																																																																																													The companies appear to have disappeared, and it is unlikely that youd ever be able sell the shares. Every time the market is on a song, a large number of companies issue shares to raise capital from the public, and disappear soon after. Check the credentials of the company thoroughly before investing in its shares. You could report these companies to Sebi. We could forward your complaint to Sebi should you want us to do so. But its unlikely that writing to Sebi would help you sell these shares.																																					Playing safe																																																																																															I am 37 years old earning Rs 42,000 a year. How could I invest my money? Please suggest some safe instruments.																																																																													S. Dutta, Calcutta
																																																																																													You should invest your money in secure assets like 8 per cent RBI Bonds or post office monthly income scheme (MIS). However, these instruments lock up your funds for a certain length of time. If you need your cash to stay liquid, you could consider investing in debt mutual funds  they are relatively stable and offers a better return than bank fixed deposits.																																					Taxing times																																																																																															My annual income from deposits is Rs 110,000. I have to file tax return every year, which is tedious. My husband used to do it for me, but now Ill have to do it myself. Could you suggest how I could invest so that I do not have to pay tax and file returns?																																																																													Sati Ghosh, Tripura
																																																																																													With this level of income, youd have to file income tax return every year however tedious it might be. Being a woman, you are entitled to a special tax rebate of Rs 5,000, and if youre above the age of 65, youre entitled to a rebate of Rs 20,000. Investing in tax-free instruments does not help. You should invest in high-yielding instruments like the post office MIS and 8 per cent RBI Bonds, and avoid paying tax by investing in assets that entitle you to tax rebate under section 88.

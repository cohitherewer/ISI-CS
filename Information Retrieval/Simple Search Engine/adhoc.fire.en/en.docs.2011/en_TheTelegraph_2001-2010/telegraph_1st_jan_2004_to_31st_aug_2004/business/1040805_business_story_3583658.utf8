Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 4: Dishergarh Power Supply Company (DPSC) plans to invest Rs 240 crore to increase its capacity from 40 MW to 100 MW.																								We have asked Tata Consulting Engineering to carry out a feasibility study of the expansion plan. Once that is done we will go in for financial closure, said S. Radhakrishnan, director and chief executive of DPSC.																								DPSC, which mostly supplies power to Asansol, has planned the capacity rejig due to increased industrial activity in the region.																								On whether they would join hands with Tata Power and Reliance Energy  companies keen on power distribution in the east  he said, We have not yet thought about it. Maybe at a later date we may think about it. 																								He, however, ruled out a joint venture with a private partner for the generation business.																								The company has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Malaysias Salim Group for setting up a 100-MW power station in Bengal.																								Nothing has firmed up yet. We cannot say when the 100-MW project with the Salim Group will take shape, Radhakrishnan said.																								Financial institutions hold a 42 per cent stake in DPSC. Out of this, Life Insurance Corporation alone owns 30 per cent. Descon, a subsidiary of DPSC, holds 31.6 per cent, Andrew Yule and its group companies together own 15.5 per cent, while the remaining is with the public.																								DPSC is involved in information technology, ITES, power engineering consultancy and management consultancy through its subsidiary Descon.																								DPSC holds a 20 per cent stake in Descon, while 80 per cent is with the employees of Descon and DPSC. Descon was set up in 1995.																								The decision to promote a separate consultancy and support services organisation in the energy sector was prompted by the governments policy to liberalise the sector and encourage private sector participation in power reforms, he added.																								Descon, which develops webpage has 20 clients already. Today it launched a webpage for Ladies Counter, a shop in New Market.																								Radhakrishna said, We are trying to add value to our existing areas of operation and offer more services to our clients. We also develop websites and this is one of our thrust areas.

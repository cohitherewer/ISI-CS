 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Selloff panel members quit
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 25: Even before the Left parties could rake up the controversy over divestment, members of the Disinvestment Commission, including its chairman R. H. Patil, have tendered their resignations to erstwhile disinvstment minister Arun Shourie.																								The scrapping of the disinvestment ministry was a foregone conclusion in the wake of the Congress-led government coming to power with the support of the Left parties, according to divestment experts.																								The name for a disinvestment minister was conspicuous by its absence when cabinet portfolios were announced. Instead, there was a new ministry called non-resident affairs, with Delhi Sadar MP Jagdish Tytler in charge.																								Disinvestment ministry sources said Patil, along with four other part-time members, sent in their resignations to Shourie soon after the election results were announced to allow the new government to recast the panel in its own fashion.																								The resignations of T. L. Shankar, . V. Iyer, V. V. Desai and K. R. S. Murthy are, however, still pending with the government. 																								The Disinvestment Commission was reconstituted in 2001 after remaining dormant for two years, initially for a two-year period, and was given a years extension till October 2004.																								The commission was first set up in 1996-97. It was the creation of the United Front government under the chairmanship of G. V. Ramakrishna.

 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Incentives sprinkled on farmers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Touted as a farm-friendly interim budget, Union finance minister Jaswant Singh gave a few sops to the farm sector and the sugar industry. 																								Gearing itself up for the coming polls, the BJP government said it was committed to a second green revolution.																								The government has already reduced the rate of interest for crop loans by public sector banks to 9 per cent  so that is not exactly a new announcement. However, Singh said Indian Banks Association has been urged to further lower the interest rates on farm loans.																								Banks are being advised to assess individual credit worthiness and to not routinely insist on additional collateral through a mortgage of the entire land holding. As a principle, collateral security should be proportionate to the value of the loan, Singh said.																								The minister also said all farmers will be eligible for kisan credit cards by March 31. A committee is being set up under eminent agricultural economist V. S. Vyas to go into all issues relating to agriculture credit, while keeping in mind non-performing assets (NPAs) norms of banks and collateral security.																								The committee will submit its recommendations within 90 days.																								The minister also announced that the existing kisan credit card will hereafter be modified, upon individual request, for use of ATM machines where such facilities exist.																								Singh also announced a revitalisation package for the industry in consultation with all the stakeholders. 																								As a measure of temporary relief, restructuring of loans taken by sugar factories will be examined by the lending agencies, including banks, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), the finance minister said.																								The government announced that a national cattle development board will be set up through central government funding. 																								This is meant to give a boost to the entire gamut of economic activity such as animal husbandry, dairying and sheep rearing, the finance minister said. 																								A farm income insurance scheme has been introduced by the ministry for agriculture in 20 districts, on a pilot basis. This will be extended to 100 districts of the country from the forthcoming kharif season. The details of the scheme will be announced later by the agriculture ministry, the finance minister said.

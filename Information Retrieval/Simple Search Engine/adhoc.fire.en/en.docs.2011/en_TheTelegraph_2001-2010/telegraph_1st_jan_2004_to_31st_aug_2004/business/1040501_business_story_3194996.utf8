 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Accounting norms for bad assets
																								Mumbai, April 30 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India today issued guidelines on accounting standards to be followed by banks for stopping operations and impaired assets.																								Merger or closure of branches by transferring assets or liabilities to other centres of the same bank may not be deemed as a discontinuing operation. The standard will not be applicable in such cases.																								Disclosures would be required under the accounting standard only when discontinuing of the operation has resulted in shedding of liability and realisation of the assets. It will also be needed if the bank decides to discontinue an operation that has the same effect.																								Referring to accounting standards on impairment of assets, the central bank said it will not apply to investments, inventories and financial assets such as loans and advances and may generally be applicable to banks in so far as it relates to fixed assets. The two standards are effective from the accounting period beginning April 1.																								The standards pertaining to intangible assets were in force since April last year.

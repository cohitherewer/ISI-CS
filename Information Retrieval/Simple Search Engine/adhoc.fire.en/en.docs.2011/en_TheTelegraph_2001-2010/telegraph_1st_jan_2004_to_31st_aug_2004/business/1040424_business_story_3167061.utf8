 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 New unit for Tata Ryerson 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 23: Tata Ryerson will set up a cold-rolled coil processing plant in Faridabad for Rs 30 crore to tap the growing demand from the auto industry in the northern region.																								Talking to The Telegraph, Tata Ryerson managing director S. Chakravortty said the new plant, which will increase processing capacity by around five lakh tonnes, will be commissioned in the next one year.																								Chakravortty also said with the commissioning of the new facility, the company will be able to cater to the auto industry in the north more effectively.																								The company, which registered a turnover of Rs 194 crore last year, has set an ambitious target of crossing Rs 1000 crore by 2010.																								However, Chakravortty said going by the growth in demand and net price realisation, the company will try to cross the magical figure of Rs 1000 crore much ahead of the targeted year. Tata Ryerson is a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and Ryerson Tull of the US.

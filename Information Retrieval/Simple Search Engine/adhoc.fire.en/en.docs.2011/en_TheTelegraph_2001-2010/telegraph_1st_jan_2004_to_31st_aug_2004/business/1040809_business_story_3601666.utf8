 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Rains lift cloud on mutuals MIP yield
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 8: The monsoon has brought good news for the monthly income plans (MIPs) of mutual funds after a three-month drought.																								Last month saw the MIPs posting positive returns after three months, with 0.51 per cent as the average. Investors can, therefore, hope to receive a monthly income, albeit a smaller amount.																								Since yields from the debt instruments continue to head south, the modest returns is mostly attributed to the revival of the equity market, the prime cause of the downturn in the payout by these funds.																								Although MIPs are not assured-return schemes, investors are generally under the impression that the fund will provide a steady monthly income like the post office scheme. It, therefore, came as a rude shock when most MIPs skipped dividends for the monthly options in June and the quarterly options in April-June due to the negative returns posted by them. Only those having sufficient time to build up buffers managed not to skip dividends.																								Investors were at a loss because even five months back, all mutual fund houses were launching MIPs one after the other and people were busy identifying the plan to invest.																								Fund managers said most people fail to realise that if equities can add zing to the returns from the debt portfolios of the MIPs during buoyant phases in the stock market, they can also hack returns in case of a sharp reversal in share prices. For instance, even a 10-per cent erosion in the equity holdings of an MIP that allocates just 10 per cent of its portfolio to shares, can shave as much as 1 percentage point off its returns.																								Now that the decline in interest rates has come to a halt, debt market yields have reduced considerably. The only hope of returns comes from the equity markets, but again its volatile nature sometimes takes a toll on the returns.																								Also, since MIPs are debt-oriented hybrid funds, 12.5 per cent dividend withholding tax for retail investors and 20 per cent dividend tax for corporate investors apply.

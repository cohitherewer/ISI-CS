The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 UBI vows to stay fit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 UBI chief P. Singh in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, May 12: United Bank of India (UBI) hopes to wipe out the accumulated loss accrued in 1992, following the introduction of prudential norms, by 2006.																								The bank will also trim its bad loans or non-performing assets (NPA) to below 2 per cent within the next two years. The banks net NPA stood at 3.75 per cent of advances as on March 31 this year.																								We have an accumulated loss of Rs 577 crore, which we hope to wipe out by 2006, chairman and managing director Parkash Singh said today.																								The bank has posted a net profit of Rs 315 crore in 2003-04, a mere Rs 10 crore (Rs 305 crore) more than 2002-03.																								Explaining the marginal rise in net, Singh said the bank has made an additional provisioning of Rs 75 crore over and above the provisioning of Rs 108 crore which was done in keeping with the normal RBI guidelines. This has impacted our net profit, he said.																								The additional provisioning was done on the Reserve Banks advice to clean up the banks books.																								The bank has made a cash recovery of Rs 114 crore in 2003-04. In 2004-05, the bank has set an ambitious target of making a cash recovery of Rs 200 crore.																								The capital adequacy ratio of the bank has reached 17.04 per cent and Singh has ruled out further capitalisation in the near future. Our tier-I capital is 15.04 per cent and this can take care of an additional business of Rs 5,000 crore. If we need additional capital we can raise our tier-II capital, which is only at 2 per cent, he said.																								The bank has done business worth Rs 31,179 crore in 2003-04 and has set a target of raising it by another 20 per cent to reach the Rs 37,000-crore-mark in the current fiscal.																								UBI has formed a corporate business group to handle credit sanctions of Rs 10 crore and above. The group is headed by a general manager. The CMD said in the current fiscal the bank has so far sanctioned proposals worth Rs 2,000 crore.																								The bank has also decided to rationalise its branches to rev up business efficiency.

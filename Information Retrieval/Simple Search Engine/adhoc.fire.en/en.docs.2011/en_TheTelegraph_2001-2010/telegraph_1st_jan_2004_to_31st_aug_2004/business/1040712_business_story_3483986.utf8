The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 SPS to merge group firms
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Team spirit																								Calcutta, July 11: SPS Steel Rolling Mills and SPS Sponge Iron will be brought under one roof to consolidate steel production at the Calcutta-based group.																								Managing director Bipin Vohra said the process of merger will be through by 2007, by when the total capacity of finished steel will go up four times. Initially, the name of SPS Sponge Iron will be changed to SPS Steel and Power Ltd (SSPL). Later, the SPS Steel Rolling Mills will be merged with SSPL, he added.																								The company has already applied to the Registrar of Companies for the name change. The group, which also has wide interests in entertainment, plans to carry on its steel business through SSPL, whose turnover is projected at more than Rs 1500 crore in 2007.																								SPS Metalcast and Ferro Alloys, both money-losing ventures, will be closed down gradually. The land, equipment and staff of SPS Metalcast will shift to SSPL, Vohra said. 																								The group has an integrated mini-steel plant in Durgapur with around 1000 workers. It is setting up two greenfield units, one each in Orissa and Himachal Pradesh, with an investment of Rs 430 crore to raise its steel capacity from one lakh tonnes to four lakh tonnes.																								The biggest chunk of its Rs 380-crore investment will go to Jharsuguda, where it will set up a sponge-iron unit, billet-caster, power station, blast furnace and rolling mills. In Himachal Pradesh, Rs 50 crore will be pumped in to build a billet-caster and rolling mills. The expansion is expected to take the groups turnover to Rs 1250 crore and net profit to Rs 60 crore in 2005-06. 																								In Jharsuguda, the group will spend Rs 122 crore on a sponge-iron facility and a billet-caster. The second phase, expected to be over in a year, will see the setting up of the power plant, blast furnace and rolling mills.																								A ferro-alloy joint venture with Motex India will also come up in the Orissa town at a cost of Rs 80 crore. The plant in Himachal Pradesh will help the group grab a bigger slice of the market in the northern region.

																								Mumbai, March 14 (PTI): Merchant bankers to ONGCs public offer are understood to have recommended a discounted price of Rs 712.50 for retail investors, who will get 25 per cent of the issue.

The total mop-up from the issue could be Rs 10,500 crore, which will help the government get Rs 800 crore more than the selloff target fixed for this financial year. 																								The total mobilisation from six public issues could be over Rs 14,000 crore. This, coupled with earlier proceeds, could take the divestment kitty to Rs 15,300 crore.

The official announcement will be made tomorrow, after the ministers of disinvestment, petroleum and finance approve the price.																								Merchant bankers told officials disinvestment and petroleum ministries that bids 5.9 times the offer were received at the top of the price-band of Rs 680-Rs 750.

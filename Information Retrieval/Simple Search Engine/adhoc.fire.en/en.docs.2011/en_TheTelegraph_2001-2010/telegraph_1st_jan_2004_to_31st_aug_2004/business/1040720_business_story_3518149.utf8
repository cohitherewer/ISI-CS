 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 India discards WTO draft on farm trade
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 19: India today virtually rejected the draft framework for negotiations circulated by the WTO to the 148 member countries as it was biased against the farm sector of the developing countries.																								We believe that much work will have to be done in making the draft text acceptable, the commerce ministry said in a statement issued here today.																								Intense negotiations are expected to take place on the issue during the next two weeks. From Indias standpoint, the draft on agriculture does not provide the required balance, fairness or equity between the provisions for the developed countries and those of developing countries.																								We find that there is a greater level of specificity on matters of interest to the developed countries and a greater level of generality in respect of the special and differential treatment components of the developing countries. What is disappointing is the lack of appreciation of developing countries sensitivities in agriculture. This is particularly true of those developing countries where subsistence agriculture prevails and where the rural population is dependent on agriculture for their food and livelihood security. We expect that these would be suitably addressed in the next few days during the negotiations if there is to be a consensus on the agriculture framework. We shall be working with the G-20 on agriculture and jointly put forward our concerns in the discussions at Geneva, the statement says.																								In the other areas of Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), Singapore issues and on implementation issues as well as special and differential treatment (S amp;DT), India is ready to work with other members of WTO in order to arrive at a consensus.																								The draft framework is a first text and underlines the explicit recognition that this would be only a basis for further negotiations in view of the fact that serious divergences in positions of the WTO member countries have emerged as reflected in the current status of the negotiations.																								The draft is being negotiated in Geneva starting from July 19 and an amended version of the draft, which will be produced after incorporating the responses of WTO members, will be considered by the General Council of the WTO next week.																								The draft focuses on negotiations in areas of market access in agricultural products, non-agricultural products and services, Singapore issues and developmental and implementation issues, without implying that the other areas of the Doha work programme are relegated to a lower priority.

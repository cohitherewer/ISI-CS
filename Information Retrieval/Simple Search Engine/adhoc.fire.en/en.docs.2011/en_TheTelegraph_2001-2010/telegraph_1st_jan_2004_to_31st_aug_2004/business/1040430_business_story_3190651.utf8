 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 CESC profits power ahead
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Lit up																								Calcutta, April 29: CESC, the RPG-controlled private power utility, has registered an unaudited profit before tax of Rs 70 crore in 2003-04 against a net profit of Rs 7 crore in the previous year.																								The net sales of the company has gone up by 7.91 per cent to Rs 2,358 crore compared with Rs 2,185 crore in 2002-03.																								Managing director Sumantra Banerjee has attributed this high profit to three reasons, namely a major improvement in transmission and distribution (T amp;D) losses, lower interest and financing charges and a reduction in high-cost imports.																								Banerjee said there has been a 35-40 per cent reduction in the pilferage component of T amp;D losses from the peak levels in 2000-01.																								Following the debt restructuring of the company, the interest cost has come down by 3-4 per cent on an average. There has been substantial savings in this area, Banerjee added. The total debt burden of CESC is Rs 3,000 crore.																								The fourth-quarter results of the company show that it has registered a net profit of Rs 17 crore against a loss of Rs 2 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.																								CESCs power purchase in 2003-04 was 863 million units compared with 1,162 million units in the previous year. Reduction in the high-cost import of power has also boosted our overall performance, Banerjee said.																								The company has been able to reduce the plant load factor (PLF) substantially. The PLF of Budge Budge, Titagarh and Southern generating stations combined was 80 per cent compared with 76 per cent in 2002-03.																								A release said the final tariff order for the current and the two previous financial years is still awaited. The net sales of the company for 2003-04 has been accounted based on the interim tariff order dated April 23, 2003. Therefore, the figure might change following the final order by the West Bengal State Electricity Regulatory Commission.

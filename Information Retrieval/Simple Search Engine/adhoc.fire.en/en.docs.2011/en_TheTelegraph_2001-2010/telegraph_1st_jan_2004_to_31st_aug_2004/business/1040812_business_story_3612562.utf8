 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Aviva to hire 1100 more by year end
 GARIMA SINGH																								Dubai, Aug. 11: Private life insurer Aviva is all set to expand its base and increase headcount at its call-centres in India.																								We will add nearly 1,100 people by the year-end to take the total number of people working in these centres to 3,800. At present, the staff strength is around 2,700 working across India, said John Hodgson, service improvement director, outsourcing (Norwich Union), Aviva, during the two-day insurance summit held here.																								He said the seventh largest insurer in the world was also interested in opening more such call-centres in the near future. He, however, did not put a number to it. The company claims that it is the offshoring business, which has led to an increase of about 37 per cent in their total profit base.																								The UK-based insurance company had said that moving jobs to India played an important part in the rise in profit. It believes that a shift to processing in India had given the company a competitive advantage with a workforce to match that in the UK.																								 We are hiring people from India because of their quality and their skills. An average Indian call-centre professional speaks 180 English words a minute, while an English national speaks 120 words, Hodgson said.																								The insurer admitted that it was hard to find people with similar skills in the UK coupled with the cost and quality of the Indian labour market.																								Moreover, the global IT bandwidth is readily available in India and is increasingly becoming stable. He added that there is an increased consumer satisfaction in the UK.																								The offshore back-office operations have helped the insurer trim its operational costs by almost 40 per cent. Hodsgon said the company was using several outsourcing models. These include body shopping, straight outsourcing, self-building, managed service and build operate and transfer models.																								Aviva, which belongs to the Norwich Unions group, said its profits have improved to 1.13 billion mainly due to the performance in the area of general insurance where an upfront commitment on a substantial element of personal claims processing in India has helped slash costs.

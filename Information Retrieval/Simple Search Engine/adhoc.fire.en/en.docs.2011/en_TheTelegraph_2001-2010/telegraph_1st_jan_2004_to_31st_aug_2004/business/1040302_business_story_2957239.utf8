 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Officers seek bank loans to buy shares
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, March 1: The ONGC officers association has asked its management to arrange bank loans for its employees to enable them to buy company shares through the public offer opening on March 5.																								A high-level meeting was held at ONGC corporate headquarters here today but no final decision has been taken on the matter as yet.																								ONGC will become the second company after Gail (India) Ltd to provide this facility for its employees if the management accedes to the request of the officers association.																								A senior company official told The Telegraph that the ONGC officers association had presented its request even before the Gail decision was announced. 																								With large volumes of these high-value stocks being unloaded on the stock market, the question always arises whether there is adequate liquidity in the hands of investors to buy them. Gail had, therefore, decided to arrange bank loans for its employees in order to generate a more buoyant demand for the stocks.																								It is also expected to send a signal to other investors that the employees have enough confidence in the prospects of the company and are even willing to take bank loans to purchase shares.																								The government is moving cautiously as the domestic stock markets are notorious for manipulators constantly on the lookout for a fast buck. The current revival in the stock prices is also attributed to the fact that the government-owned financial institutions have sold some of their mid-cap shares and picked up the PSU scrips on sale. 																								The current market price of ONGC has crossed Rs 760 per share. The 10 per cent shares that have been reserved for company employees work out to around 335 shares per employee. Each employee would have to shell out over Rs 2.5 lakh for picking up his or her entitled quota of shares, an amount normally difficult to arrange on an individual basis.																								The government will be announcing the floor price of the share on March 4 on the basis of the market feedback given by book-running lead managers  Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Kotak Mahindra.																								The lead managers claim that the recent fluctuations in the stock market were not likely to have a bearing on the price that would be based on the strong fundamentals of the company.

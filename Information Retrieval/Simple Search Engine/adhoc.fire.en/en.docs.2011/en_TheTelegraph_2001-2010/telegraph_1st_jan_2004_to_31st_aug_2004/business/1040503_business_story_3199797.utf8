 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Petronet bonds to repay costly loans 
																								New Delhi, May 2 (PTI): Petronet is likely to launch two bond issues of Rs 525 crore each next month to pre-pay high-cost debt and fund the expansion of its Dahej terminal. 																								The first issue of Rs 525 crore will be guaranteed by the Asian Development Bank and will replace a term-loan, company director (finance) P. Dasgupta said.																								ICICI Securities has been appointed the lead arranger while Standard Chartered and JM Morgan Stanley are co-arrangers for the privately placed bonds. The proceeds of the issue will be used to prepay part of the Rs 1825-crore debt Petronet raised for building Indias first LNG import terminal at Dahej in Gujarat.																								Project loans were raised at about 9 per cent and the ADB-guaranteed bonds would carry a coupon rate of 6.25 per cent, thereby reducing our interest outgo, he said. 																								Petronets agreement with a consortium of 14 banks which lent it Rs 1,825 crore, has no pre-payment liability.																								The company, which hopes to clock a $1.3-billion turnover by selling 5 million tonnes of LNG imported from Qatar next fiscal, will raise another Rs 525 crore to meet the debt portion of the Rs 750 crore expansion of the Dahej terminal capacity to 10 million tonnes by 2007-08.																								We have asked StanChart to arrange a guarantee of $70 million from the World Bank, the Netherlands or any other multilateral agency by the month end, ahead of the July date for construction to begin, he added.																								While the second bond issue may have a one-bullet repayment schedule after eight years, the ADB-guaranteed bonds will have a 12-year term, equal to term loans. 																								Our loans have a moratorium of two-and-a-half years. The bonds would mirror the 12-year repayment cycle, Dasgupta said.

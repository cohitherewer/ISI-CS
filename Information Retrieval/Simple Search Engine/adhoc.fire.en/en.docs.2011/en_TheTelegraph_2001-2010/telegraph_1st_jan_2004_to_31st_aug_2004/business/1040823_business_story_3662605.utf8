 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Tata Steel springs surprise price cut
 															- Industry powerhouse roars at home and abroad  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT First to go 																								Mumbai, Aug. 22: Ratan Tata rousted industry shoguns out of their Sunday siestas with the announcement that Tata Steel would reduce prices by Rs 2,000 per tonne in a decision that takes immediate effect.																								The move follows appeals from steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan that the onus of a reduction lay on steel firms. It also comes close on the heels of Fridays slash in duties on the metal as part of the governments attempts to rein in the runaway inflation rate, now near 8 per cent. 																								Rising inflation should be a concern for us all. The economy has seen a turn-around last year after three years of an economic slump. The recent upward spiral of prices will, without doubt, dampen the current robust consumer demand for goods. Responsible companies need to exercise moderation at all levels in an endeavour to hold the price-line, the Tata group chief said.																								Industry was caught unawares. A top executive working for a south-based private steel firm said he had no clue. What can we say now. I am on my way to Delhi, he added. 																								As if leading by example, Tata said the Indian industry must stand together, display moderation, and desist from making exploitative profits to arrest inflation, which can negatively impact the current growth rate. The message: Roll back recent steel price hikes.																								An analyst said the dramatic reduction on the part of Tisco  whose steel prices vary between Rs 26000 and Rs 32000 a tonne  are redolent of war-time measures. He was not sure if other steel firms, many of which do not own iron-ore and coal mines like Tata Steel, would respond to Tatas appeals in the way he wants them to.																								Ispat officials say they have not raised prices any way, so they are already in line. Big daddy Steel Authority of India was silent. 																								Another executive with a private steel firm said his senior colleagues, at the factories today, would take stock of the situation arising out of Tata Steels cut on Monday.																								Tata Steels reduction is expected to moderate the pressures on price increases by key steel users, like auto firms.

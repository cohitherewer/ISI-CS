 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Eveready vice-chairman and MD Deepak Khaitan (centre) with director A. Roy (extreme left) and chief financial officer S. Saha in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, June 28: Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL), which will retain the FMCG segment following a split in the companys businesses, will have to bear most of the Rs 750-crore debt burden. 																								The board today approved the demerger of bulk tea and FMCG (battery, flashlights and packet tea) businesses. The demerger will be effective from April 1, 2004.																								The bulk tea business will be spun off into a new company called McLeod Russell India Limited.																								Post-demerger, the paid-up share capital of the company will drop to Rs 27.89 crore from Rs 55.78 crore due to a reduction in the face value of each share from Rs 10 to Rs 5.																								McLeod Russell will issue equivalent numbers of shares of face value of Rs 5 each to all existing shareholders of EIIL, which will amount to Rs 27.89 crore.																								The promoters and their associates will hold a 61 per cent stake in both companies. The rest will be with financial institutions, banks and the public. The financial nitty-gritty and the ratios are currently being worked out.																								Deepak Khaitan will continue as the executive vice-chairman and managing director of both companies, while B. M. Khaitan will be chairman.																								The company has suffered a loss of Rs 38.27 lakh in 2003-04 compared with a net profit of Rs 11.13 crore. The company has recorded net sales of Rs 968.23 crore in 2003-04. The interest outgo was Rs 42.25 crore.																								We suffered a loss last year due to a drop in bulk tea prices. Of the 40 lakh kgs we produced, around Rs 40 crore was lost on this account. This year, the bulk tea business is looking up and the prices are higher by Rs 15 per kg, Deepak Khaitan said.																								The bulk tea company will have price earning ratios like all other plantation companies such as Tata Tea and Assam Company. EIIL, the FMCG company, will have price earning ratios like Hindustan Lever and Nirma. 																								We will be able to unlock the value of the Eveready brand. So the shareholders will benefit from the demerger exercise, he added.																								The Khaitans may acquire quality tea estates to expand the bulk tea business. At present, they own 28 gardens.																								The battery business currently enjoys a 47 per cent marketshare and hopes to acquire a 50 per cent share. 																								The company wants to boost its packet tea business substantially. It now sells 4,000 tonnes of tea through packets and hopes to take it to 10,000 tonnes by 2005-06.

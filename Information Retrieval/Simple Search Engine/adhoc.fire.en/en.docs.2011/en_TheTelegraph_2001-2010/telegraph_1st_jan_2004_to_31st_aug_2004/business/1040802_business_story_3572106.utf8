The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Move to create room for 2010 check-in
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 get ready for the rush																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: The tourism ministry has asked its urban development counterpart to release 15 sites in the capital to build two- and three-star hotels that are expected to come up before the Commonwealth Games in 2010.																								The city lacks affordable rooms and the introduction of budget hotels could overcome the problem, a senior tourism ministry official said.																								At present, Delhi has 7,000 classified hotel rooms, of which nearly 6,100 belong to the five-star and five-star plus category. 																								We need an additional 15,000 rooms to meet the demand during the games, said the official.																								With land prices ruling at a premium and not enough large plots available for luxury hotels, the tourism ministry has requested its urban development counterpart to release plots of nearly half to one acre each to facilitate the construction of budget hotels.																								The tourism ministry has also suggested the modification of the land policy to allow greater commercial utilisation of the allotted space.																								Currently, only 5 per cent of the land in the case of hotels is allowed for commercial use. As a result, investors prefer to set up only luxury hotels to rake in more profit. To tackle expected growth in inbound traffic, we need more budget hotels than expensive five-star ones, added the official.																								It is learnt that the tourism ministry has proposed allowing up to 40 per cent of the land to be used for commercial purpose to encourage more investment in quality budget hotels.																								Industry insiders say if India is to see real growth in the sector, there is need to enhance airlines capacity and add more budget hotels across the country. 																								The Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association (FHRAI) also believes that the country will see a spate of budget hotels coming up over the next five to seven years. 																								Tourism secretary Rathi Vinay Jha said incentives in the form of an interest subsidy scheme are being offered for one-, two- and three-star hotels as also heritage hotels in the Tenth Plan period (2002-07) to boost private investment in this sector.																								We should cross the 3-million mark (in foreign tourists) this year. The growth has been 20 per cent plus so far and we can expect it to continue, the tourism secretary said.																								She expressed concern over the shortage of flight capacity and hotel rooms during the peak tourism season from October to March.																								Talking of replicating the successful policy adopted by the Delhi government during the 1982 Asian Games, the tourism ministry has again floated the concept of offering overseas tourists paying-guest accommodation in private homes.																								During the 1982 Asian Games, the Delhi government had in fact come out with a directory of paying-guest accommodation available in the city. If this is encouraged not only in Delhi but also elsewhere, it would attract a lot more overseas visitors who would get a chance to observe Indian lifestyles at close quarters, said Jha.																								Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have started offering such accommodation to foreign tourists. 																								Hotel majors like the Tata group have already entered the lucrative budget hotel segment by setting up indiOne Hotels.

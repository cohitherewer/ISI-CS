 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Moodys rates Exim Bank stable
																								London, April 26 (PTI): Global credit rating agency Moodys today assigned for the first time a stable outlook rating to Export-Import Bank of India, even as it factored pressure on interest margins for the Rs 15,520-crore bank.																								Moodys has assigned for the first time a BAA3 foreign currency issuer rating and BA2/not-prime long and short-term foreign currency deposit rating to Exim Bank, the agency said.																								The rating took into account the banks strong recurring profitability over the years despite recent pressure on its interest margins, it said.																								The ratings have stable outlook and reflect Exim Banks successful niche franchise that has been established through its role of supporting the integrated development of Indian exporters business as well as financing, facilitating and promoting the countrys international trade and investment, it said.																								However, Moodys noted that Exim Banks relatively high concentration to the industrial firms, some of which were financially weak, leaving it vulnerable to a possible systemic downturn in the economy although such an eventuality was rather remote in the short to medium term.																								Exim Banks non-performing assets, though slightly higher by international standards, had progressively been reduced during the last three years, it said.																								It said these (NPAs) were adequately provisioned and were also backed by strong capital base that could cushion any unforeseen loan losses.																								The ratings took into account the banks relatively high exposure to the domestic industrial sector and its efforts to change its business mix by placing greater emphasis on its export credit portfolio, Moodys said.																								Nonetheless, the bank has a well diversified exposure sector-wise, with no material concentrations in its portfolio.																								Exim Bank has exhibited strong recurring profitability over the years despite recent pressure on its interest margins. A lean organisational structure means that Exim Bank has a low-cost base that is more than compensated by the banks fairly low non-interest income, Moodys said.

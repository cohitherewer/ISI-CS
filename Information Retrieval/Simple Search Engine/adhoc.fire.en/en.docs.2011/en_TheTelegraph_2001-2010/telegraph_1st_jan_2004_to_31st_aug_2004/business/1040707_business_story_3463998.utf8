 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Punch amp; praise for Laloo lollies
 OUR BUREAUX			New Delhi/Calcutta, July 6: Indian industry generally welcomed the railway budget which came with a trainload of freebies  but there were a few who panned Laloo Prasad Yadavs effort for its short-sighted focus.																								Y. K. Modi, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), welcomed the budget for maintaining operating expenses, providing better safety to passengers, initiating a drive for cleanliness and introducing more passenger amenities. 																								Cross subsidisation in the railway system should be made transparent and a review should be made to identify the loss-making operations and control cost in these areas, he said.																								SAIL chairman V. S. Jain also welcomed the budget pointing out new wagon orders and moves to enlarge the railway network would mean increased demand for steel which could help catalyse economic growth.																								However, PHDCCI president Ravi Wig was caustic in his criticism. The railways are the only high-capacity transport mode that can meet the long-term needs of our economy. Todays budget has not done much to rise above the short-term focus in announcing new initiatives, he said.																								The budget lacked commercial orientation and did not include measures to improve the financial health of the railways, he added. The budget did not talk about setting up of an independent regulator  Rail Tariff Regulatory Authority  to fix up rational railway fares both for passengers and freight.																								Accusing the railways of adding more passenger trains without creating the requisite additional infrastructure, the chamber wanted the railways to come up with high-speed good trains.																								The most disturbing feature is that little progress has been made with regard to track renewal and replacement of signals. Funds allocated for the purpose are grossly inadequate, Wig said.																								Sunil Kant Munjal, president of the Confederation of India Industry was pleased that corporate India was spared the burden of a freight increase  but wondered if Yadav couldnt have done better. Considering that the railway freight traffic has risen by 38.65 million tonnes over last years levels, the railways could have used the opportunity to reduce freight rates to gain its lost share from the road sector, which is progressively becoming more competitive.																								Stating that a number of measures that the railways should have undertaken, Munjal said the budget missed any action on structural reforms, introduction of high-speed and scheduled freight trains and expressed no attempt to leverage idle assets for commercial exploitation.																								Assocham president Mahendra K. Sanghi welcomed the railway budget with human face, but said, Laloo Prasad Yadav has not illustrated on how his ministry will generate resources to support the railways proposed drive for adequate safety measures, its modernisation and upgradation programme.																								C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of Ficcis eastern region, welcomed the railway ministers assurance on completion of the circular railway and metro railway projects in Bengal. The minister has not increased the freight rate and has announced a number of measures for passengers, he said. 																								Indian Chamber of Commerce president Anup Singh said the budget would help sustain the cost competitiveness of cargo movement as freight rates remained same. The focus on development and expansion of infrastructure, increased safety, initiative to facilitate export-import traffic were all industry-friendly measures. Moreover, steps to upgrade the rolling stock would lead to new employment, he added. However, he felt this would require huge investments and the budget was not clear on how this resource would be generated. 																								Bharat Chamber of Commerce said the minister deserves compliments for not increasing freight rates and passenger fares and for the special emphasis on safety and security of passengers. However, there have been no concrete proposals to enhance the functional efficiency and effect cost control. Moreover, the proposals for new trains and the change in the frequency of trains will not benefit Bengal, said P. K. Poddar, vice president of the chamber.																								S. K. Chakraborty, president, Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, appreciated the efforts for identifying issues like improvement of railway infrastructure and modernisation of assets along with the thrust on various passenger amenities. 																								However, he felt that more resources should be diverted towards completion of on-going projects and no direction was given to reforms or enhancing private participation.

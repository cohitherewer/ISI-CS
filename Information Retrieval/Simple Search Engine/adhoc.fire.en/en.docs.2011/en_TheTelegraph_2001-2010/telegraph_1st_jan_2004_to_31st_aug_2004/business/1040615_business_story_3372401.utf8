 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 14: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) constituted working group on financial conglomerates has recommended a system to monitor intra-group transactions and exposures amongst group entities. 																								The group has proposed a new framework, which will be complimentary to the existing regulatory structure consisting of the RBI, the Sebi, the IRDA and the system of consolidated prudential reporting recently introduced with regard to banks. 																								The basic function of the new system will be to identify financial conglomerates, which would be subjected to focused regulatory oversight.																								It would monitor the intra-group transactions and exposures (which are not monitored as of now) amongst the identified financial conglomerate and large exposures of the groups to outside parties.																								The working group has said that a designated entity within each group would be responsible for collating the data of all the entities and submitting the same to its own regulator, which would be the principal regulator for the entire conglomerate. 																								The framework envisages periodic sharing of information amongst regulators on concerns arising out of analysis of data received as part of the proposed format, and any other information outside the reporting format that might have a bearing on the group as a whole.																								The panel has suggested that one of the existing technical committees, consisting of all the three regulators, may function as a standing inter-regulatory forum to address all issues arising out of the proposed framework. 																								This committee would also review the identification criteria periodically, it added.																								RBI governor Y. V. Reddy, in the mid-term review for 2003-04, had announced establishment of a special monitoring system for systemically important financial intermediaries. The group has been renamed as the working group on financial conglomerates.																								The working group has said a company would be designated as a financial conglomerate if there is any group entity coming under the jurisdiction of specified regulators and it has a significant presence in the respective financial market segment as well as operates at least in one more financial market segment.

 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Nestle eyes General Mills 
																								New York, June 5 (Agencies): Nestle, the worlds largest foodmaker, is considering a bid for General Mills to add brands such as Cheerios cereal and Betty Crocker dessert mixes, people close to the matter said.

Nestle may be interested in General Mills at a time when the US companys earnings have been hurt by consumers shift to low-carbohydrate diets.																								General Mills may fetch $22 billion based on the average 26 per cent premium acquirers paid for food companies in past five years.																								Under the two companies joint-venture agreement, Nestle is barred from making a hostile bid to acquire General Mills. That restriction can only be voided by mutual consent.

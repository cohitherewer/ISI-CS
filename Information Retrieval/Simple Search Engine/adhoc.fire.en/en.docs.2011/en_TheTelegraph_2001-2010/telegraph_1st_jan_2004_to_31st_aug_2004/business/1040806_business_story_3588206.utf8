 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Centre for benign rate regime
																								Mumbai, Aug. 5 (PTI): The Centre has been fostering a benign interest rate environment which is not likely to see any turbulence in the near future, Ashok Lahiri, the chief economic advisor to the government, said today.																								Real interest rates have been historically somewhat sluggish and when jerky movements are seen there can be a change. But I do not see a turbulence in the near future, Lahiri told reporters after attending Sebis board meeting. 																								Citing Union finance minister P. Chidambarams view on interest rates, Lahiri said the regime should be benign and balance the concerns of savers and investors. 																								Union expenditure secretary D. Swarup said the governments borrowing programme would not be impacted by the rise in yields and progress as scheduled.

 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 More funds for rural phones
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: The department of telecommunications (DoT) should seek higher allocation for the Universal Service Fund (USF) from the finance ministry to ensure proper telecom facilities in villages.																								The parliamentary standing committee on communications has suggested a hike in allocation as the fund is used to pay those companies that set up phones in villages and remote parts of the country.																								The finance ministry had allocated a mere Rs 200 crore for the USF against a demand of Rs 2,700 crore in 2004-05. 																								The committee in its report states, The matter for a higher fund allocation should be earnestly pursued with the finance ministry, more so because Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) has put a condition that it will be able to replace 64,424 village public telephones based on the faulty multi-access rural radio (MARR) system only if it gets adequate funds from the USF.																								The committee pointed out that DoT has itself agreed that the allocation of Rs 200 crore to the USF will not be sufficient to meet the requirements for 2004-05.																								The members of the committee have also criticised the performance of private operators for their limited contribution in installing VPTs. Of 6.7 lakh villages, only 5.22 lakh have been provided with telephone facility till March 31. While BSNL has installed these phones in 5.09 lakh villages, private operators have covered only 12,665 villages. 																								The committee was pained to observe that the department had been assuring it for the past several years that stringent action would be taken against the private operators for dishonouring the contractual obligations towards telephony, but they paid a paltry sum of Rs 53.75 crore as liquidated damages and switched to the unified access licencing scheme, the report said.																								The committee has also voiced its concern over the increasing waiting list of telephones from BSNL and MTNL and its inability to recover outstanding telephone bills, which has reached Rs 4,968.50 crore till March 31, 2004.																								In another report, the parliamentary standing committee on the department of post has asked the government to speed up the computerisation of international mail processing at Calcutta post offices on a priority basis.

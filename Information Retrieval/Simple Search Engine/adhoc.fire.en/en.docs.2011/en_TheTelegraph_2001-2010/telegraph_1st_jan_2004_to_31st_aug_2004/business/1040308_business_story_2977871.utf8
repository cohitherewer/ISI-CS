 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 ONGC, Hyundai lock horns
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, March 7: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has run into a problem with Hyundai Heavy Industries as the South Korean company is trying to backtrack on its commitments in the Rs 2,600-crore Mumbai High-Uran offshore oil and gas pipeline project for which a contract was signed recently. 																								Sources say that Hyundai had agreed to complete the project by May 2005 but now wants an extension of the deadline by about six months. The Korean company has taken the plea that there is a shortage of barges in the market and it, therefore, would like to carry out the work after the monsoon is over.																								However, this seems to be a lame excuse as it is difficult to believe that a major construction company like Hyundai was not aware of the obvious market trends at the time of signing the contract. The general impression in the oil industry is that Hyundai wants to save money by hiring barges in the lean season even if this means a delay in completing the project.																								ONGC has been forced to issue a legal notice to Hyundai asking it to stick to the terms of the agreement of the contract.																								The oil major has taken recourse to this stern step as Hyundai has submitted a written request and is apparently trying to make out a legal basis for hiking the project cost. 																								Hyundai has submitted 2.5 per cent of the contract value as earnest money, which works out to around $15 million. However, the company has not deposited its performance guarantee with the bank, which is supposed to be 5 per cent of the contract value.																								If the Korean company reneges on the contract it stands to lose the earnest money and performance guarantee as well.																								Hyundai has signed an agreement for laying two pipelines from Mumbai High to ONGCs crude oil and gas storage facility at Uran on the western coast near Mumbai.																								The ONGC management is of the view that the existing pipelines from Mumbai High to Uran technically have a lifespan of 25 years, but are already over 27 years old and therefore, need to be replaced. Some sections, especially along the crude pipeline, tend to leak which slows down the production of oil from the fields and periodical maintenance work is required to keep them going.																								However, some middle-rung ONGC officials are of the view that the company should not go in for new pipelines. Instead it should change only the weak sections of the existing pipelines.																								According to them, these segments should be identified by an independent audit. They further point out that pipelines functioning in far harsher climatic conditions such as Alaska and the North Sea are more than 30 years old and have not been changed.

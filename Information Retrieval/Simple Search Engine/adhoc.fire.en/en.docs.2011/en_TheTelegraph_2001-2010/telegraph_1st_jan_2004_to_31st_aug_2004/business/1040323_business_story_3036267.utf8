 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Court tonic for Cipla shares
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 22: Cipla was a notable gainer on the bourses today after GlaxoSmithKline Plc lost a drug patent challenge case against the company and other generic players in London High Court on Friday.																								The Cipla share opened at Rs 1,100 and rose to an intra-day high of Rs 1,156, following which it finished at Rs 1,143.95, a 3 per cent gain over its previous close. The scrip witnessed 1,787 deals with 29,120 shares being traded.																								London High Court paved the way for the launch of generic versions of Glaxos Seretide by Cipla, Ivax Corp of the US and a couple of other generic players. Seretide was one of Glaxos top-selling products with global sales of over 2 billion. Britain alone accounted for over 5 per cent of its sales.																								Market analysts said apart from the favourable court ruling, reports of relaxation of norms for price monitoring of non-scheduled drugs by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) also boosted the sales of Cipla shares. Non-scheduled drugs are those which do not fall under the purview of price control by NPPA.																								It is expected that all the pharma companies will gain from the new guidelines, which state that the authority would not monitor the price increase of non-scheduled drugs up to 25 per cent in one year. The existing ceiling for such drugs was 20 per cent. Moreover, if the price increase is more than 25 per cent, the regulator will intervene only if the market share of the drug is more than 20 per cent in that particular category.

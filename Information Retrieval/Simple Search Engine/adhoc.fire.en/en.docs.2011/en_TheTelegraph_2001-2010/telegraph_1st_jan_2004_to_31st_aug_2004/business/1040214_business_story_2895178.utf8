 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 13: CESC Ltd has proposed lower tariffs in its petition for 2004-05 to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission compared with the previous year.																								We are working towards a reduction. I am almost confident that we will succeed by March 2005, CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said after a meeting with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								A CESC official said the tariff proposed for 2003-04 was Rs 4.42 per unit. The interim tariff waiting for finalisation is Rs 4.15 per unit and that proposed for 2004-05 is Rs 4.21, a considerable reduction from the previous-year proposal. The company is trying to do away with high tariffs and sincerely working towards a cost reduction in many areas, Goenka said.

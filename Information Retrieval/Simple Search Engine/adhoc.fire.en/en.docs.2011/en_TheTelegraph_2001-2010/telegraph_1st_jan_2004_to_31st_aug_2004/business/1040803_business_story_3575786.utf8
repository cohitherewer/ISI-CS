The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Fight in aviation fuel market at boiling point
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Riding the storm																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: A fierce corporate battle has broken out among the national oil majors for the lucrative aviation turbine fuel market.																								Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd is reported to have slashed prices in order to increase its market share, forcing Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd to follow suit.																								Senior BPCL officials told The Telegraph that HPCL has drastically cut jet fuel prices. As a result, the HPCL market share has gone up by about 5 per cent in recent months.																								Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), however, claims that its market share is still intact at 69 per cent and both HPCL and BPCL are fringe players.																								A senior IOC official said most of the major foreign airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Air France and Lufthansa were IOC customers. Rattling off statistics for the financial year ended March 31, 2004, he said IOC sold 1.7 million tonnes of jet fuel during the year, while BPCL had marketed 0.56 million tonnes and HPCL 0.27 million tonnes.																								While IOC appears to be complacent, BPCL is definitely concerned over the move. Senior BPCL officials admit that HPCL has eaten into their market share this fiscal. According to them, IOCs share should have taken a hit too.																								HPCL, a company that prides itself as an inheritor of the efficient Esso culture, does not view itself as a fringe player at all. A senior HPCL official said the company has fuelling stations at all major airports in the country, including Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore. We are doing very well. Our sales of jet fuel have shot up 24 per cent during the current fiscal, he added.																								IOC officials claim that their sales have grown 8 per cent over a larger base level of sales, while the HPCL increase covers a smaller base. 																								IOC feels that the bigger airlines will not switch companies as IOC has a wide marketing infrastructure. According to the company, any price cut can attract only new airlines that enter India and the existing ones will take such an offer only if they start operating on a new route.																								While this may be true in the short run, in the long run, it is quite logical to expect companies offering lower prices, backed by efficient delivery systems, to attract more customers.																								With fierce competition raging among the domestic airlines, any cut in prices is bound to lure fresh customers. Such low prices would also prove attractive for the new no-frills airlines such as Kingfisher and Deccan Air that are expected to be launched shortly.

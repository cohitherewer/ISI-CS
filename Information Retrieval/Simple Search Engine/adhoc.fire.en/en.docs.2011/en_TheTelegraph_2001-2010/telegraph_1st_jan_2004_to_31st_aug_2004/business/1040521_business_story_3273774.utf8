 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Finger on the privatisation pulse
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, May 20: The magic effect of Manmohanomics on the markets seems to have worn off temporarily. After two big-gain sessions on a trot, stocks turned volatile today after the would-be Prime Minister made it clear that his government would not privatise profit-making state-run units, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Gail, as well as nationalised banks.																								But North Block top brass feels the market needs to read between the lines as Manmohan Singh has also pointed out that public sector undertakings are free to raise fresh capital through public offerings and the government too may sell stake. 																								This should actually perk up brokerage bottomlines and market capitalisation, North Block officials said. 																								Singh made it clear that the Congress-led coalition will not pursue divestment as an ideology. We believe India needs a strong private sector and a strong public sector, he said.																								If the PSUs cant compete on an equal footing with the private sector or become a drag on the exchequer, then privatisation may help by all means, he added. But even this privatisation will be done only after addressing the concerns of its employees. Singh said, We will not do anything which will throw a large pool of workers jobless.																								The BSE index fell 1.35 per cent reacting to Singhs statements. But top North Block officials, who have worked with Singh earlier, said the market is reacting too fast.																								This is the alternative model for divestment which the British and the French have long been following ... the government remains the largest shareholder, public has substantial stakes and entities turn into board-managed free enterprises, said a senior official of the department of economic affairs.																								Similar offerings in the recent past by the BJP-led government had shown the market cap rising tremendously with investors splurging up to Rs 18,000 crore by buying heavily into CMC, IBP, ONGC and Gail. 																								The battle within the BJP over whether to privatise through strategic sales or market offerings had seen the cabinet divided and ministers at loggerheads. Singh has no desire to repeat such bickering in his new cabinet.																								Singh obviously wants the nationalised banks, needing fresh capital infusions to meet stricter capital adequacy norms, to also tap the market for their financial needs, reasoned officials. State-run entities that have nearly firmed up plans to tap the market are Central Bank of India (Rs 300 crore) and NTPC (Rs 400 crore).																								Foreign funds have now sold shares worth $683 million on the bourses in 11 sessions, more than a sixth of what they had invested this year before political worries set in. But this, finance ministry officials feel, will change once the bourses realise that market offerings will continue to help bull players.																								Fundamentals and pricing will remain key to most investment decisions and officials said this could prove a winner for PSU offerings. Most public offerings in this country have a price-earnings (P-E) ratio of less than 10. This is considered conservative by global standards where P-E ratios of up to 17 are allowed.																								Even the ONGC public offering, which grossed about Rs 10,000 crore, had a P-E ratio of less than 10, said leading merchant banker K. K. Sengupta.																								Such low pricing and the fact that the new shares being issued account for just about 2 per cent of India Incs market capitalisation, have been helping fund advisers like Sengupta to attract FIIs to market offerings. Exposure to this kind of money is not considered too risky by foreign funds, especially as they soak up to 7-8 per cent of the total capitalisation in many markets by buying new issues.

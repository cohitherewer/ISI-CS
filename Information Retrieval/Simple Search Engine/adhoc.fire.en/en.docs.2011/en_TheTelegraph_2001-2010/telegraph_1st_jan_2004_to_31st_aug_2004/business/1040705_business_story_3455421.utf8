 CHANDRALEKHA TULALMoney Matters																								Calcutta, July 4: Mutual funds were net sellers in the debt market amounting to Rs 1,271.50 crore till June 30, according to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) figures.																								The funds sold Rs 108.22 crore on June 1, but saw a reversal in the next two days. However, the sell-off that started from June 4 continued till June 21, with the highest sales of Rs 206.75 crore on June 15.																								In the last six months, debt funds were net sellers only in February at Rs 333.83 crore, while the other months saw significant purchases. Although there was a substantial decrease in purchases in May, the funds were net buyers at Rs 627.16 crore. 																								According to Value Research chief executive Dhirendra Kumar, the nervous sentiment prevailing in the debt market regarding the hardening of interest rates riding on global trends and rising inflation rates in the country saw huge redemption requests from long-term debt funds. This was the major factor which triggered the sell-off, but it is also due to the decision of fund managers to reduce portfolio exposure and move into cash.																								We are selling securities to reduce risk and increase our cash levels till there is some certainty in the direction of the interest rate movements. Since most of the investors are moving into floating rate and short-term funds, we are increasing our exposure in the money market, while moving out of the long-term debt market, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund head-fixed income A. Balasubramanian said. 																								UTI Mutual Fund chief investment officer A. K. Sridhar, however, said, We are not moving into cash and are still investing according to our investment objective of each individual scheme, be it a long-term or a short-term fund. But it is true that investors are moving their funds into short-term schemes from long-term ones.																								For the last couple of months, the debt markets have been in a flurry over the global trends indicating a hardening of interest rates. Last week, Y. V. Reddys comments revisiting the monetary policy stance if global trends exceed RBI expectations made the markets more nervous. This led to a fear that the repo rate could rise in the wake of a future hike in global interest rates. Moreover, the higher-than expected inflation rate at 5.89 per cent for the week ended June 12, 2004 compared with 5.55 per cent during the previous week indicated rising interest rates.

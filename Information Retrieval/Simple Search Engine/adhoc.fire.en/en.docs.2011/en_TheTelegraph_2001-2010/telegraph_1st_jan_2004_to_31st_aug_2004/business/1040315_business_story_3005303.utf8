 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Railway red signal for more oil wagons
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, March 14: The railways seems to be stonewalling the petroleum ministrys request for more tank wagons to evacuate products from the Northeast refineries. 																								Sources disclose that the railway ministry has been sitting over an urgent request by the petroleum ministry, sent on February 24, to resolve the issue. 																								The request comes close on the heels of a letter sent by the railway authorities to the petroleum ministry stating that the oil firms projections for the number of rakes required to evacuate petro goods from Assam are exaggerated. Each rake comprises around 48 tank wagons. The letter was sent in response to petroleum ministrys request for more rakes. 																								The petroleum ministry has now pointed out that the estimates of the oil companies are realistic as the output of the refineries in Assam has gone up due to the additional 1.5 million tonnes of sweet crude being allocated to the state from the eastern offshore Ravva oilfields.																								Railway ministrys letter is reported to have presented a nationwide picture of the movement of petro goods by the railways without adequately focusing on the specific problem of the Northeast, an official said.																								The railway ministry has said that evacuation of petro goods from Indian Oils refineries at Mathura and Panipat by rail has been low than the requirement projected by the oil firms. However, it has nothing to do with the Northeast dilemma. 																								Senior oil industry officials said that nine more rakes are needed to ensure smooth evacuation of products from the Assam refineries. Currently 95 rakes loaded with petro goods move out of Assam every month. The number of trips needs to be increased by another 23 given the current output level of the refineries. 																								Railway officials appear to be oblivious to the economic implications of not providing adequate number of rakes for these refineries. As a result, the refineries start running out of storage space for their products and are forced to slow down operations.

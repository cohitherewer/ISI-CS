 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 13: With Congress and its allies coming to power, the NDA governments proposal to dilute government holdings in public sector banks to below 50 per cent may not see the light of the day.																								The bill for reducing the stake is now lying with the standing committee of parliamentary affairs. The BJP-led government had suggested a reduction of the government holdings to 33 per cent in a phased manner.																								Bankers across the country feel that the new government will try to maintain the public sector character of the banks and will not encourage disinvestment. However, they feel that the new government will go ahead with the banking sector reforms.																								Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director . . Singh said, The Congress government was the architect of the present banking sector reforms. They are not expected to take any step which would hamper the ongoing reforms. But the bill relating to dilution of the governments stake may not take shape.																								A similar view was expressed by United Bank of India executive director K. . Prithviraj. The bill will not have an easy going, he said. Bankers said they expect more liberalised banking norms from Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram who are conversant with the countrys financial sector.																								The Congress partys election manifesto says it is committed to a modern, world-class financial sector that fulfils social objectives.																								Public sector banks will be given full managerial autonomy, the manifesto says. The banks will be encouraged in every way to expand lending, particularly to agriculture, small-scale industry and infrastructure.																								The manifesto also hints at an upward revision of interest rates. It says, Interest rates must be such so as to stimulate not just investments but also to provide adequate returns to savers. 																								Bankers, however, have raised a question  Will the new government provide the necessary capital if they do not allow the government stake to be reduced to 33 per cent? 																								The NDA-government had made it clear that no recapitalisation funds would be provided to the banks for their capital requirements.																								The banking industry needs capital to address its growing business. We need capital as a cushion to our risk-based assets. If the government does not reduce its stake then we cannot raise our tier-I (core capital) capital. In that case the new government will have to provide recap fund, they added.

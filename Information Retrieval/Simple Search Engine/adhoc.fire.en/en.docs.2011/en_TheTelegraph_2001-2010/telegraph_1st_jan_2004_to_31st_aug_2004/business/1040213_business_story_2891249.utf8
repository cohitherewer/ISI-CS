The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Filing flaws delay IBP selloff roadshow
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Slipping on deadline																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: There has been some delay in the roadshows for the sale of the governments 26 per cent stake in IBP as the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias (Sebi) approval has still not come through due to some flaws detected in the prospectus.																								Sources say Sebi has vetted the prospectus of the company and some last-minute changes are now being made to incorporate its advisory. These involve mainly re-arranging the sequence of some chapters and changes of a minor nature, a senior official told The Telegraph.																								Government officials are busy chasing a February-end deadline for offloading the IBP stake in the stock market. Roadshows are scheduled from February 13 to 27.																								The team, which will include Indian OiI chairman M. S. Ramachandran, IBP managing director Arun Jyoti and petroleum ministry officials, will be rushing for whirlwind roadshows at Singapore, Hong Kong and London next week to woo foreign investors for the issue. New York and Boston, part of the earlier schedule, may be dropped due to the paucity of time.																								In India, the roadshows will be held at Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Bangalore.																								With Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Gail (India) Ltd mega issues also scheduled to be launched in the current fiscal, there is some apprehension as to whether the market has the capacity to absorb such a large quantum of high-value stocks.																								A senior official told The Telegraph that the government was proceeding with the mindset that if prices offered for these stocks fall below the minimum reserve price, they will not be sold. In short, the government is clearly allowing for the fact that the domestic market may not be able to absorb all these issues. The roadshows in global financial centres are also undertaken to rope in additional investors.																								The sale of the stake is being handled mainly by the department of disinvestment with ICICI Bank as the financial consultant. However, the petroleum ministry, too, is closely associated with the exercise since the company comes under its administrative control and it has a deeper understanding of the petroleum sector.																								Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had picked up 33.58 per cent in IBP for Rs 1,150 crore. This was nearly twice the amount that private companies like Reliance and Shell had bid for.																								The valuation of the company carried out by the financial consultants was completely out of tune with that of oil industry experts. IOC had then bought a 20 per cent stake as part of the buyback clause for Rs 700 crore and now owns 53.5 per cent of IBP. The government has a 26 per cent stake, while the rest is with the public.																								IBP has added 543 petrol pumps to its existing chain in 2002-03, the highest number by any company that year.

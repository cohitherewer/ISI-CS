 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Steel secretary Binoo Sen (left) with joint secretary S. N. Dash in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, May 7: The steel ministry has stepped up its efforts to help public sector steel companies tide over the raw material crisis that they are currently facing. Two committees have been formed to find ways to source coking coal and coke from abroad.																								The committees have been negotiating on behalf of the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Vizag Steel Plant (VSP) on the prices and quantities of coking coal and coke abroad, S. N. Dash, joint secretary in the ministry of steel, said.																								The committees are currently negotiating with the companies in the US and Canada for more supply, Dash added.																								Incidentally, both SAIL and VSP have been forced to cut down their production because of the non-availability of coal and coke over the last few months.																								Both state-run companies, who are heavily dependant on imported coal, are in a very bad shape and may not be able to take the advantage of the boom in the steel industry, a senior official in the Joint Plant Committee said.																								Dash, however, hoped that coal import from Australia would be normal by June.																								Given the sharp rise in input costs, the steel ministry feels companies should focus on cost control measures to remain competitive.																								But the government is not going to dole out any incentives to the steel companies to ease out their worries. Neither will it ask companies to hold prices.																								Prices are governed by the market and there should not be any interference, Dash said.																								Steel secretary Binoo Sen, who was here to address a seminar on Maximising Blast Furnace Productivity with Indian Iron Ore, stressed the need for research and development to remain on a par with the international benchmark.

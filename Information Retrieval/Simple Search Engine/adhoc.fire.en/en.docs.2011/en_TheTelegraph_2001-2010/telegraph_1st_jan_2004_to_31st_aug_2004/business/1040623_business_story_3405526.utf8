 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Reliance, Tatas in spectrum spat with DoT
 M RAJENDRAN				 	 In a bind																								New Delhi, June 22: Reliance Infocomm, Tata Teleservices, Shyam TeleLink and Himachal Futuristic Communications have locked horns with the department of telecommunications (DoT) over the allocation of additional spectrum.																								Airwaves that help carry calls from one phone to another are called spectrum.																								The four private telecom operators  Reliance Infocomm, Tata Teleservices, Shyam TeleLink and HFCL  who held the basic service licence and later migrated to universal access service licence (UASL) have objected to DoT setting up a committee to recommend optimum utilisation of spectrum. 																								The Association of Basic Telecom Operators (ABTO), renamed as Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India (AUSPI), have opposed the new committee since two other committees on the same issue with representatives from private operators is discussing the modalities for allocation of spectrum and its optimum utilisation.																								In a letter to Telecom Commission chairman Nripendra Misra, AUSPI has complained, There should not have been another committee constituted on the same issue and if it was necessary, it should have taken the AUSPI into confidence before finalising anything.																								The four operators, led by AUSPI, are apprehensive that if the recommendation of this committee is accepted by the government, they may not get additional spectrum.																								The committee, set up under the chairmanship of member technology DoT, has recommended that the carrier would be allotted subject to spectrum availability in the area. It was also decided that the third code division multiple access (CDMA) carrier be allotted on service area (metro/telecom circles) basis, except in areas where spectrum is not available.																								However, fourth CDMA carrier will be allocated on city basis, due to the very severe constraint of spectrum availability as well as to provide necessary spectrum to niche operators, if any, in the rural or other areas, quot; the report added.																								The private operators have also pointed out that in addition to the two committees, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is also examining the issue of optimum spectrum utilisation. 																								AUSPI secretary general S. C. Khanna said in the letter to the Telecom Commission chairman, The regulator has sought views of stakeholders on this issue by June 30, 2004. Bringing out any report at this time would amount to subverting the consultation process and make the recommendations of Trai infructuous.

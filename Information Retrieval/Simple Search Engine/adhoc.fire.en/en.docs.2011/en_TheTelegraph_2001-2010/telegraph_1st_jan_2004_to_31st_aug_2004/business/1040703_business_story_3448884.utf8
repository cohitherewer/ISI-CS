 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 2: Life Insurance Corporation has raised its holding in ICICI Bank  the largest private sector bank in the country  to 10.09 per cent from 7.86 per cent. 																								LIC officials insist it is just an investment decision. The insurance majors appetite for bank stocks is well known. It already has a strategic partnership with Mangalore-based Corporation Bank. 																								ICICI Banks shares today closed Rs 2.80 lower at Rs 244.95. Brokers say the fall is in line with general market trends.																								In April, LIC had bid for ICICI Banks public issue to retain its 6 per cent stake in the bank. 																								The corporation had picked up over 26 per cent in Corporation Bank through a preferential issue a couple of years ago.																								In addition to Corporation Bank, LIC has a 15 per cent stake in Oriental Bank of Commerce.																								Analysts say LIC is increasing its stake in private banks to pare the risk of holding substantial stakes in public sector banks. 																								Its hedging its risks, an analyst said. LIC holds around 5 per cent in other private sector banks like HDFC Bank and IDBI Bank.																								LIC has been quietly ramping up its stake in HDFC Bank, in which it held only 3.8 per cent some months back. 																								Foreign investors hold a majority stake in HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. They are professionally managed and have no promoters, making it important for domestic institutions to hold a sizeable stake in the banks. LIC has a sizeable stake in UTI Bank. HSBC has recently acquired almost 15 per cent in UTI Bank from Actis (formerly CDC Capital).																								The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) allows LIC to invest up to 20 per cent in the equity capital of a company or 5 per cent of its controlled funds, whichever is less.																								LIC has been consolidating its stake in PSU banks primarily to get them to sell insurance policies. The deal with Corporation Bank allows it to set up offices within LIC premises. 																								Among local institutions, LIC has a clear philosophy of a contrarian investor. When other institutions are buying, it sells and vice versa.																								LIC was among the leading domestic investors to have actively participated in the recent public offers.

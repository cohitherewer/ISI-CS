 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Debt recast cell for medium-scale units
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, May 18: With the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) cell getting a favourable response from large companies, the Reserve Bank of India today announced in its monetary policy that a similar cell would be set up for medium enterprises.																								The cell will enable medium enterprises to revive their financial health within a short time span.																								This is a good move to revive the medium-scale enterprises, Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director . . Singh said.																								The CDR cell, set up for large companies, handle accounts with outstanding exposure of Rs 20 crore and above. The proposed cell is expected to handle accounts with an outstanding exposure of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore.																								A senior IDBI official said this was a much-needed cell. A huge number of medium-scale enterprises need financial restructuring. Often, banks and financial institutions take years to work out a package for them. The new CDR cell will help these units. It will prove to be a win-win situation for financial intermediaries and companies.																								Explaining the rationale behind the proposal, a senior Reserve Bank official said, Ever since the inception of the CDR cell for big companies 18 months ago, banks and institutions have managed to prevent assets aggregating Rs 56,794 crore from going to the seed even as liabilities of companies, which were affected by internal and external factors, have been restructured.																								The CDR cell approved 72 corporate proposals worth Rs 56,794 crore, rejected 19 proposals amounting to Rs 2,501 crore and is currently processing 17 proposals aggregating Rs 5,272 crore.																								At present, 44 banks and financial institutions are part of the CDR mechanism. 																								The intention of the central bank is that banks should lower their non-performing assets (NPAs) in their books, the RBI official added. 																								One way of doing it is through debt restructuring where banks and financial institutions together work out a package for the company as well as the lenders, the official said.																								The system is applicable only to standard and sub-standard accounts. However, potentially viable cases of NPAs get priority.																								The amount involved in medium enterprises will be much lower and so banks and financial institutions will not take much time to sort out the problem once the case is referred to the CDR cell, the IDBI official said.																								Proposals under CDR generally entail extending the repayment period of loans, converting unserviced portion of interest into term loans and reducing the rate of interest on outstanding advances. Promoters are also asked to chip in with equity.

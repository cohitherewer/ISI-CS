 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Its another tequila sunrise
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Take two																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: After a gap of five years, Jose Cuervo tequila is set to re-enter the Indian market. It will be available not only in duty-free shops but also in retail outlets. 																								Jose Cuervo, which is supposed to be the 10th largest spirit sold internationally, proposes to retail a 750ml bottle of the brand at approximately Rs 1,650-1,800. 																								It will be available in about five retail outlets in Calcutta which stocks bottled-in-origin products and about 40 retail outlets in Delhi. 																								In Delhi and Bangalore, Jose Cuervo will be available only through five star hotels, stand-alone bars and clubs  which are known in the trade as on-premises sales, said a spokesperson for Jose Cuervo.																								A drastic reduction in the cultivation of the Agave plant due to natural reasons severely impaired tequila production in Mexico over the last five years. This led us to focus on existing markets. With the Agave crisis over, we are now re-entering the Indian market, he said. 																								Our experience shows that the growing trend of young adults shifting to white spirits is a universal phenomenon that is applicable to India also, the spokesperson added. 																								The growing pub culture in Indian metros gives us a good springboard. Liberalisation has opened up the alcoholic beverages markets. With this in mind, we are initially targeting Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Bangalore as key markets, said Hugh Barnard, regional director  Asia Pacific. 																								The name Tequila is owned by the Mexican state. It is a Mexican alcoholic beverage that in 1974 was declared to have an appellation of origin. Like cognac or champagne, tequila may only be produced in the entire state of Jalisco and specified areas of the states of Guanajuato, Michoacan, Nayarit amp; Tamaulipas in Mexico.

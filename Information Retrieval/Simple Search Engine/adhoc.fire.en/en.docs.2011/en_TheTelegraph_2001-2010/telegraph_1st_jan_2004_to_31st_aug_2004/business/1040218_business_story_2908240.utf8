 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Guessing game on Tata Tea top slot
 OUR CORRESPONDENTSiganporia and Khusrokhan: Close ties 																								Mumbai, Feb. 17: Tata Tea has put deputy managing director Percy Siganporia in charge till such time as a new managing director is appointed in place of Homi R. Khusrokhan, who retired today.																								The vacant slot has fuelled rumours that the company may consider an outsider to take the reins at a later stage. 																								The decision to hand over temporary charge to Siganporia has perplexed most analysts, especially because the Tatas are known to chart succession plans months ahead.																								Last year, when Krishna Kumar retired as managing director of Indian Hotels, the company had appointed expatriate Raymond Bickson as his successor. The company wanted a person with international experience to head the Taj group ahead of its plan to beef up presence in foreign cities.																								Post Tetley acquisition, Tata Tea is being seen as a multinational. Whether the Tatas will look for an outsider to head the beverages business is the question on everybodys mind.																								Siganporia, however, is seen as a person with the requisite experience to head the group. 																								He was a core member of the due-diligence team that engineered the Tata Tea-Tetley merger. Siganporias strengths lie in marketing and brand evaluation. He has been studying Tetleys multinational operations and marketing strategies closely. 																								He has used his experience to streamline processes in Tata Tea and raise its standards to meet global levels.																								Siganporia and Khusrokhan have together chalked out the new strategy for the company after the Tetley takeover.																								Tata Tea has a significant presence in over 35 countries worldwide, including, the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, Poland, Russia, France and Sri Lanka. 																								With 55 tea estates across India and an area of 26,500 hectares under cultivation, the company produces over 60 million kgs of tea, accounting for approximately 21 per cent share (in volume terms) of the countrys packaged market. Some of Tata Teas frontline brands are, Agni, Kanan Devan, Chakra Gold and Gemini.

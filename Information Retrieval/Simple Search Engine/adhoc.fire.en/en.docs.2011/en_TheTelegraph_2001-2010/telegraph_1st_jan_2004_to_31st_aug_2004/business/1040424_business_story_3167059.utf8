 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Rally snaps on NDA poll pangs
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 23: Profit-taking cut short an early-session rally on the bourses, which were gripped by fears that the ruling coalition would return with a smaller lead.																								The BSE sensex closed almost unchanged at 5925.58 as poll-watching operators rushed to sell ahead of a weekend extended by a day because of elections in Mumbai.																								Though most players believe that the NDA is most likely to come back to power, there were some apprehensions triggered by the recent exit polls which predicted that the opposition could do well in some states, resulting in a lower victory margin for the alliance.																								The concerns gnawed away into gains notched up earlier in the day by mutual funds and financial institutions happy with the current crop of healthy numbers.																								The 30-share index hit an intra-day high of 5979.25, but selling pressure forced it down to 5925.58 against Thursdays close of 5924.18 in a gain of 1.40 points or 0.02 per cent. 																								The volume of business on Dalal Street was relatively higher at 2638.02 crore compared with Rs 2459.90 crore. 																								ICICI Bank was the chart-topper with a turnover of Rs 154.79 crore. The second-largest bank was followed by a new entrant, Dishman Pharma (Rs 129.71 crore), SBI (Rs 125.91 crore), Infosys Technologies (Rs 123.44 crore) and Maruti Udyog ltd (Rs 122.47 crore).																								A big highlight of the day was Bharti Tele-Ventures, which surprised the market by coming out with results far above expectations. The companys share hit an all-time high at Rs 177.10 in a surge of Rs 9.20.																								Brokers said ICICI Bank was also a top draw, propelled by a Reserve Bank of India announcement that FIIs can purchase the banks shares without its prior permission. The stock climbed Rs 20.60 to Rs 319.15.																								However, most technology counters were in the red today as investors disappointed with Satyams fourth-quarter results swarmed the counter with sell orders. The three leading lights in the software services sector  Infosys Technologies, Wipro and Satyam  ended losers.

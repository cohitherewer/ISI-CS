 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Steady FIIs steer voyage of boom
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, Dec. 31: With record investments of over $6 billion, it was clearly the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who carried the day in 2003. Driven by old-economy sectors, the year was witness to a meteoric rise in some share values with many giving returns of over four to five times to the investor.																								While a few have dished out an eye popping gain of 10 times over their comparable price as on January 1, the flavour of the year were banks, steel, public sector entities and shipping with the pharma sector also chipping in. However, FMCG and infotech stocks did not race ahead as fast as the other sectors.																								A look at some of the remarkable gainers for the year have thrown up scrips like Mercator Lines that ended the year at Rs 257.25, a hefty gain of 11 times (over 1000 per cent) over its January 1 close of Rs 22.60. The rise reflected a huge interest for shipping entities during the year which was marked by firm freight prices. The other top gainer was Sterlite whose share value rose a whopping 840 per cent during the calendar year. Shares of the non-ferrous metal major zoomed to Rs 1,400.95 from Rs 149.15 in January this year. 																								Shareholders of Matrix Laboratories, the Hyderabad-based pharma major which recently was in the news for sale of over 27 per cent of its equity to Newbridge Capital and other strategic investors, have reasons to be happy too. Its share has spiked from Rs 194.70 at the beginning of this year to end at Rs 1,566.55, a huge 700 per cent gain.																								Shares of MRPL have risen more than 620 per cent to Rs 51.05 during the year. Jubilant Organosys ended the year at Rs 881.50 from Rs 129 while CESCs shares jumped more than 509 per cent to Rs 132.35.																								Steel scrips too were in action during the year on better price realisations. SAIL was the key highlight here. The companys performance has improved and its share is now ruling at Rs 51.10 over its close of Rs 10.15 at the beginning of this year, a gain of over 400 per cent.																								The year was also a witness to a sharp jump in values of little-known stocks. Fine Drugs from the B group closed the year at Rs 89.55 after beginning at Rs 9.45 while Orient Abrasives has seen its value go up to Rs 247.10 from Rs 37.35 in January.																								On the market capitalisation front, the ONGC has emerged the leader with a hefty gain of 128 per cent. ONGCs market capitalisation is now put at over Rs 1,14,002 crore as on December 31 against Rs 49,000 crore at the beginning of this year. Reliance has gained over 91 per cent in market capitalisation during the year at over Rs 80,000 crore as compared with over Rs 41,550 crore on January 1.

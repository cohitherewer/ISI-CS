 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Govt opens LNG talks with Iran
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 28: The first round of talks between India and Iran to resolve the deadlock over the liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal began here today. While Iran is desperately seeking an assured market for its huge natural gas reserves, India wants to be compensated for the high cost of the gas with a stake for ONGC-Videsh (OVL) in a discovered Iranian oil field.																								Iran has offered a share in Husseinieh-Khush oil field but wants OVL to come through the competitive bidding process. However, India is sticking to its stand that the MoU signed between the two countries in January 2003 states that OVL would get the stake on a nomination basis.																								Iranian deputy oil minister Sayed Mohammad Hadi Nejad-Hosseinian told reporters after meeting petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar that he was hopeful the deal would be finalised by tomorrow.

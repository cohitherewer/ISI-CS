 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Accord recall 
																								New Delhi, Aug. 16 (PTI): Honda is recalling 2,200 units of the Accord sedan to replace faulty parts. The move comes close on the heels of an earlier recall of City models about three months back.																								We decided to implement certain modifications in some Accord cars sold in India, which is in line with an international campaign for the car, assistant general manager (marketing) Neeraj Garg said.																								The customers would not have to pay anything for the repair while they would get the car almost instantly, he said. Recalling of cars, a common practice in developed countries, is a new phenomenon in India. 																								HSCIL manufactures the Accord and City at its plant on the outskirts of Delhi.																								The company imports sports utility vehicle CR-V.

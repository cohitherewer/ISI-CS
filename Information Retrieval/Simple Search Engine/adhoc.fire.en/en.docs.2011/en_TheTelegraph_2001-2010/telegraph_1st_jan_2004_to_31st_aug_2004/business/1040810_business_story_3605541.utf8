 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 9: There was a change in the pecking order of mutual funds assets under management in July with SBI Mutual Fund securing a place among the top 10 with an inflow of Rs 867 crore.																								Notwithstanding the negative aspects affecting the mutual fund industry following the budget announcements, the assets under management of the entire industry increased 1.41 per cent from Rs 1,55,649 crore in June to Rs 1,57,840 in July.																								SBI Mutual Fund has secured the ninth position by replacing Tata Mutual Fund, which saw an erosion of Rs 55 crore in asset size. 																								The floating rate fund launched last month, which mopped up Rs 460 crore, is a major contributor to the surge in asset size. We also received substantial inflows in the institutional plan of our Magnum Income Saver Fund, SBI Mutual Fund chief investment officer . Sethuram Iyer said.																								According to Iyer, the growth in the fund corpus is supported by an improved performance. The fund has been a top performer across various categories in the recent period. 																								SBI Mutual Fund has registered the highest returns among the diversified equity and pharma funds in the recent period. Magnum Global has registered a return f 17.37 per cent, while Magnum Pharma fund has posted a return of 5.95 per cent in July.																								Although funds received under institutional plans do not remain with fund houses for a long time, SBI Mutual Fund is not worried about erosion of assets.																								The sustained performance of our liquid plan has brought high inflows into the fund and we are sure that it will continue to do well in future also, said Iyer.																								Apart from Tata Mutual Fund, all the other fund houses maintained their respective positions in June. 																								UTI Mutual Fund further enhanced its leadership position with its corpus crossing Rs 21,000 crore consequent to its acquisition of IL amp;FS Mutual Fund, which had assets under management worth Rs 2015 crore in June.																								Templeton maintained its second position at Rs 17,699 crore, a rise of 2.1 per cent from Rs 17,342 crore in June.

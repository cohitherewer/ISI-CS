 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 17: Indias exports clocked a 41.88 per cent growth in March this year, pushing up the overall growth to 17.26 per cent in 2003-04. For the first time, exports crossed the $60-billion-mark to end 2003-04 at $61.8 billion, even as trade deficit widened during the fiscal, virtually doubling to $13.36 billion against $7.44 billion in the previous year.																								Exports during March grew by 41.88 per cent to $7.3 billion as against $5.15 billion while the cumulative exports in 2003-04 stood at $61.8 billion surpassing the annual target of 12 per cent by over 5 per cent. In rupee terms, exports in March stood at Rs 32,901.57 crore, which is 34.07 per cent higher than the value of exports during March 2003. Exports during fiscal 2003-04 are valued at $61.84 billion against $52.74 billion in the previous fiscal, a growth of 17.26 per cent.																								In rupee terms, exports stood at Rs 2,83,604.52 crore in 2003-04, which is 11.6 per cent higher than the value of exports in 2002-03.																								Indias imports in the period under review stood at $75.2 billion, representing a rise of 24.96 per cent against $60.188 billion in 2002-03. In rupee terms, the imports rose to Rs 3,46,474.45 crore from Rs 2,91,132.93 crore, a growth of 19.01 per cent during the period.																								Oil imports during 2003-04 grew by 14.29 per cent to $20.17 billion against $17.64 billion in the previous fiscal. Non-oil imports in 2003-04 are estimated at $55.03 billion, 29.38 per cent higher than the level of $42.5 billion in 2002-03. Imports in March are valued at $6.927 billion, an increase of 17.61 per cent over $5.89 billion in March 2003.																								The government has attributed the high growth to good performance of exports, efforts to streamline the data collection and a slight change in the method of reporting data by customs which is now based on LEO (let export order) instead of EGM (export general manifest), an official statement said here.Trade credits 																								Tightening its norms on trade credits for imports, the Reserve Bank of India today said credits up to $20 million per import transaction will now be permitted only for import of capital goods. This measure is in the case of import transactions of maturity period exceeding one year but less than three years, the RBI said.

 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Rate hike hint in Fed price fight
				 	 Greenspan: In control																								Washington, June 9 (Reuters): The Federal Reserve will do what is required to keep inflation in check if the forecast behind its view that interest rates can rise gradually proves wrong, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday. 																								Greenspan, speaking to a group of bankers in London by satellite, suggested the Fed was prepared to act aggressively if needed to stem inflation, even as he restated the central banks view that it could likely act at a measured pace. 																								That conclusion is based on our current best judgement of how economic and financial forces will evolve in the months and quarters ahead, he said. Should that judgement prove misplaced ... the (Fed) is prepared to do what is required to fulfil our obligations to achieve the maintenance of price stability.																								A feed of his remarks to the conference, where he was part of a panel with European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet and Bank of Japan deputy governor Toshiro Muto, was made available in Washington.																								The Fed has held overnight interest rates at a 1958 low of 1 per cent since last June. But it is widely expected to bump them up by a quarter percentage point at the conclusion of its next meeting on June 29-30. Analysts expect that move to be the first step in a protracted rate-rise cycle. 																								Greenspan said markets have already been adjusting in anticipation of Fed action, contrasting the current period with the painful tightening cycle of 1994, when investors were caught off-guard by rate hikes. 																								Still, some in financial markets worry the Fed has waited too long on rates and think policy-makers may have to tighten credit more quickly than they now anticipate as a result. 																								Greenspans remarks pushed bond prices down, the dollar up and weighed on US stock markets, which closed up slightly. Some economists said Greenspan sounded a bit more hawkish on inflation than other members of the Feds policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee have recently. 																								He is certainly not stepping out of line with the FOMCs stance but is choosing to emphasise a willingness to move more aggressively if circumstances require it, said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics in New York. 																								Greenspan said a sharp recovery in US business profits provided evidence of the restoration of a significant degree of pricing power, which he said was also apparent in accelerating core inflation.

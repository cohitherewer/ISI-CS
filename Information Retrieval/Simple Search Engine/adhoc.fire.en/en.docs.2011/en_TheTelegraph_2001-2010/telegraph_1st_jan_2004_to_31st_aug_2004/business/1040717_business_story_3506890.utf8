 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Boardrooms on Tuesday hair trigger
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 16: Tuesday could spell double trouble.																								Two major MP Birla companies  flagship Birla Corp and Birla Ericsson Opticals Ltd  will be holding their board meetings and shareholders conclave on July 20, even as the controversy over succession continues to rage in the Birla empire.																								Last Monday, chartered accountant R. S. Lodha  and a close confidant of Priyamvada Birla  read out before a shocked family, her will that bequeathed the entire Rs 5000-crore assets to him. 																								On Tuesday, R. S. Lodha could assert his right to enter Birla Building  the virtual headquarters of the old Birla empire at R. . Mukherjee Road  to attend the board meeting of Birla Corp. The Birlas have made it abundantly clear that they will bar his entry. The board of Birla Corp  where Lodha is a co-chairman  is meeting to consider the results for the first quarter ended June 30.																								Senior company officials said: It is business as usual at Birla Corp. We will be taking up our unaudited results for the first quarter ended June 30. Managing director K. C. Mittal may chair the meeting. We may also see a new chairman that day. Anything may happen. But we will go ahead with the meeting.																								Birla Corp, which has interests in cement and jute, had reported net sales of Rs 324.8 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 and earned a net profit of Rs 33.3 crore.																								Birla Ericsson, where the MP Birla group owns 35.05 per cent, will hold its annual general meeting at Rewa in Madhya Pradesh. Lodha amp; Co is the auditor of the company.																								Senior officials at Birla Ericsson said: The AGM date has not been rescheduled. There is no change in the resolution for appointing a chairman in place of late Priyamvada Birla. Managing director D. R. Bansal will chair the meeting. 																								The articles of association allow shareholders to pick a chairman. When asked whether they have got a wind of who would become the chairman, the officials said, We have not received any direction from Birla Buildings on the issue.																								One of the resolutions that will be placed before the shareholders is the reappointment of Lodha amp; Co as the auditor. 																								This will be the first meeting of a Birla company where Lodha amp; Co  an auditor for several Birla companies  will be seeking its reappointment. Speculation has been rife that several companies owned by different Birla factions will now seek new auditors to replace Lodha amp; Co.

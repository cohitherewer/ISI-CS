The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 U-turn over vehicle phaseout 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								One step forward, two steps back, yet again. Going with its go-slow green mantra, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to shift into reverse gear, this time under pressure from the truck-operators lobby threatening an indefinite strike.																								As a result, the deadline for phasing out four-wheel and eight-wheel passenger and goods vehicles from the Calcutta Metropolitan Area has been extended from August 23, 2004, to December 31, 2004.																								Truck operators are against a notification issued by the transport department on July 29, calling for the removal of pre-1975 vehicles from Calcutta roads with immediate effect. The unions have demanded that the deadline be pushed back to March 31, 2005.																								After meeting belligerent representatives of truck operators associations at Writers Buildings on Monday, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said: We need time to execute this order. So, we have deferred the deadline to December 31, 2004, giving vehicle-owners time to relocate from their existing routes in greater Calcutta.																								The government order touches buses, minibuses, trucks, taxis and lorries of the pre-1975 vintage plying in Calcutta, Howrah, parts of North and South 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Nadia.																								The high court has not ordered phasing out of old vehicles. All that vehicles require to do is meet the tail-pipe emission norms, claimed Sadhan Das of the Joint Council of Bus-Owners Syndicate.																								The governments move will affect around 30,000 vehicles plying here and will render about five lakh people jobless, added Das.																								The association, along with other minibus, truck, taxi and luxury taxi unions, will hold a protest at Esplanade on August 19.																								While relenting in the case of 30-year-old vehicles, the minister made it clear that vehicles dating back to 1970 or earlier had to be taken off the streets immediately. Their permits for the Calcutta Metropolitan Area will not be renewed, Chakraborty said.																								The other half-step forward is the freeze on autorickshaw permits for the time being. As the minister put it: We already have about 38,000 autorickshaws plying in greater Calcutta. Issuing permits for more will only increase competition now.																								But here again, LPG-enabled autos or those willing to ply after converting their engines would be considered, he added.

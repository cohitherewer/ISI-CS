The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Five-stars shine bright on wedding night
 A STAFF REPORTER The Festival of Lights recreated, a Rajasthan haveli of yore and a white Christmas, a flower extravaganza elaborate luncheons, high tea with delicate snacks, dinners with the choicest cuisine... Homage to art, imagination  and almost all good things that money can buy. All at high-profile marriages these days, not in cramped halls, but in five-star hotels on a wedding season high.																								The latest big one in line is the marriage of Mayank, 22, son of Mahendra Jalan, honorary consul of France in Calcutta and leading businessman, to Neha Jhunjhunwala, 21, on February 7, at the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers. The guest list includes the European Union ambassador to India, the French ambassador, the whos who from the world of Indian industry, and even a delegation of 10 women members of Parliament from the UK.																								While the ceremony will be traditional and just for family and friends, says Jalan senior, there is little that is low key. The accent of the dcor, conceptualised by Aruna Purvit from Mumbai, whose credit list includes the marriage of Kumarmangalam Birla, will be on flowers. The evening reception will have about 2,000 invitees, including 125 out-of-towners. And the bride and grooms trousseau has been designed in Delhi. Its a spectacular affair, and will be a showpiece wedding, says Ranvir Bhandari, general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla. Its one of those fairytale marriages, and will definitely be a big one of this season.																								But its not the first, nor will it be the last. With marriages becoming more elaborate, so are the celebrations. Small is out and big is in, and so are the themes, dcor, food and guest lists. Its big business at the hotels, and each one has special arrangements just for the marriage mart. At the ITC Sonar Bangla, the lawn, Sunderbans, and banquet hall are where the events are staged. Every marriage date this season is full up, says Bhandari, with the allied rise in room bookings (see box).																								At Taj Bengal, too, the going is good. Wedding nights from November to January were all booked, and its looking great for February and March. The dedicated wedding service zones include the banquet hall, gardens and other smaller halls. The themes, often with plenty of blooms brightening things up, range from Rajasthani forts to South Indian temples. And the menu has live counters with Italian, Mongolian, Indian barbecue and tawa, and even exotic fruits. As a spokesperson put it: Weddings are an important segment of our industry They bring in good business.																								At the Hyatt Regency, 100 per cent is the figure given out for marriage dates on the calendar. The ballroom, foyer and lawns are hired out, and about 25 to 30 rooms are invariably occupied by guests for a single event. Once again, Rajasthani themes are the most popular, elaborate is the key, and exotic flowers  not the dry variety  flown in from different parts of the world, are the focus, with the dcor provided by professional interior decorators. At the Salt Lake hotel, while conferences account for 65 per cent of the business, weddings take a significant 15 per cent of the revenue cake.																								So, if the wedding bells can be heard this season, head straight for the nearest star hotel for the big bash.

 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Salute to foray of a foreign tongue
 RAJRUPA GHOSH																								If there is one Indian item which makes its way across foreign shores without any official ado, bandh or no bandh, it is English. For after the UK and the US, India, along with Australia, sends the third largest volume of English words to Oxfords Concise English Dictionary. 																								This was revealed by Judy Pearsall, publishing manager, Oxford University Press (OUP) on her maiden visit to the city during a free-wheeling interaction. With 48 hours to go before yet another Bengal bandh, she spoke about how adda joins bandh in the 11th edition of the dictionary. 																								India is the third largest English-speaking community in the world with 35 million fluent English speakers. And the way Indian English has progressed over the years shows it is a mature language with a lot of variety as it is able to coin words on its own, such as filmi.																								OUPs readers all over the world look at all kinds of texts and pick up unusual words (over 2,000 per reader, per month). Their entries in our database, along with the context of use, are evaluated over the years, their usage frequencies tabulated, before new words like the typically Indian batchmate or undertrial are included in the dictionary, says Pearsall. 																								The 42-year-old is keen to maintain a middle path as far as pronunciation is concerned. Words have to be explained in a way familiar to a foreign tongue. So, though the Bengali can now have his adda in the concise Oxford dictionary, he will find it pronounced as ada. Thats taking one step at a time into the sanctum sanctorum of the Queens language.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 20, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Hoodlums rule the roost at Howrah and Sealdah stations after 10 at night. As many long-distance trains arrive at and leave Howrah after 10.30 pm, passengers feel quite unsafe. The railway authorities seldom bother about the harassment caused to us, especially women and children, while waiting at the station. Sufficient policemen must be posted to ensure passenger safety.

	Several coats of asphalt have been applied on many stretches as part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations road restoration project. As a result, the road surface is higher than the ground level of the entrances to the adjoining buildings at some places. Rainwater flows into the buildings instead. Pedestrians are also being inconvenienced. Some simple changes in the repair process may solve the problem.

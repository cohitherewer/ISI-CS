																																																		Howrah Police netted four criminals from across the town on Tuesday night. All four have been charged with murder, dacoity and extortion. The quartet  Tinku Sahani, Farukh Sheikh, Bablu Acharya and Dinesh Kumar Shaw  was rounded up with bombs, a revolver, a chopper and four rounds of bullets. Farukh, Bablu and Dinesh were arrested in Janagate, between Shibpur and Jagachha. They had planned to burgle some houses there on Tuesday night and disperse to their respective homes, said a Shibpur police station officer. They were to share the spoils at a get-together a week later. Police records say that the three men held at Janagate are residents of Tangra Pilkhana and Mollarchak, in the Mograhat police station area of South 24-Parganas. Dinesh lives on GT Road, in Howrah.

 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Fumes take toll on kids
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Paediatricians and officers of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) have raised an alarm over the increasing number of acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases among children up to 12 and beyond. 																								Apart from pneumonia and wheezing bronchitis, such cases are predominant among infants and could lead to death. Curbing the level of pollution and providing more open spaces  parks and greenery  are the only solutions, experts say. 																								They warned that the growing use of mosquito repellent, room fresheners and perfume sprays are also responsible for respiratory infections in children.																								A few years ago, the most common childhood disease was diarrhoea. Things have since changed. Now, we find that most children are suffering from ARI, said M.K. Chatterjee, medical superintendent of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children. 																								Environmental pollution, along with malnutrition and lack of sanitation are the major factors for the significant rise in ARI cases in the city and the suburbs, Chatterjee added.																								He stressed that parks, playgrounds and open spaces for children would help a lot more than any medicine to curb respiratory diseases. 																								Hospital authorities said more than 40 per cent of the children admitted to BC Roy hospital round the year suffer from ARI.																								Swapan Kumar Roy, paediatric physician with the hospital, said the infective cause of bronchitis, prevalent two decades ago, had been replaced by allergic cause of bronchitis. 																								In extreme cases, oxygen saturation of blood reduces considerably. If the brain tissues are deprived of oxygen for a long time, brain function is gradually jeopardised, leading to the childs death, Roy explained. He warned that 25 per cent of the children suffering from ARI might develop adult type of bronchial asthma. 																								In the past few years, suspended particles like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen have increased in the air we breathe. This helps the viruses remain at our breathing level and children are most vulnerable, said Anindya Bandopadhyay, paediatric physician of Ruby General Hospital. Vehicles must abide by norms, said a WBPCB official.

Picture by Amit Datta																								Can the human body transcend its physical reality? Is it possible to exist on the edge of the concrete and the abstract? The questions have intrigued German choreographer Jan Pusch for long. The exploration resulted in the dance drama Into the Blue. 																								Also involving music and video, Into the Blue plunges into the temporal and spatial realms with three solo performances by Detlef Alexander, Wobine Bosch and Paula Scherf.																								The performers are different personalities in three different assumed situations, exploring how the human body could develop in future, says Pusch haltingly, aware of the tinge of abstraction in his reply, but unwilling to disclose further. 																								After staging the dance drama to packed auditoriums in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the Jan Pusch Repertory from Germany has touched down in the city for a show at Rabindra Sadan on Wednesday. 																								Cutting across cultural tastes, the production has toured  and made an impact  in Russia, Italy, Malta, Czechoslovakia and Latin America, besides bagging the prestigious Press Review Award at the International Contest for Choreographs, Hanover, in 2001.																								The solo pieces in the dance drama are stretched out with three intermissions, as the repertory is working with sophisticated video equipment. But Into the Blue is not a graphic coalescence of dance and video, warns Pusch. I have seen several such works in the West, where the visual element distracted the audience. But the idea of projecting the two-dimensional into a three-dimensional space seemed interesting, he adds. 																								Having chalked out the blueprint of the piece, Pusch was faced with the daunting task of choosing his cast, as the performers had to emotionally, intellectually and physically believe in what they were supposed to do. The dance movements were first developed without music, as the West is prone to associating music with emotions. We are still not familiar with the concept that dance alone can stir emotions in us, he explains.																								Though trained in western classical ballet, the 38-year-old gave up professional dance to concentrate on choreography a decade ago. I did not want people to lose their spontaneity by emulating my movements, says Pusch, who started taking piano and cello lessons from age four. That was when he was in East Germany. 																								After moving to West Germany, Puschs interests changed and he switched to classical ballet. Since 1994, he has been working as a freelance choreographer with ballet companies in Hamburg, while also composing music for productions alongside.																								For Into the Blue though, Pusch has assigned the background music to Beat Halberschmidt. I focussed on the kind of atmosphere Pusch wanted to create, says Beat.																								With Into the Blue, we want to present avant-garde, cutting-edge contemporary western dance in Calcutta, says Max Mueller Bhavan director Martin Waelde. 																								The other major event lined up by Max Mueller Bhavan later in the month is a conference on progress and development in the cultural context. The three-day meet, hosted in association with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, will provide a podium to philosophers, sociologists, economists, ecologists and several others to share their views.

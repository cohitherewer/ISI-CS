 An exhibition at Birla Academy reaffirms Bikash Bhattacharjees ability to make a world of dreams come alive, says Soumitra Das  Moonlight and The Snake (above): Two of the exhibits It is said that when Bikash Bhattacharjee was in peak form before his prolonged and incapacitating illness, people would book his paintings in advance, and love of art was not the only reason why they did so. His works, particularly the more decorative ones of delectable feminine forms, had become blue-chip investment. 																								Unfortunately, these commissioned works created the impression  and a very wrong impression it was -- that he was capable of painting only pretty pictures. Public memory being notoriously short, it is easy to forget is that this artist, who never eschewed the academic style that he was trained in, could create a world where dreams come alive without deviating from stark realism. It is our misfortune that his genius was nipped in the bud at a critical juncture when it would, perhaps, have bloomed to its full glory. 																								Since his illness, Bikashbabu has been confined to the wheelchair. Last week Lalit Kala Akademi conferred a fellowship on the artist. The Birla Academy of Art and Culture has organised a large exhibition of Bikashbabus canvases and drawings, many of them borrowed from private collections. It is a significant exhibition for here we see Bikashbabu in full glory. It will go a long way in clearing the wrong ideas we have about his work.																								Most of these canvases were painted a decade or even two decades ago. But they have not lost any of their impact or relevance. In the absence of a museum in this culturally-conscious state, this exhibition affords a rare opportunity to see works that may not be seen again. 																								We in Bengal have for long heard stories of the bastusaap, a word that loosely translates as household serpent. In other words, it is a king cobra venerated as a deity, a creature of myths and legends. On the canvas it becomes a bejewelled serpent, slithering and hissing across the gleaming marble floor of a north Calcutta palace. The image has a magnetism of its own as all such reptiles reputedly do. It is real but it goes beyond reality. The dark naked feet of a woman and the hooded reptile hint at erotic possibilities.																								Bhattacharjee is fascinated by the city of Calcutta, as much by its decaying 19th century dwelling houses as by the shanties. Where most foreigners find a worst-case Third World city that they try to reclaim through good works, Bhattacharjee discovers human dignity and even poetry amidst the squalor and poverty. The mother and her little naked boy stand moonstruck, impervious to their surroundings. Nonetheless, it is a gritty enough painting.																								In the catalogue of Bikashbabus exhibition in 1997 at the same venue, he had expressed his indebtedness to his training in the British academic style, his acceptance of the ideals of 19th century Bengal, and his rejection of the tenets of modernism unless they appealed to his taste and intellect. At the same time, he admitted that he was fascinated by surrealism in spite of his positive outlook.																								In one large canvas, dark figures of gun-toting soldiers are lined like statues on pedestals along a street covered with dirty snow. Blood oozes out of tiny holes in their foreheads. The last statue is that of a donkey, the tattered flag of the victor fluttering next to it, underlining the futility of it all. In another canvas, a goat has escaped being sacrificed, its forehead still smeared with sindoor. 																								Bhattacharjee was traumatised by the massacre of youths to wipe out the Naxalite movement. In a mixed media executed in 1979, a blindfolded youth, green blood oozing out of holes in his chest, is being interviewed by a woman with manicured nails. No propaganda vehicle could have been more vocal than these works against mans inhumanity to man.																								Bhattacharjee is riveted by images moving on a screen. The influence of cinema on his practice becomes clear here. The figures look as if they are in suspended animation, frozen in time. 																								The statues of beautiful women seen so often in the ruins of stately homes and the images of goddesses retrieved from rivers after immersion gain new life in his canvases. 																								His deep-seated romanticism is expressed in the image of the woman on a swing. It is a scabrous beauty who could turn into a heap of ashes but gains eternal youth in Bhattacharjees creation, even if its body is gradually going to pieces. His paintings try to resist the decaying process of time, a surety against flux.

 Before and after: The government has to undo at the tax-payers expense (below) what the party workers do to the walls (above) before the polls The report entitled CU slams door on Delhi diktat (March 6) is amusing. Though the members of the Calcutta University (CU) Syndicate have rightly opposed the Model University Act proposed by the University Grants Commission on the ground that the act will rob the universities of their autonomy and establish the control of the governments over the universities, the same persons are silent when the state government does the same. They have not opposed the W. B. University of Health Services Bill 2001 and the W.B. University of Technology Bill 2002 in which the government has kept no provision for elected teacher and student representatives in the administrative and academic bodies.  The state government is also attempting to establish control over all affairs of the university and reduce financial assistance. Thus, both the central and the state governments are violating the concept of democratic education which states that the academic affairs of the universities will be determined by academicians and elected representatives of teachers and students and funds will be provided by the government. But both governments are trying to shed their financial responsibilities and advising the universities and colleges to generate resources on their own. Thus, there is an attempt on the part of both the central and state governments to commercialise education. This is not new. Such attempts are being made through the National Policy on Education, 1986.  I would request the members of the CU Syndicate not to take a one-sided view and to oppose any attempt by the governments to curtail the autonomy of the academic institutions. Dr Pradip K. Datta, 
Department of physics, Presidency College. Apropos the report Election panel boon for walls (March 9), it is heartening to note that the Election Commission (EC) has forbidden political graffiti on government buildings. The step was long overdue. The EC is contemplating penal measure against political parties who defy the directive. Can it not take up the case of private individuals who do not dare to enter into confrontation with the political parties? Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
Nayapatty Road. The report Ousted father gets son evicted (March 4) reminded me of Bollywood potboilers in which the aged father fights his lawless son for justice. This incident unveils the face of the administration. Why should we fear terrorists from Kashmir when we have a host of them occupying important government offices? However, Paritosh Chowdhury deserves kudos for fighting on despite knowing the dire consequences of such an act. Kunal Ray, 
Santragachhi. Eviction of old parents from their own house by son and daughter-in-law is now shamefully common. We want a national policy so that senior citizens can spend their last days peacefully. Sachindra Nath Mitra,
Beleghata.  It is distressing how the state government is evading Bharat Stage-II (Poll plea for Bharat-II phase, March 3). Tottering vehicles emitting noxious smoke is a common sight in Calcutta. Why is the government so keen to safeguard the interests of vehicle-owners? Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town. Once Bengali doctors dominated the entire northern belt of undivided India. It is sad that not a single cancer specialist from West Bengal was invited to the international conference on cancer research in Delhi (Cancer research in doldrums, March 6). The government should build the infrastructure for cancer research here. B.N. Bose, 
Dum Dum. The report Same man held twice for same case in Howrah (March 11) was bizarre. Such arrests only malign the khaki force of Bengal and create insecurity among the public. Pashupati Mondal, alias Shankar, can take the cops to court for such double booking. T.R. Anand,
Budge Budge Trunk Road. The workshop was commendable work by the traffic department (65 deaths in 64 days, March 5). But how much it will help curb accidents unless some policy is framed to regulate private bus operators is doubtful. Diptimoy Ghosh, 
Salt Lake City. It is shocking that witnesses refused to testify against assailants dreading the ire of ruffians (Mums the word in murder belt, March 9). Rabindranath Kar, 
Sankar Ghosh Lane.

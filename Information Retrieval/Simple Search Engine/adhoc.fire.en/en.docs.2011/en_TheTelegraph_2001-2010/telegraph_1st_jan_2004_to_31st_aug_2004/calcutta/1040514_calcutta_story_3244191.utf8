The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Alone, the leader learnt of party rout
SOUTH OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								6.30 am at 30B, Harish Chatterjee Street. Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee stood with a battery-operated, hand-held microphone, shouting instructions to her counting agents leaving for Survey Building, Ballygunge Government School and David Hare Training College, where counting for Calcutta South constituency was to begin at 8 am.																								Koda najar rakhbi, ekdam ghabrabina (Keep a close watch. Dont get nervous), a jovial Mamata told her agents and party workers, handing over food packets to them. Her loyalists had given her to believe that Trinamul would bag at least 17 seats and ally BJP another six.																								Anticipating victory, a shamiana had been put up in front of her small office. A blackboard was hung with Trinamul Congress = Victory written on it with chalk. 																								Mamata appeared relaxed when she went into her cubby-hole with close aides like Ratan Mukherjee, Tamanash Ghosh and Sonali Guha to doodle.																								At 11.30 am, Mamata became restless as the debacle gradually unfolded. Three telephones on her desk kept ringing, bringing in bad news. Only she was steadily leading. All the seven candidates from last years winning seats were headed for defeat. 																								Look how the CPM rigged the polls. They did not even spare my prize candidates like Ranjit Panja and Krishna Bose, a crestfallen Mamata told partymen.																								She closeted herself in her office and did not eat a proper lunch, despite repeated requests from brother Kartick and other family members. Aamake birakta korishna, aamar khidey nei (Dont bother me, I am not hungry), she told them. Occasionally, she sipped tea served in a bhaar. At 3.30 pm, a worker removed the blackboard.																								Outside, Trinamul workers were trying to analyse the poll disaster. The Muslims voted en mass for the Left Front and the Congress. The NDAs policy of cutting down on interest rates did us in, said a party leader. 																								Others stood in front of the office. Mediapersons flocked to the courtyard, but Mamata did not emerge until 5 pm, when she addressed a press conference. 																								Five years ago, when the party had bagged eight seats, green abir was sprinkled generously on all visitors. On Thursday, there was not even a hint of celebration, though Mamata had won by nearly 100,000 votes.

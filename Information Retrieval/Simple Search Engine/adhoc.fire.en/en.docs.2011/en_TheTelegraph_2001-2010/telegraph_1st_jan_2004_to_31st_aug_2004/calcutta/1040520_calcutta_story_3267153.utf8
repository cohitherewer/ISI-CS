The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Road tax, car fees set to get hi-tech
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Stride into one of several offices, whip out a credit card-like piece of plastic, hand over the requisite amount to the person behind the counter, and leave.																								No touts, no paperwork, no shuttling from one counter to another  paying road taxes and vehicle registration fees will not be a nightmare for long, with the controversy-ridden smart card finally poised to make an entry into Beltala.																								The ubiquitous blue book  now coming to the car-owner in the form of one big sheet  will soon be history.																								All details of a vehicle, from information on owner to the type of vehicle and when its taxes were last paid, will be recorded on a two-inch-by-three-inch piece of plastic, otherwise known as the smart card.																								An on-line connectivity system through Wide Area Network (WAN) will also link the public vehicles department with all regional transport authorities in every district headquarters.																								After the introduction of WAN, a vehicle-owner can pay road tax and other fees or get his/her driving licence renewed from any of the offices through the computerised system, said a transport department official.																								Vehicle-owners today have to pay taxes and other fees at the regional office where the vehicle has been registered. So, car-owners in the city only have access to the public vehicles department (PVD) at Beltala, while those in the northern and southern suburbs have to go to the Barasat and Alipore regional transport offices, respectively.																								We have started computerisation of vehicle records at the PVD and all regional transport offices. This is nearing completion. We will next start setting up the WAN for connectivity with all the 18 regional offices, he added. But an amendment to the existing motor vehicles rules will have to be made. 																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said: We want to get rid of the heaps of paper and files piling up in the PVD and other regional transport offices. Besides, we want to phase out the paper blue book and go hi-tech.																								The smart cards, he said, were ready and would be distributed to car-owners as soon as a green signal is received from the Centre.																								Calcutta, asserted transport department officials, would be the first metro in the country to introduce smart cards, which would also enable the traffic police to access details of any vehicle with just a swipe.

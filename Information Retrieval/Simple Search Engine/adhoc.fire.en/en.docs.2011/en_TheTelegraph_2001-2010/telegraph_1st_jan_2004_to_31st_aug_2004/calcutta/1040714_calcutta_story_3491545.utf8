		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 																				Swarna Kamal Saha								President, Bengal Bus Syndicate																																							Bus-owners need not compensate victims. In case of an accident, the insurance companies do that as victims are covered under the bus insurance scheme. There are lawyers who collect information from the fatal section of Lalbazar and get in touch with relatives of victims. They help in the procedure of claiming insurance for a commission. As for the allegation that drivers race as we pay them a commission against tickets sold, we are willing to shift to a salary system. Let the government set up a committee to work out the viability of running a bus and give us facilities that state buses get.

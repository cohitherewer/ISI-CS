 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Recognisance of landscape painting
																								Beauty is truth, truth beauty/ That is all ye know and all ye need to know  Keats perception of the inexplicable relationship between truth and beauty. Ritendra Roy belongs to the crop of modern artists who subscribes to this Keatsian theory of beauty. He has revived the art of landscape painting in a world that has steeped itself in mercantile capitalism. Into the brotherhood of mankind that has forfeited its aesthetic sensibilities for mundane worldliness comes a whiff of fresh air; Roys paintings embody an idea. His creations are born of a marriage between space, colour and light on the one hand, with its surrounding ambience on the other, to convey a mood while journeying into infinity.																								Event: Paintings by Ritendra Roy																								When: Till February 22; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 4th floor

																																																		The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has set up an economic offences investigation cell to handle crimes by financial institutions and is set to float another to monitor power theft and other electricity-related crimes. 																																																								he economic offences investigation cell monitors non-banking financial companies in addition to looking into cases of tax evasion by traders and companies. It, however, monitors only the payment of state government-imposed taxes. Headed by retired inspector-general Narayan Ghosh, the cell is currently functioning with 14 officers, whereas its sanctioned strength is 22. 																																																								he proposal to launch the other cell was formulated after a recent meeting between the power minister and the State Electricity Board chairman where hooking and other offences were discussed. The government is also considering deploying a special force exclusively for the cell. The state cabinet is expected to give its formal approval about both cells when it meets on Wednesday. 																																																		Mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Monday that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would take up a Rs-1 crore beautification project at the Keoratala burning ghat soon. Mukherjee said trees would be planted and an air-conditioned room for visitors would be built at the site where the conventional wooden pyre operates at present. 																																																		Unavailability of power and water on the Calcutta High Court premises on Monday caused a lot of hassle for the judges and advocates as well as visitors. According to high court sources, the air-conditioners in the judges rooms did not function throughout the day and no drinking water was available. However, officials of the public works department managed to restore power just before the court closed for the day.																																																		City-based industrialist Sanjay Budhia, who is also newly-appointed honorary consul of Malaysia, called on the chief minister on Monday morning and stressed on the need to have direct flights between Malaysia and Calcutta. India continues to be Malaysias largest trading partner in South Asia. Direct air connectivity between the two countries is a priority in order to forge stronger trade relations, Budhia said. He added that he would take up the matter with the Malaysian government and the airline. There is a lot of traffic between Calcutta and Kuala Lumpur, but people mostly fly via Bangkok or Singapore since there is no direct flight. This is not only more expensive, but takes at least four to five hours more in making the transit, a spokesman for Cox amp; Kings said.																																																		Saraighat Express, which left Howrah on Sunday evening, was delayed by nearly half an hour when a six-month-old baby, travelling with its parents, developed symptoms of acute gastro-enteritis. It was attended to by the divisional medical officer of Eastern Railway (ER), V. Pandey at Bolpur. According to an ER spokesperson, the prompt action taken by the on-duty ticket examiner, N.C. Mandal and the station manager of Bolpur, N.K. Mitra, saved the child. 																																																		Three men took their own lives in and around Calcutta on Monday.

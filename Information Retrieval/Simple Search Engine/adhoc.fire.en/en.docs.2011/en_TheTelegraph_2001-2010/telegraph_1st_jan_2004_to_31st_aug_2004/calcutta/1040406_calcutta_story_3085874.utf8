 Ankita RathiAnkita Rathi 																									Is what shes known as, for Ankita has never been without a badge on her collar since Class III. In fact, in Class XI, this career monitor had four of them stuck to her lapel. The Mahadevi Birla student has been vice-president, house vice-captain and captain several times over, in junior, middle and senior school. In Class XI, the 17-year-old was also the school Interact Club president and Rotaract Extension chairperson in the Interact District Council. Her point of Interact pride is organising over 90 community and social welfare projects. Also worked in the districts through Rotaract.																									She is, too. Played inter-school badminton in the junior section, till a muscle tear put her out of action for a while. The national-level skater was a regular at tournaments, till a left-hand fracture during practice put a stop to that as well. Played table tennis for house competitions, and the water baby is a qualified swimmer. Ankita also won a bronze medal in gymnastics at a Sports Authority of India competition. Versatility, she says, is the name of the game.																									Is not just her favourite phrase, but also another nickname. Guddu got a scholarship for Class XI and XII after acquiring 92 per cent in the CBSE board exam in 2003. Not to mention her 92 and 94 per cent aggregate in Class VIII and IX. The TTIS reporter was voted the most mature delegate in the TTIS team that visited Pakistan in January, on a peace mission. A memorable moment was when a poem she wrote at a bus stop and entered in poetry.com was published in a book in Austria called Letters from the Soul. 																									Is one of the many claims to fame for the runner-up in the Horlicks Personality Contest last year. The painter has won art competitions as well as laurels in creative writing, quizzes, ad spoof, mock parliament, medley, dancing, cartooning, face painting and more, at inter-school fests. The Kiran Bedi fan pursues hobbies like photography, plays the Hawaiian guitar, synthesiser and violin and, of course, brushes up on her palm-reading skills, in her spare time.

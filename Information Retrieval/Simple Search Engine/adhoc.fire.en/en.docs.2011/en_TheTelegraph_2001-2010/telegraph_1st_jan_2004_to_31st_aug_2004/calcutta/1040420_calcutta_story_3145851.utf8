																								O xford Bookstore hosts an exhibition of graphic illustrations by Sarnath Banerjee whose graphic novel, Corridors (published by Penguin India), was launched last Sunday. The exhibition, featuring sketches from Corridors, which, interestingly, is Indias first graphic novel, also includes a screening of a 20-minute animation film based on one of Banerjees novels, titled Hakim Tartoosies Potency Oil. The artist himself will do a series of presentations involving displays of original pages from his comic strips, as well as a short introduction to the genre of the graphic novel, which is an established form of reading in the West and rapidly emerging as a very popular visual medium the world over. This exhibition, a one-of-its kind event to be held in the city, while offering a combination of innovative visual experiences, harmoniously blends the serious with the humorous. It presents us with a view of life that is fascinating and yet realistic.																								Event: An exhibition of illustrations by Sarnath Banerjee 																								When: Till today; 10 am to 9 pm																								Where: Oxford Bookstore, 17 Park Street

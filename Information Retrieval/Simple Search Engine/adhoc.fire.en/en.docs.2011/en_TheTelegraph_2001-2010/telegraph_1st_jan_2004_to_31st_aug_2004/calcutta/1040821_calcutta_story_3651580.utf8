 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Building up crime boom 
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Although police are on the trail of one-armed Dilip, there are several other gangs operating in Salt Lakes Sector V, the added areas of the township and Rajarhat New Town, which are posing no less a problem to the administration.																								Saltlec and New Township are havens for extortion, sex rackets and illegal liquor booths, often leading to murders. The current construction boom in Sector V, Mahisbathan, Nayapatty and Rajarhat New Town have spawned a new generation of criminals, some of whom have close links with the ruling party. 																								Most of these gangsters pose as suppliers of building material. They force developers to buy stuff from them, alleged Tanmoy Mondal, Trinamul Congress MLA from Rajarhat. We have submitted written complaints to the authorities but no steps have been taken so far, he added. 																								Officials of several software companies conceded that they faced problems of extortion. A supplier approached us and said we had to buy construction material from him. We found his rate was much higher than the market price, but we were forced to take materials from him, said a top official of a software firm, on condition of anonymity. 																								Complaints at local police stations do not always yield results, he said, adding: Police will pay a visit and then, nothing happens. 																								Others said though at times the man running the racket is arrested under pressure, he is soon out on bail. 																								In most cases, the companies prefer to keep quiet and come to an agreement with the suppliers. It is better to pay them off rather than go to the police and increase the hassles, said another executive of a Sector V company.																								In the Mahisbathan and Nayapatty areas, the developers are the victims of extortion rackets. With Rajarhat New Town coming up and connectivity improving in the past few years, these once-backward areas are witnessing a building boom. 																								Gangs force developers to buy materials from them, a local Trinamul leader said. Gaur Mondal and Ruish, who operate in Rajarhat, and Khitish Mondal and Saheb Mondal, operating in Salt Lake, are the kingpins. According to police, Saheb is Dilips henchman. These criminals allegedly enjoy the ruling partys patronage. Gaurs father, Khitish is a pradhan of Mahisbathan II panchayat.

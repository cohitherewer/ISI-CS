The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 CU top boss signature forged
 																											- Coast guard employee submits false marksheet, memo for job MITA MUKHERJEE																								Close on the heels of the Mukti Deb marksheet scandal, Calcutta University (CU) is embroiled in another incident of forgery.																								Like Mukti Deb, who joined Visva-Bharati by producing false marksheets of Calcutta and Jadavpur universities, the culprit involved in the latest incident, an assistant commandant of the coast guard in Delhi, has forged the signature of the CUs controller of examinations.																								This proves we are dealing with a highly organised, deeply embedded racket, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, CU controller of examinations, on Thursday. 																								In October 2003, the coast guard authorities wrote to CU along with copies of marksheets of assistant commandant R. Gupta. They sought to know whether Guptas documents were genuine and whether any person by that name had at all passed the universitys B.Sc examination in 1977 with honours in chemistry.																								The university carried out an inquiry and found that the marksheet was forged and no such candidate had appeared in CUs B.Sc examination that year. The university sent the report back to the coast guard office in November 2003.																								However, what shocked the university was a second letter from the coast guard, that reached the office of the controller of examinations on July 1.																								The coast guard claimed to have received a second letter from the university in June. The letter, purported to have been written by Adhikary, said CUs November report on the authenticity of Guptas marksheets was wrong and that Gupta had, indeed, passed the 1997 B.Sc examination. A copy of that letter was attached to the note the university received in July 1.																								The forged letter bore the signature of Adhikari and also the university logo.																								We were making inquiries. Now that we know that the marksheet and the second letter are forged, we have no option but to take action against Gupta, said Narasimha Rao, coast guard joint director (personnel). 																								I was shocked to receive the coast guards note on July 1. The second letter sent to them was forged and what is more surprising, my signature, too, was forged. This is the rarest example of forgery we have come across in recent years, said Adhikari. 																								We are sending the detailed reports to the coast guard and informing the police of the incident, he added.

 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Litter fleet renewal under tipper threat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic authorities and the solid-waste management consultants for the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), are at loggerheads over the proposal to deploy auto-tippers to clear garbage from lanes and bylanes.																								Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporations former chief engineer (conservancy) I.C. Gandhi, who is on the solid-waste management experts panel of the CEIP, had suggested the deployment of auto-tippers. But the citys civic engineers think the move will be labour-intensive and the tippers will spew more pollutants into the air from their two-stroke engines.																								It is more expedient to replace the old garbage trucks with Bharat Stage II versions, since the state government has decided to ban non-Bharat II vehicles from April, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee.																								Municipal commissioner Debasish Som, too, is hesitant to clear the tipper proposal after conservancy officials pointed out that in terms of carrying capacity, seven tippers would be required to replace a truck.																								In that case, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will have to employ seven drivers, in place of one, the officials reasoned. It would be expensive too, pointed out chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar. A new dumper-presser truck, the type now used by the CMC, costs Rs 8 lakh. Seven tippers will cost about Rs 11 crore. 																								Aniruddha Mitra, who is looking after Gandhis office in his absence, said on Thursday: The suggestion to introduce tippers follows the successful implementation of the scheme in Surat in replacing conventional handcarts in a phased manner. The proposal is still hanging fire with the CMCs municipal commissioner and the conservancy department.																								Going by the rules, the proposal will be scrapped automatically if it fails to get the municipal commissioners nod.																								The CMC maintains a fleet of 150 trucks to remove 1,400 tonnes of garbage daily. Another 1,400 tonnes are removed by private contractors. All the vehicles are required to conform to Bharat II norms from April.																								We had hoped that with the ADBs financial assistance, at least 60 per cent of our fleet of conservancy trucks could be replaced with the Bharat II version. If the consultants opt to deploy auto-tippers instead, then the conversion of our fleet will be delayed,said mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb. 																								As part of the ADB-funded environment project, a Rs 10-crore procurement package is on the anvil to modernise the logistical infrastructure of the CMCs solid-waste management system. The package will be spread over two phases.																								Procurement in the first phase includes bulldozers, pay-loaders and mechanical sweepers at a total investment of Rs 5 crore. In the second phase, dumper-pressers, Bharat II-compliant trucks and hand-carts with buckets will be bought for a bill of Rs 6 crore.

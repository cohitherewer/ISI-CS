 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Interaction at the western music workshop. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The room fills up with the sounds of Brahms Alto Rhapsody. The 15-odd people listen in rapturous silence to the lone voice singing of lost love, followed by a chorus of optimism. 																								There are religious overtones in the prayer of hope, but the story of rejected love, written by Brahms for fellow-composer Schumanns daughter when she married someone else, is eternally secular, and moves the participants of the western classical music appreciation workshop.																								Requiem and romanticism, symphony and sonata, Brahms and Beethoven, melody, harmony, instrumental, vocal For some of the participants, it might as well be Greek and Latin, for others, its a part of their lives. Amateurs or connoisseurs, they gather every Friday evening for two hours at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, in Bhowanipore, for pure listening pleasure. But there are lessons on the technical aspects, too.																								The teacher for the 12-session workshop is Anita Mehta, a Cambridge graduate and scientist at the Salt Lake-based SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences by day and a classical music enthusiast by evening. 																								Her action plan is to take an idiosyncratic look through the ages at the evolution of music and harmony, not from the start to now, but beginning and ending in the middle. The aim is to inculcate an analytical appreciation of music, to help grow informed love in the listener.																								The participants are a cross-section of society, from several walks of life, including a 15-year-old school student and a 60-year-old university lecturer. Theres a neurologist and a photographer, a film-studies student and a graduate, but they all share a love for music, and a passion to know more about western classical, like the subtleties of soprano, alto, tenor and bass. So, there are theoretical discussions, with practical illustrations.																								For 25-year-old Shambhu Purshottam, a student of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, the experience is enlightening. It hasnt been very long yet, but since I like music, its good. I wanted to learn more about western classical, which I listen to anyway, but this is more about critical knowledge. And its a nice mix of people in the workshop, some who know music, others who dont.																								Mehta explains that in western classical music, as opposed to Indian classical, there are orchestras, with the linear melodies of each instrument juxtaposed together, and the harmony, notes, highs, lows and speed all clearly written down. But it is in the rendition that the interpretation comes in. Each performers dynamics are different, since liberties can be taken. How you tell the story of the piece is important. Besides, you have to put the composer in the context of the period, and understand the music according to the tools of his times, she explains.																								So, the listener has to be active, not passive. Each session has a theme, and the approach is hands-on. While the fundamentals of things like time signature, evolution of harmony, intricacies of melody and music as a standalone piece or as protagonist in a film are discussed, it is basic enough for those with zero knowledge. The response of a flood of questions and comments is proof enough that their collective curiosity has been excited. As the words fade, its time for more music. Song of Destiny plays on

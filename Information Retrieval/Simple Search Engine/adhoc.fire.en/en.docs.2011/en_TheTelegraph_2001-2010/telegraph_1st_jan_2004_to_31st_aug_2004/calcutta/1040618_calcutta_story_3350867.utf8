 SANGITA S. GUHA ROY																								Lights and camera were well in place but there was very little action, complain former students of the script-to-screen workshop in video film-making at Chitrabani.																								The three-month course, costing each of the 10 students in the batch Rs 10,000, allegedly promised a hands-on, practically-oriented session, at the end of which each student was supposed to make two short films.																								The students, however, were in for a rude shock when towards the end of the three-month workshop, they were asked to cough up Rs 3,000 more or forget about the second film.																								We had everything in place  starting from the storyboard to the shooting schedule  but we were not allowed to proceed with it. Acting director Julian S. Das asked us to pay up more money, citing a funds crunch, alleges Minu Agarwal, one of the former students.																								The institute authorities deny the allegations. We never promised the students they would be making two individual films at the end of the course. Since the idea is to learn direction, a group film to give them a hands-on practical experience is all we offered, says Father P.J. Joseph, director, Chitrabani.																								In any case, this was the first batch in this kind of workshop that got down to making at least one individual film each, he clarifies, adding that a proposal to make a second individual film did come from the course coordinator but didnt materialise owing to a funds crunch.																								These courses are supposed to be subsidised, as Chitrabani is a non-profit organisation and gets grants from various national and international bodies, argues Deep Mukherjee, a young graduate who had come to the institute looking for a viable career option.																								The students also went on to conduct a market survey to verify the total cost of equipment hire with the help of course coordinator Raja Dey, who felt that the editing equipment cost was inflated. We required the equipment for 10 days. At the market rate of Rs 150 per day, the total cost couldnt have been more than Rs 1,500 but the institute quoted Rs 3,000, alleges Dey.																								The students were ultimately allowed to make a group film but they were far from satisfied. 																								Its bizarre to expect 10 people to direct a single film. But we were helpless, says Ajit George Varghese, who is now planning to take his film-making dreams to FTII Pune.

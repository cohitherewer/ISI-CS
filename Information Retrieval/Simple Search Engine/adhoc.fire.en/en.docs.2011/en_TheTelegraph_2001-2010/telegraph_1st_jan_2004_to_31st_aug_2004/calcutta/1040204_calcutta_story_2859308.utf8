 Feng Shui / Pinky Kapoor																								Our ambitions in life are best achieved when we have definite aims and objectives and a guiding force. More often than not, it is our own inhibitions and fears that restrict our success. Feng Shui principles help us to create a favourable environment, which when coupled with a positive attitude can work wonders. Thus, if we want to clinch a deal, get admission to a college of choice or get a promotion, we should direct our energies in a positive manner and not yield to the bottlenecks created by negative emotions.																								To focus our thoughts in the correct direction, Feng Shui advises us to place the business card of the organisation whose contract we wish to acquire, in the north of our house, bedroom or office. Similarly, placing a picture of the university we want admission to or the brochure of the organisation we wish to join in the north would go a long way towards fulfilling our dreams. It would be wise to place the above on an auspicious day for maximum benefits. This apart, dont forget to face your auspicious direction while filling in important documents and forms.																								While it is quite easy to arrange our homes according to the principles of Feng Shui, its not always possible when we have to go on business trips or stay in an unknown environment. Before you move into such a place, try your best to get a room according to your auspicious direction. It is most likely that you will occupy a room that has been previously lived in by some other person. In such a case, always remember that inanimate objects have the capacity to absorb both negative and positive emotions that in turn affect the person staying here. Therefore, to clear the room of negative energy, open all the windows, light a candle and burn a few incense sticks in the north-eastern sector. Sleep with your head pointing towards your success direction, so that beneficial energy can flow into your body. If a mirror in the room catches your reflection while you sleep, cover it and also unplug all electrical appliances so that their electromagnetic waves dont interfere with your sleep.			It is believed that each individual is destined to have a profession or business according to his or her nature and capability. Each business/profession is said to be associated with a particular element. This element can be successfully harnessed if we use the correct colour linked to it. The five elements, their related colours and the corresponding areas of interest they influence, are given in the accompanying chart.																								For instance, the colour red would be beneficial for the owners of fast-food chains and restaurants as well as those seeking employment in this industry. This is because this trade is primarily concerned with the element of fire, which is symbolised by the colour red. Job-seekers would be advised to carry a red handkerchief, a red folder or a red pen as it provides them with the energy required for this profession.																								An important aspect of successful business deals is the confidence with which you present your ideas. In case you need to give a presentation, it is important to face a direction that is auspicious for you. But make sure that you have a solid wall to support you and your back is never to the door or window as this may create anxiety and insecurity.																								Tip of the week:																								People who are connected with businesses related to the water element such as media and finance would do well to wear blue for crucial business meetings. For men, the best combination would be a blue shirt worn with black trousers. As far as accessories are concerned, carrying a black briefcase, a black or blue pen, a mobile, files and folders ensure that people in the media line are supported by their favourable elements.

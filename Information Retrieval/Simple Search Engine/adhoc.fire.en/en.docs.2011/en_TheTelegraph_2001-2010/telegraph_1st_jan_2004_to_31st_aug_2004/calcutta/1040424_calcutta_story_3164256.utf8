The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Quartet in net for housewife molest
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), a CPM wing, were arrested on Friday on charges of torturing and molesting a 22-year-old housewife at Chaitanyanagar, in Barasat, last week.																								Our raids over the past few days yielded nothing, admitted Kanad Mukherjee, sub-divisional police officer, Barasat. The men would flee just before wed arrive. However, a tip-off on Thursday night helped us round them up. The men did attempt to get away, but gave up when they realised that they were outnumbered, he added.																								The relentless raids followed a prod from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office. He had asked the local police to arrest the housewifes tormentors, irrespective of party links. The government will not go by political colour, he had said.																								Bhattacharjee issued the order after the incident was reported by The Telegraph, also citing how the police chose to overlook the crime in light of the goons political affiliation.																								Ramen Dhali, Debu Kundu, Ratan Sarkar and Surjo Das will be produced in court soon, police said after their arrest. The four would harass the housewife in Barasat whenever she stepped out of home. After her husband asked the youths not to disturb her, the quartet started issuing threats to the husband, the wife and the rest of their family.																								The four raided the house on Sunday and molested the woman in front of her baby daughter and sister-in-law. Though a complaint was lodged with Barasat police station, there was no action taken. The four criminals took advantage of this and stepped up their harassment of the family. 																								Things began to move only after the couple approached senior officers and reports started appearing in newspapers. Chief minister Bhattacharjee promised to look into the matter. 																								 The family has heaved a sigh of relief after the arrests. We thought wed have to leave the area, said the 60-year-old father-in-law of the victim. He had earlier advised his daughter-in-law not to lodge a case against the miscreants because of their links with the ruling party.																								We are reassured by the police action. Those four men had nearly ruined our lives. Now, we feel safer in the area, said her husband who, in the past few days, didnt dare leave home for long. The family, however, is not sure about staying on in the area. At the back of the mind remains the threat by Ratan and Surjo of a post-poll reprisal.																								The DYFI district leadership, which had earlier admitted that the four were party activists, did not comment on the arrests.

 															- Disturbing revelations by urban surveys on child domestic labour A STAFF REPORTER																								They come to the city to flee poverty and to earn a living. More often than not, they end up being abused and mistreated, and survive on a pittance. 																								Child domestic workers are a common sight in Calcutta, mostly from villages in the districts, from as young as seven or eight years old. They were the subjects of discussion at a seminar organised by Save the Children, UK, in collaboration with partner implementation NGOs on Wednesday. Under the scanner were several surveys conducted by the NGOs in the city and districts to gauge the numbers and quality of lives of these young workers.																								There were presentations of urban surveys by three NGOs in different areas. But the stories were the same  of illiteracy, poverty, uncooperative employers, and abuse of girls.																								Dipanwita Ghosh from Right Track went door-to-door in Mominpur, Kidderpore, Ekbalpore, Alipore, New Alipore, Chetla and Taratala. In the 7,436 households visited in six wards, 324 child domestic workers were found, between the ages of nine and 16. Of them, 89 per cent were school dropouts, 69 per cent were the eldest girl child in the family, 29 per cent lost their fathers at or below the age of five, only 3.6 per cent were boys and only 11 per cent of their parents had studied above Class IV. 																								Another revelation was the fact that the children from Midnapore and Canning are supplied by agents, while those from Lakshmikantapur and Burdwan are sent by their families.																								Peoples attitudes to child domestic workers is the problem. They see themselves as doing these children a favour  if they werent helping them, then the kids would be starving in their villages. In some cases, they would ask me how much I earn and why Im wasting my life. One marble businessman asked me to work for him instead of doing this work, recalls Dipanwita. 																								During the survey, it emerged that the worst cases of mistreatment and lack of cooperation come from upper-class homes, in this case, Alipore. This is where the wealthiest business families live, and there are three to four child domestic workers per home. But they refuse to talk to us. We learnt from their drivers that there is a centre in Salt Lake supplying these youngsters, she adds. The middle class is more sympathetic to the kids.																								Christine D. Rozario, from Loreto Sealdah, got screamed and shouted at and chased away on many of her attempts to get to these youngsters. We went to 2,000 households and also worked with mainly Class V children in eight schools. These children formed their own groups and went around their neighbourhoods, mobilising support. They were better received than us. But we had sensitisation workshops with parents and teachers  some of them had reservations about the project, explains Christine.																								Paschim Banga Yuva Kalyan Manch surveyed Jadavpur, Behala, Garia and Tollygunge. Here, Pratibha Vaidya found out that of the 90 child domestic workers they were able to pinpoint, 75 were girls, mostly between the ages of 10 and 15, and over 45 per cent of them were from joint families. And their monthly pay varied between Rs 100 and Rs 400. A lot of the employees are resistant to the children coming to our drop-in centres. And most of these kids dont want to go back home, despite the abuse. The biggest reason is TV, Pratibha sums up.

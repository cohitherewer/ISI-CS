The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Malls mull survival tools
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 At Forum, on Elgin Road: More than 5.5 million people have visited the mall since it opened in March 2003. A Telegraph picture 																								Todays shoppers look for quality and reliability, width and depth of product range, love touch-n-feel, in-store mirrors, being spoken to and recognised, good bargains and rewards On the flip side, the pet peeves are long queues at cash tills, shop-floor personnel asking dumb questions, obscure price tags, intimidating service																								With Calcutta firmly in the grip of mall-eria and more than three million square feet of built retail space being readied for rollout over the next 36 months, existing as well as emerging players are keen to get the basics right to drive in the footfalls. A couple of structured plenary sessions at the CII retail summit in town last week offered answers to a plethora of retail posers.																								What is wiser  to lease or to sell space, are competing anchors productive or counter-productive, what would be the impact of FDI on retail, do multiplexes really benefit malls? Should a Hugo Boss sit next to a Haldirams? From tenant mix to merchandise management, pricing strategy to consumer loyalty programmes, the twin symposiums on mall management and retail management sought to address diverse issues critical in todays context.																								Malls should be inclusive, not elitist, and a degree of studied negligence often adds to the ambience. Its important to comprehend the catchment character and cater to local aspirations, observed Harsh Neotia, developer of City Centre. Atul Ruia, director of Mumbais highly successful Phoenix High Street Mall, agreed with Neotia that it was important to project malls as destinations.																								While most concurred that leasing out mall space as opposed to buyout was the right strategy  at least to begin with  there was a word of caution for the newcomers. Those joining the fray without adequate knowledge of the business are likely to get hurt, warned Deepak Sachdev, vice-president, Ansal Properties amp; Industries Ltd, developers of Delhis Ansal Plaza.																								Forum managing director Rahul Saraf felt an anchors role was to drive footfall into a mall. But it must dip into only a certain portion of the shoppers basket. Some anchors tend to be quasi-malls themselves, while sitting inside malls, which is not a happy scenario, he said. Saraf, however, doesnt have reservations on multiple anchors in a single property, referring to the overwhelming success of the Phoenix format.																								The rudimentary four-step hygiene towards delivering a great customer experience should be identify, differentiate, interact and customise, said R. Sriram, CEO and managing director, Crossword Bookstores Ltd, while stressing on the need to build learning relationships.																								The increased lifestyle spending options, together with the credit-friendly environment and exposure to overseas formats, would make fashion the future of retail in every product category, felt Sanjeev Agrawal, head, marketing, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd. But, there wont be a blind aping of the West, with a leaning towards niche, specialised brands, he predicted.

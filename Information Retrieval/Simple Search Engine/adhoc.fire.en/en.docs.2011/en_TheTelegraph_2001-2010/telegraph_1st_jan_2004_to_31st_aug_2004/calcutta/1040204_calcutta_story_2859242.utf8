 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Steve Young interacts with students and teachers at Calcutta School of Music. Picture by Aranya Sen																								What are you inspired by? How do you write your music? were the questions from a young guitar teacher.																								I grew up in Georgia, Alabama and Texas. The foothills of the Appalachia are very poor areas. Thats my inspiration. As for writing music, its intuitive, a spiritual experience, like a spirit whispering in my ear, was the response from veteran musician Steve Young, with a warm smile.																								In Calcutta recently, the American singer-songwriter played for a packed audience at the American Center, sang with baul singers for a TV programme and interacted with students and teachers at Calcutta School of Music (CSM). The mix of Scottish, Irish, Celtic, Spanish, Native American, Cherokee, gospel, soul and rock music is the key to his success.																								From a white trash song  the story of his own happy cousins  to music men like Muddy Waters  thats the kind of names they had, and an Irish sailors song that became a cowboy ballad, Youngs repertoire incorporates all that is inherently American. His hits include Seven Bridges Road, sung and re-sung by legends like Dolly Parton and Joan Baez. 																								I dont understand what made some of my songs famous. Its a mystery to me. Id like to do it again. Maybe one day Britney Spears or Bollywood will use my songs, was the flippant answer to a curious query from a guitar student about his success.																								Performing around the world is his passion, from Egypt to Australia, China and beyond, on his 21-year-old guitar. 																								The Californian has 13 albums and innumerable live performances to his credit, and has worked with musicians like Gram Parsons and Van Dyke Parks. His songs have been used by the likes of Eagles and Rita Coolidge.																								Offbeat and original is his taste in music. But I love anything that sounds ancient, like its way back in time. Thats what appeals to me about Indian music. Even in the folk songs here, I can hear the wonderful drama in the words, although I dont understand them.																								While there were queries on his choice of music and his musical influences, it was his performance that held the audience spellbound. The last song that he sung on popular demand at CSM was the Marty Robbins hit El Paso. He was happy to oblige, since Spanish music is his personal favourite. 																								And the appreciative applause at the end was proof that he had won them over.

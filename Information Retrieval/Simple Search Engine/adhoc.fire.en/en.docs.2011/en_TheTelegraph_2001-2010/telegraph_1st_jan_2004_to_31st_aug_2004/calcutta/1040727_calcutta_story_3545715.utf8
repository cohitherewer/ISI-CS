The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Takeover of Metro hangs fire
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government is working on a central proposal to take over Metro Railway, state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Monday.																								We have not taken any final decision in the matter because a lot of aspects, including its overhead, liability, earnings and expenditure, will have to be examined. I have asked my officers and engineers to look into the matter and submit a report, Chakraborty said.																								The transport minister told the Assembly that the Centre had recently approached the government to take over the Metro management, including plying of trains. Let work end on extension of services from Tollygunge to Garia. Only then will we be in a position to finalise our stand, Chakraborty said.																								The Rs 907-crore Metro extension project is scheduled to be ready in June 2007. The state government has to bear one-third of the project cost and has already pushed in Rs 46 crore.																								According to transport department officials, minister Chakraborty has discussed the takeover offer in different circles but the government does not appear to be too keen to accept it, in view of the Metros huge financial liabilities.

Social Register The Devdas-inspired jewels. Picture by Rashbehari Das The bustling jewellery circuit in the city is hosting another exhibition at the moment. And though the name of the collection, Summer Splendour, might suggest that the designer is a little confused about the seasonal calendar, a peek into the gorgeous pieces on show and one is forced to admit that names matter little, after all.The Delhi-based designer, Asha Kamal Modi, who exhibits her work in Calcutta every year, is back again at Identity Gallery, with a collection of neck-pieces, bracelets, anklets, earrings and chokers. Last years Ash-inspired Devdas look is still riding the popularity wave, the designer insists.The high point is possibly the vibrant use of colours that Modi has mastered. Set in silver, the designs flaunt precious stones like rubies, emeralds, sapphire as well as semi-precious stones like coral and garnet.Most of the items are elaborate in craftsmanship and are apt for an Indian occasion as well as a glitzy party. Lively colours like green, pink and red dominate the collection while, in keeping with the summer season, light blue and pristine white stones have also been used.We have set the jewellery in silver to make it more affordable while giving the craftsmen a free hand in using the metal, said a spokesperson on behalf of Modi, who is now in Delhi. Most of the pieces are gold polished.Devdas is still ruling jewellery purchasing trends, and we have come up with elaborate and large neck-pieces reminiscent of bygone eras, the spokesperson added.While one can pick up a pair of earrings for Rs 1,500 onwards, bracelets and bangles have been priced between Rs 3,000 and Rs 8,000, while chokers are on sale for Rs 3,200 onwards. The lighter necklaces start from Rs 4,200 while the larger ones go on to Rs 30,000. A good mix of contemporary colour schemes, the exhibition is on till July 6. Models take the stage at the RCGC fashion show. Picture by Rashbehari Das Club couture  RCGC members flaunted their chiffons and silks and got an eyeful of the same at a glittering fashion show on Friday evening.Organised to celebrate the inauguration of a new air-conditioned lounge at the south Calcutta club, the gala showcased ethnic garments and some fusion ensembles by city-based designers and boutiques.While there was bridal wear from Palki, the boutique Navya Naveli, specialising in chikankari, presented a unique range of lehngas embellished with delicate embroidery teamed with a sparkle of mirrors.There was a hint of glint in Minds collection as well with mirror work ruling the roost. Their salwar-kameez sets in stiff kota fabric, usually reserved for saris, stood out apart from Indo-westerns in crepe and silk.What set the ramp on fire, though, was a medley of reds from So?, a boutique on Park Street.Pretty models sizzled on the ramp in the fiery palette flaunting Indian drapes and western silhouettes to a well-choreographed show put together by model-turned-event manager Nicola Gomes.The audience had no choice but to keep a close eye on the proceedings, which was part of the Friday club nites theme at the venue, for emcee Preksha was there to grill them on the sugar content of the eye candy  sticking to the clothes only  after every round.The bubbly compere would fire a volley of questions like which designers on display they liked and why, and would they be willing to shell out more moolah for designer wear and so on.The point to the posers was to feel the pulse  and the buying potential  of the audience . The encouraging verdict emerging out of this for the show-stoppers: the fashion conscious are willing to pay more for exclusive, quality designer wear. Arunima digs in at Escoffier New Alipore. Picture by Rashbehari Das Bake bestHot Breads new avatar Escoffier has spread its wings to south Calcutta. Freshly baked bread and melt-in-the-mouth pastries from the popular brand are now available at Metropolis, a shopping complex in New Alipore. We have a range of fresh breads, baked items and confectionery that customers can pick up from here, said Saurabh Almal, confident after his 10-year experience in the bakery business with Hot Breads and now Escoffier that Calcuttans like to feast on all things floury and sweet.The New Alipore extension, that was recently inaugurated by actress Arunima, is a take-away shop for breads, sweets and savouries.There are plans on the anvil for a few more outlets as well. Past perfectShades from the past have inspired the newly launched antique line at Syndicate Jewellery, shop at 22 Camac Street. The plush 6,000 sq feet showroom with an art-gallery look is currently playing host to an exhibition of its latest line of jewellery called Inspirations, in which each design has been inspired by styles of ancient craftsmen. Like a bangle in solid gold with a motif of Queen Victoria in meenakari inspired by old Jaipuri art-work. A string of pear-shaped amethysts hark back to British styles. The use of Arabian motifs on another set of bangles gives a Persian effect.To achieve the antiquated style and feel, the gold has been given a used, dull finish. The antique look is what many people buying heavy jewellery prefer, suggests a spokesperson for the shop.Most of the sets in the newly launched line are formidable, with a heavy look and feel to broad necklaces and large earrings. The sets are priced at Rs 40,000 and above. While the line is sure to interest patrons of the yellow metal, the shop showcases contemporary jewellery as well, just right for the modern woman. Light-weight sets of necklaces and earrings in gold are available for as little as Rs 2,000. HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

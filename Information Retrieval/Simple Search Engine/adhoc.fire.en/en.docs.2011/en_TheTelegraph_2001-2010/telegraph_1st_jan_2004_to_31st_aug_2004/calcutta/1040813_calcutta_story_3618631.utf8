 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 14 years on, faint memories linger
 AMIT UKIL IN JAMDOBA (BANKURA)																								For 14 years, the dream of meeting her husband, some day, has kept her going. But now, Purnima Chatterjee lies listless on a charpoy in a dark room in her fathers house here.																								With her husband, Dhananjoy, two nights away from the gallows, Purnima has given up the fight and abandoned all hope.																								I still believe my husband is innocent. He was framed, said Purnima, moments after she came to know that the Supreme Court had rejected a fresh plea on Thursday.																								Purnima stopped eating ever since the news from Delhi reached this obscure village in Bankura.																								On Wednesday, Purnima wrote her last letter to her husband, stating that she had waited for so many years with the belief that Dhananjoy would be freed.																								The letter that was sent to the condemned cell of Alipore Central jail carried references to the seven months she had spent with Dhananjoy after marriage. Now, I will have to live with those faint memories, she stated.																								On July 28, when he had met his younger brother Bikash in prison, Dhananjoy sent a message to his wife, asking her to marry again if he was hanged.																								I cannot think of marrying again. It is not possible, Purnima insisted.																								She works in the state health departments integrated child development scheme and is unsure about how her colleagues would accept her after the tragedy.																								Her father, Anil Mukherjee, who sold a chunk of his land and ornaments to help Dhananjoys parents fight the case for 14 years, does not feel his elder daughter will remarry.																								I am facing so much difficulty in getting my younger daughter married. I do not know what her fate will be, lamented Mukherjee.																								A marriage negotiation for Shyamali, 29, Purnimas sister, had been going on for a while and it was to be finalised this Sunday. 																								The boys family called off the talks on Thursday.																								Purnimas family members remain convinced that Dhananjoy has been wronged. Why was Buddhadebbabu so desperate to see Dhananjoy hanged? There are so many criminals who are roaming free, observed Samir Goswami, Purnimas uncle and a local CPM worker.																								He was framed and he served two punishments, imprisonment for 14 years and then the death sentence, added Goswami.																								If Purnimas despair is shared by her family members, voices of anger rise from the villagers who have decided to raise black flags  not the Tricolour  at Jamdoba, Kashipur, Jhantipahari, Chhatna and other blocks on the Purulia-Bankura border, on Independence Day, to protest Dhananjoys hanging.																								Security has been beefed up in nearby Kuludih, where Dhananjoys family lives, but his parents and other family members showed no signs of stepping out or leaving the village.

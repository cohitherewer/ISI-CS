 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Bengal art through the ages
Galerie 88s 16th annual exhibition features twin art shows on works from two distinctly different periods of Bengal art. Forgotten Pioneers of Modern Bengal Art is dedicated to the paintings of the late Amina Ahmed Kar (one of her watercolours appears along). One of the foremost exponents of this school of art, she is well-known for her use of abstract imagery and passionate colours. The other exhibition, titled Art Watch, deals with works by emerging talents in the field of Bengal art. Featuring paintings by Santanu Maity, Jayanto Roy, Sandip Roy, Jiaur Rahman, Sabyasachi Bose, Chandana Hore, Riten Roy and Paula Sengupta, among others, this exhibition highlights todays diverse trends in this genre of art. The two exhibitions provide an interesting combination, conveying the link in the images and imagination of the Bengal art over the last five decades.

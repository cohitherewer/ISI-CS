 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 All-star bow to the Barracks
MOVIE MISSIONThe Anjan Dutt film is set in Bow Barracks, a settlement of around 140 Christian families in central Calcutta
 The mission is to raise funds for the restoration of the dilapidated address
 The star cast ranges from Victor Banerjee to Lillete Dubey, Moon Moon Sen to Usha Uthup																								It was just another Christmas and Anjan Dutt had dropped in at Bow Barracks to screen Bada Din to the residents. The screening was meant to raise funds for the historic tenement, Dutt had been told by architect-activist Manish Chakravarty.																								As the actor-director walked around, the people surprised him, as did the place, which had a spirit that outshone its outward bleakness. It seemed as if a miniature world with a cosmopolitan population of Chinese, Goan and Anglo-Indians had been tucked into the huge weather-beaten structures in central Calcutta.																								Some three years on, Dutt wheeled his camera into the Barracks, with script in hand. After a month-long shoot, he emerged with Bow Barracks Forever, an English language film documenting a string of human stories stitched together.																								For Bow Barracks, Dutt needed actors who could bring forth the essence of the individual dramas. The way the people talked, the way they smoked their cigarettes, the way they lived their lives.

(Top left) Victor Banerjee And after a mad hunt, he put together a cast he could be proud of  Lillete Dubey and her daughter Neha, Victor Banerjee, Moon Moon Sen, newcomer Clayton Rodgers, George Baker, cameos from the likes of Usha Uthup and Nondon Bagchi, plus the residents of the Barracks. Some kids from Parsee Club were roped in, too.																								Lillete, who plays a real-life wine-brewer, did a lot of homework. She would often drop in at the Barracks and interact with the people. And Victor, who is an alcoholic trumpet player, learnt to play the instrument. I was furious with Moon Moon who didnt turn up for the workshop we had with Sohag Sen, but as she was familiar with the milieu through her acquaintances, she just walked into her role, says Dutt. For Lillete, the film was a chance to work with a cast with a predominantly theatre background. I fell in love with the script. Here was something very exciting after Monsoon Wedding. Also because I love working with ensemble cast. While shooting for three-four weeks, we forged a special camaraderie, says Lillete, who shares screen space for the first time with daughter Neha, never having been together in one frame in Monsoon Wedding.																								Things were relatively easy for the 24-year-old Clayton with his Anglo-Indian background. I had spotted him at a British Council school drama festival and found him really stunning, recounts Dutt. For the role of Sally, a somewhat flirtatious teenager, I was looking for a fresh face. Tapas Pals daughter Sohini fitted the bill.																								To conjure up the right atmosphere, Dutt consulted the residents of the Barracks for the costumes, designed by his wife. With the shooting schedule becoming one long party at the Barracks, some of the residents happily stitched costumes for the cast, while others served up a steady stream of speciality dishes for the stars and the rest.																								An essential part of the film is the soundtrack scored and composed by Dutts son, Neel. The tracks have been sung by Shaan, Usha Uthup and the Goa-based Dominique.																								The idea is to draw national and international attention to Bow Barracks. So, I am planning a mid-December release. It will be Christmas time and the place will be at its best, Dutt adds. The funds generated from Bow Barracks Forever could go a long way in restoring this decrepit building and saving a slice of history.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

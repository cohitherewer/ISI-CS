The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 State move to clear occupied heritage sites
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed at reports about forcible occupation of heritage properties in the city and other urban areas by a section of unscrupulous promoters, the government has directed the civic bodies to take steps to protect all the heritage sites.																								The municipal affairs department has also instructed the municipal authorities, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, to form heritage preservation committees in the city and all urban towns.																								The heritage preservation committees will comprise municipal officials, engineers, senior citizens and representatives of local clubs and mass organisations. The committees will conduct surveys of heritage properties in the respective areas and submit their status reports to the state heritage commission within a month. The committees have been directed to take immediate steps to recover heritage sites from unauthorised occupation.																								The government has a state-level heritage preservation commission with educationist Pratap Chandra Chunder as its chairman to chalk out programmes for preservation of heritage sites. The state heritage commission has already identified about 350 heritage sites all over Bengal.																								The municipal affairs department has also asked the district administrations, including rural bodies, to trace historical places in addition to those identified by the state heritage commission. 																								We have information that some people have grabbed heritage sites and properties for commercial exploitation. However, the government is determined to protect the heritage properties and will not allow any change in their status. We will take stern action against such people, said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya.																								The minister said the Assembly had already passed a bill for the preservation of heritage sites and properties. Under the new legislation, any change in the status or transfer of heritage properties is illegal and a cognisable offence, he said.																								According to officials, many heritage properties and sites located in Malda, Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar are potential tourist attractions. Several of these heritage buildings were in a bad shape due to the lack of renovation and proper maintenance.																								We intend to develop the heritage sites in different districts and later throw them open to tourists, Bhattacharya said.

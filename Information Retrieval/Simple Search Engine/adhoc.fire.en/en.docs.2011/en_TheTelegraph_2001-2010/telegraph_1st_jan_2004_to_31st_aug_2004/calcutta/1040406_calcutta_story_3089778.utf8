The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Client list 500,000, yet mobile upwardly
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Cellular service provider Hutch has become the first operator to cross the half-million mark in the eastern region. Hutch (erstwhile Command) touched the magic figure in March. 																								The past year has been remarkable for us. We witnessed over 80 per cent growth in subscriber base. In the final phase, 100,000 subscribers were added in less than six months, said Sunil Sood, chief executive officer, Hutch.																								From college campuses to middle-class households and corporate headquarters to small trading zones, mobile mania ruled all segments. Though pre-paid connections, with 75 per cent share, drove the numbers, post-paid connections also registered a significant growth. 																								According to Sood, the growth was driven by a combination of factors, including the superior quality of network with over 471 sites, round-the-clock availability of customer service, a host of value-added services and a range of offers for subscribers.																								The network quality will improve further, as we have been allowed additional spectrum frequency. From 6.2 megaHertz, it will go up to 8 megaHertz. We have already applied for the extra frequency, added Sood. 																								The company invested around Rs 100 crore for network improvement in 2003 and the investment plans for this fiscal are also substantial.																								Though the total number of cellular phone connections in the city (870,274 as per data released in February by the Cellular Operators Association of India) is much lower than metros like Delhi and Mumbai, the company is hopeful of maintaining the growth rate. 																								The market is not only growing in the city, its also growing fast in the suburbs and we will intensify our efforts to rope in new subscribers, he added.																								Besides, the company will roll out a host of new initiatives for subscribers, ranging from one more Hutch shop in north Calcutta to mobile-phone recharge zones in public places, like the airport, railway stations, clubs, hospitals and banks. 																								Hutch is also tying up with tour operators to offer attractive weekend packages and eco-tourism options to its subscribers.

	The pond on the premises of Deshbandhu Park is getting polluted by the day. It should be converted into a modern swimming pool. Not only will that help learners prepare for competitive swimming, it will also be a good place for state-level champions to practise. A nominal fee may be charged from the users for maintenance of the pool.

	While many multinational banks are offering 24-hour service to their customers, IDBI still lacks certain facilities. Their ATM counter at the Park Street branch is often found defunct. Many-a-time, I have also found that the envelopes to deposit cheques are not available there. If such is the state of affairs, more and more customers would make a beeline for multinational banks to avail of better service. Will the IDBI authorities look into the matter?

	It is disheartening to see that the newly opened subway at Bidhannagar railway station is getting waterlogged after every shower and is rendered useless for passengers. Some still manage to wade through the ankle-deep water but in the process ruin their clothes and footwear. The condition of the subway undoubtedly is proof of the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities entrusted with the construction of the subway. The construction itself is faulty as the lie of the floor is not meant to drain off the water. Water now accumulates in the area because it is at a lower level than the surrounding floor. Perhaps, the subway has been opened to public without a trial.

	The small post office at 1, Council House Street in Dalhousie is a unique one. The post master, counter clerk, stamp vendor and the rest of the staff are all women. However, there is one drawback which bothers regulars  work never starts before 10.30 am. Will the postal authority take some step so that the post office starts catering to customers from 10 am?

	A traffic signal must be put up at the Sarat Bose Road-Rowland Road-Elgin Road crossing. It is a school area and students returning home find it difficult to negotiate the stretch with buses stopping almost anywhere to pick up passengers.

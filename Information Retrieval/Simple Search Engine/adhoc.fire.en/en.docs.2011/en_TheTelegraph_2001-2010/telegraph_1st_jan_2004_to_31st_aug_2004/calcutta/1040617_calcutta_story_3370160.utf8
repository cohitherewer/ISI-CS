 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Suns rays to power road lights
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The traffic wing of the city police is, for the first time, using non-conventional energy sources, like solar cells, to power its embedded road dividers. 																								Similar lights, though not solar-powered, are already in place on Red Road. They will be installed in major thoroughfares in and around the city soon. 																								In the trial run, the new blinking lights were equipped with solar cells to charge them for the night. In future, roads connecting the EM Bypass and VIP Road, running through the New Township in Rajarhat, will feature such lights for traffic safety. 																								We started using such devices in the past couple of months along some city roads. We will extend their use to some more roads, like the approaches to Vidyasagar Setu, the Bypass and a few streets through which vehicles travel at high speed, said Arun Kumar Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). 																								The conventional lights introduced a few years ago developed snags after continuous use. 																								As these are embedded in metalled roads, it is very difficult to pull them out to replace the batteries. The solar lights will solve the problem, as they will generate their own power to charge the blinking light-emitting diodes (LEDs), said a traffic police officer associated with the maintenance of these lights. 																								Deputy commissioner Sharma said such lights are very essential, especially at the entry and exit points of highways and on the citys high-speed roads.																								These new gadgets have been encapsulated in a steel casing with a glass top, directly under which four rectangular solar cells are fitted. The cells are connected with a timer and a battery that power the blinking LEDs. The battery gets charged as sunlight falls on it. The entire unit will be embedded in the metalled roads. The glass used matches bullet-proof glass in terms of strength, as heavy vehicles will pass over them, a traffic official explained.																								 The timer, which automatically turns on after 12 hours, sets the lights blinking once it is dark. The lights keep blinking for the next 12 hours, and automatically shut down around sunrise. 																								Housing minister Goutam Deb said all major roads in Rajarhat will be fitted with the solar-powered signalling system.

 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 In-laws gag and set bride ablaze
 																											- Four years of torture ends in flames, four held A STAFF REPORTER																								Four years of an unhappy marriage, scarred by torture and abuse, ended with the murder of Nargis Bibi by her in-laws.																								Struggling to draw in each breath for nine hours, Nargis, 28, succumbed to 100 per cent burns at 4.30 am on August 15. 																								Three of her alleged killers, including husband Mohammad Naushad, were arrested after Nargis brother Mohammad Kaif Ahmed lodged an FIR with Narkeldanga police station, naming six persons. Another arrest was made on Wednesday, but the rest are absconding. 																								We are interrogating the arrested for the whereabouts of the absconding accused, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Ranvir Kumar.																								Nargis two-year-old son and three-year-old daughter are missing.																								Naushad, a television company salesman, married Nargis on January 23, 2000. Brother Ahmed had paid a dowry of Rs 80,000, along with 14 tolas of gold jewellery. 																								But Nargis returned home in April, bruised and in tears. Husband Naushad, mother-in-law Zairunissa, sisters-in-law Shahani Khatoon and Dulari Khatoon, brother-in-law Mohammad Mukhtar and his cousin Mohammad Anwar Hussain had kicked her out of their Gas Street home in Rajabazar. 																								A few days later, Shahani turned up at Ahmeds Canal East Road home, where he lives with mother Lado. She alleged that Nargis couldnt cook and had failed to perform the duties of a housewife.																								She then told Ahmed that Naushads income had dropped, and asked him to send Nargis back with Rs 1 lakh. Naushad would buy a taxi with the money, she said. Ahmed raised Rs 20,000 and took his sister back to her in-laws.																								Things went on smoothly for a while. Nargis was again subjected to abuse and assault, and sent back home after every few months. 																								Fearing a talaq, she did not utter a word, nor did she let Ahmed interfere. Ahmed, too, kept sending Nargis back to her in-laws with money.																								But his patience wore out when a tearful Nargis turned up at home again in June. He informed neighbours, who accompanied him to Naushads house. He told Naushad that he would inform the police if his sister was abused and assaulted ever again. 																								I had not imagined that my protest would eventually claim her life, Ahmed said. 																								At 7 pm on August 14, Nargis sisters-in-law allegedly gagged her, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. 																								The family waited till it was sure that Nargis would not survive, and then admitted her to Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital. She died the next morning.

 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Landfill laws fail to save the ponds
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Where have all the waterbodies gone? To the ground, would be the disturbing answer  going by the concrete-jungle figures served up on Friday in the state Assembly.																								No less than 97.02 hectares of land has allegedly been filled, of which the government has managed to restore only 33.75 hectares to the original condition.																								In all of 148 complaints, only in 16 cases were the areas restored to the original condition, while filling was stopped in no more than 72 instances.																								Worse, only 10 persons have been arrested in the city in connection with filling up of waterbodies  a non-bailable offence.																								Friday found the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government rattling off these figures in the Assembly. It is unfortunate that despite so many existing laws, waterbodies continue to be filled up, admitted fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, who also oversees waterbodies along with other official agencies.																								The problem exists all over the state, but it is worst in Calcutta and its surroundings, he later added.																								When the Inland Fisheries Act was compiled in 1984, the government was simply taking a measure to prevent the crime, and the problem did not exist then. Later, the act was amended twice and now filling waterbodies is a non-bailable offence.																								The main problem is to pick up offenders. We have obtained a list from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) containing plot numbers and names of owners. However, during investigation, it is often found that the land has been transferred to others, said minister Nanda.																								It was also found in several places  for example in ward no. 2 in Cossipore  that the houses were constructed after getting the plans sanctioned from the CMC, along with mutation. So, there was nothing we could do, he said. For the remaining complaints, however, notices had been sent.																								Nanda went on to urge the corporation, the municipalities and the police to back the government in its bid to save the waterbodies.																								We are going to bring a new provision in the law so that if it is proved from records that a waterbody has been filled up, it will be taken over by the government as vested land. As compensation, the owner will get one-fourth the money that can be earned by cultivating fish in the tract, minister Nanda later added.

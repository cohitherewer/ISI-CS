 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 In search of the self
																								Life has become so stressful in the present day that human beings have lost touch with their own lives and that of their near and dear ones. Lack of communion with their own selves has led men to become like machines. And having lost the ability to feel and respond naturally to emotions, they dont know when to laugh and when to cry. Written by Prodyut Chakraborty and directed by Dwijen Bandopadhyay, Samstabs Gunodharer Asukh tries to help us resolve the confusions in our minds and, in the process, discover our true selves. It is an attempt to find ones own self through Gunodhar, the eponymous character of the play, who undertakes an almost magical search for his lost identity with the help of his friends, Ujjal and Pabitra.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Gunodharer Asukh, produced by Samstab																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

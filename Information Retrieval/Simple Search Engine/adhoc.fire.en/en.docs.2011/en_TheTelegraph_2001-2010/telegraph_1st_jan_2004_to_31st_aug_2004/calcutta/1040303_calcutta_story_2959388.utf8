 															- Child support group reopens case of lock-up brutality after cries of cop cover-up BAPPA MAJUMDAR			A brutal case of torture in lock-up, involving a 13-year-old boy, has been reopened by the state human rights commission and accusations of a police cover-up hang over the withdrawal of the complaint a few months ago.																								Salauddin Sheikh, a student of Class VIII at Mohanpur High Madarsa, on the southern fringes of the city, allegedly had a brick tied to his genitals during his four days in custody at Mograhat police station, after being picked up by police in search of his older brother. The case had then come before the human rights commission, but after an initial investigation, it was closed. The family had withdrawn its complaint, apparently, under pressure from the police.																								Now, a child rights group has lodged another complaint of gross human rights violation, forcing the commission to reopen the case and call for a fresh investigation.																								The case dates back to October 16, 2003, when police picked up the boy, having failed to find his brother Noor Nabi. My brother is not home. Please come back later, Salauddin had pleaded. But police refused to listen and took him to the thana instead, allegedly threatening to kill him if his brother did not surface.																								For the next four days, Salauddin languished in lock-up. As the hunt for Nabi continued, Salauddin was verbally and physically abused, before he was stripped and a brick tied to his genitals, said Swapan Mukherjee, chairman of Free the Children (FTC)-India, the organisation now fighting the case.																								On October 19, Salauddin was produced in court and granted bail. He was taken to hospital, where his injuries were confirmed. Father Sabur Ali moved the human rights commission in the hope of getting justice, but soon withdrew the complaint, leaving the commission with no option but to close the case. FTC-India then stepped in. 																								The boy and his father confessed they had been told by police to withdraw the case or face serious consequences, explained Mukherjee. FTC-India wrote to the commission to reopen the case on a number of grounds (see box). Its been months, but the boy still feels pain in his lower abdomen and genitals, it added.																								The case came up for hearing on February 19, 2004. A member of the commission confirmed a second inquiry was underway. There are sufficient grounds for fresh investigation, the member said. Tamal Das, officer in-charge, Mograhat police station, said he would provide all information regarding the case.

Picture by Pradip Sanyal 																								Fourteen-year-old Nairwita Bose just could not stop staring at her on-screen role model, Pammi of Des Mein Niklla Hoga Chand fame, who walked up the red carpet her parents had rolled out in front of their Behala home on Saturday afternoon.																								Pammi sat beside me and chatted with my mother. She also accepted a stuffed toy that I had made especially for her. It was like a dream come true, gushed the Class X student, in a daze long after the small screen star had come and gone.																								The Boses were just one of about 50-odd families across the city that sailed through the Aapke Star Aapke Ghar contest and waited with bated breath for some special guests to turn up at their doorsteps. 																								As part of the contest finale, a bevy of seven actors who shot to stardom with their Star Plus serials, split up in groups of two and breezed through the homes of the winners. 																								The contest, from Monday to Thursday, featured questions related to the stars and their serials carried in Anandabazar Patrika. Viewers had to send in their answers to the Star TV office, call Red FM or SMS to 7827.																								The team of seven celebs comprised Sangita Ghosh (Pammi from Des Mein), Grusha Kapoor, Pallavi Kulkarni and Manoj Joshi (Lalita, Karishma and Mayorsaab from Kehta Hai Dil), and Kiran Kumar, Sai Deodhar and Shakti Singh (Sooraj Singh, Monika and Vikram from Saara Akaash).																								The Aapke Star Aapke Ghar contest  conceived by Star to reach out to its viewers and held before in Delhi, Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Pune  had drawn 8,000 entries, a tremendous response, bigger than anywhere else, according to creative director, Star, Shailaja Kejriwal. 																								The objective to host it on a larger scale in Calcutta was because we had received such a huge feedback from the city. In fact people from here keep writing to us, suggesting twists and turns that could make the serials more exciting, revealed Kejriwal.																								While Sanjeevani turned out to be the hot favourite among Calcutta viewers, walking away with the largest share of votes, Kumkum came a close second.																								The channel is planning to launch a behind-the-scene show on TV celebrities, which would take a peek into the lives of small-screen icons. For example, a lot of people are interested in knowing what Tulsi of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi does at home, or how she lives, explained Kejriwal.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

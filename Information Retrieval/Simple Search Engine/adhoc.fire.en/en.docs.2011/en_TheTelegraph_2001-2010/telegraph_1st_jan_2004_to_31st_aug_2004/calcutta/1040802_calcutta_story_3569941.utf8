 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Plan sanction delay bleeds civic coffers
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								As a fallout of the undue delay by the building department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in sanctioning plans, the civic bodys revenue earnings over the past six months have dropped Rs 20 crore.																								A preliminary investigation on this count by the civic authorities, following allegations by CPM leader of the Opposition Nirmal Mukherjee, exposed a racket in the department in extorting money by sitting on files of commercial buildings and other large-scale construction projects.																								Files on building approvals do not move despite clearance from the municipal building committee unless we pay up, said a licensed building surveyor (LBS).																								Over 200 such big construction proposals are yet to reach the mayor from mayor-in-council member (building) Swapan Samaddar for ratification in the mayor-in-council meeting, though they had been cleared by the building committee months ago. 																								Soon after CPM leader Mukherjee made this allegation, about 150 files were sent to the mayor the next day. Though director-general (building) Ashok Roychowdhury and the building council did not take much time to process the file, mayoral council member Samaddar took a month or two just to send the file to the mayor.																								In the case of 6, Alipore Park Place, the building committee cleared it on June 30, 2004, and though the construction proposal reached member (building) from the municipal commissioner on the same day, he took 26 days to send the file to the mayor.																								In the case of 1B, Hazra Bagan Lane, even after the file was cleared and sent by the municipal commissioner to the member (building) on June 4, 2004, Samaddar took a month and 20 days to send the file to the mayor. 																								According to the CMCs deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh, Section 391 does not confer any right on the member (building) to do anything with a construction proposal approved by the building committee. However, the mayor-in-council as a body has the right to ratify or reconsider a proposal approved by it, he said.																								No construction proposal already cleared by the council is lying with me, said Samaddar He pointed out that the member, mayor-in-council (building), had been empowered by the CMC Act 1980 to sign the file cleared by the council before sending it to the mayor for its ratification.																								During the former Left Front regime in the CMC, the member (building) used to check the files cleared by the committee but did not sit over them, said a senior engineer in the building department.																								However, as the allegations made by leader of the Opposition Mukherjee held water, mayor Subrata Mukherjee directed municipal commissioner Debasis Som to conduct a probe into the issue and bust the racket. 																								The municipal building committee is an expert body constituted under the CMC Act of 1980 to scrutinise the construction proposals for all large buildings covering an area of over 500 square metres or more, and where there is proposal for relaxation from existing building rules. 																								The committee consists of representatives from Calcutta Police (traffic), the West Bengal fire services, CMDA, CIT and the the CMC. Meetings take place once a month and up to 30 big construction proposals are considered in a meeting. 																								Mayoral council meetings, too, are held once a month. But the dates of the two meetings do not tally. So, if a file is held up, a project is delayed for anything between two and three months.

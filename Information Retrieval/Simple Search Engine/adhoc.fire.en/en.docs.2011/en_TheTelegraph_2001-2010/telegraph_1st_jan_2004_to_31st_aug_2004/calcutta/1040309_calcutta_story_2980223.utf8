 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Test beam accord turns axe on Sony
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE Sourav Ganguly (top) and Jassi: Numbers game 																								Those calling the shots at Ten Sports  the channel exclusively beaming the India-Pakistan series  and at multi-system operator (MSO) offices have finally managed to resolve the row over fresh agreements and ensure peace of mind for consumers. But in the process, a section of operators has lost its.																								Tens call for a greater declaration of subscriber base, in the run-up to the series, has hit a section of operators where it hurts. With average declaration in the CMDA area hovering around 25 to 30 per cent, an attempt was being made to turn the heat on other non-sports channels.																								In a letter sent to MSOs over the past week, members of Cable Sangram Committee (CSC)  which claims support from a majority of city cable operators  warned that due to the subscriber base hike by Ten, payment would not be made for the Sony package of channels from March.																								The logic behind targeting Sony was apparently the fact that popularity of the Sony channels  even post-Jassi  is comparatively less than the STAR and Zee packages.																								The move was also to work around directives issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), stating that cable operators must lower subscription rates if they reduce the number of channels after December 26, 2003.																								City MSOs, however, have come down heavily on this announcement. A spokesperson for RPG Netcom, the citys largest MSO and Sonys city distributor, said: In response to the letter, we asked the CSC that if they dont show the Sony package, would they settle for less from consumers? Also, if they continue showing the package and dont pay, how is the MSO supposed to pay the broadcaster? We have not received any reply from them on either.																								As Sony distributor, RPG Netcom also asked other MSOs whether they agreed to the proposal. All three MSOs confirmed that there is no possibility of jeopardising the Sony channels in any way, the spokesperson pointed out. Copies of the letters were sent to TRAI, he added.																								There is no issue among our operators on this and no question of not paying for the Sony channels, said Suresh Sethia, a joint venture partner of SitiCable. Most operators have also distanced themselves from CSC on the issue. Its an illogical demand from a body which claims to represent operators, but which, in reality, hardly reflects the concerns of the cable industry, said a senior cable operator of north Calcutta.

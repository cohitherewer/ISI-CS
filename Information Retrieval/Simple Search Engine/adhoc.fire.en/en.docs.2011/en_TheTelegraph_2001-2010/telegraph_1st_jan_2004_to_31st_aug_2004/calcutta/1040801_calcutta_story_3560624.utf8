ClubSandwichAn avenue and a venue to teach sports to the middle-class and a home away from home for its members and family. Thats how Dakshin Kalikata Sansad (DKS) would like to come across.This was exactly what visionaries like J.C. Das, Harshonath Mukherjee, Khitish Dasgupta and Narayan Sen had in mind when they founded the institution that took its first tentative steps in 1928 as The South Calcutta Club.From the modest beginning when cricket and soccer were played on the Deshapriya Park pitch and the club had three tennis clay courts on campus, it has come a long way. Our core competence has always been sports and down the years we have tried to promote different sporting activities in the right spirit while including social and cultural activities to make it a place worthwhile to visit, says Hironmoy Sona Chatterjee, honorary secretary of the club.Chatterjee was part of the new blood injected into the committee in the 70s to steady the ship when DKS was struggling for paucity of funds. Our point of action was to host a major tennis tournament every year to tide over the financial crisis, he recalls. Thus, DKS revived the Bengal state tennis championship after a 12-year hiatus in 1976, followed by the East India championship.There was no looking back after these effective approach shots. Spectacular winners followed in the shape of the Sarda Plywood Masters and the Satellite Masters. The clubs financial condition improved significantly and the DKS brass deemed it fit to raise the bar further by bringing international junior tennis to town.We were the pioneers in holding the ITF Juniors in India. Besides helping promote the game, it offered an opportunity to our youngsters to compete with world-ranked juniors in their backyard, stresses the secretary. For more than a decade now, Deshapriya Park is a permanent stop on the ITF Juniors calendar.Now, the club is affiliated to state parent bodies in all the four disciplines it offers  tennis, cricket, table tennis and football. More than 500 students avail of the structured coaching programmes in tennis, cricket and TT, which cater not only to members and family, but to anyone who meets the criteria. In tennis, children in various age groups (5-7, 7-10 and till 16) are groomed academy-style with customised programmes at advanced levels.Recognising the need to evolve and upgrade according to present-day demands, DKS is readying a new Rs 64-lakh swimming pool complex for a year-end rollout. Besides the pool and the water-treatment plant, the modern complex will boast a state-of-the-art multi-gym, a table tennis hall, a lounge and five players dressing rooms  three dry and two wet.From Nachhu Mukherjee and J.M. Banerjee to Poulomi Ghatak and Nupur Santra in table tennis; Nirmal Chatterjee to Deb Mukherjee in cricket; Sourav Panja to Ragini Vimal in tennis. The clubs commitment to sports is manifest in the conveyor belt of champions it rolls out.SUBHRO SAHA

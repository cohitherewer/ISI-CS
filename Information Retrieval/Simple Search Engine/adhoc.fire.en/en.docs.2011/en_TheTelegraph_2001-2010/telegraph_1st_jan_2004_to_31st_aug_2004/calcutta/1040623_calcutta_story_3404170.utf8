 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Builder howl at stiff tender
 SUBHRO SAHA																								Fearing a monopolistic situation that would shut out most local builders from a plum Rajarhat development, the city developers forum has petitioned the chief minister to water down stringent and restrictive stipulations in a tender for sale of bulk land, floated earlier this month.																								In a letter to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, with a copy to state housing minister Gautam Deb, CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India)-Bengal has appealed for a level playing field to enable local builders show their credentials and skills.																								The tender notice by West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) invited expression of Interest from reputed builders for sale of bulk land (150 acres) at New Town, Rajarhat, for a mixed-use commercial development, including IT, office space and tourism-related activities.																								The tender allows only two partners to bid, with a combined net worth of Rs 100 crore and an annual turnover of Rs 200 crore. 																								While city developers find these riders stifling, the major restrictive clause which has raised hackles is that the bidder must have developed at least three million sq ft and a 100-acre project in the past five years in Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore or Hyderabad.																								The conditions of the advertisement are very stringent and restrictive. We request that these be made more flexible to permit more applicants to qualify, so that the government gets the best price, as well as fresh ideas, for implementation of such a dynamic project, CREDAI-Bengal president Jugal Khetawat writes in the letter to the chief minister.																								The forum feels the stipulation in the tender would not only exclude all the builders of the city from bidding, even if they want to do so collectively, but also most of the national builders and their consortiums. 																								Most of the 3,000-odd builders from all over India, who are part of our apex organisation, would be excluded even collectively, barring one or two, laments Santosh Rungta, vice-president of CREDAI.																								The state government proclaims it will import expertise only in areas where local inputs are wanting. But while Calcutta developers are perfectly capable of taking up any project, the needlessly restrictive clauses in the Rajarhat bid notice rule out all local players, Rungta adds. 																								The forum has also sought a role in policy decisions. We are willing to extend all our resources at the local and national level for implementation of such projects, says CREDAI-Bengal secretary Pradip Chopra.

The reservation counters in the western hall at the Fairlie Place office will be operated in two shifts from 8 am to 8 pm during the period instead of the existing one shift of 10 am to 5 pm. In addition, the credit card counters now in operation in New Koilaghat reservation office will be shifted to counter number 1 at Fairlie Place for functioning during the period.

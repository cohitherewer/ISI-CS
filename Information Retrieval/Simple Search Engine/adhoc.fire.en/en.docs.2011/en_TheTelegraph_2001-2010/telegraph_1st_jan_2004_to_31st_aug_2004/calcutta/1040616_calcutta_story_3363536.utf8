 Fantasy World at Howrah, to open shortly. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Howrah may not be everyones idea of a fantasy world, but thats precisely what a hotspot on that side of the river hopes to be.																								A water theme park called Fantasy World is waiting to be unveiled this week, bang opposite the Alampur CTC bus stop, 10 minutes along the Kona Expressway from Vidyasagar Setu.																								In the first phase, the four-acre park would offer some hi-tech rides in a verdant setting dotted with pools, play area, eatery and shack-like wooden seating arrangements.																								There arent too many options for the residents of Howrah to chill out on weekends and other holidays. So, a haunt like this offering daylong fun for the entire family is bound to be a big hit, says proprietor Naba Jati.																								The main attraction for the 3.5 crore project, built in technical collaboration with Chennai-based Domini FRP Pvt Ltd, is the six-loop ride that sends you hurtling down a splash pool from a full 42 feet up.																								In the ride named Water Cyclone, there are four closed circular loops and two open-air semi-circular loops through which one slides down rubber mats for a thrill spill.																								There are two smaller versions of the Water Cyclone nearby for kids, with only open-air semi-circular loops.																								The good thing about Fantasy World is that it thinks big about little ones  be it a small kiddie pool, numerous slides, swings and see-saws or an artificial wave pool to generate crests six feet high on a watery day.																								A rooftop restaurant serving Indian food with an emphasis on items from the tandoor to start with, will take care of growling tummies after all that gambolling.																								The park complex also boasts two water filtration plants that are supposed to take care of the chlorine and oxygen content regulation apart from regular water purification.																								The second phase will see numerous additions to the revelry repertoire depending on the popularity of the park.																								For an entry fee of Rs 100 per head on weekdays and Rs 150 on weekends and calendar holidays, including unlimited access to all the rides, its not a bad deal, says project manager Amitabha Mukherjee.																								The location will be a huge help as its just 10 minutes from Vidyasagar Setu In fact, with the new NH6 coming up, Ballygunge will be just 25 minutes away from here, adds Mukherjee.																								If the city and the suburbia do catch on, the next leg of Fantasy World will see a shopping complex selling everything from toys to clothes, beauty parlour to gym with sauna bath and more.																								More recent plans include regular events and a couple of dolphins to nosedive with in the winter months.																								And you thought it was only the monsoons that make a splash.

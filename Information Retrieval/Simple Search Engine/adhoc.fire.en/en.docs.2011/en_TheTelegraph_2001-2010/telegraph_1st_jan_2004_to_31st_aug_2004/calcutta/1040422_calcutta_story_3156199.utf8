 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Law scores over sentiment
 															- Teenager in tears refused stay with NGO, sent to Liluah home OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The fast-track Bankshal court on Wednesday witnessed a curious tug-of-war between the letter and the spirit of the law. Hanging in the balance was the immediate future of a hapless 16-year-old girl.																								The judge finally chose law over sentiment and sent the teenager in tears back to the Liluah Home for Destitute Women, instead of the non-government organisation (NGO) that had given her refuge for the past three months.																								Payels tragedy can be traced back to when both her parents died young. She was being looked after by her maternal aunt in the Kantakhal area of Barrackpore, till her cousin, Deepali, did a diabolical deed last year. She took advantage of the pretty girls innocence and sold her to a madam at Sonagachhi for Rs 5,000.																								Deepali was an occasional sex-worker, something her mother was unaware of. She handed Payel over to Bhanu Khan, who ran a brothel in Sonagachhi.																								Payel was initially pampered with good food and good clothes. But one day this January, Bhanu asked Payel to entertain a customer. When the girl refused, she was mercilessly thrashed.																								Soon, personnel from the immoral traffic section of Burtola police station learnt about the teenager while conducting routine raids in the red-light area. They rescued Payel and would have sent her to the Liluah home had not volunteers of Sanlaap, an NGO working for trafficked girls, been present there.																								Police lodged an FIR against Bhanu, Deepali and an associate called Nilima. Bhanu and Nilima were arrested on January 17, and Payel was handed over to the Sanlaap volunteers. Deepali is still absconding.																								Payel was brought to court the next day and judge Chandrakala Mukherjee directed that she be sent to the Liluah home. But this order was not executed. Bhanu was, meanwhile, denied bail by high court.																								On Wednesday, the case came up for hearing before the fast-track court. Ashok Mukherjee and Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, counsels for Bhanu, argued that as members of Sanlaap were prime witness to the case, they had no right to keep Payel in their custody.																								Even though the girl repeatedly asked the court to allow her to stay on with the NGO, the judge admitted the plea of Bhanus counsel and asked police to send Payel to the Liluah home.

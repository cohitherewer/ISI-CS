 Tuesday, April 06, 2004  Hic, hic, hurray! SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND SOMA BANERJEE
Pictures by Rashbehari Das  A fire juggler at the Goan Carnival at The Kenilworth															A big bash was held at The Big Ben on Friday night, to break some good news to its regulars. The British-style pub at The Kenilworth started the new financial year by slashing bar rates of imported liquor to almost half of the existing prices, with a host of new munchies to go along with it.																					A peep into the new liquor menu showed that, for example, a Johnny Walker Black Label would now cost Rs 245 for 30 ml instead of Rs 425. A pint of Heineken Beer comes for Rs 145, not Rs 300. The going rate for a single malt whiskey is Rs 245, brought down from Rs 450.																					And to kick off the revelries this weekend, Bangladeshi pop sensation Laila was in the house. Saucily clad in black top, denim skirt, fish net stockings and knee-length boots, the 18-year-old had the crowd grooving in no time as she belted out a string of chart-toppers. In a spirited performance, she mixed pop picks like Baby Boy by Beyonce Knowles, Lady Marmalade by Christina Aguilera and Pink, Kiss Kiss by Holly Valance with classics such as Whitney Houstons Saving All My Love For You.																					eting the package are newly-introduced snacks like Chatpata Corn and Mushroom Vol-au-Vent, Saunfiani Paneer Tikka Shaslik with mint chutney, Olive Stuffed Meatballs with Hot Garlic Sauce and Prawns on Horseback with Yoghurt and Mayonnaise Dip.																																													Goan gala																					More fun was to be had at the same venue last weekend, in true Goan style. Though the sand  surf may be miles away, theres a party going on right in the heart of the city. Viva-la-Goa is the name of the game at The Lawns at The Kenilworth. The carnival kicked off on Friday with live music and scary stunts spiced up with a taste of Goan cuisine and some spirited Feni doing the rounds.																					The 10-day festival, continuing till April 11 includes pop act The Wizards in action every evening, coupled with Goan and Portuguese dance, fire juggling, tattoo and face painting. While The Wizards are into easy listening, mainly pop, hip-hop and reggae, the action hots up with the fire-and-limbo dance. The traditional Portuguese-Goan fire jugglers perform to trance beats. Dhekni (welcome dance), Kunbi (harvest dance), Kotifugdi (coconut shell dance) and Corredinho (Portuguese folk dance) are other attractions.																					A tattoo and face painter is busy adding colour to the proceedings (albeit with poster colours) even if the attempt at recreating a traditional Goan village with innocuous thermocol cut-outs of palm groves, straw huts, waves and fish is somewhat uninspiring. 																					The food is at its spicy and tangy best. The emphasis is on spices and gravies in Goan cuisine, especially Kashmiri chillies. We use a lot of tamarind and coconut as well, explains chef Rosario Fernandes. We have stuck to locally-grown vegetables and good pork and sea food, he adds. The buffet comes for Rs 349.

Organised by Spandan in association with the hotel, artists came together on a shared platform, giving birth to a charity collection.																					The evening saw patrons like Afroze Randeron, Pramod Saraf, Anjali Burman and socialites like Rita Bhimani, Ravi Kumar and Dolly Roy rub shoulders with the artists  all for a good cause. The proceeds are to go to Anubhav, a social welfare project planning an old-age home.																					 Sen, the muscle behind Anubhav, picked up a painting auctioned by Kishore Bhimani. The bids steadily climbed from Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000, 10,000, 11,000, 18,000 before stopping at Rs 25,000. A total of 13 of the 38 paintings, created by participating artists including Partho Bhattacharjee, Ashoke Mullick, Sanatan Dinda, Samir Paul, Gauranga Beshai, Pintu Paul, Avijit Dutta and Sukanto Das, were sold on Friday. 																					Samir Pauls acrylic on canvas saw many buyers, as did the works of Sanatan Dinda and Partho Bhattacharjee. While drinks flowed and snacks did the rounds, the artists lent their signature strokes to a blind canvas.

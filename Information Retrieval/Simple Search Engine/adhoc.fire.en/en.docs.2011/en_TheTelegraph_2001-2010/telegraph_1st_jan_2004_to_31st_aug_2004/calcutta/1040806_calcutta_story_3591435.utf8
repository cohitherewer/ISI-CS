The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 06, 2004 Fun feast on campus
They are more popularly known as places to stop for a light bite when hunger strikes and the pocket is almost empty. But most students spend oodles of free time in college canteens, catching up on campus gossip or just hanging out with friends. Young Metro takes you on a tour of some well-known destinations. More next week. Food amp; Friendship: Students in the Bhawanipur College canteen Chew on Chess: At Presidency College.

	Cricket crazyBeing an enthusiastic Team India supporter, it was heart-rending to digest Indias loss in the Asia Cup final. We once again squandered a golden opportunity, chasing a paltry target of 229. Except Sachin, everybody lacked intensity. Most players dance to the tune of advertisers. They are becoming complacent and lackadaisical about cricket. Competing against Australia and Pakistan in the Netherlands will not be a walk in the park for India. Thereafter, India playing an upbeat England in their own backyard, followed by the Champions Trophy could prove to be the toughest season under Souravs captaincy. But I am confident of a complete turnaround by the men in blue, sooner rather than later.Pratyay Banerjee,
Tollygunge Smoking sinMost of Calcuttas teenagers live in confusion lane when it comes to differentiating between the good and evil of adolescent activities. One of the most common bad habits is smoking. The effort of the Bhagirathi Neotia Centre, through the programme Hridayshaan, is commendable, to create awareness among young people of the ills of smoking. Initially, we had to fill up questionnaires to create an up to date record of smokers and non-smokers among schoolchildren. It also gave a clue as to how many students wish to take tobacco in some form. I think it was thoughtful of the government and the Bhagirathi Neotia Centre for collaborating to create this awareness among students. I hope that students, especially boys, realise that one doesnt have to smoke to be macho.Tanmoy Das Lala,
St Xaviers Collegiate SchoolDeath penaltyAfter months of waiting, Dhananjoy Chatterjees verdict was handed down by the President. And once again, the controversy has begun. Capital punishment erases the chance of reformation, but considering the nature of the crime, hanging was possibly the best decision. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam must have thought of the consequences. But will the growing crimes against women vanish from our society? The answer is no. From childhood, a boy should be taught to respect a girl and vice versa. I think all schools should become co-educational. This will provide a platform for social integration. If Dhananjoy is hanged, we should stand by his poor parents in their hour of sorrow. Subhajoy Roy,
Mitra InstitutionDogs lifeWe see them on every street corner, but their plight pricks our conscience only for a moment. Stray dogs in Calcutta lead a life of misery. There are about 10 puppies in my area, who cannot walk without limping. People tell me the CMC, during its drive to neuter the dogs, had carelessly injected them in the backbone. They are now handicapped. We have all been witness to incidents of rash driving which has left a stray dog or cat crushed in its wake. Next time you see a suffering or injured dog, do your bit. Call Compassionate Crusaders Trust (24647030) or PETVETS (24831608).Madhumita DasIf theres something on your mind, drop Young Metro a line and share your thoughts (youngmetroabpmail.com). Went to class five minutes late and had to face a verbal bashing from Chatterjee maam. Couldnt sleep last night after losing to Pakistan. What a miserable game! What a terrible score! We lost as usual, just when it counts. A special Team India knack. Was it fixed? Ask Toss ka Boss. We won! We are so in the game. I forgive them for their failure on Sunday. Now it gets interesting. The Asia Cup is still worth watching...Kitna saal ka hai? Wont ever forget that. Went to see Julie, but was not allowed in. Mortifying experience, when the durwan announced I was not old enough. Watched Spider-Man 2 instead. Action was phata phati, but went Bollywood-style at the end. The bad guy dying is fine  its a comic book story after all. But MJ running in her wedding dress with a halo behind her was too much.  And so we lost, again. A terrible performance, again. Was too depressed to watch the presentation, again. Sachin did what he had to, but what about the rest? The team isnt that bad. So what happened?

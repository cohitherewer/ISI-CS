 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Arrest no balm for Rajarhat realtors
 JULIUS GOMES																								Realtors in Rajarhat are scared. 																								Thursday nights arrest of Nirupam Saha, alias Kala, one of the three criminals who shot and killed Pradip Roy last Saturday, has not allayed their fears. 																								Saha is allegedly close to Bhupati Sengupta, vice-chairman of the CPM-run Rajarhat-Golabari Municipality. He was rounded up from the Shastribagan area of Rajarhat.																								Sengupta, however, denied having any links with Saha. He lived in my locality and that was how I knew him, he said.																								Saha ran a dubious cable-connection business from the Joramandir area of Baguiati. He has a criminal record, said sub- divisional police officer (Barasat) Kanad Mukherjee.																								The murder last Saturday of the 42-year-old Baguiati-based promoter at his home-cum-office, a stones throw from the local CPM office, had sent shock waves through the areas realtor community. Members complain that extortion is growing in strength and sway because of political links.																								There are some leaders of the ruling party who must be appeased to get our plans sanctioned, disclosed Ram Chatterjee, a Narayantala-based realtor.																								Often, the suppliers of building materials, mostly locals, offer us their stock. There are frequent fights, since there are so many of them and comparatively fewer jobs, Chatterjee added. The conflict in Baguiati is between supplier and developer. 																								There are big bucks floating, since the demand for space has hit the roof. Around 6,000 buildings have been erected in the past three years in Rajarhat, with 1,919 plans submitted during the past year alone. Of these, about 1,700 were okayed, including 185 multi-storeyed buildings (with more than four floors).																								The extortionists, drawn by the big money, capitalise on the situation. There have been instances when they got aggressive over refusals to pay up.																								A trader was shot dead in his Hatiara office, a few kilometres from Roys residence, in February. Extortionists walked into his office one evening to collect the money, but shot him when he declined to pay. Earlier, in 2003, the homes of a few defiant promoters in Shastribagan were pounded by bombs. No arrests were made, in spite of cases being lodged at the local police outpost.																								Debashis Nath, circle inspector, Baguiati investigation centre, was quick to shrug off blame. There are too few policemen to tackle the problem. The Rajarhat-Gopalpur area has a population of 2.5 lakh, with only 22 policemen in one outpost, he said.																								Amal Guha, former chairman of the CPM-led Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, admitted that the leader-criminal nexus was behind the spread of extortion. A few comrades want to make a fast buck, he rued.																								Arjunpur-based supplier Rana Bose confirmed that the violence escalated because too many cooks wanted to make the broth. We procure the building materials and approach the local leaders. The leaders arrange a meeting between the developer and us. Often, the meetings turn into arguments. People lose their lives in the fallout, he said.

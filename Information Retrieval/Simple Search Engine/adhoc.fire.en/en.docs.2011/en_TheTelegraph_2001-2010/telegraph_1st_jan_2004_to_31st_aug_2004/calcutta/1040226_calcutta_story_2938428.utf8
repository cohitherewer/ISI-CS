																																																		Members of a local club on Wednesday stumbled upon 63 used bullet heads while cleaning a pond in Bally. Police officers later seized these and informed the army and the state police headquarters about the find. A crowd gathered there and the police had a tough time controlling it. According to the police, the brass bullet heads, two-and-a-half inches in length, were found five feet under the pond bed. It appears that the bullets belonged to the pre-Independence period. However, we are not sure about that and have informed the police and as well as the army headquarters, said district superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya. Local residents alleged that some miscreants might have dumped the bullet heads into the pond. Criminals from Howrah and other parts of the city used this area as a hideout, they said.

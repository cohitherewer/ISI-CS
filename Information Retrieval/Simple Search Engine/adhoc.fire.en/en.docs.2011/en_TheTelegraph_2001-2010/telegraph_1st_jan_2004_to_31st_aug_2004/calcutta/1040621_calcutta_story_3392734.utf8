 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Energy scan for suitable candidate
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Conducting a host of screening sessions before recruiting an individual is fine, but have you ever thought of scanning the energy levels before offering the job? 																								Its essential, stresses Pune-based building biologist and bioenergeticist Mayank Barjatya. 																								For him, the mental and physical energy reserves determine an individuals actions and are the most important attributes that drive productivity.																								The 32-year-old architect, who mastered his skills in Vastu before going to France for a degree in bioenergetics, links human behaviour with the external environment and works out corrective methodology to synergise the two systems. 																								He was in town over the weekend for some projects he was reluctant to disclose.																								Be it settling an industrial dispute or increasing efficiency in the workplace, the architecture graduate from Pune University has started receiving calls from the corporate sector, spread out between Nairobi and Nagpur, from Antwerp to Australia.																								In the past five years, I have been involved in around 700 projects. My methodology is simple. I analyse the energy levels of the individual and see whether it matches his environment. In case there are differences, I intervene, explains Barjatya, who runs a bioenergetics clinic in Pune.																								With the help of some scientific tools for energetic diagnosis and treatment, like the Lecher Antennae, Bio-feedback Energy Tester and Cmodermil Energetic Stimulator, Barjatya tries to detect where the problem could lie. He has over 1,200 devices and medicines  all patented by ACMOS, the French institute he is attached with  for the purpose.																								Though the concept of bioenergetics is new in India, its fast getting accepted with people experiencing the benefits from it, says Barjatya, who is consulting for the International Convention Centre thats coming up in Pune. Use of Vastu, which was first invented in ancient India, will also increase in the coming days, he adds.																								The list of clients he flashes has more than a few formidable names including Greaves India Ltd, Rolls-Royce in Singapore, Indofil Chemicals and ARF Foods in Mumbai. According to Barjatya, celebrities, from politicians to film stars, also consult him. 																								Everyone needs peace and we are trying to provide it, signs off the bioenergeticist with a smile.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Tell-all anger against snake and felon
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He chose to call Anita Saha a kalnagini (venomous snake), not kakima (aunt). He held her responsible for the gruesome act that he committed  wiping out six family members, before hanging himself at home on Saturday night.																								What Shibendu Saha left behind was more a letter bomb than a suicide note, that exploded in the face of two family members  uncle Amalendu Saha and aunt Anita  within hours of the tragedy that struck 91/3C, Tollygunge Road, in the darkness of a July night.																								Every second line of the three-page note was steeped in anger and hurt as 33-year-old Shibendu implicated his uncle and aunt, who now find themselves in police custody till July 27.																								Going by the letter, Shibendu wanted the reasons behind the tragedy to reach the President of India, the chairman of the human rights commission, the Calcutta Police commissioner, the income-tax department and the media.																								I have lost everything, right from a small savings certificate of Rs 5,000 to my wifes ornaments, in my endeavour to steer the joint family business back on track and make it profitable. But he (Amalendu) killed all my dreams, Shibendu lamented in his letter.																								Amalendu was arrested after officers of Charu Market police station found a number of Shibendus statements in the letter matching with his statements made in the course of preliminary interrogation.																								Our investigation has revealed that the part of the suicide note we have examined so far is true, said an officer working on the case, adding: The accused (Amalendu) has already admitted to some charges mentioned in the note.																								In the course of investigation, police came to know that Amalendu, co-proprietor in the family business, might have siphoned off funds, even though it was a joint venture with Shibendus father, Nabendu Saha.																								Anita used to live in a small house opposite the Sahas five-storeyed building. After marriage, Amalendu seemed to be more bothered about improving the financial condition of his in-laws, observed an officer.																								For this, he even started diverting funds from his family business to Anitas household, added the officer.																								Shibendus final note said much the same thing. While we are becoming poor, they (Amalendu, his wife and his in-laws) are becoming prosperous by the hour, he alleged.																								Ever since Amalendus father-in-law died a few years ago, he would foot the bills for his jobless brothers-in-law. According to Shibendus note, Amalendu had purchased a plot for Rs 50 lakh in Baruipur with funds from the family business. Amalendu denied this, police said.																								Shibendu went on to accuse his uncle of business misdemeanours: He (Amalendu) used to purchase items in my name for the business. As a result, I had to pay up. But nothing used to be mentioned in the record-book. He would then sell the items and keep the money. He never told me about his shady dealings.

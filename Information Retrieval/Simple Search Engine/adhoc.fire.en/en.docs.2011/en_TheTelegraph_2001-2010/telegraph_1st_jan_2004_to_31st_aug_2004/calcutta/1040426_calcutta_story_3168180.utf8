 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Into a web of dreams
																								When a man becomes an artist he enters into a world that presents him with what is known as artistic licence. It is this freedom that lets him spread his wings and fly into unchartered territory and explore a universe on a different latitude. He goes where his imagination leads him and interprets what he sees in a language that allows for an understanding of the unattainable. The Studio presents an exhibition of artists who have lived in and explored the world of dreams. They have dared to present a transparent illusion through a three dimensional solidity and physical substance, thus transforming the wildest flights of imagination onto a medium that gives it a concrete form. The artists have been assembled from different walks of life but are bonded in their common love for the aesthetics of painting. It is an exhibition that features modern contemporary art as is perceived by those who have spent anxious moments in its creation. Art lovers are invited to explore a private world of paintings and linger in the beauty of ephemeral dreams.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings by The Group																								When: Till April 27; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North gallery

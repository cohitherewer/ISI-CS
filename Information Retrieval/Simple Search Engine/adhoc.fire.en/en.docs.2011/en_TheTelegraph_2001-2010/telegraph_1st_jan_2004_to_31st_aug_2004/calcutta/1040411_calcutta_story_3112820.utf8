 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Fatal leap from bridge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Howrah bridge became the stage for an unusual piece of drama on Saturday morning when an unidentified man, in his mid-thirties, climbed atop one of the pillars of the bridge and jumped off in a bid to end his life.																								He succeeded, not after falling into the river but after landing on a metal surface, which was suspended midway between the river and the bridge.																								At around 8 am, the man climbed atop the pillar and started shouting and gesticulating at the people on the road below to attract their attention. Rush-hour traffic, streaming towards the city from Howrah, almost came to a halt. 																								The momentary hush of disbelief was followed by shouts of pedestrians on the bridge, urging the man to climb down to safety. The man, however, remained perched on top of the bridge for the next five minutes, addressing the crowd that had gathered below. 																								The witnesses say that the man appeared to have been depressed and was suffering from delusions. He had mentioned how he wanted to end his life by jumping into the sacred river, a police officer said.																								Exactly at five minutes past eight (by the clock of a witness), the man leapt off the bridge. He cleared the railings and was hurtling towards the water. But then a dull thud was heard on a metallic surface. 																								Those among the crowd who bent over the railings saw a gruesome scene. A lifeless body was lying on the frame of a trolley that was suspended by cables from the bridge for carrying construction material. The body had hit the metal frame with such force that the limbs were almost severed. 																								Labourers, employed for routine repairs on portions of the bridge, had left the structure there the previous evening.																								Police said the man died on the spot. The body was subsequently sent for autopsy.STAR debate venue																								The debate, organised by STAR News, will be held on Queensway, in front of the north gate of Victoria Memorial, on Sunday, from 8 am. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi of the Congress, Subrata Mukherjee of the Trinamul Congress and Somnath Chatterjee of the CPM will be grilled by an audience limited by the number of seats available on a first-come, first-served basis.

 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Cop hunt for daughter to crack death case
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police are looking for six-year-old Sreya Mitra to crack the unnatural death case of her mother Sharmistha. The 34-year-old housewife was found hanging from the ceiling fan in the bedroom of her house on Upen Banerjee Road, in Behala, on Saturday night.																								Though Sharmisthas husband, Somnath, has been arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by Sharmisthas family, the police are yet to locate Somnaths parents and sister, who are absconding. Sreya is with them.																								Police said Sharmisthas body was discovered by her husband around 10 pm on Saturday, when he returned home after buying some soft drinks. Sharmisthas uncle spoke to Somnath over the phone after the discovery of her body but was not convinced with the explanation. He suspected foul play. Later, he assembled other relatives and went to Behala police station to lodge a complaint against Somnath, his parents and sister. 																								Investigations by the police on Sunday and Monday revealed that Sharmistha was badly treated by Somnath and the couple shared a strained relationship.																								Sharmistha was mentally tortured by her husband. They married for love but she was academically more qualified. Somnath had a habit of coming home drunk, something his wife did not approve of. This would lead to regular quarrels, said Sukhendu Bhattacharya, Somnaths neighbour. 																								Somnath, a real estate developer, lived separately with his wife and daughter, though his parents and sister would drop in regularly at his second-floor flat in a four-storey building.																								Now, we are on a hunt for Sreya, whom Somnaths parents took away with them last Friday. Only she can give us vital clues to the case. We are also waiting for the post-mortem report to help us determine whether it was a case of suicide or murder, said South 24-Parganas deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir.																								Police are also trying to contact other relatives of Sharmistha. Her only brother, Prosenjit Dey, works in Delhi. She had written to him a few days ago, saying she was unhappy and disturbed. Prosenjit left for Calcutta on Saturday, after receiving the letter. But he never got to see his sister alive, lamented Ranen Sen, a family friend.																								According to Somnaths statement, he had gone to buy soft drinks around 9.30 pm on Saturday. He told us he returned 20 minutes later and found the door locked from inside. Breaking in, he saw his wife hanging from the ceiling fan. He called up the police, and then Sharmisthas relatives at Jodhpur Park, said Subhash Sen, officer-in-charge of Behala police station.

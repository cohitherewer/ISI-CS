The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 18, 2004  Calcutta Column

	I had booked a cooking gas cylinder with Banerjee Gas Distributor, at AE market, Salt Lake, on May 18. But I have not received the refill even three weeks after the booking. The distributor blames the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) claiming that he has not received the supply from IOC. I would like to draw IOCs attention to the inordinate delay in the LPG supply which has caused us much inconvenience. Cooking fuel is a basic necessity these days so the company should be prompt in the delivery.

	My telephone has gone out of order since May 13. I have already lodged two complaints with Calcutta Telephones (CalTel). I have also met CalTels sub-divisional engineer of the local area and the divisional engineer (internal) at the CalTel office on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. It has been over a month now and I am still waiting for my phone to be repaired. Will the authorities wake up and restore my connection? 
	Nireekshana Elisha, Middle Road

 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Hospital cluster on a campus
 															- Rs 100-cr project for end-to-end disease THERAPY A STAFF REPORTER																								After creating cutting-edge sub-specialities in urology and raising the kidney-care bar in Calcutta, Wockhardt Hospitals Ltd is set to augment its presence in the city further. The group is finetuning plans to build a cluster of speciality hospitals on the EM Bypass for end-to-end disease management.																								To be set up in collaboration with the Boston-based Harvard Medical International (HMI) as part of the existing strategic alliance, the around Rs 100-crore project will come up on a two-acre campus acquired from the CMDA in front of Manovikas Kendra. The hospitals will be commissioned in January 2006, subject to clearances obtained on time.																								We are looking at a number of specialities, like heart, digestive diseases, womens diseases, bone-and-joint, brain-and-spine, besides, of course, kidney, which is our core competence in Calcutta at the moment, observes Wockhardt general manager Rupali Basu. A Delhi-based market research group, engaged in mapping existing demand in each of these segments, will submit its report by this month-end.																								The report will give us a fair idea of the need for these products, and the size and profile of the patient clientele, says Basu. Once the feedback is in, the plan will be finalised in six months and the project implemented in 14 months, according to the management, which feels that 250 to 300 beds should be the optimum size at the Bypass facility.																								The proposed paperless hospitals will also provide a clutch of e-health services, like virtual family visit (where the patients audio-visual message and doctors reports are put on the website on request from non-resident kin), online settlement of bills and the like.																								Besides, we are focusing a lot on the systems so as to include clinical pathways, which would have in-built alarms and alerts on a host of medical issues, like infection control and disease management, to act as guide to the doctors, adds Basu.																								The management is also keen to increase capacity at Wockhardt Hospital amp; Kidney Institute from 60 to 100 beds, if not at the Rashbehari Avenue address, then on the new campus. 																								The south Calcutta hospital has segregated its essential services into sub-specialities like uro-oncology, female urology, reconstructive urology, laparoscopic urology and male infertility, besides venturing into unrelated kidney transplant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Comics missing at action stations
 															- Distributorship shift dries up supply line, signal of month-end solution SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 The cover of a Spider-Man comic: Two-month lull																								Does Batman find out who Hush really is? Is Superman able to reveal his true identity to his loved ones? Does Spiderman finally strike a balance between the camera and crime-busting? These and other questions have remained unanswered to comics-lovers in Calcutta for the past two months.																								Supply of the Gotham Comics titles on superheroes, spin-offs from popular cartoon shows like Scooby Doo, and the ever-popular MAD magazine has run dry.																								We have changed distributors, which has resulted in delay and unavailability in certain areas, admits Suresh Seetharaman of the Bangalore-based Gotham Comics. But by the month-end, things should be normal again, he assures.																								For the comic addict, that is still a date too far. Ive been without my favourite comics for two months now, says Anand, a 24-year-old who collects almost all the titles priced between Rs 15-25 every month. Specials, priced at Rs 90, are also missing in action.																								Around 20 titles, featuring DC Comics regulars like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Justice League of America and their Marvel counterparts like Spiderman, Hulk, Daredevil and X-Men are swept off the shelves of city bookstores and pavement vendors each month.																								These are products with good potential and we manage decent sales, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword bookstore. At Landmark, the supply of the Gotham titles remains suspended till the distribution deadlock is dealt with. The same story is repeated on the Park Street pavement. I manage to sell almost all the titles that I get within 10 days, rues a vendor rendered comic-less.																								The assurance that the Gotham series will be back soon has not pacified the comics-crazy. Getting the back issues will be a huge problem, points out Reshmi, an 18-year-old superhero freak. A genuine complaint, since vendors and stores return the unsold comics every month before signing on fresh stocks.																								The Gotham baton passes on from Vishal Book Centre to India Book House, which is confident of good sales, given the growing popularity of the product.

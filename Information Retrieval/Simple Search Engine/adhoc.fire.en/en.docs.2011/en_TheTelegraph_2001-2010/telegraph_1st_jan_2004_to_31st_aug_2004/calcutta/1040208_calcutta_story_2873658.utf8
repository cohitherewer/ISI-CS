 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 Rivalry cause of trader murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The motive cloud over the murder of Shambhu Choudhury on Thursday night seems to be clearing. After a day-long probe into the grisly killing of the 25-year-old businessman, police reached the conclusion that it was a pre-planned murder triggered by rivalry  either professional or personal . 																								Investigators on Saturday said that the killing was not aimed at extorting money. Rather, it was the handiwork of professional killers.																								Choudhury was abducted by three unidentified men in front of his Burrabazar office late on Thursday. He was taken to a secluded spot on Canal West Road, less than 150 metres from the Maniktala police station, and shot in the head at the back of his chauffeur-driven Santro. Before leaving the spot in a waiting taxi, the killers even slit his throat.																								The culprits sped off leaving Choudhury to die and the detective department groping for a motive behind the attack. 																								We are sure that the assailants had no intention of snatching or extorting money from Choudhury. The incident was the fallout of a rivalry. Now we are trying to find out of what sort it was  professional or personal, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department. He, however, said that if any sort of business rivalry triggered the incident, the detection of the case would take time.																								Mitra said the family had come to Calcutta from Purnea in Bihar in 1990. They set up a business in spices and milk powder five years ago, he said, adding that Choudhurys driver Ujjwal Halder was being interrogated. As of now, there is no point in disbelieving Halders statements since he is the only witness, Mitra added.																								The investigators, however, found the drivers role a little surprising. The Santro travelled a busy stretch covering seven km and five important intersections from 11.10 pm to 11.30 pm. There were at least seven points where police vehicles were parked. The driver could have easily stopped the car near a police jeep, said an official of the detective department. Mitra said this point was also being probed.																								Mitra, who is in charge of the prove, has formed a team involving officers of four wings of the detective department  homicide, anti-rowdy, motor theft and dacoity  to trace the exact motive and the assassins. Match turns sour: A cricket  match between two neighbouring village teams in Howrah district  on Saturday left two persons seriously injured. An argument  over the match snowballed into a fight, police said.

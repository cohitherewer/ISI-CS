The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Dream dazzle
 Hema Malini at the Tanishq showroom in Kankurgachhi on Wednesday morning. Picture by Amit Datta 																								She has ruled the silver screen for almost two decades and her visit to Calcutta on Wednesday morning proved for sure that Hema Dreamgirl Malini still rules the hearts of cinegoers. She was on a six-hour visit to promote 19 karat=22karat, a nation-wide campaign by jewellery major Tanishq, aimed at educating customers about the purity of gold in ornaments that they buy. 																								In south India, it is a ritual to purify gold that is bought from the goldsmith, but now one can just test the purity of gold by using a machine, said Hema. 																								Looking gorgeous in a red salwar kameez, a pair of brown shades covering her eyes, when she alighted from a white Sonata Gold with her sister-in-law in tow, she stunned even those who were most expecting her. 																								There were no star tantrums here, as the pretty lady played the role of conscious buyer  urging everyone present to check their gold jewellery on the karatmeter. The karatmeter is a machine introduced by Tanishq to help customers to find out if what they have bought from local goldsmiths is actually of the worth they have been charged for. The promotion also allows customers to exchange their 19 karat valuables for 22 karat jewellery till August 8. 																								Chatting up a room full of media people and ardent fans, Hema spoke about everything from her yoga lessons which are a must to her new avatar as Rajya Sabha MP, in which capacity she wants to do things for children and culture.																								If mishti doi is her favourite sweet dish, dance still remains her favourite form of self expression. I am all set to stage my next dance drama project on Yashodhara, she said. 																								After an hour when she was ready to leave the Kankurgachhi store, the pavements were over-flowing with people who by word of mouth had gathered to catch a glimpse of one of Indias most enduringly pretty faces. 																								A rush from the shop door to the car and she zoomed off like a dream that was. 						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Tagore summer tryst with the peers
 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Tagore: Garland of pearls for House of Lords																								Moses Room. House of Lords. June 23. 7 pm sharp. Rabindranath Tagores tryst with the prestigious house of peers, eight decades after he had refused knighthood.																								The House that traces its origins back to the 14th Century, when royal advisers began to divide themselves into commoners and lords, will get a taste of Tagore this summer.																								London-based choreographer Bithika Raha will organise a poetry-reading session on Tagore for a select gathering of 100, on an invitation from Lord Navnit Dholakia, president of the Liberal Democratic Party.																								Back home, news of passages from Rabindranath reaching Moses Room evoked mixed response.																								I am happy, I am proud to know that such an event is taking place, said poet Joy Goswami.																								Writer Debesh Roy swung to the other extreme: Rabindranath is now 143 years old. If the House of Lords or any other House has found time to hear some of his poems recited, its good for them but (I feel) it has nothing to do with Rabindranath.																								In London, meanwhile, the Tagore pieces to be read without the aid of a soundtrack  live music, after all, is not allowed in the House  have not been finalised yet. But the two names tipped to hold the stage for the hour-long programme, titled Garland of Pearls, are Tagore scholar William Radice and former BBC staffer Pervez Alam.																								If Radice makes it, he will select his own poems and read them in Bengali, said Raha on Thursday, in Calcutta to garner funds for a future project.																								Once the evening takes off with a speech by Baron Dholakia of Waltham Brooks, Raha will take the podium for a talk on Nrityakala, the dance school and cultural institute she founded in London, in 1986, of which Dholakia is a patron. 																								She will then take the audience on a guided tour of the rich heritage of India, and specifically Bengal.																								The list of 100 invitees to Moses Room comprises members of the House and Rahas acquaintances  a mixed bag of businessmen and artistes. Shekhar Kapur could also be there, added Raha.																								The middle-aged dancer, trained in Manipuri and kathak, has produced an impressive repertoire of dance dramas in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and English for the London audiences. 																								A few years ago, she had roped in Shabana Azmi and Farooq Sheikh to recite Karna Kunti Sambad, an audio version of the Tagore poem, translated into English by Ketaki Kushari Dyson.

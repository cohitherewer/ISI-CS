 Saturday, March 27, 2004 Life - Passing ThroughCzech her out
SANGITA S. GUHA ROY Model watch: Yana Gupta as the brand ambassador of Christian Dior. Picture by Pabitra Das This one is to watch out for, literally. The Czech model-turned-actress Yana Gupta not only sizzles in raunchy item numbers that have become an integral part of Bollywood flicks lately, but is equally at home playing Miss Dior or the high-profile brand ambassador of the international couture brand Christian Dior. Ravishing in a John Galliano outfit shipped in especially from Paris, portraying the same pink and white monogram featured on Dior watch bands, Yana was in town on Friday to launch three premium Dior watches  Christian Diors latest international Spring 2004 range. Not surprisingly, Yana has to love the very girly and fresh look of the watches that combine a pink and white canvas strap with white butterflies on a white metallic body. And one has no choice but to believe that Christian Dior has always been her favourite brand.Music, modelling and travelling are a few of Yanas other favourites. The 22-year-old hazel-eyed beauty was bitten by the travel bug early in life and has been on a roll ever since, traversing continents and cultures. Modelling has been her passport to success for as long as Yana can remember. Endorsing products and fashion glossies, she built quite a reputation for herself in Europe and Japan with clients like Calvin Klein, Victorias Secret, Nivea, Toyota, Honda and Sony to her credit. A spiritual quest and a holiday mood brought her to India about four years back. I came here with the express purpose of holidaying and had no intention of settling here or anything, reminisces Yana. But a combination of culture, cuisine and love held her back. She ended up marrying painter Satya Gupta, whom she just happened to meet by chance over a cup of coffee and was completely enamoured by his magnetic personality.But it was Yanas exotic, good looks that held the modelling and the film fraternity in thrall ever since she set foot in this part of the world. Besides bagging modelling assignments for Lakme, Limca, MTV and PETA, she set all hearts aflutter with the dance number Babuji in the Vivek Oberoi starrer Dum, where she is seen pouring red, red wine over her long, long legs.Call her moves bold or daring, Yana is absolutely comfortable with what shes doing. I like to look sexy in my work but draw a line where it veers towards sleaze, she stresses. So, you have to take her dare-bare sequences in Jalwa 2 remix and singer Shails Tera Chehra in the right spirit even though she dismisses most of the music videos shot today as trying to be sexy but turning out to be really ugly.What Yana does find beautiful though is the laid-back, relaxed attitude of the people here that makes you feel less stressed out than anywhere else in the world. Some of it seems to have brushed off on this leggy beauty, as she declares with a toss of her curly hair, I am just content shooting a few dance numbers and music videos here and there. And will there be a gradual progression towards more acting? May or may not be. I love my freedom and would only put as much on my platter at a time as I feel comfortable chewing on, she shrugs.

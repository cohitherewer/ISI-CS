 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Kingpin was chronic woman-teaser
 															- Station assault leader held with associates, total arrests 18  A STAFF REPORTER																								All the culprits, including the kingpin, of the molestation on the crowded Hridaypur railway station platform fell into the police net on Friday afternoon.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had described the crime as bhoyonkor (horrifying) and pledged to drag out all the culprits, said at Writers Buildings on Friday: We have arrested the kingpin and his associates, who were responsible for the assault on a working woman on the station platform. 																								Officials of Barasat police station rounded up Abir Chatterjee, alias Polu, said to be the kingpin, and three associates  Gopal Saha, Gobindo Roy and Bholey. With these four arrests, the number of detentions stand at 18. 																								During the course of interrogation, police came to know that it was not the first time that Polu had disturbed the peace of the chief ministers oasis. He has a long record of crime. 																								Polu and his associates, most of them drunk, had attacked the 25-year-old woman and molested her on the platform while she was returning home on Monday evening. She was accompanied by a male colleague, which was enough for her to be made the target of lewd remarks first and then for hurt and humiliation.																								Polu, who had dragged the woman by the hair in full public view, was known to terrorise women of his locality. Two-and-a-half-years ago, he was handed over to Barasat police for abducting a woman and attempting to rape her.																								He, along with some others, stormed the womans house around midnight near Apanpalli while her husband was out of town. The woman was taken to a nearby field, said an official of Barasat police station, adding: On hearing the cries, neighbours rushed to the spot. Sensing trouble, Polu and the others started to flee. However, members of resistance group Balak Sangha, who were patrolling the roads, caught up with them.																								A few months ago, Polu had swung into action again. He accosted a couple on Rathtala-Brati Sangha Road late in the night while they were returning home from a soiree. The woman was harassed. When her husband protested and local residents rushed to the spot, Polu and his accomplices sped away, said a resident of Rathtala.																								Apart from these criminal activities, platform no. 1 of Hridaypur railway station was Polus playground. Teasing women in public is his idea of fun. The overbridge on the platform became inaccessible after sunset because of his taunts and the activities of his gang members, the resident continued.																								There is another allegation against Polu  of grabbing railway land. Polu supplies building material and to store his stocks, he took over some land beside the railway tracks. He demolished some shanties and drove out the families from there, complained another resident.																								Police say Polu had played a key role in the platform incident, while his associates either assisted him or kept watch. All 18 will be produced before the two victims  the woman and her colleague  for identification, said an officer of Barasat thana.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Arrested for Rs 1.5-lakh job dupe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The tutor learnt his lesson the hard way on Friday.																								Five years ago, Hrishikesh Bera, 58 and unemployed, passed himself off as a lecturer in English at Calcutta University and promised a woman the post of a French lecturer on the campus.																								When the promise did not materialise, Sangeeta Mukherjee headed straight for Lalbazar. Detective department officials rounded up Bera on Friday from his Rajen Dutta Lane residence, in Muchipara. He had fleeced Sangeeta of Rs 1.5 lakh. Sleuths said Bera had even promised her brother a job in a private firm. 																								Sangeeta, a resident of Chandernagore, in Hooghly district, met Bera in 1999. He told me he was a lecturer, with easy access to top CPM leaders at Alimuddin Street, she told the sleuths.																								Bera managed to hoodwink the woman and extract money from her. She gave him the amount in instalments. And till last month, Bera assured her she would join the university soon, police said.																								Bera, who runs a coaching class at home, has been booked on charges of cheating.

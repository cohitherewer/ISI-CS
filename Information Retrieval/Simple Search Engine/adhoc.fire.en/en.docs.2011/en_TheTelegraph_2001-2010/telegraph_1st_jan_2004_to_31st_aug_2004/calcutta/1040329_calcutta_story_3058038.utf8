Pran Bandhu Nag, spokesperson for the Joint Struggle Forum, said 19 per cent dearness allowance was due to the employees, along with other arrear payments. The forum submitted a deputation to finance minister Asim Dasgupta, listing the demands. The organisation threatened it would strike work if the demands were not met within two weeks. 																																																		One woman was killed after an autorickshaw, carrying five passengers, overturned on DC Dey Road, in Entallys Kapalibagan bustee area, on Sunday. The unidentified victim, about 60 years old, was pronounced dead at NRS Medical College and Hospital. Other passengers sustained minor injuries.

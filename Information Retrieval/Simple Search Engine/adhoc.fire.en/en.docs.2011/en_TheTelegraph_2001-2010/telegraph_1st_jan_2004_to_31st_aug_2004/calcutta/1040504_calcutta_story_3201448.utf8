The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 Action hero turns telly teacher 
(Top) Akshay Kumar promoting his new show (PTI) and, above, Saif Ali Khan (Reuters) 																								 Setting the screen ablaze with a bevy of beauties is fine, but nothing compares with landing the perfect kick-boxes on a bunch of baddies. For martial arts is Akshay Kumars first love. 																								The action hero, who has made a career of bashing up bad guys in Bollywood, will host a seven-part documentary show on martial arts on National Geographic. The series will kick off on May 9, but Akshay is through with shooting for almost five episodes.																								Ill be going through 14 years of my experience, demonstrating the techniques of the forms, and discussing where it all began, says the black-belt in karate who believes he owes a lot to the craft he had learnt and honed to near-perfection in Bangkok.																								The Seven Deadly Arts of Akshay will take the audience on a weekly journey through the basics and beyond with seven martial art forms  taekwondo, aikido, muay thai, kung fu, karate, kickboxing and kalaripayattu (considered the mother of all martial arts).																								Not charging a fee for the show is his simple token of gratitude to the fight-and-fitness form. What I am today is all because of martial arts. I have to use it everyday in my career, says Akshay, who was only too glad to snap it up when National Geographic approached him with the project about four months ago.I also want to break notions that martial arts is only about fighting. One can use it in day-to-day to life. Practising martial arts helps improve your dedication and patience. You become a lot more focused, too. Even a businessman, who apparently may not have any connection with it, can use it in some way. I will show my viewers how, promises the Sabse Bada Khiladi, whose cup brimmeth over with martial moves, and a healthy dose of marital bliss as well.Nick goes desi																								 Kids just wanna have fun, and Nickelodeon India has just the thing to make it happen. The channel is now bringing 12 hours of entertainment in Hindi, to cash in on summer vacations. Roping in actor Saif Ali Khan, known for his funny bone, to add to the frolic, Nickelodeon has also gone trendier by re-christening itself Nick.																								The channel hopes to reach a wider cross-section with a more desi feel  being promoted through the Dekha Kya? Nick Ab Hindi Mein! campaign  and will include Hindi-dubbed programming everyday from 8 am to 8 pm. Nick, popular for shows like Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron, Legends of the Hidden Temple, Rugrats and Kenan amp; Kel  has stepped up its Hindi content on the channel from four hours in 2003 to eight hours in early 2004 to a 12-hour time band now.																								We have launched our first marketing initiative with Saif Ali Khan and plan to do a lot more programming centred around Bollywood, explained Alex Kuruvilla, managing director, MTV Networks India.

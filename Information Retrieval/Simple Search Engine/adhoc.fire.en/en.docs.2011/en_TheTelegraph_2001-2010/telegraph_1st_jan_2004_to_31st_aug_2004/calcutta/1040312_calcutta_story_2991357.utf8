The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Beer price constant in tariff card eyewash
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hoteliers and bar-owners have started changing their rate cards for packaged drinks like beer, mineral water, soda and soft drinks, under pressure from the consumer affairs department.																								On the menu, the price of beer will be mentioned as Rs XX (the maximum retail price printed on the bottle) per glass or per mug, instead of per bottle. This apart, it will be mentioned on the menu card that the cost is inclusive of all taxes and establishment charges. For beer, a consumer will have to order at least two glasses or mugs for the volume of a full bottle.																								Earlier, the legal metrology section of the consumers affairs department had conducted raids on various bars and restaurants in the city and slapped a penalty on 20 owners for faulty peg measures and charging prices of packaged drinks over and above the printed maximum retail price (MRP).																								Officials argued that no trader could charge a single paisa over and above the MRP for any packaged commodity. 																								The Hotel and Restaurant Association of India (HRAI) moved court against the department, saying members had the full right to fix charges for any item. The court rejected the plea and later, the association withdrew the case.																								We decided to alter the rate card to avoid further hassles. The price we have been charging for packaged drinks will remain the same. What we will change is the language. On the bill, we will show the MRP and add the extra amount as establishment charges, said S.K. Khullar of Amber.																								HRAI joint secretary Rajesh Mishra said the stubbornness of the consumer affairs department had only added to hoteliers woes. We cannot understand the benefit in altering the menu card, considering that we will charge the same as earlier for packaged items. The price of a bottle of beer or soda or soft drink will remain the same, Mishra pointed out.																								Controller of legal metrology Ashok Bhattacharya said the department had no control over service charges or establishment costs on any item. 																								We want that the consumer must know what the actual price of the commodity is and how much he is paying by way of service charge. If a consumer is happy paying a service charge of Rs 60 for a bottle of mineral water costing Rs 10, then so be it, he said.																								Bhattacharya said the consumer affairs department had started a discussion with the tourism department to formulate a guideline on imposition of service charges and establishment costs.

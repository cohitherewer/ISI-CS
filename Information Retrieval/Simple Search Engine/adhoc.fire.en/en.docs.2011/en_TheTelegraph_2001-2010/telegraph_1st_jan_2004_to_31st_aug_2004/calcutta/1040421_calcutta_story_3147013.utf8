 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Magic medley in festivals grand revival initiative
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Norah Jones: Keen to come down to Calcutta																								Want to come away with Norah Jones, this November?																								With maybe a John McLaughlin on the guitar for company and a man called A.R. Rahman thrown in, as well.																								A magic medley is ready to unfold over three days of breaking barriers and fusing forms in dance, music and various other genres of performing and visual arts. Shaw Wallace and event managers Showhouse have joined hands to revive the Antiquity Festival of Fine Arts on a grander scale, after a decade-long hiatus.																								John (McLaughlin), who has sweet memories of the city from his Shakti concert here in the 80s, is eager to play before his beloved Calcutta audience again. Along with Zakirbhai (Hussain), we can create some extraordinary music if we can get him and Spanish guitar legend Paco Piano down for the festival, says tabla maestro Ustad Sabir Khan, very much part of the revival initiative.																								Both Khan and Showhouse CEO Omer Haidar confirm discussions with Norah Jones agents and recording label have been progressing along encouraging lines and that the multiple-Grammy-winning soul-jazz artiste is quite keen to perform in the city.																								We want to provide a platform for adaptive creation involving the finest exponents in their callings, blending the classical with the contemporary, that would put Calcutta firmly on the global tourism map, explains Shaw Wallace president A.K.M.A. Shamsuddin.																								So, one can look forward to a scintillating exchange involving L. Subramaniam and Vanessa May; a quicksilver collaboration between Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and Adnan Sami; Birju Maharaj and Bharathi Shivajis troupes matching steps with Mallika Sarabhais contemporary style.																								From Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia to youth icons Amaan and Ayaan Ali Bangash, the show plans to bridge the generation gap with some innovative formats. Innovation will rule the dance stage, too.																								In 1994-95, at Victoria Memorial, we showed how the seven Indian dance forms could be fused and presented as one choreographic piece. This time, the focus will be on group choreography with more experimental and fusion forms, confirms Haidar. So, Thankamani Kutty could be seen in step with Sonal Mansingh or Leela Samson with Madhavi Mudgal.																								We neednt limit our scope to dance and music only. The festival will seek to include visual arts and photography, classic film screenings  anything that showcases Calcuttas artistic heritage, and draws the world to its charms, says Shamsuddin.																								The organisers, who want to involve the state tourism department as well as ITDC with a sizeable international tourist traffic in mind, are setting their sights on Victoria Memorial as venue.																								We can do the show without touching a single stone of the monument as we have done before, promises Haidar. If the green signal is not forthcoming, the festival site will be shifted to some other landmark location in the city.

 Natures ravage: Running up a bill for damages The report The physician fades out (April 5), confronts us with a disappointing trend. What has happened to the friendly local general practitioner who used to treat us during all maladies with compassion, mouthing words of hope and cheer, and became almost a trusted member of the family?  Gone are the days when the general physician was the only hope during emergencies as well as the day-to-day maladies of the non-affluent middle class which could not afford specialists. These doctors cured us of practically half the diseases that we went to them with at nominal fees.  There is no denying the fact that these days the middle class patients have no choice but to consult specialist doctors as well. But they are no replacements for the neighbourhood general practitioners who scored in terms of both affordability and approachability in comparison to their more high-profile colleagues.  We are now forced to cough up exorbitant fees at the altar of the specialists who treat patients with a give-and-take attitude.  Apart from their professional advice, they do not utter a single friendly word to comfort the patient. Nor do they, working with clockwork precision, spare as much time with an individual as the local doctors did. Sunil Banerjee, 
VIP Road.The havoc wreaked by the Norwester on April 7 was nothing short of special effects shown in a horror film (Ill winds blow in death, ruin, April 8). The picture accompanying the report showed a private car damaged by Natures fury. When the affluent were so badly affected, the condition of the pavement-dwellers could only have been worse. We appreciate the governments promptness in despatching relief, but a compensation of Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,000 for fully damaged and partly damaged houses respectively may not have sufficed for many. Mohit Surana, 
Howrah. It was disappointing to find the HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee list the same old lame excuses for the delay in completion of the flyover (Another year gestation for flyover twins, April 10). The time required to get the clearance for traffic diversion and the relocation of public utilities must have been considered while fixing the deadline. Its the contractors, backed by unscrupulous officers, who are responsible for the delay. Sunil Garodia, 
Sushil Sen Road. Apropos the report Freedom crusade for caged, April 5, most of us do not raise our voices against the inhuman practice of keeping animals in cramped cages. Earlier initiatives taken by bird-lovers just faded with time. Let us hope that Suchetanas efforts will yield positive results. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty Road. Several developmental projects have been halted midway through (State opens purse for Chitpore project, April 8). The Chitpore terminal station is just another example. The project is of vital importance to those living in north Calcutta and North 24-Parganas. Kudos for highlighting the case. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum Park The report Flyover down the drain has incorporated certain statements mentioning my name. I protest that the reporter did not talk to me about the information published. S.R. Banerjee,
Vice-chairman, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners Metro replies: This is not only untrue, but extremely surprising. The bulk of the information contained in the story was provided by the HRBC vice-chairman, over the phone, on April 16 and 20. The surprising part is that no part of the information published by us has been denied. So why the fuss? While speaking to Metro, the vice-chairman would certainly have known what he was talking about. The report Fairy tale twist to vat baby life published on April 29 about an abandoned child Golu being brought up in our hospital for the last one year contained an inaccuracy. Matri Mangal Pratisthan is one of the oldest mother and child care hospitals in the city and not a hospital for destitute children as the report has mentioned. Rita Das, 
Administrator, 
Matri Mangal Pratisthan

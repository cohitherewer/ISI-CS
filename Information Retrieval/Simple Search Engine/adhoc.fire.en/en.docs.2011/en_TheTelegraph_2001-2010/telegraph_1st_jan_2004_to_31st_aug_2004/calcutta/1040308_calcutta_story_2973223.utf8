 Chefs Guha (left) and Qureshi with new dishes from the Peerless Inn															The Calcuttans love for food is legendary and Peerless Inn knows it all too well. Constantly looking to reinvent its mouth-watering menu, it has introduced new delicacies in its four restaurants: Aaheli, Bichitra, Nishidin and Lahari. 																					i, the Bengali speciality restaurant is offering dishes typical to the Burdwan district, like Daler Bora and Rokomari Telebhaja, as well as all-time favourites such as Dharosh Posto, Puti Machher Charchari and Bhapa Murgi, to be rounded off with some slurpy Chhanar Jalebi. Bichitra, the multi-cuisine restaurant is bringing alive the different flavours of pulao from various parts of India. One has a tough time choosing from Zafrani Machhi Pulao, Tomato Murg Pulao and Masala Gosht Pulao. For the vegetarians there is the Paneer Hariyali Pulao, Tiranga Pulao and Moti Pulao to choose from.																					Then there is the bakers party at Nishidin, the 24-hour coffeeshop. You can munch on some Chicken and Spinach Patties or Spicy Mutton Puffs as one catches up with friends over a cuppa. For those looking for something more substantial, there is the Curried Fish and Shrimps, while health freaks can take their pick from Baked Paneer Roll and Apple and Grapes Strudel. The best catch, however, seems to be on offer at Lahari, the bar-cum-restaurant. One gets complimentary servings of two non-vegetarian and one vegetarian snack for every pitcher of beer. These include Chilli Garlic Fish, Murg Tawa Tikka, Chilli Potato and the Chef Special Veg snack.																					If you have a tough time choosing between the delicacies, go with Chef Debashis Guhas favourites  Tiranga Pulao (a visual treat created with spinach pure, saffron and beetroot juice), and Apple and Grapes Strudel with vanilla and custard sauce (an Austrian dish). Sreshtha shows off a Kyra outfit 												Bright and beautiful																					Spring is a good time to replenish your wardrobe with bright outfits. Keeping this in mind, Komal Sood has unveiled a new Spring-Summer Collection at Kyra. Komal believes that fashion is an expression of the soul  a blend of personal style and utilitarian comfort. It comes as no surprise then that her clothes are dynamic, vibrant and modern with each garment finely crafted to offset the wearers personality.																					egant, romantic, dashing and funky, the focus of the Bright and White Collection is handloom and natural fabrics. It involves a fusion of colours and showcases printed and embellished cotton lycra T-shirts with surface ornamentation. The look of the season is fine cotton shirts and tunics with embellishments. Trendy denims in jeans and skirts have an international edge to them. The Indo-Western line of tops in lighter shades teamed with bright pants are a good look for the summer. While Kyras Spring-Summer Collection has stunning necklines, the showstopper for the season is the bright and vibrant Paris Line, comprising the Spring-Summer Collection of a number of brands from Europe such as Aunge, Sinnequone, Vinnicci, Kookai, Oxford Street, Kenzo Jeans, Vivian Tam, Miss Sixty and Salad.

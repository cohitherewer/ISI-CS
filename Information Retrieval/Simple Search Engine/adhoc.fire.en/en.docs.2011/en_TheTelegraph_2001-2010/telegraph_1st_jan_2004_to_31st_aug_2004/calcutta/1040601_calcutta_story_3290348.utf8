 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Funds hunt at CMC after foreign pat
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								The Trinamul Congress may have been routed in the Lok Sabha elections, but the Trinamul-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has won accolades from abroad. The board hopes this recognition of its quality-driven services will see it through the next civic polls.																								The roll of honour started with the CMC becoming the first civic body in the country to win the ISO 9001:2000 certification from the International Organisation for Standardisation, Geneva, for matching quality of service rendered with that assured to consumers.																								And now, riding the crest of the recent reforms programme, the CMC is hopeful of bagging more funds from the Department for International Development in the UK, its principal funding agency, which, officials claim, is quite happy with the civic bodys performance.																								It is a matter of pride that our stores department has been adjudged the best. And now, it is time to win back peoples hearts through improved services and more reforms. The ISO certification is a recognition that we maintain international standards, mayor Subrata Mukherjee told Metro.																								The stores department, that won the civic body the prestige, has already drawn up plans to further upgrade itself by: Eliminating obsolete and non-moveable items from its offices. Some of the items have been lying unused for more than a decade. CMC officials said this would result in creating more space, accrual of cash and more compression in the stores ledger Introducing scientific methods of purchasing and minimising inventory holding, thereby optimising on resources Introducing computers and systems in all the stores of the CMC and on-line networking in and around the city Using manuals for stores and purchase to ensure standardisation of inventory and purchase procedure Putting in place a more comprehensive, customer-focussed and documented quality management system Continuing to improve services and operations for the benefit of the public and internal customers of the CMC.																								Saikat Dasgupta, controller of the CMCs central stores and the executor of the reforms programme, believes that employing professional consultants for assessment and necessary reforms at the 22 CMC stores has worked wonders. From sodium vapour lamps for illumination of streets, to pipes for water supply and materials for repairing pavements  all are supplied by the stores. Therefore, our responsibility is the greatest, says Dasgupta. We hope this success story will help us get more funds for our future projects, he added.																								The introduction of modern materials management at the CMC stores is being extended to its garages, said a senior official.

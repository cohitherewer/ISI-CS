The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Spare a day for democracy
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should polling be scheduled only for weekends? More answers will be printed next week Duty-bound: Election officials busy with the electronic voting machineShiv Shanker Almal, 
																		Lower Rawdon Street. 																																																														The day votes are to be cast is usually declared a holiday by the government. Therefore, there is no need to schedule polling for a weekend. The need is to modernise and regularise the election system and make it fault-free. 									

Rohit Kumar Singh, 
																		Rishra, Hooghly																																																														Yes, I think polling should be restricted only to weekends as that will make it easier for the office-goers to exercise their voting rights. Otherwise, they would have to rush from the polling booths to reach office on time. Polling on weekdays will also ensure a good voter turnout at the booths. 									

Mamata Banerjee,
																		Sarsuna																																																														Polling must be scheduled for weekends so that the functioning of offices and other commercial activities are not disturbed. Moreover, if possible, polling should be conducted throughout the country on a single day. Since that may not be implemented under the present circumstances, at least election result forecasts should not be allowed via the exit polls. 									

Rajarshi Ghosh, 
																		Surya Nagar																																																														Definitely. Polling should be scheduled for weekends as on weekdays it affects the day-to-day routine of the people. Many families in our country are dependent on daily wages. Polling on weekdays can rob them of a days meal. 									

Kalyan Ghosh,
																		Park Street																																																														Ideally, polling should always be conducted on weekends. This will make sure that normal activities are not upset by the democratic process. But for a large and diverse country like India, battling various problems like terrorism, it may get difficult to schedule polling days according to the convenience of the different sections of society. But as far as practicable, polling should be on weekends. This way it will not add to the longer than necessary list of holidays. 									

Tapan Pal,
																		Batanagar.																																																														What for? Who wants to spoil a perfect weekend deciding which criminal, debaucher or swindler has what nuisance value? People have better tasks earmarked for weekends, like cleaning the toilet, washing linen or helping out the kids with their homework. Casting a vote is perhaps not more important than these chores.									

T.R. Anand,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														Yes, elections should be held on weekends, preferably on Saturdays, because our economy will incur the least loss if a half-day holiday is declared. Wasting a full working day for the sake of elections is simply a waste. Even Sundays can be utilised in some productive work. Our countrys interest should be kept in mind while deciding on which day polling should be conducted. Too many holidays will weaken our economy. Hope our future political leaders will keep such considerations in mind while scheduling the 2009 elections. In fact, a difference can be made even in the coming Assembly elections.									

Varsha Chabaria,
																		Rabindranagar 																																																														Polling is not a routine affair. Its importance cannot be ignored. But our daily work cannot be neglected either. So, the proposal is welcome. In my opinion, polling can also be scheduled on national holidays. That way, the economy will not have to suffer, and the purpose of polling would also be served. 									

Jayanta Datta, 
																		Chinsurah. 																																																														I approve of the idea. Those who earn daily wages will benefit if it is implemented. It will also save an unwanted holiday for the economy. And offices would not have to deal with lazy employees who dont turn up for work on the pretext of going to vote. 									

Subhobrata Basu, 
																		Ballygunge Station Road																																																														For office-goers, students and daily wage-earners, nothing is more annoying than to have polling scheduled on a weekday. Their daily routine is bound to go haywire because of the election. School/college exams get postponed and taxi and bus drivers are often forced to ply their vehicles on election duty without much income. 									

Sounak Chakraborty
																		Baranagar																																																														Obviously, polling should be held only on weekends. Why should work in both the private and the public sectors be stopped on a weekday adding to the losses in our economy? Since a large section of government officials is allocated election duty, work will be affected in government offices if polling is held on a weekday. Most public vehicles are used for election duty, so those who have to go for work, election or not, will have to suffer for lack of conveyance. 									

Sushma Jalan,
																		Alipore																																																														Such a move would certainly be welcome. A full working day can be saved in this manner. A forced holiday results in a loss of crores for our economy. In previous years, college and professional examinations have had to be postponed as they were clashing with polling dates. Strikes inflict more than enough holidays on the people in our state. So, saving even a single working day would be appreciable.									

Qutbuddin A. Tasira, 
																		Saifee Hall 																																																														Previous elections have shown that voter turnout is not more than 55 to 60 per cent anywhere. So, if we want to encourage those belonging to the high-income group to cast their votes, polling must be scheduled during weekends. 									

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 
																		Arabinda Nagar 																																																														Most of the voters are self-employed or employed in the unorganised sector. Hence, they do not get any leave on polling day. So, holidays should be earmarked for conducting the polls.									

Joydeep Chatterjee, 
																		Shyambazar																																																														No rules can be fixed as to on which day polling should be conducted. But the voter shouldnt be in a hurry when he goes to cast his vote. A relaxed mind, away from office tensions, would help him decide best who to vote for.

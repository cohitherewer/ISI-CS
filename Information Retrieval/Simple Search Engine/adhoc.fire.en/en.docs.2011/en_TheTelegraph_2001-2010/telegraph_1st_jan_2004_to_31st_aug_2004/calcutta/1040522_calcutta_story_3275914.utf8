 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Italy aid team ahead for sewage upgrade
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Italy is very much the flavour of the season, from the Capital to Calcutta.																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is rolling out the red carpet for an 11-member Italian delegation, touching down in town soon, armed with offers of financial and technical aid to develop the civic infrastructure in Calcutta and the suburbs.																								The water supply, sewerage and sanitation system in operation in Italy is one of the best in the world, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya asserted on Friday.																								We want to replicate the same in and outside Calcutta and they (Italy) have expressed their willingness to help us to implement the same, he added.																								The delegation, led by regional minister for Italys Lombardi region, Jiovanni Bordoni, will hold discussions with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, planning and development minister Nirupam Sen, and the state urban development minister, on finalising a plan of action with regard to several projects.																								The delegation will include chief of Milan chamber of commerce Raffeillo Benetti and senior officials from the ministry of international affairs, different chambers of commerce, ministries and financial organisations.																								Italian companies, Bhattacharya said, had agreed to take up a host of civic infrastructure projects in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal. Apart from technical and other assistance, the minister said, they would arrange for funds required for implementation of the project.																								As the population of Calcutta, Howrah and other towns are growing along with the commercial and other activities there, it has become necessary to renovate the system of water supply, sewerage and sanitation, explained the minister.																								A team from Italy, comprising engineers and sanitation experts, had come down a few months ago and conducted a study on the existing civic infrastructure, especially relating to water, sewerage and sanitation in Calcutta, Howrah and four other towns.																								As per the schedule prepared so far, the high-profile team will host a workshop on Monday at a city hotel in the presence of the chief minister, senior bureaucrats, engineers and experts.																								During their 10-days stay, the team will hold an interaction with the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, and visit Howrah, Durgapur, Asansol and Siliguri.																								This is not the first collaborative effort between the Bengal government and Italy, pointed out government officials.																								Dont forget Roopkala Kendra, in Salt Lakes Sector V. The training centre for film production, with a strong focus on social uplift projects, is a successful Indo-Italian venture And with a left-backed government in Delhi, a hitch-free collaboration with the Italian government and industry is all but assured, they added.

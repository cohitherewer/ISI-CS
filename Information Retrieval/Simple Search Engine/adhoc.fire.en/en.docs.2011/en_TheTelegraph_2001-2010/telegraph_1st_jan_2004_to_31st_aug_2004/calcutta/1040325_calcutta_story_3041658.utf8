 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a bid to tackle environment-related issues and organise mass awareness campaigns, the state pollution control board (PCB) has engaged 150 NGOs to work on protecting the environment in and around the city.																								PCB member-secretary S.K. Sarkar said on Wednesday that the NGOs had been selected after a check on their quality, capability and knowledge of pollution. 																								Several NGOs have been in the field for long, but in a disorganised manner. We want to impart a system to their method, Sarkar said.																								The NGOs will work mainly in four sectors: wetlands preservation, auto-emission checks, disposal of hazardous waste and plastic carry-bag phaseout.																								They will implement the PCBs plans and policies and take our message to the people, Sarkar said. The NGOs, with help from local people, will organise awareness campaigns, educate people on the need to save the environment, distribute leaflets and organise seminars and exhibitions, he added. The PCB will provide administrative, technical and other back-up.																								A major chunk of the funds will have to be arranged by the NGOs themselves, either locally or through sponsorship. The PCB will train the NGOs in batches from April. They will work in separate and specified areas.																								The PCBs activities have increased manifold and a number of acts and rules have been framed to protect the environment. It is not possible for a handful of government officials alone to enforce the laws. By drafting the NGOs, we aim at involving the masses in the activities, said member-secretary Sarkar.																								The NGOs will guide the people in obtaining permission for felling of trees and filling up wetlands, in case of any emergency. Also, they can procure a no-objection certificate for construction of a building or a factory. 																								They will also collect opinions and complaints from the people and place it with the PCB for further action. In fact, the NGOs will be the bridge between the Pollution Control Board and the common people, Sarkar signed off.

																								Legwork is bound to score over lip service this weekend if youve let the Olympic fever pump up your adrenaline. If you havent been able to pick up some gymnastics to show off on the dance floor, let your tongue do all the movin and shakin.Shoot amp; shine																								You cant possibly venture out partying this weekend without getting the name of our Olympic silver lining, Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, right. Get your double trap shooting facts right or keep your trap shut. And then zero in on our boy from Beckbagan (Remember, I had told you before the opening ceremony that Leander would do it again). Clearly, feel good is a filthy factor no more.Sex amp; the city																								With men like Avtar Singh around, you will always have enough to spice up a bland party. You can feel sorry for poor Jyotirmoyee (running out of luck and all that) or go into a giggly spiel over the bar named Buddha. Slogan shouting and stone pelting is the mob job; among the party people, an arched eyebrow and a snide remark should suffice. Basic instinct, and all that.

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY				 	 SPRUCEd-up INTERIORS: The CMC headquarters on SN Banerjee Road.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken up a Rs 12-crore project to renovate in phases the interiors of its headquarters on SN Banerjee Road, built almost a century ago. 																								The British governments department for international development (DFID) will fund the renovation. This is the first major revamp for the mammoth building, constructed during the Raj.																								A beehive of civic activities, the building was designed by David Osmond and constructed by Mackintosh Burn for Rs 1.98 lakh. R.T. Grier, then chairman of the Corporation of Calcutta, formally opened it in June 1905. 																								City architects said such a huge structure  on 270,000 sq ft in the prime area of the city  would cost at least Rs 18 crore to build today. However, some of the components, like the wooden staircases and the iron railings, will be difficult to come by, said Anjan Mitra, architect and urban designer. 																								Last month, the civic authorities invited tenders from architects and architecture firms to prepare a scheme for a thorough remodelling of the inner part of the heritage structure. The outer part of the building  where 5,000 employees attend office daily  will, however, be preserved as a heritage structure.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said Rs 5 crore will be spent in the first phase and work will be carried out for nearly a year and a half. The Rs 7-crore second phase will be taken up subsequently and the entire remodelling is expected to take three years. 																								The objective is to give the interiors a modern look and utilise the floor space more effectively, without altering the character of the building or its architecture, explained the mayor.																								Civic officials said the worn-out offices will be refurbished with fresh coats of paint, furniture, lighting and waiting rooms for about 10,000 people who visit the CMC headquarters daily. 																								The DFID is providing about Rs 212.25 crore as grant to the CMC to overhaul the functioning and human resources management of the civic body for enhanced performance and better delivery of services in the next six years. The fund for remodelling the CMC interiors forms part of this grant. 																								It will be remodelled in the style of the old Reserve Bank of India building on Council House Street, that was carried out by the central government, said CMC director-general (civil) Uday Shankar Sengupta.																								The mayors concern at present is the temporary relocation of various departments during the renovation, expected to begin after the Pujas. 																								Officials said the relocation would have to be carried out very carefully, as there are tonnes of documents relating to birth and death certificates, records of historic buildings, records of licences and taxes and valuable maps of the citys underground drainage and sewerage.

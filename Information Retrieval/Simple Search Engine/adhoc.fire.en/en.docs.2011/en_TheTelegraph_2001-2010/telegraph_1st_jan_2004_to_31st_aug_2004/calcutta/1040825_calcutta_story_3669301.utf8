 															- Alliance francaise mulls grand expansion, shift to city heart  SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Mukto, a Franco-Indian jazz group, rehearses for a concert at GD Birla Sabhagar. A Telegraph picture 																								More movies, more jazz, more books and more alliances The French cultural centre in town, the Alliance Francaise de Calcutta, promises to reinvent itself in a bigger and more vibrant avatar soon, drenching the citys arts and culture canvas with a kaleidoscope of colours and ideas.																								A relocation to the heart of the city by the middle of next year is very much on the cards. Our present premises (217, AJC Bose Road) is too cramped for the language students and is hardly suitable to accommodate all our plans. Moving to a downtown address would give us better visibility and help us serve members and students more efficiently, says Alliance Francaise de Calcutta director Nicolas Blasquez.																								According to the partnership agreement between the foreign affairs ministry and the Alliance Francaise of Calcutta, the two parties are to work together to develop and implement a language, cultural and cooperative policy. This entails teaching French as a foreign language, training teachers and expanding teaching options, acting as a resource and documentation centre, organising cultural and artistic events and exploring cooperation endeavours.																								The director, constitutionally responsible for implementation of the agreement, is keen to make Alliance a resonant rendezvous for interchange of ideas and achieve the right connect with Calcutta. Hence, leading French authors like Didier Daenincks, Daniel Pennac and Dominique Fernandez are expected at the Book Fair next year, which will have France as the partner country. Translation sessions from French to Bengali and French to English, besides special sessions by French cartoonists, are also lined up at the citys favourite fair.																								We hope to have significant participation by French jazz musicians at the Congo Square jazzfest (at Dalhousie Institute) this winter, apart from big names like Thierry Gregorire and Geneviege Chanut whore set to perform in the city, adds Emmanuelle De Decker, deputy director, cultural affairs. Noted mixed-media artist Pascal Monteil, working on a book on India, wants to do a special project on Calcutta, says De Decker. With a host of corporate houses showing a keen interest to pick up French, the institute plans to beef up its language courses too.

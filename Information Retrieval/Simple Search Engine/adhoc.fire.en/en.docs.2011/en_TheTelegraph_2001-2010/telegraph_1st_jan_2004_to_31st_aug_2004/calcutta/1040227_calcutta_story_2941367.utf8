 															- TRAFFIC CONSTABLES SMART SALUTE TO REIN-RALLY PRIME MOVER SUNANDO SARKAR AND TAPAS GHOSH 				 	 The constables helmet is perched on a car parked on Old Post Office Street. It rests there all day, until its time for Justice Amitava Lala to leave for home. Picture by Amit Datta																								It could be Calcutta Polices way of saying sorry to Justice Amitava Lala, who failed to bring back a semblance of rally-free order on the citys streets but succeeded in putting the fear of the law in the law-keepers mind.																								Five months after the force did its best to frustrate the judiciarys rein-rally efforts, it is making amends in a curious way.																								A traffic constable  who refused to reveal his name  has been posted on Old Post Office Street. His only assignment appears to be clearing the way for the judge.																								Till a few minutes before Justice Lala emerges out of Calcutta High Court, the constable is the perfect peoples policeman. Taking some khaini from one driver and a piece of buttered toast from another, he watches the world crawl by on the narrow street.																								The helmet is invariably kept on a parked car  on Thursday afternoon, a Fiat (number WB-02/B-0158) was the privileged resting place  as the constable chatted up the drivers.																								But the moment word arrives  via a boy who carries tea into court  that the judge has started his climb down the stairs, the constable is a changed man.																								He dons his helmet, whips out his whistle and summons the world to order. He runs up the street to its crossing with Kiron Shankar Roy Road, orders every other vehicle to a halt and then, in a final call of duty, gives the smartest of salutes to Justice Lala.																								The constables grand showing does not go unnoticed  rows of onlookers lining the first-floor balcony of an adjacent building cheer him on, some even raising a salute at the sudden flurry of activity. 																								Heres a blow-by-blow account of the constable in questions performance on Thursday afternoon: 3 pm: He is nowhere to be found near his post. His helmet on the Fiat, however, announces his presence. 3.10 pm: He is seen near the Assembly, chewing on some khaini or pan masala. News of a massive snarl-up on Old Post Office Street and most of KS Roy Road reaches him. He ambles across, does nothing more. 3.50 pm: The effort of an on-the-spot inspection proves too much. The driver of a parked car brings him his buttered toast and the constable, seated on a parked scooter (WB-20/1119), munches his mid-day meal. 4.15 pm: Justice D.P. Sengupta leaves in a white car (WB-02/D-4963). The constable barely picks himself up, casually signalling other vehicles to give way. 4.55 pm: Word finally reaches him that his duty hour  or minute  is approaching. He swings into action. He whips out a comb and runs it through his hair before putting on the helmet. Hands flailing, whistle blowing, out comes the notebook, and the first number of the day is noted down (WB-02N-0097). 5.30 pm: Justice Lalas blue Esteem rolls out. The constable runs to the crossing of both streets, orders every other vehicle to stop and give way to the judge, whom he sends off with a smart salute.

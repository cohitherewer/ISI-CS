				 	 A sample of the Arts amp; Ideas offering																								Pictures dont always speak a thousand words, at least not on their own. Sometimes, a few words can infuse new life, new meaning into a photograph. The exhibition of decorative posters, 20X30, at Swabhumi, is a case in point.																								Photographs and paintings by renowned lensmen and artists blown up to the size of a poster, coupled with an adage or a thought to go with them, lends a whole new dimension to the concept of mixed media.																								This is an effort to make art more affordable as well as accessible to the common art enthusiast, says designer Sunil Sil, at Arts amp; Ideas, the Designshop, at shop no. 213, Swabhumi.																								Infusing art with objects of everyday use is yet another way of appealing to one and all.																								The line-up of artists is impressive, to put it mildly  Aditya Basak, Jayashree Chakraborty, Jogen Chowdhury, Shuvaprasanna, Subrata Chowdhury																								Touching up T-shirts, bookmarks and greeting cards with design prowess, the team behind 20X30 has succeeded in lending a touch of native chic, as well.																								Having set out to turn design on its head, Arts amp; Ideas seems to have got off to a bright start, catching the eye of our men of letters and brushes. A well-stocked book corner in the gallery featuring works on various art forms by renowned authors adds to the appeal.

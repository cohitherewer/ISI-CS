The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 Sip 'n' bite SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA A burger at the ongoing Indus Valley food festival.															 If you are looking for a quick bite and sip while on the run, its a good idea to drop in to Indus Valley. The two-year-old restaurant at 53, Syed Amir Ali Avenue is hosting a burger and mocktail festival, on till April 29. 																					We are the only restaurant in the city that specialises in burgers, says Neerja Nopani of Indus Valley. Our innovative burgers, flavoured with mustard sauce and mayonnaise are quite a rage with youngsters, especially in the evenings, explains the owner.																					A host of new preparations adds meat (and a few veggies) to her claims. Like with the tandoori, paneer tikka and chicken tikka burgers, and Sloppy Jos Burger in veg and chicken varieties (open burgers baked with mozzarella cheese and mushrooms topped with a veg or chicken patty). 																					These are best washed down with a variety of shakes and twisters (or mocktails) flavoured with fruits such as peaches, apricots, kiwis and black currants, topped with a dollop of ice-cream. Only Orange, Always Apricot, Litchi Lumbada, Black Currant Mania, Strawberry Queen, Blue Ocean, Grenadine Nectar and Ginger Apple are just a few of the variations.																					Indus Valleys three-pronged approach targets office-goers with its thali or complete meal offers during lunch hours, the hip brigade during the evening with food festivals, and the family crowd during dinner time.																					We are strategically located, which helps us cater across segments, elaborates Neerja. Its another matter that now the pavement leading up to its shiny facade resembles the ruined civilisation from which the restaurant takes its name, with repair work on at a meter box that caught fire a few days ago.																					But that doesnt take away the fun from biting into a big, juicy burger. Learning about wine is a must for hospitality industry pros. (AFP). Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Tipsy tips																					Sugar + yeast = alcohol + carbon-dioxide. The simple equation behind a not-so-simple beverage  wine  was the subject of a lesson at ITC Sonar Bangla recently. Novices were taken through the basics of appreciating one of the most misunderstood drinks around.																					The in-house group was a cross-section of uninitiated personnel, from the hotels chefs to back-office staff.																					With the barriers between the society movers and the more ordinary shakers breaking down when it comes to wine consumption, it has become more important for employees to have some knowledge about it, feels the hotel management.																					And though they may not have been able to understand the subject in all its depth after the talk given by a representative from Sonarys (dealers in imported wines), they could, at least, make some of the relevant noises, when matters came to the cork.																					our came up early on in the session, right from the basics. A white wine is never white, it ranges from green to brownish yellow. A red wine can have a purple, orange or brownish hue. A white wine can be made from red grapes (by removing the peel), but the reverse is never possible.																					so, important tips on talking bubbly. It is only called Champagne if it is actually from the French district of the same name. Otherwise, it is sparkling wine (remember the basmati-Texmati episode? Same principle). 																					Wine trivia aside, the class was taken through a tasting too. See, swirl, smell before tasting the wine (Dont sip it, gulp it, according to the instructor). When told to open ones mouth to let air make contact with the wine on the palate, to release its flavour, a few members of the uninitiated bunch were horrified.																					That cant be very sophisticated, can it? asked one participant.																																													Leading ladies																					On Friday, Calcuttas leading ladies are getting together for a musical tribute to woman power.																					They hail from all walks of life  artistes, designers, dancers... But for The Ladies of Calcutta evening at Tollygunge Club, they will come prepared with their vocal chords flexed. The line-up, anchored by Usha Uthup, includes Tanusree Shankar, Lee Alison Sibley, Mona Lamba, Pali Sachdev and Anamika Khanna.

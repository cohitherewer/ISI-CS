The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Brand Tagore: Dwindling interest amp; missed opportunities
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								It was bound to happen. With elections in the air, it was just a matter of time before Tagore got eclipsed by  hold your breath Rabin Deb. 																								Spontaneity is usually rare in the hugely boring, even predictable, tributes paid to Tagore. Laughter, of course, is by and large forbidden. It was, therefore, a welcome relief to read that a young boy, probably six or eight years old , brought the house down by attributing one of Tagores poems to the CPM candidate from Calcutta South. 																								The hype and hoopla surrounding Rabin Deb was certainly much more than the sedate public functions to pay tributes to Tagore. The confusion of the youngster is, therefore, quite easily fathomed. 																								Rabindra Jayanti functions at this time of the year are, of course, a dime-a-dozen. Rabindrasangeet remains, arguably, the most popular stream of music in Bengal and Tagore continues to be deified. 																								Two musical evenings in May, however, provided much food for thought. The first function was held at Salt Lake and prominent singers from across the border in Bangladesh were also slated to take the stage. It was an elaborate affair, and the stage was suitably done up for a television channel which sponsored the event and had undertaken to telecast it.																								Tagore would hardly approve, but most of these musical evenings are turning out to be mechanical. 																								At the Salt Lake function, which this writer merely chanced to watch on the television, over-dressed people turned up looking suitably solemn. Perhaps they were just being mindful of the cameras catching the scowls. They sat primly, eyeing each other as the women engaged in the popular pastime of sizing up the saris on display. 																								The singers were formally introduced one after another and they took the stage as if they were attending a funeral. The musicians who accompanied them also were generally expressionless. The singing was, however, top class. But the audience rarely stirred. They shuffled in their seats but either did not clap or clapped rather reluctantly.																								The second function was more informal and held within a housing complex. The singers, once again, were both professional and prominent. It was an open-air show, in which the audience drifted in and out, stretched their legs, shared a gossip or two, huddled together or doubled up with laughter at the back. The young were busy courting while the very old sat stiffly in the front rows, conscious of their elderly status. Here, too, the soul somehow seemed to be missing.																								There are exceptions, of course, and those who have had the privilege of attending functions organised by the Sutanuti Parishad swear by them. But, increasingly, Rabindra Jayanti functions appear soul-less and dull, with the same songs and the same patterns of rajanigandha flowers decked out year after year. 																								It would explain the growing loss of interest among people. A faithful Tagore fan made a point when he said: If I have to just listen to the songs, I might as well listen to them at home with fewer distractions and in greater comfort. 																								Earlier, he recalled, Rabindrasangeet exponents would establish a rapport with the audience by talking to them, sharing their experience and insight. They would talk of Tagore, the poet and Tagore, the visionary. In short, he claimed, they were more enjoyable and the audience would often break into laughter or join in the singing. 																								Others, however, promptly joined issue and claimed that such interactive sessions were more of an exception even earlier, and that Rabindra Jayanti functions have not really changed much over the years. 																								They all agreed, however, that contemporary singers would do well by looking at themselves as public performers with a responsibility to entertain, not just with their singing skills but also with their ability to carry an audience to a musical experience. Their ability to share anecdotes, provide insights into Tagores life and works and to talk of the response that his works evoke would then set apart the good performers from the great, they felt. 																								Rabindrasangeet is just one of the areas of concern. The fact is that the city has not quite been able to take advantage of the potent Tagore brand. The legacy of Rabindranath, who left behind 2,500 songs, over 2,000 paintings and drawings and 28 volumes of prose, poetry, lectures and plays, could have been utilised for cultural revival. 																								Not only is Tagore fading out of the imagination of people in the rest of the country, even visitors to the city have little opportunity to rediscover one of the tallest men and a creative genius. One has only to compare the successful branding of Shakespeare to realise the missed opportunities, as also the immense possibilities of brand Tagore.

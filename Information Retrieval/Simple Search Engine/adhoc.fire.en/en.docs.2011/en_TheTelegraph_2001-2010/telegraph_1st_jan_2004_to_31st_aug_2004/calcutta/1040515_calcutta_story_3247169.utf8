 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Realtor held for fraud, hint of drug links
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Salt Lake-based realtor has been rounded up by the police for allegedly duping his business partner. There were other complaints, too, of fraud against the realtor, which police will investigate. The Narcotics Control Bureau was also conducting separate investigations into the realtors links with the drug trade.																								Realtor Santanu Chakraborty was arrested earlier this week on charges of duping his business partner of over Rs 15 lakh, said Manoranjan Saha, additional superintendent of police (Salt Lake), on Friday. He will be produced at the Barrackpore sub-divisional judicial magistrates court on Saturday, Saha added.																								There are several other complaints against Chakraborty. We will start inquiries soon, said an officer of Bidhannagar (North) police station.																								Chakrabortys partner, Tapan Bakshi, had filed a cheating case against him at the Barrackpore court on March 21, 2004. Chakraborty appealed to Calcutta High Court for an anticipatory bail, which was rejected.																								In his complaint, Bakshi said he was involved in two projects in Salt Lake with Chakraborty. He had invested a huge amount. Chakraborty refused to return my capital and did not pay my share of profit, either, he said.																								A team of officers from Bidhannagar (North) police station arrested Chakraborty last Tuesday. He was produced in Barrackpore court, where the judge put him in police custody till May 15. 																								According to police: We have received allegations that Chakraborty had sold an apartment to several persons and also duped others, said an official.																								Meanwhile, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) sources said they were carrying on investigations against the realtor on possible links with drug rackets in the township.																								Although officially the NCB would neither confirm nor deny reports of the realtors links with drug rackets for the sake of inquiry, sources said probes were on to find out the source of funds for his projects.																								The bureaus endeavour is to find out the sources from where the money is being pumped into the realtors projects, an NCB official said, on condition of anonymity. 																								Sources said narcotics dealers were taking the help of local promoters to gain a foothold in their area of operations. 																								According to NCB officials, the promoter-drug dealer nexus has assumed alarming proportions in Salt Lake. With a number of small and medium projects coming up in the township over the past few years, sleuths claim they have proof that some of these projects are being funded by drug money. 																								 quot;We have conducted raids on the premises of such persons and are working out the details of the case. Several documents, including bank passbooks, were seized, an official said.

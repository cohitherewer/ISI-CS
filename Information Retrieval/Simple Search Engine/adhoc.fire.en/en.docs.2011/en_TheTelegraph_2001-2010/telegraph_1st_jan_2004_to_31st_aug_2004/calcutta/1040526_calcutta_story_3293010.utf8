The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 Subrata Mukherjee								Mayor, Calcutta Municipal Corporation																																							As the mayor, I would not want any wall to be defaced. In other metros like Delhi or Mumbai, this practice does not exist among political parties. Banners and hoardings are all that there are. But here the communists have started this trend, and we have to compete with them. In my own constituency, I have started cleaning the walls. As for the other candidates, if they pay the Corporation, we can do the job for them. So far, no one has approached me with such a request. The responsibility of keeping the city clean cannot certainly be mine alone, when no other party is bothered.

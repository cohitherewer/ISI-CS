 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 For kids, a summer chill-out
 SANGITA S. GUHA ROY																								Holiday homework is a horror, playing in the sun is no fun. But dont let that rob the spring from your step, for there are choices aplenty to cheer you up.																								All-action summer camps calling all children is the latest buzz around town, with parents queuing up readily to wash their hands of the demanding tykes. And the kids arent complaining, either. For, theres lots of interesting activities on offer to keep them constructively occupied. So what if the chill bill for children can add up to between Rs 500 and Rs 6,000 (see chart)?																								When we were growing up, month-long visits to relatives was the norm during holidays. But today, everybody is busy and handling restless children during long vacations is nothing short of a nightmare. This is where summer camps come in handy, says Sabina, a young mother of two.																								Her views are seconded by Vandana Kanoria, director, Kislaya Montessori House, that kicked off summer camps 16 years ago. Parents often dont get enough leave from their jobs to spend quality time with their children. So, its become fashionable to send kids to summer camps, which are not only enjoyable but educative as well, stresses Vandana, whose camp theme this year is Hindustan Hamara.																								Nehru Childrens Museum expands on the Indian-ness theme with workshops on Gauriyo Nritya and Bharatanatyam. The hobby camps at Birla Institute of Technological Museum (BITM) roll robotics, astronomy, physics, chemistry and life science experiments into one.																								Theres lots of outdoor fun for all-round development on offer, as well, with The Golden Retreat, Haldia, making a splash with swimming, pool, snooker, table tennis, contemporary dance and more. Ibiza The Club offers horse-riding, rock-climbing, nature study, treasure hunt, cricket, football, tennis, badminton, billiards, swimming, angling and archery, with a parent allowed to tag along for a tot.																								But if folks would rather keep a closer eye on their wards, city Montessories and playhouses are a better bet. Kids Conclave, for example, has a three-week deal that packs in cooking without fire, calligraphy, math and grammar, story-telling and more (children need to be in constant touch with their lessons lest they forget them, explains chief coordinator Indira Sengupta). The pace picks up at Padatik with jazz, salsa, hip hop, funk and ballet, theatre, health and cooking classes.																								And you thought summers were a drag!

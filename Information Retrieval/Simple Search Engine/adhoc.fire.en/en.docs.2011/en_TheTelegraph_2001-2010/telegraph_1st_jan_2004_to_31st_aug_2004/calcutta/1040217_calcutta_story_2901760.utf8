		 Protiti ChatterjeeProtiti Chatterjee																									She isnt just yet, but at a rather young age  she turns 12 on Thursday, February 19  she has managed to accomplish quite a lot. And her aspirations are even higher. But commitment and hard work are two qualities Protiti has in abundance. For, not only is she a consummate kathak performer, but is also a budding academic to boot.																									is what she usually gets to hear from family and friends after a display of her talents on stage or TV. Initiated into dance by kathak exponent Amita Dutt at age five, the Park Circus girl has already performed in several solo and group shows at Rabindra Sadan, Kala Mandir, Science City auditorium and Aurobindo Bhavan, amongst others. Plus, regular appearances on TV channels ATN World, Akash Bangla, CTVN and Bangla Ekhon.																									Are two of the Class VI student of St Johns Diocesans favourite subjects, with history, maths and Bengali also on the list. Never anything less than third in school, she tops in her class and her year quite often. But its astrology and astronomy that fascinate her no end, and Protiti likes to do some serious reading on the two subjects.																									Is an alien concept for the multifaceted Mumpy. 																									Practising kathak for an hour or two a day, studying after school and classes with dancer Madhumita Roy every Saturday leaves the girl with very little time to laze around at home. But despite the tight schedule, she also manages to participate in, and win, school elocution and debate contests, and the occasional quiz. Drawing and playing badminton are her other hobbies, when she can spare a few moments, which is rare with at least one public performance lined up every month.																									in dancing and academics, is Protiti. Its all in the family, she insists, with sitar maestro Shyamal Chattopadhay as grandfather and a musically-inclined doctor as mother. But though music and dance run in her genes, a surgeon is what she is determined to be.

 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Women taunted and fired at
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A protest by a woman and her daughter against lewd remarks led three men to open fire on them on Sunday morning.																								Both mother and daughter escaped miraculously. One of the bullets grazed the womans forehead, while another narrowly missed the daughters head. No arrests have been made yet.																								The incident took place around 11.15 am on Pemalton Street, in the Park Street police station area. The three men had entered the narrow street in search of a motor mechanic, identified as Natu. They stood in front of Natus house and called for him. When told he wasnt home, they started abusing him, said an officer of the local police station.																								None of the residents dared protest. Then, Ayesha Bibi, 45, who lives opposite Natus house, came out and told the trio to stop.																								Her rebuke turned the three goons more aggressive. They started taunting Ayesha. When her daughter Salia came out, she bore the brunt of their comments, said the officer.																								The mother-daughter duo protested loudly. At that, one of the gangsters whipped out a revolver and pulled the trigger. Ayesha slumped on the street as the bullet grazed her left temple. The bullet aimed at Salia narrowly missed her head and hit a roadside wall, the officer said.																								Preliminary investigation revealed that the three men were aides of Mehtaz, who runs an extortion racket in the area. 																								We are trying to dig out Natus antecedents. It seems he had a link with the attackers, said the official.

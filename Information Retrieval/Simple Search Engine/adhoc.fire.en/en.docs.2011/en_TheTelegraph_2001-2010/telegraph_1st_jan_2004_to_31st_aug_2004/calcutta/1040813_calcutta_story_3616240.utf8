The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Small talk
Heres to help you roll your tongue over the right words and phrases before venturing out to party, for the prize is bound to go to the worst wag about town.				 				 				 		On the ball																								If you respond to the words fire alarm by thinking somethings burning, sit at home. After all, kiss-tell-sell Faria Alam is the flavour of the forthright, this fortnight.																								How much can a roll in the hay  or a romp on a four-poster bed or a bend (unlike Beckham) on the staircase  possibly rake in?  500,000 and counting is the answer scripted by the Bangladeshi secretary and the British tabloids  with the Team England coach caught hopelessly off-side.																								Faria Alams expose on her affair with Sven-Goran Eriksson may have done away with even the fig leaf, but theres still a whole lot that remains unsaid, in the adda zone. So, be on the ball or pay the penalty.Birthday bash																								Its time to raise a toast and turn the clock back as Someplace Else turns 10. If you are above 25 years and have been partying hard this last decade, the news of the return to the Someplace Else disco days  even if it is only for a night  must bring on a big bout of nostalgia. The dance floor that has seen lots of good, groovin times will be cleared of the bands for some bumpin (you cant not in that tiny space), if not grindin. Love triangle 																								Heres a masala mix to spice things up for you: Kareena and Shahid are truly, madly and deeply fida on each other. Never mind if you are yet to catch some live action between the two in Ken Ghoshs Fida, releasing on August 20. You can always conjecture whether Fardeen Khan would be playing spoilsport (what with him rumoured to be sharing a bathtub with Bebo in the film). So, the big question is who actually will win Poo at the end of it all  her real-life love or her reel-love of Dev and Khushi? Keep guessing.Date dare																								A gentle reminder: todays Friday the 13th. So watch your step if you are the superstitious kind, but be bindaas if you arent. Rest assured, theres no ghost out to get you in the chief ministers oasis of peace.

	Some pavement-dwellers put up their entire families on the footpath, making it dirty and difficult for people to use them. They even do their washing and bathing there, splashing the water around and then leaving the tap open. The Corporation should take action against these people who treat public walking space as their own.

	Residents of Budge Budge need a direct bus to Howrah. If we have to catch a train from Howrah, we are forced to go to Bata More and board an ever-crowded Batanagar minibus. I have been a resident of this locality for the past 26 years but none of the local public representatives have taken up the matter to date. The transport department should do something about this problem.
	T.R. Anand, Budge Budge

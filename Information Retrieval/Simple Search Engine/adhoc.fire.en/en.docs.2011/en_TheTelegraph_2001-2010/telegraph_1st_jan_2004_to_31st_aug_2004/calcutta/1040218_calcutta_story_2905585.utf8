The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 John Travolta You are fearless and courageous and will not stop till you achieve your goal. There is, however, a feeling of loneliness. You are wise and your judgment is usually correct. You like to strive for the good of others, but your forthrightness can hurt them at times. You brook no words of caution from anyone. Grey and purple are your colours.  Kusum Bhandari

	Trading in ornamental fish is very profitable these days. However, many eager youths lack the technical knowhow for pisciculture. The fisheries department should start a scheme for imparting training to these people. 
	Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town. 
	I absentmindedly left my wallet in a state bus (on route S-14) on my way to work a few days ago. The bus conductor, Gautam Mondal, found my wallet and came to my office in Salt Lakes DA block to return it. He refused to accept the money I offered as token of gratitude. Such people inspire others to follow the path of honesty. Arindam Banerjee, Phoolbagan.

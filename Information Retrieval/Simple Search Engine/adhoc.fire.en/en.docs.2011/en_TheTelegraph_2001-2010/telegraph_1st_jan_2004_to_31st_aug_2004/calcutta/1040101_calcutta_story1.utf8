The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 01, 2004  If you think your city is changing,  youre right
 If you think Calcutta has changed  for the better over the past year, youre not in danger  of being laughed off the street. Two out of three Calcuttans  agree with you. An opinion poll done for The Telegraph  Metro by TNS Mode has thrown up its fair share of cynics,  but there are some in-your-face signs of movement few have  missed. 2003s favourite figure of  the year is undoubtedly the flyover. Three hundred Calcuttans  106 between 15 and 24 years of age and 194 between  30 and 45 covered in the survey, spontaneously picked  flyovers as the No. 1 monument to change. Justice Amitava Lala will be glad  to know that when handed a list of possible changes which  have made a difference, an overwhelming number 83%  singled out his rally-restriction order. Watch out chief minister, they  didnt like your handling of the issue. The majority,  55%, believes the governments opposition to the order  has affected the image youre so worried about. That  is not to say, though, that they are not with you  85% think perception of the city is brightening. It comes with the warning, however,  that it has not brightened enough for the young to declare:  this is my city of the future. In the 15-24 age group, 58%  would leave with a heavy heart if they had  the chance. What will keep them? More change,  perhaps. Topping their wish list for 2004 is better infrastructure. Its not as if Calcutta has  place only for flyovers, and not fun. The new shopping centre  with the multiplex has it hooked the ladies love  it. Optimism is high a large  majority believes Calcutta can be comparable to any other  metro. Heres hoping for more change in 2004. Happy  New Year!

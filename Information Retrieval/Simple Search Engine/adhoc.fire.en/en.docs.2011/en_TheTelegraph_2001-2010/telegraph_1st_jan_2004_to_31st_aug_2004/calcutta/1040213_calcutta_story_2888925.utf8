The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 13, 2004  Calcutta Column
 
	The security arrangement at Writers Buildings is very  tight. But how can one justify the slackness just a few  yards away from the red-brick structure? The roadsides have  been taken up by pavement-dwellers and eateries. The scene  is certainly not what the power centre of a metropolis should  look like.  
	Chandan Ray, Sarsuna.  
	Most taxis in the city now play FM radio at a high volume.  An hours journey with such loud music is enough to give  one a headache. I wonder how the cabbies manage to stand  that noise, compounded by the cacophony all around. Arent  they more prone to mishaps?  
	Tapan Pal, Batanagar.  
	Being a regular commuter to Sealdah station, I often have  to board a train from Bidhannagar. The announcements made  through the public address system at this station are too  garbled to follow.  
	Samiran Das, Duttapukur.

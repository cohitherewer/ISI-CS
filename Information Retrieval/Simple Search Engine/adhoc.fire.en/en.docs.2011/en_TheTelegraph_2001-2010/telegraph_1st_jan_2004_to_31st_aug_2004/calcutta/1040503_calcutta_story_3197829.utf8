 Special treatment: Tuberoses being packed for export. Picture by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryBasudeb Chowdhury: Could you elaborate on the process of sending flowers abroad?																																																													For this, one needs to have a cold chain. Under the scheme, the harvested flowers are to be stored at a temperature of four degrees to six degrees Celsius. Then, they have to be packed in a special way before the flowers are put on board an aircraft. Earlier, we did not have a mobile cold van to collect the flowers from our rural growers. But now we have one. We are developing another centre with state-of-the-art storage facilities for the flowers meant for export.

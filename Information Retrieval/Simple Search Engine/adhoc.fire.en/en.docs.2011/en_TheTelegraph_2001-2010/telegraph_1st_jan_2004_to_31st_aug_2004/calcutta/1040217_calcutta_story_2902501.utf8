 															- HONING TALENTS OF THE THEATRICAL TYPE MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Jamie Beddard interacts with a participant at the workshop. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Jamie Beddard is an actor with a BAFTA-winning film to his credit. The 37-year-old is a writer and stage director, too. The Briton is currently in India, facilitating a workshop on dramatic writing. He also suffers from cerebral palsy.																								But for Jamie, and long-term collaborator Katie OReilly, disability is no stumbling block. It may have shaped their personal politics, but has not altered their fundamental approach to life.																								And on Monday, they brought the same empowering message to participants of the writing workshop being held at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP). The challenged and the able, teachers and students signed up for the interactive sessions with the UK-based writers, who will conduct the British Council-supported programme till Friday.																								We do identify ourselves as disabled, admits OReilly, who suffers from invisible spinal disorder. So, issues of disability do recur in their work. But disability is only a bit of me. I like to write about other things that I am interested in, as well, stresses Jamie.																								The executive director of the Graeae Theatre Company, which works with many disabled theatre professionals, has been in films such as the BAFTA-winning Skallagrigg and Quills, starring Geoffrey Rush, Michael Caine and Kate Winslett.																								In the UK, there a lot more disabled actors than here, says Jamie, who feels that it will take a long time to change the scenario in India. When he was starting out in 1987, it was not common in the UK either. But the situation has improved, with more actors finding their way in a difficult industry, despite having a long way to go.																								The workshop aims to help people inject substance into their writing. You cant teach someone to be a good writer, says Katie. But you can teach them skills to be better than they presently are.																								Jeeja Ghosh, one of the participants, is a social worker at IICP, where she was formerly a student. She has not been writing much of late. But now the activist wants to refresh her skills for use as an advocacy tool. Teachers of special schools and mainstream schools were also in attendance, as were other ex-students of IICP, and even a couple of college students. 																								Helping aspiring dramatists identify things they want to communicate is central to the sessions. In order to write, you have to have something to say, she adds. What the participants choose to write about is up to them  it might be about disability, it might not be  the trainers point out. Writing is not about therapy for the duo, though if participants express personal issues and get a sense of satisfaction, it is an added bonus. To help hone professional skills, films made in England, as well as Jamie and Katies own works, will be shown at the Taratala institute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 B-school fledgling eyes a surge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Globsyn Business School (GBS), one of the youngest management schools in the city that saw its first batch graduate this year, plans to at least double its student strength in the next batch and expand to other cities.																								According to chairman Bikram Dasgupta, the first batch of 53 students has received over 60 offers from top companies, including Reliance Industries, ICICI Prudential and Star TV, and several from the east.																								We have purposely not gone for international placement with the first batch, concentrating more on the eastern-region companies, Dasgupta explained. 																								The placement results and demand for quality education have encouraged the GBS management to add around 60 more seats for the next batch. The school recently added 6,500 sq ft to its Salt Lake campus.																								Dasgupta plans to take the school to other parts of the country, particularly Delhi, but only after being fully confident.																								Retailing and broadcast journalism are other interesting areas Globsyn may look at in the near future, according to Dasgupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Last-ditch bid to stall the hanging
 OUR BUREAU																								The government may have fixed August 14 as Dhananjoy Chatterjees date with death, but 20 leading lawyers fighting to save the rapist-killer claim they are still confident of stalling the hanging.																								The government has not followed the jail code, which specifies that a gap of 21 days must be kept between the day the President rejects a mercy petition and the new date for execution of a capital sentence, no matter how many times a mercy petition has been rejected, said advocate Jaymalya Bagchi.																								Legal experts said a gap of 21 days is deliberately kept to gauge the mental condition of the death-row prisoner and to give him time to pursue all possible legal recourse.																								The state made a glaring error by not giving the prisoner or his family time to approach the Supreme Court again, added Bagchi,who has been defending Dhananjoy.																								In Delhi, Colin Gonzalves led a battery of lawyers drafting a petition in Dhananjoys defence, highlighting this point to put the hanging on hold. The petition may be filed in Supreme Court by Gonzalves on Wednesday.																								The government has handed us a big weapon to fight our case when time is running out. I had detailed discussions with Gonzalves about the state governments hurry to send Dhananjoy to the gallows, said Bagchi.																								Despite several attempts made by us, we could not get hold of the Presidents rejection order. The government has denied us this right. We dont even know whether the state government had informed the President about the fact that Dhananjoy has languished in prison for 10 years (1994-2004) due to the governments fault, Bagchi added.																								Far removed from the hectic legal activity in the Capital and in Calcutta, a deathly quiet descended on Chhatna, in Bankura, where Dhananjoys ailing parents learnt of the August 14 date from neighbours. 																								A magistrate has been asked to formally deliver the message of the execution date  that coincides with his birthday  to Dhananjoys parents.																								Everything is finished. How could they decide to hang him the day he was born? The government should have thought about our parents, who are completely shattered, said Dhananjoys brother, Gangadhar Chatterjee.																								A police picket was posted in front of the Chatterjee house and everybody coming to meet the grieving family was stopped and questioned.We are waiting for Bikash (Dhananjoys younger brother) to come back from Calcutta, was all father Banshidhar would say.

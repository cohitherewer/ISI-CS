The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Safe city for women, but...
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Are women in Calcutta less safe than in other cities? More letters will be published next week Victims of attention: Women on Calcutta streets Piyal Mukherjee, 
																		Lake Town																																																														Safety of women depends on the attitude of the inhabitants of a place. In Calcutta, women are always treated with respect. For all the stray cases of ill-treatment of women reported in Calcutta, law-enforcing authorities usually take immediate measures. The sharp increase of similar incidents in other cities in other states indicates that Calcutta is comparatively safe for women. 									

Sushmita Chatterjee, 
																		Panihati																																																														Women in Calcutta used to feel safe even a few years ago, when the people of the city were always ready to help in case of trouble on the streets. Not any more. For let alone at night, even in broad daylight, there are reasons for women to feel insecure. This is because of proliferation by anti-social elements, an unhealthy Bollywood craze and degeneration of the citys innate culture. 									

Kajal Chatterjee, 
																		Sodepur 																																																														A glimpse at mere statistics will reveal that women in Calcutta are safer than those in other cities. But that is hardly reason for complacence. The demographic change in Calcutta, coupled with the Bengalis obsession with Hindi films, have resulted in women being treated as mere objects for satisfying mens lust. The need of the hour is for law-enforcing agencies to take immediate action and for Calcuttans to try and redeem their past bhadralok culture.									

Pijus Kanti Sarkar, 
																		Narendrapur 																																																														Buddha babus speech about West Bengal being an oasis of peace is a pretty one. In spite of the Bapi Sen case or the recent Rekha Chandak murder, it is true that if we compare Calcutta with other cities, women are safer here than there. But it should be noted that Calcutta is also at the same time becoming a safe haven for terrorists and that is definitely not a good sign.Soumya Das,
Bangur Avenue 
Women are definitely safer in Calcutta than the capital, where crime against women is steadily on the rise. However, Calcutta cannot be termed the safest city either. Women in Salt Lake are unsafe outdoors, especially after sundown. Deserted roads and inadequate police patrolling add to the problem. Women are victims of abuse in crowded trams and buses too. The administration is doing precious little to check this. 									

Sulagna Sengupta,
																		Convent Road																																																														The alarming rate of increase in cases of violence against women is definitely a cause for concern. However, women in Calcutta are much safer than those in other metros. In places like Lucknow and Patna, or even Delhi, notorious for abuse, women have to think twice before venturing out after dusk without being accompanied by a man. And in reality there occur many more cases of abuse than reported. In a city like Calcutta, a higher awareness level brings more such cases to light. Even statistics hint that Calcutta is better off, as far as womens safety is concerned. 									

Tapan Pal, 
																		Batanagar																																																														The demographic profile of Calcutta influences the safety of women in the city. Imbalance in the sex-ratio, especially in the below-30 age group, a notable presence of migrant, adult male population, marrying age for men being on the higher side, and considerable age difference between husband and wife  tilt the balance against women in this city. Added to it are the social stigma on single women and erosion of moral and ethical values, that make the independent, working womans life a nightmare. 									

Indranil Sengupta, 
																		Salt Lake City																																																														Crime against women is, perhaps, comparatively less in Calcutta than in other cities. However, there are certain pockets in the city that are quite unsafe for women after dark. The situation was better even a few years ago. But now it is almost dangerous for women to venture out alone in Calcutta. The situation of law and order in the state has definitely deteriorated over the years.									

Mamata Banerjee, 
																		Sarsuna																																																														Calcutta is still safer for women in comparison with other cities in the country, but the scene is changing drastically as suggested by statistics and media reports. Extravagant lifestyles of women and their adventurous dress codes often land them in trouble. As in the case of the murder of a woman near the SAIL office recently, it is not understandable why she visited such a deserted place so late in the evening.									

Sitima Singha,
																		Serampore																																																														Women in Calcutta are not better off than their counterparts in other cities. The government should provide more security for women after sundown and prevent women from visiting certain deserted spots. On the other hand, women too should take precautions and try to avoid deserted places, even with male escorts. They should dress carefully as well. To an extent, they themselves can work towards avoiding mishaps. T.R. Anand,
Budge BudgeA few stray incidents do not mean that women are not safe in the city. Every man that women encounter on the roads does not pass lewd comments at them. Buses, trams and even Metros have seats reserved for women. Leaving aside cities in south India, no other city bestows so much respect on women as Calcutta does. 									

Sushma Jalan,
																		Burdwan Road																																																														Calcutta, previously considered safer than other metropolitan cities, is going from bad to worse. Eve-teasing has become a common trend. But the rise in physical and mental abuse of women at the workplace and in public transports is alarming. Delhi and Mumbai are notorious for being unsafe for women. But if current reports are to be believed, Calcutta seems all set to break all records soon. After all, it is the city where a woman was teased by cops and when another policeman dared to come to her rescue, he was beaten to death.

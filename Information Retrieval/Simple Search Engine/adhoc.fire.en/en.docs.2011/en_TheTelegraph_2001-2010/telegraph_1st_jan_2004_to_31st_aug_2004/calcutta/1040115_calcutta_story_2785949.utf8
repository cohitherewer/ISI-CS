 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Bone doctors go back to class
 																											- Stung by Rajnis Patel death, state on training programme initiative A STAFF REPORTER																								An effort to improve the quality of orthopaedic surgery is under way in Calcutta by taking budding orthopaedic surgeons back to the classroom, brushing up their basic medical education and acquainting them with the latest techniques. 																								The training of surgeons through workshops, lectures and interaction, beginning Thursday at NRS Medical College and Hospital, comes seven months after the death at SSKM Hospital of budding cricketer Rajnis Patel. The 19-year-old died on June 1 last year, a victim of neglect.																								After taking disciplinary action against the guilty doctors treating him, the government has embarked upon a drive to improve healthcare in state-run hospitals. Director of medical education C.R. Maity said several training programmes had been lined up for doctors.																								The Eastern India Initiative for Orthopaedic Training is one such venture, where young orthopaedic surgeons will be taught the newer techniques of fracture fixation for three days from Thursday.																								The fact that doctors here are lagging behind, whereas people are aware of newer techniques, is cause for concern. We are planning to bridge the gap so that the new generation can perform surgeries with utmost precision, says A.J. Kundu, head of orthopaedics, NRS Medical College and Hospital. 																								To start the training, 11 common fracture zones have been chosen by experts, including lower limbs and the whole upper and pelvis region for discussions. Nearly 100 doctors are undergoing training. 																								After a lecture on the new techniques, doctors will be asked to go to the workshop, where they will be handed instruments and models to work in a simulated atmosphere. Once that is over, doctors will be back in the lecture rooms for an interaction session, Kundu added.																								Experts, including Joy Patnakar from Mumbai, will be at hand to identify which doctor failed to carry out the simulated surgery properly. The expert panel will point out to the doctors what had gone wrong and they will go back to the workshop to repeat the procedure. The idea is to make the whole exercise as comprehensive as possible and to eliminate all possible errors, added surgeon G. Maiti.																								Once the three-day workshop-cum-training programme concludes, the government plans to bring all the orthopaedic surgeons from the district and sub-divisional hospitals to Calcutta for a stint at the top medical colleges and hospitals for practical classes.

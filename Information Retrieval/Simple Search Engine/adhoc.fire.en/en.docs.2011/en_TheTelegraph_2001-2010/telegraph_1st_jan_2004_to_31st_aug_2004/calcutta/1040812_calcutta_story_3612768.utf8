The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Oncology wing added
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An oncology department was commissioned in the Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass on Wednesday. 																								Prathap C. Reddy, chairman of the Apollo Group of Hospitals, said sophisticated medical equipment, including a Positive Emitron (PET) Scan capable of producing sharper images than MRIs, would be inducted into the oncology department shortly. 																								We have decided to instal the machine because Calcutta urgently requires hi-tech radiation oncology wings. 																								Apollo Gleneagles is contemplating opening yet another hospital in Mumbai. We are scouting for land in Mumbai. Work will start as soon as we get it, Reddy said. 																								He was on a days visit to the city to participate in a seminar on advances in the fields of gastroenterology, plastic surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology.

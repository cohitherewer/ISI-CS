 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Blood on the soiree ground
 																											- Lewd dance sparks clash, bombs and bullets take a toll of two A STAFF REPORTER																								Sunday evening started with a revealingly-dressed woman gyrating with a team of performers, while another sang numbers from Bollywood blockbusters. 																								It came to a sudden stop well past midnight, as gunshots rent the air, killing three and injuring several others. 																								This occurred at Purbaparas pumphouse ground, at Nayapatti, in the added area of Salt Lake, during the concluding event of a seven-day Ulta Rath celebration. Drunk young men from local colonies and outside attended the event. Three-thousand people witnessed the show. 																								As the young men danced to the tune of one of the women, who stepped down from the dais and behaved provocatively, a quarrel ensued. At that point, local people barged in and demanded that the lewd dance be stopped. The young men and the residents came to blows. 																								Bombs were hurled and gunshots were fired, killing Anil Pramanik, 45, and an unidentified middle-aged man. A 75-year-old woman Sundari Pramanik, died of a heart attack on Monday at a Salt Lake private hospital after she went into a state of shock on witnessing the battle. 																								Ten men were arrested, including Chinu Mondal, organiser of the function. Raids are being conducted to net his brothers, Saheb and Anup, along with a criminal of the Lake Town area, one-armed Dilip. 																								Around midnight, when things were really hotting up, Miss Swapna stepped down and started dancing with the drunken young men. Soon, a quarrel broke out over who she should dance with, recounted Palani Pramanik, a local resident. 																								Police denied the charge and said residents, who objected to the obscene show, fell out with the organisers, who were primarily responsible for the firing. Sources said a group of 15 youths arrived on the spot in two cars and fired 25 rounds.																								Anil, who worked as a supervisor for a local construction company, died after being shot in the chest. 																								The other man was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries later in the night. 																								He told me he would listen to a few songs on his way back from a grocers shop and then return home, said Anils wife, Alpana, who works as a cook. When I heard gunshots and saw people running in all directions, I had no idea that my husband had been killed, she added.																								Soma Pramanik, Bidhannagar Municipalitys CPM councillor from ward 14, said she would see to it that similar programmes are not held in the fairground. I told the organisers to seek police permission, but they did not pay heed to me, she said.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The green bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday sought a report from the Union environment ministry, asking whether it had already released the Rs 6.96 crore that had been sanctioned for the development of Rabindra Sarobar.																								Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee also asked the ministry to inform the court about its plans to remodel the Sarobar, following its decision to bring it under the National Conservation of Lakes Project (NCLP).																								The court went on to ask the Bengal government to submit an affidavit stating whether it had been intimated by the government of India about the decision to include Rabindra Sarobar in the NCLP.																								The government should also inform the court whether it had received any amount from the Centre for the betterment of the Lakes, observed the bench.																								In their order, Chief Justice Mathur and Justice Bannerjee asked the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), the organisation entrusted with maintenance of the Dhakuria Lakes, to file an affidavit stating the detailed plan for its development.																								The report should mention how much money is needed for the modernisation of the Lakes, they mentioned.																								The order follows a report submitted by the Union environment ministry before the court a month ago, declaring that Rabindra Sarobar would come under the purview of the NCLP.																								Environment activist Subhas Dutta had filed a petition before Calcutta High Court, alleging that Rabindra Sarobar was suffering due to mismanagement. 																								A group of morning-walkers at the Dhakuria Lakes became a party to the case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 STAR back on beam after month
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After more than a months lay-off, the STAR bouquet of channels was back in 1,50,000 cable homes in the city on Saturday evening.																								The deadlock over beaming of the channels  since the second week of December  was resolved following a 17-hour talk among officials of RPG Netcom, Siti Cable and Manthan that carried on through Friday night. This was the culmination of a 72-hour crisis management exercise by senior STAR officials to end the impasse. 																								All the issues associated with Siti and Manthan have been resolved and as a distributor of STAR network, we have switched on the STAR bouquet for both the multi-system operators, said Amit Nag, chief executive officer, RPG Netcom. 																								Over 350,000 cable homes  out of around 15 lakh in the city  went without their favourite soaps following RPG Netcoms decision to blackout the STAR bouquet of channels on the Manthan network, and Siti stopping telecast of the bouquet that includes STAR Plus, STAR News, STAR Movies and National Geographic Channel.																								According to industry sources, the past one month saw significant realignment in the industry with around 25 operators moving out of Manthans fold and joining RPG Netcom and CableCom. This brought down the number of homes without STAR programmes from 350,000 to 150,000 over the past five weeks. 																								The January 15 directive of freezing cable television rates by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) was instrumental in resolving the stand-off, said Suresh Sethia of Siti Cable. The apex body has directed cable operators across the country to charge the tariff that existed on December 26, 2003.																								We have sorted out our differences with RPG Netcom on increasing the subscriber base for STAR and we are happy that our viewers are able to see their favourite channels once again, added Sethia. 																								Manthan director Gurmeet Singh said: We have sorted out the issues amicably and are showing the STAR channels. RPG Netcom switched off STAR channels from Manthans network on December 9 following disputes over dues. 																								In yet another development, the cable operators called off their proposed 24-hour strike on January 20 to protest the unreasonable rate hike in the new year by major pay bouquets. As the question of rate rise doesnt arise following the Trai ruling, we are calling off the strike, said Mrinal Chatterjee, a leading cable operator. Principals meet: The All  Bengal Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Principals  Meet will be held at Birla High School on January 24. Heads  of the 113 schools affiliated to the board in the state  will attend the meet, to be conducted by CBSE chairman Ashok  Ganguly, who feels that the east is a neglected area for  the board. The main issues on the days agenda are academics  and affiliation.

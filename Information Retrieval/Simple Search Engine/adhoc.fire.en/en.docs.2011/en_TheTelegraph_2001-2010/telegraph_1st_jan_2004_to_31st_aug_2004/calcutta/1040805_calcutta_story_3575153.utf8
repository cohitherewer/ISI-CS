 Thursday, August 05, 2004 Strokes that soothe 
From chocolate and coffee to wine and fresh fruit, our spas offer exotic rubs to fill up your senses. Himika Chaudhuri and Nisha Lahiri find outEver heard the old joke (cracked by men, mostly) that a womans beauty regimen involves the contents of a kitchen in a face pack? Ever thought that those cucumbers could do more in your tummy rather than on your eyelids?Well, you are way out of your league now. Chocolate to wine, coffee to fresh fruit, rub it all over your body for the most exotic skin and body treatments in town. After dieticians have pretty much ruled out consuming any of these for one reason or the other, is this what it all boils down to?So after a long week spent meeting clients, chasing sales targets and closing tricky deals, make the most of the weekend by pampering yourself with some pure indulgence. Check into a plush spa and get slathered with creams and packs till both your mind and body (and, unfortunately, the pocket, too) start feeling significantly lighter.Most of these relaxing techniques, claim the spas, are more than just massages and are called therapies or treatments. There has been a spurt in such services on offer as well, with Solace at Sunny Park, Sonar Spa at ITC Sonar Bangla, Club Prana at Hyatt and the serene, secluded Vedic Village setting up specialised centres with exciting therapies and treatments. We bring you a sampling of the most interesting and unusual:Cocoa wrap Mocha madness in the form of a massage? This one may not be for those on a diet (self control may, after all, prove difficult). Beauty diva Blossom Kocchar has whipped up a yummy concoction for supple, silky skin. The first is a coffee scrub. The entire body is scrubbed down with coffee seeds crushed and stirred into a liquid form. The grainy liquid is rubbed on the body to remove dead tissue. This leaves the body softer. A light shower in warm water follows. Then, an almost magical chocolate wrap comes on. The entire body is painted (with a painters brush) with liquid chocolate, wrapped in a polythene sheet and covered up with towels. A little nap may be the next order of business, as you have to lie still with the chocolate seeping into the skin for 25 minutes. The chocolate is said to lighten the skin while it moisturises. After the final shower, you may just be set to beat Miss Beautiful Skin at her own game. At: Solace, Sunny Park. Cost: Rs 1,000.Wine bath If youve drunk your fill of wine all through Saturday night, you could well continue doing the wine thing on Sunday. Only this time, you wont be raising the glass to your lips. Wine therapy makes the best use of the therapeutic qualities of wine, which, apparently, leave the skin looking and feeling younger. The treatment exploits the active agents of grapes, which are believed to be great for the skin. The fruit is rich in vitamins like A, B1, B2, PP and C. The therapy involves the spa crew setting up a bath in your room adding up to six bottles of red wine in the water in the tub. A grape-scrub precedes the soak. With all artificial lights in the room turned off, its the flicker of the candle and the whiff of wine that keeps you company as you immerse yourself in a Bacchanalian bath. The warm water opens the pores of your skin, letting the wine seep in which gives you the glow that can put a chandelier to shame. This Spa is popular with the celeb brigade that checks into the hotel. We hear its Raveena Tandons favourite. At: Sonar Spa, ITC Sonar Bangla. Cost: Rs 5,000.Fresh fruit rub If you are giving your dose of fresh fruit a miss, make up for it with the irresistible fresh fruit therapy. Freshly cut and smashed apples, pineapples, bananas, papayas and grapes are used in this massage. The paste cleanses the skin as it softens. Coconut milk is used to wash the hair as a conditioner. A number of medicinal herbs are also used. The massage ends with a sauna bath, leaving the body feeling light and rested. At: Club Prana, The Hyatt Regency. Cost: Rs 2,000.Herbal therapyShirodhara is a popular, holistic body treatment for ailments ranging from insomnia to arthritis. It involves plenty of oils of the herbal kind. Hundreds of different blends are used, depending on the treatment, including lotus, rose, sandalwood and patchouli, one of the rarer, more expensive varieties. This is mainly used for rejuvenation rather than therapeutic purposes and entails pouring warm oil constantly over different parts of the body.At Vedic Village, C.M. Pradyumna recommends the Kayaseka Shirodhara, in which warm medicated herbal oil is squeezed from a cloth by six attendees on to parts of the body, and then rubbed in a synchronised manner. It is done in seven positions, and lasts for about an hour. You could also try the Abhyangan Shirodhara, another whole-body oil therapy. At: Vedic Village. Cost: Rs 1,800.Pictures by Pabitra Das

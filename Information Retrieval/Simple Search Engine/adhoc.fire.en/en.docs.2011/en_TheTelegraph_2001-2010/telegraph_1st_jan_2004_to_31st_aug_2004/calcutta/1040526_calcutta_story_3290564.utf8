 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Enter, majestic maneater
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Sunderkanta surveys his surroundings at Alipore zoo on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Alipore zoo has a jewel in its rusty crown the biggest Royal Bengal tiger  a maneater at that  the zoo has ever housed. 																								And on Tuesday evening, the pride of the zoo was christened Sunderkanta (the pride of the Sunderbans).																								Minister for environment and forests Jogesh Burman was present in the zoo when the maneater of Samshergunge got his name.																								The alpha male was brought to the city from the Sunderbans in grand style, with hooters blaring, red lights flashing atop the van, and a convoy led by a pilot car.																								The tiger was trapped and caged from Samshergunge, in Hemnagar village, and we have seen nothing like it in the past 50 years. Its big and strong and has quite a fearsome reputation as a maneater. His most recent victim was a teenaged girl, Rupasi Bawri, said Pradip Vyas, director of the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (STR).																								According to Vyas, the 12-year-old tiger was a terror in the area. On two previous attempts, we had managed to capture the tiger, but this particular creature, being really strong, had managed to break free, Vyas elaborated.																								The tigers strength was evident on its first night in the zoo. More than 10 of us were on guard outside the cage he had been brought in, when suddenly, we saw the tiger sticking his head through the cage. He had muscled his way through the metal bars and the iron net securing the cage. We immediately made an arrangement to cover the cage with another iron net, said a guard.																								Now begins the hunt for Mrs Sunderkanta. The Sunderbans Tiger Reserve men have been alerted to look for a similarly tough female tiger straying into a village, so that our tiger here has a mate, said Vyas. 																								We would like to breed such strong tigers in the zoo This would really be a major achievement, he added.

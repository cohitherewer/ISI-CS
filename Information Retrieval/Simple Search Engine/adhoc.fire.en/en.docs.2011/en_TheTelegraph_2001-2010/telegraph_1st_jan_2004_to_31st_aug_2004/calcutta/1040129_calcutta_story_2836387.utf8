																																																																																		A special leave petition has been moved in the Supreme Court seeking to commute the death sentence of Dhananjoy Chatterjee into life imprisonment. The caretaker-cum-liftman of a residential apartment in Bhowanipore was awarded a death sentence by the Alipore trial court for raping and murdering an 14-year-old girl of the same apartment. In his petition, Chatterjees counsel Chanchal Ganguly said the death sentence was awarded in 1991 and 13 years of non-execution of the sentence deserves the petitioner to seek remission of his sentence. Each days delay in the execution of the sentence has caused the petitioner a great deal of anxiety, anguish and agony, since the threat of death at any point of time was looming large on him, rendering him virtually a living corpse, the petition added.

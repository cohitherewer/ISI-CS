The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Catch, match amp; conch shell
 OUR BUREAU Small-screen actors Anushree Das, June Maliah, Bhaswar Chatterjee and Koneenica Banerjee could catch the action only in snatches, in between shooting at Santoshpur stadium. Their lunch break on Wednesday afternoon found them cheering Sourav and his men to victory. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 																								For once, it took Sachin Tendulkars safe hands, not his stroke play, to uncork celebrations in Calcutta. Even before Inzamam-ul-Haq (caught Sachin, bowled Murali Kartik) could lumber back to the dressing room across the Gaddafi Stadium greens, revelry had revved up on city streets.																								From crackers to conch shells, Tricolour to SMS, the tools of triumph were whipped out for a famous victory to be.																								First, the fluttering flags. The demand started picking up as the match progressed, said a man selling the Tricolour, priced at anything between Rs 5 and Rs 70, near the Bhowanipore Metro station well past 9 pm.																								I have a huge stock and I can meet the post-win demand, smiled the middle-aged man, waiting for a long night ahead.																								Then, the television. It was last day last show at Lahore and Calcutta couldnt afford to miss a moment of drama. 																								On Wednesday, hundreds of miles away from the on-pitch action, cricket proved to be the great leveller once again, as babus and businessmen, the young and the old, scrambled to grab a seat  or a foothold  in front of the nearest TV set. 																								Shops all but downed shutters and business establishments politely postponed customer service as the Behala boys men in blue took on the gang in green.																								Be it the Left-ruled Writers Buildings or the Trinamul Congress-dominated Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters, the scene was the same: the imposing structures were virtually empty.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee watched some portions of the match during the day between work. He then left Writers earlier than usual. Of course, India is going to win, said Bhattacharjee, before leaving. Haruk jituk, phone korbo (Whether we win or lose, I will call), added the chief minister, when asked whether he would be speaking to skipper Sourav Ganguly after the match.																								There was no mayor or deputy mayor in action at the civic body headquarters. Municipal commissioner Debashis Som, with a reputation for working late into the evenings, left office at 3.30 pm.																								Cricket fever caught up with the poll planners, too. Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee convened Wednesdays press conference earlier than usual, before retiring for a closed-door meeting with senior officials, the all-important TV set on mute.																								B.K. Agarwal, a city-based industrialist, had reason to feel even closer to the action than most. Agarwal, along with Exides S.B. Ganguly was in Lahore as part of the 42-member business delegation, for the earlier tie. 																								I cant think of a better experience in my life. I will never forget the reception and warmth we received in Pakistan, said Agarwal, admitting that he was missing being there at the Gaddafi on Wednesday evening. We were teasing the Pakistani supporters in the stands and they were so sporting, he recounted.

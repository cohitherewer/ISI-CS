Hair stylist Bridgette Jones gives model Devdutta a spiky hair makeover TRESS TALE: Devdutta before the makeover sessionGone are the days when one would spend hours in front of the mirror trying to achieve a Miss Universe hairdo before heading for a party. The no-fuss look is the thing of the moment with little attention to detail when it comes to styling hair. The focus, instead, has shifted to smart cuts and colours, with a dash of accessories thrown in, which makes elaborate styling quite unnecessary. The wash and go look is in right now, explains hair stylist Bridgette Jones of June Tomkyns, the salon on Ballygunge Circular Road. No one wants haircuts that would require time-consuming maintenance. As we cut and shape the hair, we add volume or colour to enhance the style and that suffices, she adds.Bridgette, however, advises different looks for the daytime and evening. While the day styles should be uncluttered, easy to manage without ornamentation or elaboration, for the evening she recommends more attractive hairdos which dont necessarily have to be practical. The hair expert gives model Devdutta a spiky hairstyle, which looks quite elaborate, yet is easy as a few twists and teases. She puts on the fashion scrunchy The occasionThe spiky hairdo is necessarily an evening style and is just perfect for a special occasion. It looks like something one might see on a ramp, which attracts the teenagers these days. Everyone wants to look and feel like a model. This particular hairdo has a lot of attitude that suits them very well, says Bridgette.The style goes best with dressy westerns.Must-havesI took into consideration Devduttas hair texture, quantity and quality while deciding on this particular look for her. Her hair is just ideal for this spiky style, observes the stylist, adding that hairstyles, after all, should be individual specific. We always asses the hair, face structure and overall appearance of a person before giving her a style. Because, not everything suits everybody. For instance, it would look ridiculous if a fat person flaunts dreadlocks, she adds. Shoulder length fine hair that is not too voluminous is perfect for the spiky hairdo. AccessoriesThe basic requirements are a fashion scrunchy and a strand of hair crystals. You can even opt for hair extensions instead of the crystals. The scrunchy should be elaborate and look like spiky hair of a different shade than your natural hair colour. Some Pearlised Shimmer hair gel, which has a pearl-like glow, is needed to complete the job. The final spiky lookTwist and twirlAttach the strand of crystals to the roots of a few hair strands with hair glue and let it dry for a couple of minutes. Then, brush the hair well and scoop it up with your hands as you would while tying a high ponytail. Tie it with the scrunchy and twist the ponytail so that the hair tips look spiky. Put the strands of the scrunchy between your own hair so it is all mixed up well. Apply the Pearlised Shimmer on the tips of the hair to define the look. Pull out a few strands from the sides and the front for the carefree effect. Keep the crystal strand dangling on one side.Its a simple style which needs a bit of lifting, teasing, pulling and directing with your fingers and hand to achieve a casual, soft and full look, signs off Bridgette.SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

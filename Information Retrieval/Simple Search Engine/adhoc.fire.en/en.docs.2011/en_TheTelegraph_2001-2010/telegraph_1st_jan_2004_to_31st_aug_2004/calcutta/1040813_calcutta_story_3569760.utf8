The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Headgear saviour of life and limb
 SIMI KAMBOJJuly 2, 2004: Feroz and Yasmeen Ahmed were returning home after dropping their daughter to school, when their motorcycle was hit by a speeding bus near the Park Circus crossing. Feroz died after being dragged by the bus for a while. Yasmeen, riding pillion, was thrown off the two-wheeler and died on way to hospital.The 28 year-old mother of two was not wearing a helmet.February 9, 2004: A. Sarkar was taking his 13-year-old son Arkaprabha to school when his scooter was hit by a car on Strand Road. Sarkar sustained minor injuries. Arkaprabha was thrown off the two-wheeler and died on the spot. Neither was wearing a helmet.																								Refusal to wear helmets has robbed two-wheeler riders in Calcutta of life and limb. Fifteen two-wheeler riders and five pillion-riders lost their lives in mishaps on city roads till August this year. Three were seriously injured. 																								Last year, 15 motorcyclists, five scooterists and 14 pillion-riders were killed, while 135 motorcyclists, 30 scooter-riders and 36 pillion-riders were injured.																								The year before saw 14 motorcyclists, five scooter-riders and eight pillion-riders die in accidents. The number of injured: 74 motorcyclists, 12 scooterists and 14 pillion -riders. Twenty-six people on two-wheelers and two pillion-riders died in mishaps in 2001. 																								In the face of a rising death count on city roads, police action seems to be strangely lax. 																								From 15,016 cases in 2001, cases for riding two-wheelers without helmets slumped to 10,746 in 2002 and 13,509 in 2003. Till June this year, 11,490 cases had been lodged.																								The police department seems unaware that it is mandatory for two-wheeler riders to wear helmets. Or the cops simply dont care about the rules. 																								This reporter, on a two-wheeler and without a helmet, got past traffic constables at three busy intersections on Thursday evening  BBD Bag, Esplanade-Lenin Sarani, and the five-point crossing at Park Circus.																								However, following a recent directive from the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH), the state government has woken up to the hazards of riding two-wheelers without helmets and has decided to crack down on the offenders. 																								Details of the enforcement strategy were drawn up at a meeting between the transport department and the traffic police on August 6.																								The directive from Alok Rawat, joint secretary, MORTH, says: Keeping in view the large number of road accidents involving riders of two-wheelers and judgments of various high courts regarding use of helmets, the states are urged to review the enforcement of the relevant provisions... and provide a feedback on the action taken. The response in the matter may please be expedited. 																								An earlier ministry missive had observed: Two-wheelers and pillion riders are some of the most vulnerable road users and account for a disproportionate percentage of deaths in road crashes.																								Most deaths, it had noted, are preventable if wearing of a protective helmet is enforced. The matter obviously cannot brook any delay in the context of the large and increasing population of two-wheelers on our roads. Inaction can only add to the already high number of deaths on this account. 																								The ministry has asked the West Bengal government to undertake a drive across the state to achieve total compliance on this count. 																								Riders and pillion-riders who dont wear helmets are liable to prosecution under Sections 128 and 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. They will be fined Rs 100 for the first offence, and Rs 300 for each subsequent offence.																								Calcutta seems to have been hooked on to the two-wheeler culture, with 400,000-plus two-wheelers plying on city roads daily. Statewide, the two-wheeler count is 2.35 million. Motorcycles seem to be the universal favourite, accounting for 80 per cent of the citys two-wheeler population. 																								Motorcycles also account for the highest percentage of accidents. The fatality rate, too, is the highest in case of motorcycle mishaps, warned Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic).

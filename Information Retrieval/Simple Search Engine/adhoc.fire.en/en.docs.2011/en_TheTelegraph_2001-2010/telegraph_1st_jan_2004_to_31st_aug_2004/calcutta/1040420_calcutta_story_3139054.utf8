The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Celluloid celebration
 															- FOCUS: EUROPEAN CINEMA NADINE MUKHERJEE				 	 A delegate of the European Commission at the Nandan festival																								I liked the tragi-comic look at family affairs This could also have happened in India, says Somnath, 30, emerging from the screening of Birthday by Richard Hobert from Sweden.																								Boundaries are being blurred by the universal language of artistic expression at Nandan. The occasion is the Calcutta leg of the 10th European Union Film Festival in India, which will see 15 films from 15 European countries being screened till April 21.																								Friday evening found Nandan director Ansu Sur hosting representatives from six European countries and a delegation from the European Commission in New Delhi. 																								I am happy that representatives from France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Cyprus, as well as diplomats from Italy and Germany based in Calcutta have made it to the festival, said Sur, urging everyone to have a good time during the festival days.																								The European Film Festival is a collaboration between the directorate of film festivals (government of India), the European Union State Mission and the Delegation of the European Commission in India. The Directorate of Film Festivals was set up in 1973 to arrange cultural exchange programmes, support Indias participation abroad and also organise international and national film festivals in the country.																								The European Coordination of Film Festivals is a network involving 210 European film festivals that responds to measures to support the participation of European works and professionals in film festivals organised in Third World countries. 																								The coordination aims to promote European cinema, improve circulation and raise public awareness.																								Having started in Delhi, the festival spread to Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta since 1992, but European Film Festival 2004 is being held in Delhis Siri Fort auditorium, Thiruvananthapurams Kalabhavan theatre and Calcuttas Nandan.																								At Nandan, there will be three shows daily  2.30 pm, 4.30 pm and 6.30 pm  with two screenings on the final the day (April 21). 																								The films have been picked by the European Commission, with all entries being sub-titled in English. The tickets  contrary to the programme brochure, that clearly states entry free  range from Rs 20 to Rs 30.																								On Sunday, Nandan officials confirmed that the 6.30 screenings were drawing in the crowds, but some were even braving the April sun to make it for the afternoon shows. 																								Among the films to look forward to are A Girl from Belgium and Blind Spot from Slovenia. The curtains come down with Open Hearts, from Denmark, on Wednesday.

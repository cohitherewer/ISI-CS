The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 16, 2004  Hooked to smoky flavours Puff: Lounging around at Sisha with the hookah 															Inhaling a cloud of Jasmine smoke. Thats the best way to start a footloose Friday evening. Change that to Double Apple if you are the sporty kind or Pina Colada if cocktails excite you. The flavour of the tobacco, as you will realise when at Sisha, the first hookah bar of the city, is not an issue. What matters is going through the sheer excitement of smoking from the ornate glass apparatus and counting the bubbles pop up in the belly of the sleek gear. And as the smoke hazes out the contours of the pretty face sitting beside you, you can feel the magic of the Arabian Nights taking over. After all, tobacco or sisha as its traditionally known, comes all the way from Egypt to this night haunt.																					But what captured the imagination of most, bogged down by the heat wave, was the coke hookah. Sultan tea, a heady concoction of citrus juices and dark rum was another option to cool off with. 																					Lounge music is yet another selling point (you can hear your own voice unlike in most other night clubs). Foreigners, young executives, all-woman groups, corporate bigwigs and college students make up the regular weekend crowd. 																					The king of lounge music Karunesh ruled the DJ console as relaxed souls reclined on the satin cushions all set for a long night ahead, with the smoke rings conjuring up various images. You could choose the one you wanted for the weekend. Cub culture: A TTIS rookie rocks the floor at Tantra												Chilled-out convocation																					Go out into the world and reach for the stars. That was the message for the 2004 graduating TTIS tigers team of Class XII pass-outs. Not that this bunch needed a push, or help, in that direction. Theyre young, hip and happening, and on Friday evening, they were partying to their hearts content in celebration of their new-found adulthood.																					though the coming-of-age party was meant just for the 118 young boys and girls leaving school, there were plenty of gate-crashing younger tiger  and cub  reporters, eager to grab a slice of the action. But the stars of the day were the ones saying goodbye. The farewell gifts for them were a TTIS tiger T-shirt  which many of them promptly donned  a watch and a TTIS flag.																					And they rocked for a full four hours, on and off the dance floor, at Tantra, at The Park, with some of them putting professional movers and shakers to shame. 																					If there was any proof on paper required for these cubs coming of age, here it is  the young adults have found a place in The Good Life, after graduating from Young Metro.Dancing dons																					Some were at the forefront, others were in the thick of things, some had the right moves and others just followed the music. But they all had one thing in common  plenty of energy and enthusiasm. A few, however, really shone in the spotlight. Like Akshay Jain, who had his attentive audience in shock and awe with his flawless execution of complicated floor moves.																					Avinash Gupta won on pure adrenaline points, with his non-stop jumping, kicking and hands in the air, and the tireless egging on of his friends to follow in his footsteps. There was attitude aplenty on the dance floor. In the thick of it all was Barry Brien.																					As for the little ladies, Sucheta Sahai won hands down, denim cap, bare feet and all. The moves matched the rhythm, and she could just as easily do a Mithun Chakraborty to either the beat of Disco Dancer or Shaggys Sexy Lady. The dancing duo of Madhumita Das and Stuti Agarwal had enough girl power to have the boys begging for a chance to match steps with them. Mr and Miss TTIS Inam and Sucheta. Pictures by Pabitra Das 												King amp; queen																					They oozed attitude and talent as the moment of reckoning arrived  the Mr and Miss TTIS contest. Girls powdered their noses and boys adjusted their hair as the floor was cleared. First up were the dudes, blowing kisses at the ladies and flaunting the stuff they were made of.																					The eight finalists then had to face a question round from Barry sir. Hail, Inam Hussain Mullick, spiked hair and talking talent. The aspiring JU English students reply to Ive heard JU girls are beautiful. What do you think? was Ive heard the girls carry their own pack of cigarettes, while the boys borrow from the darwan. Enough to win The Telegraph watch.																					The girls were a tad shy, but the competition was equally tough. Emerging victorious was Sucheta, with a 100 per cent on the confidence scale. Her impromptu impersonations of Jeetendra, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra and Hrithik Roshan moves and reply of Khayo, piyo aur masti karo to What next, after school? summed up the sentiments for the evening.												Soccer socialBhaichung Bhutia looked a happier man on Friday night. And why not. Childhood sweetheart Madhuri Tipnis is back in town after an assignment in Bangalore. The duo was spotted at Cloud 9 on a comeback date. But when it came to facing the cameras, friend and fellow footballer Rennedy Singh played ball as Madhuri fought shy.																					Party Pooper																					Bouncers were brought into play at Tantra this weekend. The stag in question was trying to make up for his partner, or the lack thereof, by sporting low-slung denim with G-string peeking out, Kaanta Laga style! Enough to get the minders all thorny.

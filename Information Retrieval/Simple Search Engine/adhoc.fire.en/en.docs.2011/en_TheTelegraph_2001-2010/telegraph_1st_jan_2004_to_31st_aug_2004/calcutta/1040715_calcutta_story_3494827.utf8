The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 15, 2004  Rain rage on ramp Model Ipshita showcases a hand-painted umbrella by Partha Pratim Deb at the Mentaid auction. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															The Hyatt Regency on Monday evening played host to a brigade of art enthusiasts and well-wishers of Mentaid, an NGO that serves mentally challenged people, at the first ever auction of umbrellas in the city. 																					Spearheaded by 25-year-old Prateek Raja of Gallery Kanishkas, the effort was as much to celebrate monsoon in style as to raise funds for the NGO. 																					The umbrellas  14 of them in all, painted by eminent artists like Shuvaprasanna, Sipra Bhattacharya, Laluprasad Shaw, Prakash Karmakar, Wasim Kapoor, Partha Pratim Deb, Partha Shaw, Samit Dey, Madhuboni Chatterjee, Subhashish Saha and Ashish Kirtania grossed a total of Rs 42,000 at the end of an hour-long auction. Two of the umbrellas were painted by children of Mentaid and were the first to be auctioned. 																					I did not think auctioning something like umbrellas was going to be easy, but the encouragement Ive received from both the artists and the buyers has been incredible, said Prateek, who after a recce of a large number of NGOs across the city zeroed in on Mentaid to help them raise money. A workshop held on June 16, where the umbrellas were painted, marked the beginning of the event which was titled Barsha. 																					If being at an auction of umbrellas was new, seeing Bikram Ghosh in yet another avatar  this time that of the auctioneer  wasnt. After a few of his usual anecdotes the anytime-anywhere man contained himself to announcing the names of the artist whose work was being showcased even as models walked around with umbrellas in hand. 																					Meera Kakkar and an unknown bidder picked up two pieces of art each, while Nandita and Dilip Raja of Gallery Kanishkas grabbed one piece each. Musician George Lindenmeyer picked up another, while Utpal Ganguly pitched for one. But it was one Mrs Chowdhury who bid for and picked up the first Mentaid umbrella for Rs 1,000. The highest bid on one single umbrella reached Rs 6,000.  Isha set the tone for an item girl talent hunt coming to the city soon. (Reuters) 												Bomb babe																					A gorgeous beauty swung to the wild beat of Ishq samundar dil de andar in a New York pub, matching steps with Sanjay Dutt; Kaante became a hit and Isha Koppikar became a household name. 																					Spurred by the success of the item number, director Sanjay Gupta plans to introduce a similar sizzling sequence in his forthcoming film Musafir, starring Sunjay Dutt, Sameera Reddy and Anil Kapoor. This time, however, the swinging slot beside Dutt is up for grabs and the chosen pair of legs to travel all the way to Mumbai may well be from our neighbourhood. A talent hunt, christened Item Bomb, is being launched across the country and Calcutta is one of the six selection stops. 																					We are coming to Calcutta in the third week of August after Dubai, London and Delhi (the two other cities are Mumbai and Bangalore), said Yogesh Radhakrishnan, business head, Zee Music. The contestants will be required to match steps with any of the 18 numbers from a compilation of item songs brought out by T-series. We have a lot of hope about Calcutta as the city has sent so many beautiful faces to Bollywood. Koena Mitra, for instance, is part of the films cast, he added. 																					Director Sanjay Gupta swears by the power of the item number. It is a key selling tool... Isha started off as an item girl. Look how she is getting the lead roles now. 																					Musafir heroine Sameera Reddy, a vibrant dancer herself, will be among the judges. We are looking for a girl who is comfortable in her skin. Dancing an item number is not about perfect moves but it is about exhibiting the power of being a woman, through body, mind and look, she sums up.

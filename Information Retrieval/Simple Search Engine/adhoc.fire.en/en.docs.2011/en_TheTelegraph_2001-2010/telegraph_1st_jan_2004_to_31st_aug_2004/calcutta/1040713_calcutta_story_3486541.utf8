The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 Clean is in for new stylebhais
Face of Fashion Kiran Uttam Ghosh Bhaichung Bhutia have metamorphosed into style icons Whats common to old cottage cheese, getting run over by buses and Brad Pitt? Some netizen has gone and likened them to the greatest turnoffs. With enough BO to inspire a suggestion they distribute nose plugs with tickets to his films, Brad Armpitt is the latest icon of the Total Turnoff, voted as the smelliest celeb. With due apologies to the man and his fans, for most, todays man is supposed to smell as neat as his manicured nails look. Its not a womans sole burden and responsibility any longer to pretty up our world. Were in it together. The point came home to me when I caught Sourav Ganguly on a recent flight and was bowled over by his new look. The bhaalo chheley who could have been my neighbours son, had morphed into a guy one would turn around to look at for the sheer presence he exudes. Maharaj has come a long way. Obviously, unkempt isnt cool any more. The unshaven chin is fine, but clean is in. The new slob can wear his hair uncombed, but not unwashed. Pity the Old Spice generation. Not because of the divine after-shave, which is an eternal classic, but because it was the only choice my dads generation had when they wanted to pamper themselves. Today, Michael Jackson can sport a bandhgala and chant ekam satyani inspired by Johnny Carson, the Beatles and Mike Love of the Beach Boys who went to town with the Nehru jacket. Makes me wonder how many of the lapel-free jackets did our first Prime Minister have? Could his collection have beaten the rumour that Sammy Davis Jr, claims to own over 200 Nehru jackets? The point here is, like women who love to do an Imelda Marcos with hundreds of pairs of something or the other in the wardrobe, the times have allowed men, too, to pamper themselves. And am I glad for that! Happy that more and more men I meet sport manicured hands and pedicured feet. And a wardrobe to match. Mens wear has always been interesting from three-piece to bandhgala, but the cutting edge difference today is that men have been taking more care of their appearance. They take professional help at salons, blow drying their hair or getting their mane snipped into the endearing Tintin puff that looks like they slept on their face. I grew up with the impression that it would only be a fop whod go to a parlour, and so, Im hopeful with this new man. This is quite the man about town and certainly not the jargon-fangled over-the-top metrosexual man. Clothes make a political statement, whether it is the Johnny-come-lately who sports nothing but his branded merchandise because hes not sure whether hes smart enough without it, or the erudite jholawala who wears his intellect on his khadi sleeve. Most intellectuals believe if they dress well, they stop being cerebral. For much the same reason, some people wont wear khaddar, since it would tie them up in the ideology of other people.Recently, a publication asked me to revisualise the wardrobes of some of our politicians. The first thought that struck me was most of them dress according to political conviction and theres little about them that I would like changed. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in spite of his Harvard education, looks perfectly in sync with himself in his spotless veshti. So does Bengals most prominent man in the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee. His dress sense on his first day as speaker was so politically suitable, I couldnt offer any suggestions that would suit him better. I would be doing an injustice to his stature if I did.Although weve come a long way appreciating our Indian style, some of it still comes from overseas. The metrosexual man happened here after it happened there. Its a sign of our insecurity that we cant be confident of our own style quotient. Our men have courted chic for centuries. Honestly, nothing beats the crisp starched fine cotton geelaid kurta and dhoti.Take Bengals nawabs. They were sultans of style. Although Sachin Pilots headgear is politically inherited rather than natural choice, its dashing. On the field, or rather, off it, Sourav Ganguly with his new haircut, Sachin Tendulkar and Bhaichung Bhutia have shaped up into dapper, dependable men.  Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav GangulyMumbai films have never been known for being very fashionable with Jeetendras white drain pipes, Govindas ga-ga wardrobe and Mithuns maatir maanush image. Till, Karan Johar gave his heroes a long, hard look. Farhan Akhtar went one further in Dil Chahta Hai, changing forever the way saleable Hindi film heroes were supposed to look on screen, with the image he gave goateed Aamir, slick Saif, and now Hrithik. Whats most interesting today is that men look comfortable being dressed up or sloppy but salon-cared and clean. But technology has played a major part in this transformation. Undoubtedly linen is a classic, but theres a zip in new age fabrics like sheer metallics, cottons, lycra mixes and what not, that work for menswear today. Im convinced old sayings make a lot of sense. Clothes certainly maketh a man.

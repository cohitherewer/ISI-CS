The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 Life - Passing Through				 Model run on small screen
 Aditi Govitrikar at the NIFT show. Picture by Pabitra DasHer face has launched many an ad campaign and her hour-glass figure has added to the appeal of many a design ensemble. So, when the hazel-eyed beauty walked the ramp at the ITC Sonar Bangla on Monday, draped in the creations of the students of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the shows oomph quotient rose like the summer Celsius.																								A doctor, a model, a mother and an actor  meet all-rounder Aditi Govitrikar. One of the top pirouetting beauties of the country, Aditi has recently made her foray into the world of television with her serial Kehna Hai Kuch Mujhko, on Sony TV.																								Talking about her small screen debut gets Aditi all excited. In Kehna Hai I play Ronit Roys girlfriend. The name of my character is Anuja and I portray a very possessive kind of a woman whose mind has been poisoned regarding the relationship between Ronit and Pallavi Joshi, she shoots off, faster than she runs the ramp.																								Ask her about her experience while shooting for her first serial, and she tells you that she is enjoying it thoroughly. I have only shot for two days till now and though it was very hectic, it was a lot of fun too. Ronit was very supportive, she gushes.																								But while she is set to scorch the small screen, the big screen has passed her by, ever since Soch and Dhund. Though I got some offers after Dhund, none of them were exciting enough. I will only do a film if I really like the role. And I dont mind a negative role either, asserts Aditi.																								Regional films (read: Tollywood) figure high on her wish list, it seems. My first movie was a Telugu one called Tamdu, which I did four years back. And now I would love to do a Bengali film; I find the language very sweet, smiles Aditi.																								And the language is not the only thing she finds sweet about the city, either.																								I love the (usual) mishti doi and the rosogolla and whenever I come to Calcutta I make it a point to carry these back with me. I also like the street food here, especially the phuchka. Koena (Mitra) had once taken me to Aaheli to taste Bengali food and I really liked the luchi, she recounts.																								Aditi has been coming down to Calcutta since 1997 and shes come here enough times to notice the improvement  and the lack of it. I find Calcutta much cleaner now and the pollution seems to have decreased a bit. But the traffic situation is the same, it hasnt improved much, is her take on the city.																								On the personal front, Aditi has one regret: I am constantly travelling and never get to spend enough time with my four-year-old daughter. But I guess she is getting used to my schedule as I have been working ever since she was three months old. 																								On the professional front, its just a matter of time before the doc in her takes over from the model and actor. I havent decided on when and how, but I know I will finally put my degree in medicine to use, she signs off.						SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

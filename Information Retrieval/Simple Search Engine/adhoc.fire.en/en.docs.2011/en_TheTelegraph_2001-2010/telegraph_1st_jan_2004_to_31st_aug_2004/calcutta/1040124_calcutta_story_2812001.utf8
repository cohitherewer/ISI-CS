				 Water tax order stayed

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER
																								A division bench of Calcutta High Court has passed an interim order on the judgment of Justice K.J. Sengupta of the same court, restraining the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) from collecting water development tax from citizens.
																								The stay was passed on Wednesday on a CMC appeal against the trial court order. The stay gives the civic body the authority to collect water development tax.
																								A group of south Calcutta residents had moved the court of Justice K.J. Sengupta, challenging the validity of the CMCs new tax. The judge directed the CMC not to levy the tax and also asked it to refund the money collected so far.
																								The CMC appeal to the division bench of the same court, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, said the tax had been imposed to develop the drainage system of the city as also to instal sewers in the added areas of Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach.
																								CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh explained that the tax collected so far would be used to repay loans obtained from the Asian Development Bank for the sewerage project. The bench fixed the matter for final hearing after two weeks.

	Parthenium shrubs are spreading at an alarming rate in Sarsuna satellite township. These dreaded plants are known to spark allergies and even cause asthma to those who often come in contact with them. Many residents of Salt Lake developed breathing problems in the Eighties because the area was heavily infested by parthenium shrubs. Can the civic authorities take necessary measures to destroy them in Sarsuna? 
	Pijush Banerjee, Sarsuna. 
	Most private nursing homes in the city are charging exorbitant fees for their services. They take advantage of the fact that most guardians would avoid admitting their wards in government hospitals, which are in a distressing condition. Moreover, it seems that qualified doctors, too, form a part of these rackets in the nursing homes. In such a situation, who will protect the rights of the common man? Will the human rights panel take measures before it is too late? 
	K.K. Roy Choudhury, Rabindrapally.

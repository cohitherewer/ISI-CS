 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Entry tickets forged, staff siphon off lakhs 
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								A government park is in the eye of a scam. The forest department has stumbled upon a racket in forged tickets at Banabitan, in Salt Lake. 																								An inquiry has been ordered and a showcause notice slapped on an employee. Some others involved in the racket have been identified and a large number of fake tickets recovered from the counter.																								We are determined to get to the bottom of the racket and net all the culprits, deputy conservator of forests Somnath Mukherjee said on Tuesday.																								Forest department officials were not sure but said the racket may have been operating for the past five years or so. 																								On a tip-off, officials started monitoring ticket sales over the past six months. We were surprised to find that daily sales dropped to Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 when about 5,000 people visit the park daily, said an official.																								The forest department introduced entry tickets at Banabitan about 10 years ago. Initially, the price was Rs 2. Now, it costs Rs 10. 																								Officials said a section of Group-D employees had printed forged tickets and sold them to visitors. The spoils were shared among themselves.																								The counters at Banabitan are controlled by these Group-D employees. It is not possible for visitors to identify the fake tickets, nor imagine that the forest department tickets could have been forged, said the official.																								We suspect that the employees inserted the fake tickets in a wad of genuine ones and sold them to a party of five or six. Perhaps they sold one genuine ticket for every five fakes, the official said. They must have cheated the government of lakhs.																								As soon as the scam was unearthed, the forest department installed computerised ticket-vending machines at Banabitan. 																								Our daily ticket sale has suddenly jumped to Rs 50,000 on an average, from a mere Rs 8,000. This indicates the amount of money the government has lost, said the official. 																								A report will be sent to forest minister Jogesh Barman immediately on his return from the districts, where he is attending a number of functions to mark Forest Week, beginning Wednesday. The weeklong string of programmes will end on July 20.

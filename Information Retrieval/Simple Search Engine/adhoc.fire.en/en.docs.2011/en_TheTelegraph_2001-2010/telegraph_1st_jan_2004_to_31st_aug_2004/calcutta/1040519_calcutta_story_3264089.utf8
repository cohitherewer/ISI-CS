The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Path to skip Park Circus traffic chaos
 A STAFF REPORTER																								South-bound vehicles coming from EM Bypass need not touch the four-point crossing at the terminal of the No 4 bridge to take Biresh Guha Street or Gariahat Road. Henceforth they can take a slip road after crossing the bridge. 																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Tuesday inaugurated the slip road off the No. 4 bridge near Park Circus. The Rs 50-lakh project has been implemented by CMDA.																								The minister said the road would ease traffic congestion at the four-point crossing. We had constructed the first slip road on VIP Road which the Salt Lake and EM Bypass-bound vehicles take to avoid the busy Ultadanga crossing, he said.																								Bhattacharya said construction of the Salt Lake bypass flyover would be completed by August and efforts were on to complete the Lake Gardens and Sonarpur flyovers within 2004. Newly-elected MP from Calcutta Northeast Mohammed Salim was present at the function but mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the chief guest, skipped the function.																								Chief executive officer of CMDA Alapan Bandopadhyay said the CMC would widen the four-point crossing at the terminal of No. 4 bridge. There is a building occupied by some traders at the crossing which will be demolished, he said.

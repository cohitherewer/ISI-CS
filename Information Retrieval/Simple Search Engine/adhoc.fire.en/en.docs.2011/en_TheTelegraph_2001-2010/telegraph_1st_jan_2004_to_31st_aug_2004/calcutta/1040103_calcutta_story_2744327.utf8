 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Serving humanity
																								We live in our cocoons, well-sheltered, or so we presume, as we move along in the jet-set age. We dont have time for anyone except ourselves. Till one day, when a bolt from the blue hits us and we scamper for shelter, but find none. Sounds like a Dooms Day prophecy? But very true except for the fact that we have messiahs like Om Vishnupad 108 Tridandi Swami Sri Srimat Bhakti Sravan Tirtha Goswami Maharaj, or Baba, among us who dedicate their lives to the service of humanity. A devout and learned Vaishnav, Baba has set up 21 ashrams throughout the country, including Niladri Health on Wheels, mobile medical units in Orissa and Delhi. Plans are afoot to set up similar multi-functional units in Mumbai and Calcutta equipped with a cost effective surgical system, a disaster reaction unit and tele-medicine facilities. Sri Gouranga Ashram hosts a music concert today and the proceeds from the show will be used for the mobile medical project in West Bengal. The show features renowned ghazal singers Bhupinder Singh and Mitalee Mukherjee along with percussionist-wizard Sivamani (picture on the left) and Govinda Bose in Music of the Drums.																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Science City main auditorium

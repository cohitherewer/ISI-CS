The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 08, 2004  Jewellery for the seasonSOMA BANERJEE Pinky shows off some of the Dia Gold creations. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															White gold and coloured stones are the look for the season, and the Dia Gold outlet at Metro Plaza unveiled a collection on Wednesday that clearly keeps this in mind.																					There is also a need to change jewellery designs to match the season and its accompanying mood, feels Varda Goenka, jewellery designer and owner, Dia Gold.																					When the curtains came up on the gleaming pieces set in a mix of white and yellow gold, semi-precious stones like citrine, blue, white and yellow topaz, tourmaline, peridot, aquamarine, garnet and amethyst caught the eye.																					Ruby, emerald, sapphire, black, champagne and pink diamonds were set in 18-carat white and yellow gold for necklaces and earring sets.																					e prices begin at Rs 2,000 for a pendant, the upward limit is sky-high, concedes Varda. There are a handful of jewellery watches studded with coloured diamonds, the chandelier earrings priced at Rs 20,000 onwards and the mesh collection using woven gold stand out. Creations like a white gold scarf necklace and a broad cuff bracelet are also expected to be a hit with young women.																					And though platinum is the loudest (and most expensive) statement in style you can make, white gold, heavier than silver yet more malleable than platinum, is the next best thing.																					The Colour of Summer festival is on from April 9 to 16.

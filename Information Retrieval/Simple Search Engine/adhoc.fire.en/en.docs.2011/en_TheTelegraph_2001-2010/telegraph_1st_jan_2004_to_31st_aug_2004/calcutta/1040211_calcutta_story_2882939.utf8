 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Drain-check plan in Salt Lake
 																											- Expert body to offer disposal tips, spread awareness on plastic ban A STAFF REPORTER 																								A three-member technical committee will be formed in Salt Lake to prepare a report on the drainage and sewerage system of the township.																								State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the decision to set up the committee was taken during a meeting on Tuesday with councillors of Bidhannagar Municipality.																								We will form the committee with people from the engineering discipline. They will study the solid waste management in a bid to improve the drainage and sewerage system of Salt Lake, said Bhattacharya. The committee will recommend measures, which will then be adopted by the municipality.																								According to the minister, Rs 4 crore and 22 lakh had been sanctioned to improve solid waste management in the township. An awareness programme will be taken up to improve the collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste, he added.																								Sources said technical staff from the urban development department, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Bidhannagar Municipality would make up the committee.																								The sewerage system of the township is in poor shape and steps have to be taken before the monsoon. The connecting lines of the main sewerage pumping station in Sector III with the Bagjola treatment plant are almost choked.																								The lines, which pass under the Keshtopur canal and VIP Road, are all but jammed, said an official of Bidhannagar Municipality.																								The connecting lines between the sewerage channels of the three sectors with the main pumping stations were almost choked. If immediate measures are not taken, the sewerage system will collapse, warned the official.																								Now, its a race against the clock. The committee will be formed soon but it will take some time to prepare the report, as a detailed study will be required, admitted a senior official. Till then, we will step up the awareness drive, so that things start improving, he added.																								According to officials, the awareness drive on solid waste management would include alerting people about the plastic ban in the township. Although the use of plastic has been officially banned in Salt Lake, its use has hardly waned, officials pointed out.																								During the Bidhannagar fair, plastic packets were all over the place. We received several complaints and the only way out is to raise public awareness against the bags and ensure that the ban order in implemented, said CPM councillor Chandan Ghosh.

Baisakh Bash The thala at Kewpies and (below) Patisapta at Caf Coffee Day. Pictures by Rashbehari Das lIf granny is not at hand and mommy (or the happening daddy) is too busy to slog it out at the stove this Poila Baisakh, you will still have the chance to celebrate. The Bengali New Year enthu has infected all, and city eateries have gone hog wild with special menus for the season. Here are a few of the flavours to expectEver since Kewpies opened around five years ago, it has become synonymous with authentic, reliable Bengali fare. This years feast promises to serve more of the same, between April 13 and 18. The homely Elgin Lane restaurant offers a wide choice of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Delicacies such as Elish Paturi Boneless, Chitol Petir Jhal, Chingri Cutlet Curry, Galda Chingrir Muro Bhaja, Mangshor Tehari, Murgi Posto, Duck Vindaloo, Goan Crab Curry, Smoked Hilsa, Chicken Jahanara, Kopi Badshahi, Motorshutir Dhoka, Dal Chhechki (a dry dish with dal cooked in a variety of spices) and Rosogollar Kalia (no, its not sweet!) are the new names to be tried out.Innovative items to cater to the large vegetarian clientele are also being concocted, such as Kach Kolar Cutlet, Dab Jhinge and Enchorer Korma. We even cook some dishes without any onion or garlic, says Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies, whose long list of regulars boasts veggie names such as Sanjiv Goenka, who freaks out on Kach Kolar Cutlet.There are two lunch slots  from 12 noon to 1.45 pm and 2 pm to 3.30 pm. Dinner will be served between 7 pm and 11.30 pm. The fare has been divided into three kinds of thalas  Non Vegetarian Mahabhoj (Rs 350), Vegetarian Mahabhoj (Rs 280) and Nobo Borsho Special (Rs 255). There will be an a la carte spread on offer as well.The Bangali bug seems to have bitten a more unlikely F amp;B outlet as well  Caf Coffee Day. Malpoa and Patisapta will be available at its city outlets till April 16. There is nothing to beat homemade Malpoa and Patisapta when it comes to Bengali sweets, feels Anubhav Puri, marketing head, Caf Coffee Day, eastern India.With fewer people having the time to cook these specialities at home, the yuppy coffee hangout is looking to lure all kinds of clientele  from the young men of the house (the promotion is called Naboborsher Jamai Ador) to housewives, as well as the college regulars.The sweet fest kicked off on Tuesday at the New Alipore outlet of the coffee chain with a cookery demonstration by Madhusree Mukherjee, who stirred up Potoler Dorma, while folk singer Nondon Khanna and Cactus guitarist Sanjay enlivened the atmosphere with renditions of folk numbers based on the Bengali palate. Though the aim was to boost the young brand image  a lot can happen over coffee  most customers preferred to sit outside and have their Caf Frapps in the heat of the afternoon.If star hotels are more your scene, all of them have something lined up for the foodie.Saffron at The Park has a Bengali promotion running from April 12, on till April 18. We have a combination of dishes from East Bengal as well as this side of the border, explains F amp;B manager Anirban Simlai. From Bhetki Paturi to Bhapa Elish, Kacha Aamer Dal to Karaisuti Diye Dhokar Dalna, the Bangla bhoj takes in a bunch of favourites.At the HHIs Poolside Caf, a buffet dinner can be had only on April 14, where performances from Bangla band Cactus and Dona Ganguly and her dance troupe are top draws. The food goes with the theme. Dab Chingri, Bhapa Elish (boneless), Bhetki Maachher Paturi, Bikramouri Mochar Ghanto, Chhanar Dalna, Kochu Bata. Cough up a cover charge of Rs 1,000 per couple for the whole deal.At the Palm Court, a buffet lunch and dinner have been on since April 12, continuing till April 15. Bengali dcor, down to a kula menu and dhoti-punjabi clad waiters, has jazzed up the look. Start off with Aam Porar Sharbat and go on to Topse Maach Bhaja, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Shukto, Phulkopir Rasa, Luchi, Amsattar Chutney, Kheer Malpoa and more for Rs 400. Keep watching for more New Year morsels...

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Rate war over hospital waste
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Two-and-a-half weeks ago, the government made it mandatory for hospitals to ensure that the bio-medical waste generated by them is suitably treated and disposed of. A raging dispute has since erupted between the citys private hospitals and the waste-management company assigned to ensure proper disposal.																								The state Pollution Control Board (PCB) and the government made it mandatory for hospitals to treat bio-medical waste in a scientific manner inside a concealed plant and set April 1 as the day to kick off the project. However, the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI)  a conglomerate of private hospitals in the city finds the terms set by the Hyderabad-based company unacceptable.																								Its rate of Rs 2.70 per 250 g of bio-medical waste is too high. Other conditions, too, are illogical. We have asked them to sort out the issue across the table, said AHEI president Sajal Dutta.																								Following a PCB stricture, the state decided that each hospital, both private and government, would need to take special measures to get rid of their bio-medical waste. 																								So, the private company, which has set up a special plant in north Howrah, started taking the waste from the hospitals.																								Earlier, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would collect the waste. But since it was not adhering to WHO-prescribed norms, the government decided to rope in a professional body. 																								According to health department estimates, there are approximately 20,000 hospital beds in the city, of which 13,000 are in the government sector.																								Trouble broke out after the company specified that each hospital must pay Rs 2.70 per 250 g of bio-medical waste for each bed in the hospital and not a rate based on occupancy, as sought by the hospitals. The company also made it clear that the containers used by the hospitals were sub-standard and they would have to use a special polythene bag, which only it would supply.																								Both terms are unacceptable. Why should we pay for beds that are not occupied? Second, it does not make sense to buy the special bags from them only. We must be allowed to deal directly with the manufacturers, Dutta pointed out.																								A spokesman for Medicare, the waste-management firm, said all terms and conditions were agreed to by the hospitals. Why complain now? Moreover, the PCB rule is clear about waste management, but it doesnt specify that the hospitals cant do it themselves, he added.																								The AHEI has asked the company to sit at the talks table. Lets see how the talks unfold. Thatll guide our course of action, said Dutta.

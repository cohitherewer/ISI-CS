Feb. 2004: 26,714 Calcutta Telephones promise of a lakh new CellOne connections by March 2004 has failed to ring in a revolution.																								Last year, confronted with allegations that a deliberate go-slow was taking its toll on CellOne, the BSNL brass had promised that things would improve by March 2004.																								March has come  and almost gone  but the number of CellOne connections is stuck at a little over 25,000.																								The authorities had also promised to set up 72 base transmission stations (BST) in and around the city to improve connectivity, but the project is yet to be taken up.																								CalTel officials said the delay was mainly due to technical reasons. The equipment is necessary to set up the infrastructure for increasing connections, said S.K. Bhaduri, CalTel general manager (customer services). We expect to start providing new connections from April. 																								Asked why the deadline had not been met, Bhaduri said: Installation of machines and the technical work involved was huge and complicated.																								BSNL sources said the waiting list of customers keen to sign up with CellOne is growing by the day. There are more than two lakh customers waiting for CellOne connections, revealed a CalTel official.																								The CellOne service was commissioned in Calcutta on October 30, 2003 after a host of hitches. The debut date was deferred several times, but officials went ahead and announced an annual target of 100,000 connections.																								 But all such promises have failed, causing frustration among a large number of customers, said T.S. Srinivasan, secretary, Telephone Services Society (TSS). After waiting endlessly, several customers are now approaching private operators, who give them connections instantly, he added.																								Sources said the CalTel authorities are saddled with shortage of towers, insufficient radio connectivity and large numbers of roaming subscribers creating congestion in the existing traffic. It is, apparently, in no position to increase its customer base due to inadequate infrastructure.																								Allegations of irregularities over appointing distributors have surfaced again. Handling of the second phase of prepaid Excel CellOne by the authorities is quite poor, said Srinivasan, adding that the much-hyped Excel prepaid service had failed to take off due to various irregularities.																								The appointment of distributors was made as per rules and there was no irregularity, said a senior CalTel official.

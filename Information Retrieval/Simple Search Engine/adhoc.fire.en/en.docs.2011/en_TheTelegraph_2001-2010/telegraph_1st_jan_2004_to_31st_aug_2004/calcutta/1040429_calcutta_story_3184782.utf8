The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Cellphones for 1,000 officers
 							 - Police poll preparedness A STAFF REPORTER																								For the first time, Calcutta Police will provide cellphones to more than 1,000 officers on election duty to facilitate swift communication.																								According to deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh, officers in charge of the 750 polling stations and those in charge of the 200 cluster mobile squads will be given cellphones, provided by a private telecom company, to avert any untoward incident during the elections. 																								We cannot depend solely on our wireless sets. The network may get jammed during the peak hours of polling. So, we have decided to distribute cellphones among our officers, Singh said.																								Senior officers, of the rank of deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner, will get a cellphone each, in addition to the ones they already have, so that other officers, at the inspectors and sub-inspectors level, can get in touch with them swiftly in case of emergency, Singh added.																								The police control room at Lalbazar will be provided with five additional, toll-free landlines and a few mobile phones, too. In addition to the existing lines (eight parallel lines and three direct numbers), the Lalbazar control room will get five more telephones and cellphones. The numbers will be published in all the leading dailies, so that people can report any incident that may take place, the deputy commissioner explained.																								Six companies of central para-military forces will arrive to reinforce the 15,000-strong city police. The central force personnel arrive in the city on the evening of May 7, after the elections are complete in Bihar. We may get some additional central forces, but we cannot say for sure at this moment. We will be informed about that only on May 5.																								The para-military forces will be deployed at sensitive points across the city and also at the strongrooms, where the electronic voting machines (EVMs) are kept. 																								Any polling station that houses more than two booths is considered sensitive and armed police will be deployed there. Apart from that, we will withdraw police personnel who are on special duty at consulates and private premises for law-and-order duty on the day of polling, the deputy commissioner signed off.

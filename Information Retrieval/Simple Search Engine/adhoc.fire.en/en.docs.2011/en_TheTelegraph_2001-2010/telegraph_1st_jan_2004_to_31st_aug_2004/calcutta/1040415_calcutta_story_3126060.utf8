The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Justice tardy, token tourney
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR				 	 Rajnis Patel: In memoriam June 2, 2003. Rajnis Patel, a budding cricketer from Bhowanipore, who spent long hours practising at Vivekananda Park, falls victim to medical negligence at SSKM Hospital following an on-field injury. April 15, 2004: Manoj Patel, bereaved father of Rajnis, inaugurates the Rajnis Patel Memorial Cricket Tournament at Vivekananda Park.																								A tournament dedicated to his son, who died at 17, is little consolation for Patel, who has been desperately banging on the chief ministers doors for justice.																								A cricket tournament is a good gesture, but what about justice? A senior doctor who was in charge of my sons treatment has been suspended, but he continues to flourish with his private practice. And the post-graduate trainees and others who turned my son into a guinea-pig are roaming scot-free, lamented Patel.																								Rajnis had died after languishing in the orthopaedic ward of SSKM for three months, during which five failed surgeries were conducted  mostly by post-graduate trainees, while senior doctors, including orthopaedic surgeon Dilip Majumder, stayed away.																								At the request of organisers Bulans Cricket Academy, Patel will turn up at the park on Southern Avenue around 9.30 am for the inauguration. The organising committee for the tournament has a number of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) officials.																								Former India great Erapalli Prasanna, along with former Bengal Ranji captain Sambaran Banerjee, will be present to inaugurate the 18-day event, along with Rajnis father.																								They have told me that a tournament of such magnitude, which will see the likes of Arun Lal and Sourav Ganguly turning up on the final day, will be a fitting tribute to Rajnis. I am thankful to everybody for this, but what we really want is justice from the government, which it has not been able to give us, said Patel.																								Vivekananda Park will be paying a token sporting tribute to Rajnis, but precious little seems be happening on the other fronts. The date of the first hearing by the West Bengal Medical Council has not yet been fixed, complained Patel.																								And the chief ministers office, after promising Rajnis jobless father compensation, has done nothing. His confidential secretary and other officials said we would get compensation soon, but nothing seems to be moving. So, we have decided to send a legal notice first and then take appropriate steps, warned Patel.

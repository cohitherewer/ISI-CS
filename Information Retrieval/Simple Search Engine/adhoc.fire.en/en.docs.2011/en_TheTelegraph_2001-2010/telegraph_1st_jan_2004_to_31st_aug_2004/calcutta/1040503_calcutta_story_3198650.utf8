 															- Always wanted to do my thumg, says Charlies Angel A STAFF REPORTER				 	 GENES AND SKULLS: Kiera Chaplin on the sets of Yatna on Sunday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Cool is how she describes spotting a theatre called Chaplin in the middle of a market in a city shes never been to before.																								Cool is how she finds dogs and cows being allowed to roam free and do their own thing in a country shes never visited before.																								Cool is how one must define Kiera Chaplin.																								How else would you explain the 21-year-old granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin  and great-granddaughter of Eugene ONeil  dividing her days between modelling, acting and bringing underground films to the surface in LA, starting up an electro-rock band in London, and sweating it out in a cramped north Calcutta bookstore?																								I have always wanted to do my own thing and to be involved in various forms of creativity. I loved the screenplay of Yatna, and so, here I am, says the blonde, explaining her presence in a city shes heard is great fun and crazy, to star in Rajshree Ojhas debut feature film.																								Kiera, says Rajshree (the 29-year-old Calcutta girl who won acclaim and awards for her 25-minute film Badger), plays young French missionary Laia who comes looking for life and falls in love with an older man, a Bengali doctor (Victor Banerjee) who is married (to Rupa Ganguly). Its five Nirmal Verma stories rolled into one, explains Rajshree, giving diverse yet unified glimpses of life in three cities (Calcutta, Kochi and Mumbai).																								Its a beautifully crafted, impossible love story, says Kiera, somewhat solemnly. And it gave me a great excuse to come to India, which Ive always wanted to.																								India finds a special, if somewhat strange, place in the family of the daughter of Charlie Chaplin and Oona ONeils fifth child, Eugene. My mother (Bernadette) has never been to India, but she is so fascinated by this country that she has named my youngest sister India, she reveals. She is only one-and-a-half years old now, so Im sure shell come here some day.																								For now, the elder sibling, who first became aware of her famous genes from the bookshelves full of Eugene ONeils works and the history books in school with so much about Charlie Chaplin, is most excited about spending close to two weeks in India.																								The Chaplin streak of creative overdrive has found her blazing a fashion trail (the Pirelli calendar to Vogue and Vanity Fair); dabbling in films (The Importance of Being Earnest to Aimee McPherson Story); singing and producing music (forming a band with her 16-year-old brother to giving new talent a stage); backing film-makers who do not want to walk the usual Hollywood talk (under Limelight Films, of course); diving in to animal causes and more.																								Being part of the Chaplin family, I guess there is no escaping the creativity, smiles Kiera.																								And, maybe, the cool craziness that comes with it. Fiddling with her skull-shaped ring  with skull tattoos to match on her left arm, for skulls symbolise that we are all the same  Kiera recounts the storm she had raised in the fashion world with a nipple ring. It shocked everybody, but it was so cool, Im glad I did it. After all, you only live once, she laughs.

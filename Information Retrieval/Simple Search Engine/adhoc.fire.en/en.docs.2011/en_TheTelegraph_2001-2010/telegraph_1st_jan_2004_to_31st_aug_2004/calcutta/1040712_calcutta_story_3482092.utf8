 															- SALT LAKE TAKES TO RAINWATER A STAFF REPORTER 																								After the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Salt Lake municipality will be the second civic body to make rainwater harvesting a must for its residents. The civic body, which constructed the first rainwater reservoir in the township as part of a pilot project, now plans to make it mandatory for residents to include similar reservoirs in their building plans.																								According to civic officials, there have been several inquiries from residents for setting up rainwater reservoirs. However, the municipal authorities are yet to allow construction of rainwater tanks, as it will have to be formalised at a board meeting. 																								We will place it as an agenda in a future board meeting and soon, the rule is expected to be implemented, Dilip Gupta, chairman of the Bidhannagar Municipality, said on Sunday. Initially, multi-storied buildings will be asked to build rainwater reservoirs, Gupta said. 																								The municipality, which has a 12,000-litre rainwater reservoir at its office, Poura Bhavan, has started using the water after it was filled up this monsoon. Collected from the roof of the building and stored in the tank on the ground, it is used for gardening, said D.K. Gupta, chief engineer, public health engineering, of Bidhannagar Municipality. The municipality has constructed the reservoir with the help of the state Pollution Control Board (PCB). 																								Officials said they had studied the rainwater harvesting system in Chennai and were planning to use it as a model. PCB officials said they would provide technical knowhow to residents to set up reservoirs. A water tank, filter and a pipeline will serve the purpose, a PCB official said. 																								Municipality officials said once implemented, the scheme will help ease the townships water crisis. More than seven million gallons of water is required per day in Salt Lake. 																								The municipality has to buy 3.5 million gallons per day of surface water from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authoritys Palta waterworks, at the rate of Rs 3 per thousand litres. 																								In addition, the municipality, with its 15 water reservoirs and three booster pumping stations, draws another 3.5 million gallons a day of water from the underground through deep tubewells. This is treated by the iron treatment plants. The total cost of supplying water to houses comes to Rs 4 per thousand litres, which is very high, an official said. 																								At least 30 per cent of the supplied water can be saved through harvesting, he added.

																																																																																		The transport department has issued a deadline to two-wheeler owners asking them to pay the lifetime tax by June 30, failing which they would have to pay a penalty. Copies of the order were faxed to all taxing authorities earlier this week. The state government announced its decision to impose the lifetime tax as a means of augmenting its revenue last September. The move was challenged by two-wheeler owners in Calcutta High Court, where a single bench had set aside the government notification, declaring it ultra vires. Later, when the government moved the division bench against the order, the court stayed the single-bench ruling, which allows the government to collect tax, but not the penalty until the matter remains in court. The matter will come up for hearing on June 10. 																																																		The body of an unidentified man, about 45 years of age, was discovered in a lorry at Loha Math in the South Port police station area, at around 7 am on Friday. The lorry, owned by Kiran Pal Singh, was parked there for repairs for the past 10 days, police said. A mechanic working on the lorry on Friday morning discovered blood dripping from the undercarriage and then found the naked body lying inside the lorry. The body bore no external injury marks. So it is possible that he was not murdered, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh said. The body will be sent for post-mortem on Wednesday to ascertain the cause of death. 																																																		Mohd. Firoze, 30, was found dead in a pond at Birds Jute Complex, near Dakshindari in Lake Town, on Friday. Police said Firoze entered the complex on Wednesday night with two accomplices to commit a burglary. The guards, however, detected them and gave chase. While the other two escaped, Firoze fell into the pond in his haste to get away and drowned. Firozes family members lodged a missing persons diary at Lake Town police station on Thursday. The body has been sent for post-mortem.																																																		Ten persons, including several children, were injured as a private bus overturned at Bagnan, Howrah, on Friday morning. Police said the bus, which was on its way to Bakshi, fell into a roadside ditch. The passengers were rescued by local residents and admitted to Uluberia State General Hospital. Two of them are stated to be in critical condition. 																																																		Activists of Paschim Banga Bigyan Mancha on Friday demonstrated in front of a pond in Barasat on the northern outskirts of the city to scotch the rumour that the water of the pond had a medicinal effect and brought good luck for people who drank it. Members of the science forum, after conducting a test on the water of the pond, said it was not fit for consumption. 																																																		A seminar on the role of Sri Annada Thakur, the founder of Dakshineswar Ramkrishna Sangha, Adyapith, will be held on Sunday. Authors Mahasveta Devi and Sanjib Chattopadhyay will participate among others.To Milli Mission of Bengal for organising a survey of drinking water resources and cleaning water bodies in the run-up to Environment Day

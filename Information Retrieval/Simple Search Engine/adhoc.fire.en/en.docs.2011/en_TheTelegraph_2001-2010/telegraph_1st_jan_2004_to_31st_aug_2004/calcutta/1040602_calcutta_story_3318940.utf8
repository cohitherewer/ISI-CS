 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 Medicare despair in the dark
What kind of a safety net is there for a Calcuttan faced with an emergency in the dead of the night, when access to money is restricted, when a government hospital is the last place you want to go to and when the clock is ticking away? A very unsafe one, as Bappa Majumdar and Sanjay Mandal found out when they tried to secure a bed for an emergency patient one night last week A string of major private hospitals in the city were approached on the night of May 26-27, with the following plea of admission:A certain Mr A.C. Roy, 65, was having severe chest pain and convulsions after suffering a bump on the head earlier during the day. He needed immediate admission and so could a bed please be arranged? The patient had no money in hand till the next morning, but this was an emergency.The individual responses  hardly heartening, apart from a few exceptions  are listed here. Those who quoted the highest admission fee are clubbed together in the graphic.

 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Cops scan cahoots claim
 OUR BUREAU																								A day after goons spilled the beans on the police-criminal nexus, the state home (police) department has asked the district authorities to carry out a thorough probe into the matter.																								Ashok Shaw, arrested by officers of Golabari police station, was grilled on Thursday and he told interrogators that an IPS officer was in cahoots with the gangster accused of supplying arms to criminals in Howrah. 																								Shaw claimed that recently, the IPS officer had supplied four danas (bullets) to this don. 																								Deben Biswas, inspector-general (South Bengal), said police officers have to know criminals if they need to build sources within the underworld. It seems that in this case, something similar could have happened. I believe that the IPS officer named by the criminals apparently has a clean record.																								Police are probing the cop-criminal nexus in Howrah, involving Ashok Shaw and Ashok Mahato. After identifying the criminals from the police records, a senior officer of the state police has said a team will be deployed to net the culprits.																								Inquiries have revealed that the don, who is behind a lot of criminal activity in Howrah, is moving scot-free. He has been on the wanted list of the district police for several years and he was the main link in the arms supply chain to criminals. 																								It is strange that such a person is roaming scot-free, while our seniors talk about integrity and honesty, a Howrah police officer connected with this case observed. This criminal of north Howrah has allegedly survived so long owing to the blessings of some senior police officers, including those of IPS rank. 																								A retired police officer said: He easily strikes a rapport with policemen of higher ranks. So, he has survived. It is a give-and-take process. The police want him in several cases, like raiding railway wagons, extortion and operating satta. 																								The Bantra police once arrested him in 1998 on a charge of smuggling motorcycles out of Bengal. Now, he is a political tool.

				 20 couples rounded up in resort raid

 A STAFF REPORTER 
																								Couples looking for an out-of-the-way rendezvous, watch out. The police are eyeing a crackdown on privately-owned resorts that have turned into hubs of vice. One such raid on a resort in Bishnupur, on the southern tip of the city, started around 11 pm on Thursday and continued well into the dawn of Friday.
																								Twenty couples, between 18 and 45 years of age, were rounded up. Police said most of them were college students from south Calcutta, and were booked under the Immoral Trafficking Act. They were produced in the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrates court on Friday.
																								Additional superintendent of police (industrial) R.K. Singh said the force had information about rampant immoral activities at the resort that was raided. We acted on a specific tip-off this time, he said, adding that further raids on resorts are in the offing. Most of these resorts do not have proper licences for selling liquor, but alcohol is served to customers. We are monitoring the activities of more than a dozen resorts on Diamond Harbour Road, he said.
																								Resorts within the city limits and on the fringes have always drawn flak from activists, residents of the neighbourhood and the police. The reason: they are rarely visited by the local people. 
																								In an effort to boost business, the resorts give their customers a special privacy, ensuring that their identities stay concealed. So, the resorts become havens for all sorts of shady activities.
																								On behalf of an anti-resort movement, leader Abdur Rob said: Weve had a movement against resorts for a long time. We have organised several public meetings and processions in the past to register our objection to the immoral activities taking place in them. Social activist Medha Patkar had also joined one of our rallies. The resorts are a threat to the healthy environment of the neighbourhood in which they are located.
																								Rob alleged that the police were hand-in-glove with the resort managements. We tip off police about what goes on in the resorts, but they hardly ever act. The cops make a neat sum from the resorts. Once in a while, they raid a resort and catch customers, but the owners get away. Unless action is taken against the people running the resorts, the problem will persist, he added.

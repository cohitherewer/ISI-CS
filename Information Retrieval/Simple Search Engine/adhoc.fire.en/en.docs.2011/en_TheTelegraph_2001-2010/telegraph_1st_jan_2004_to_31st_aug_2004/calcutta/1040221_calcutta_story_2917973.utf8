 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Court comfort for enterprise
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta High Court has stepped in to cut through the maze of red tape and dated rules that threaten to stall a rare example of private enterprise in Bengal.																								Justice Shubhrakamal Mukherjee, in an interim order, has allowed a firm set up by three unemployed youths from Bengal to market their vitamin-enriched water, over-riding the red light from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).																								In 2001, S.K. Saha, Dwaipayan De and Subir Pal came to know of a research project, undertaken by Jadavpur Universitys pharmaceutical technology department, to supplement the nutritional value of water with vitamins. They got in touch with the university, following it up with an MoU.																								It was decided that their firm, Vita Pharmaceutical Industries, would manufacture the product  using ordinary packaged water bought from another BIS-approved firm  and the university would set up a committee to provide technical knowhow and oversee the quality of the product.																								That was what the three were doing till December 2003, when their supplier of ordinary packaged water was asked by BIS not to manufacture and package vitaminised drinking water under brand name Aqua-Vita. With the supply blocked, production came to a grinding halt, prompting the makers of Aqua-Vita to seek the courts help, said their counsel N.R. Mukerje.																								He told the court that the trio had approached BIS for its certification prior to commercial production in 2002, only to be told that there was no Indian standard for vitaminised drinking water.Then why should its manufacture, using BIS-approved water, be blocked? asked the petition filed by Saha, De and Pal. 																								The petition filed also mentioned that the government had granted it a health and a food licence. Regular tests conducted by the university and independent laboratories have shown that the product does not violate any Prevention of Food Adulteration Act norms, it added.																								All three youths were unemployed when they had set out, the petition said. We told the court that theirs is an example of a combination of enthusiasm and entrepreneurship, something very rare in Bengal now, Mukerje added. BIS counsel Anupam K. Chatterjee, however, said: BIS has no control over any product that does not use its certificate and has no wish to be seen as stifling industry and initiative.																								The interim order by Justice Mukherjee allowed normal production of Aqua-Vita till the case was resolved. And their suppliers of ordinary packaged water were their agents, he added, implying they could go on taking their supply from the same firm.

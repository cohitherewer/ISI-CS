 DEEPANKAR GANGULY Residence of Sister Nivedita: Restoration hope. Pictures by Amit Datta 																								Thanks to the mayors candidature in the Lok Sabha polls, the civic authorities have taken up a scheme to restore the remaining eight of the 12 historic buildings related to Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Ma and Sister Nivedita in the Bagbazar area centred round Balaram Mandir  the birth place of Ramakrishna Mission. The estimated cost for their facelift will be Rs 60 lakh.																								The area belongs to the Northwest parliamentary seat from where mayor Subrata Mukherjee is contesting for an MPs seat for the first time.																								The eight buildings are the residences of Sri Ramakrishnas disciples Chunilal Bose and Sarat Sarkar on Ramakanta Bose Street, residences of Sister Nivedita, Kalinath Bose and Baikuntha Nath Sanyal on Bosepara Lane, residence of Kiran Chandra Datta on Lakshmi Dutta Lane, residence of Yogin Ma on Bagbazar Street and residence of Nanda Lal Bose and Pasupati Bose. 																								Mukherjee came across the buildings in course of an election campaign and offered to take care of the remnants of the heritage of the Ramakrishna movement which have survived a century of neglect.																								Mukherjee visited the eight buildings last week and felt that civic authorities should do something to save those structures from their natural decay as the present descendants living in them could not afford to maintain them. But he expressed his inability to take immediate action due to the Election Commissions directive. 																								The mayor also wanted to know from municipal commissioner Debashis Som why the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had remained indifferent to the preservation of the buildings. I asked the municipal architect and town planner department in December to prepare a report on the condition of the listed buildings in north Calcutta, said Som.																								Later, the chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma was directed to submit a status report on the buildings surrounding Balaram Mandir in three days. The report was submitted on Friday.																								The report focussed on a cluster of 14 buildings which Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Ma would visit and stay in. Of the 14 structures, four  residential buildings of Swami Turiananda, Bhagyadhar Mullick, Girish Chandra Ghosh and the school building of Sister Nivedita  were demolished during the construction of Chittaranjan Avenue.																								Balaram Mandir is named after Balaram Basu, one of the principal disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Vivekananda inaugurated Ramakrishna Mission Association from this building in 1897 and it played a vital role in furthering the Ramakrishna movement. This building gave an impetus to many other disciples to construct and procure buildings nearby.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Car test units get more days
 SIMI KAMBOJ																								After successfully blocking attempts to introduce Bharat Stage II norms, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government appears to be making light of the October 1 deadline issued by Calcutta High Court on compliance with pollution-emission norms laid down by the Centre.																								The governments laxity is evident from the fact that it granted the extension of an internal deadline it had issued to the automobile emission testing centres (AETCs) to upgrade their equipment by another 45 days. In a meeting last Friday, the four-member committee supervising the changeover for AETCs pushed back the July 15 deadline to August 31.																								A circular detailing the dos and donts will be sent to the AETCs this week, informing them that renewal of their licences after August 31 will depend on whether or not they have upgraded their equipment, a transport department official said.																								While transport sources attributed the extension to the inability expressed by the testing centres to upgrade in so short a time, the units said it was the government that was procrastinating. Procurement of Class II multi-gas analysers  a must for testing the emission norms specified by the Centre  remains a dream, since no manufacturer has, to date, got his analyser certified by the Automotive Research Association of India, the lone certifying authority in the country.																								In a meeting on June 3, the committee had laid down that all centres will have to be computerised and equipped with web cameras by mid-July. The computers will be linked to a central server, also connecting the Public Vehicles Department and the Regional Transport Authority. 																								This way, the transport department will have access to data of vehicles being tested. We can check periodically and find out which vehicles havent got their engines tested, a committee member said.

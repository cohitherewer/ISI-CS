 A STAFF REPORTER																								Eight paintings by Upendrakishore Roychowdhury were found damaged in the strong-room of Rabindra Bharati Society when the high court-appointed special officer and experts from Indian Museum inspected the room for the second day on Sunday.																								All the paintings were, however, restored temporarily by Indian Museum preservation officer Amalendu Bikash Mitra. 																								Rabindra Bharati University registrar Santosh Kumar Ghorai said the campus will demand the takeover of the strong-room as the paintings and other items stored in it were national property and under threat.

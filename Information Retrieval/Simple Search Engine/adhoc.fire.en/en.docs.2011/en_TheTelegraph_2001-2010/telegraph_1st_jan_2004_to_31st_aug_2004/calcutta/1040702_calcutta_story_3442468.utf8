The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Keep clinical eye open, doctors told
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mishra: Examine patients, not reports																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra lashed out at doctors for losing their clinical eye and depending heavily on extra investigations.																								Two days after Metro carried a report on how city doctors were making prohibitively expensive and unnecessary investigations to treat patients, Mishra said: Clinical medicine (examining the patient) is a thing of the past. Nowadays, the stress is more on investigations. I dont mind investigations, but they should be justified and should not be made for commercial gain.																								Addressing representatives of the Indian Medical Association on Doctors Day (birth anniversary of Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy), the health minister urged doctors to properly examine patients and not depend on reports alone. There was a time when doctors like Bidhan Roy would depend on his clinical eye, but nowadays, doctors devote more time in examining reports only, Mishra said.																								He added that the much-talked-about doctor-patient relationship had suffered as a result and the time had come for doctors to give a serious thought to it. You just work towards building a better relationship with your patients, he added.																								Moloy Patra, secretary of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) state branch, echoed the ministers sentiments, adding that doctors who indulge in redundant investigations for commercial gain should be thrown out of the fraternity. We have never been in favour of unnecessary investigations, Patra added.																								Some city doctors supported Mishras attack on unnecessary investigations and said that doctors should be careful about their harmful effects. 																								Although, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines clearly say that any routine surgical patient who is healthy and below 40 does not require any investigations, only a handful of doctors actually practice it, said laproscopic surgeon B. Ramana. 																								I practise evidence-based medicine, but do not believe in investigation for the sake of it. I have been told many times that if anything goes wrong, I will pay for it, but that has never changed my mind, he added.																								In the past few years, a string of cases filed against doctors forced medico-legal firms to make doctors aware about the possible consequences of a patient deciding to haul doctors to court on charges of negligence. Most firms urge doctors to carry out all possible investigations to be on the safe side, say experts.																								Defending doctors, IMA secretary Patra said with new consumer protection rights coming into effect, doctors have no other choice but to be extra cautious. 																								Nowadays, even ordinary people keep asking doctors why they have not done a particular investigation. So, everything is more complicated, Patra added.

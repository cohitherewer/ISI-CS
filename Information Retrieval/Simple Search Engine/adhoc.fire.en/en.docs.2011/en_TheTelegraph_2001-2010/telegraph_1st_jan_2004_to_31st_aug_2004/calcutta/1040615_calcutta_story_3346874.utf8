The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Bye Alipore, Bypass ahoy for fins amp; tails
 															- State plan to shift aquatic zoo animals to 200-acre wildlife park awaits high court nod SIMI KAMBOJ				 	 A rhino at the Alipore zoo: Time to move house?																								Ratul doesnt live here anymore. Kadambini has moved out of Alipore and has left a forwarding address  Bhagwanpur Mauza, off the EM Bypass.																								Pending passing of a green plan, its time for the rhino couple at Alipore zoo  and most aquatic animals  to pack their bags and get a move on.																								For, a 200-acre nature-cum-wildlife park will come up off the Bypass stretch between Ruby Hospital and the Garia connector if the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments Ramsar Wetland Management Draft Plan is approved by the Calcutta High Court.																								A government-appointed committee has earmarked over 200 acres of land for the Rs 10-crore extended zoological campus off the Bypass. The proposed park is the focal point of the plan chalked out by the environment department. And central to the plan is the shifting out of some animals from their cramped confines of the 45-acre Alipore Zoological Gardens.																								According to environment department officials, over 60 per cent of the land identified for the nature park falls in the wetlands zone and so, primarily, aquatic animals will be housed here. Then, the rest may follow.																								Calcutta High Court had issued an injunction on constructions in and around the wetlands area and asked the government to draw up a wise use management plan for the wetlands.																								The government has been contemplating moving the citys animal kingdom out of Alipore for over a decade now. State environment secretary Asim Barman will place the present plan before the ministry of environment and forests for approval on Wednesday.																								The draft also envisages other projects such as creation of a wetlands interpretation centre, a medicinal plants-cum-horticulture farm to house endangered flora and a floriculture farm spread over the 12,740 hectare wetlands area. There will be hardly any construction apart from minor fencing and installation of electric poles, assured environment department officials. Not a single cottah of wetland will be touched, asserted Barman.																								Taking a cue from Chilika Lake and its dolphin sanctuary, Calcuttas proposed nature park would showcase animals exclusive to the state. So, the bottle brush marsh mongoose will find pride of place along with otters and turtles.

 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 A dream with a difference
																								The stage adaptation of Akhtaruzzaman Elias Khowabnama (The Dream Narrative), directed by Kishore Sengupta, unfolds the struggle of the sharecroppers and lower-class labourers during the Tebhaga movement. The play revolves around the peasants and their opposition towards the injustice meted to them by the landlords. Elias always preferred to avoid typical issues that usually comprise our contemporary stories and novels. In trying to settle man in society and history, Elias attempts to draw the resources of his writings from the day-to-day life of the common man. Thus his writings encourage new understandings of individuals and provide us a narrative idea about mankind, the world and the particular period in a prose style which is unflinching in its honesty and realism. In fact, Khowabnama needs to be included among a handful of classics in our literature as it attempts to rewrite the history of ordinary men and women.																								Event: Khowabnama (The Dream Narrative)  Play in Bengali by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Mill staff power line snapped
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A mother fans her child at the Union Jute Mill coolie line, at Entally. The mill has run up dues of Rs 11 lakh, leading to the snapping of power connection. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								While Virender Sehwag shone in Multan, it was darkness by day for over 1,000 residents of a by-lane in Entally. They missed the first Indians innings of 300 as the CESC snapped all power lines over non-payment of dues.																								Over 350 workers of Union Jute Mill have been spending their nights in pitch darkness because their Radhanath Chowdhury Road staff quarters, known as coolie line, is without power since Friday. The mill authorities have not paid the electric bill and the dues stand at Rs 11 lakh.																								The workers are up in arms. The mill management deducts a certain sum from our salary every month as house rent, power and water supply charges. We found out about the dues when CESC officials came to disconnect our lines, complained Hakimat Ansari, a worker of the mill.																								Without electricity, life at coolie line is hellish. During the day, we can cope. But after sunset, its a nightmare. The rooms turn into furnaces after a scorching day. We cant even leave our rooms and sleep in the courtyard because of mosquitoes, said Ghulam Rasul, another worker.																								Mothers have a trying time, too. The children cant sleep all day because of the heat. At night, they are too exhausted and cry themselves to sleep. We have to sit up and fan them. And so, we dont get any sleep ourselves, said Azmira Begum, mother of three children between 18 months and four years.																								The power-snap has resulted in a drinking water crisis. The roadside taps of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation are the lifeline. We have only two taps, on which 350 families depend. From early morning, we gather at the taps and after a two-hour wait, we manage to collect five litres of water, said Mansura Begum, mother of four.																								The mill authorities approached the CESC with Rs 1 lakh and a request for reconnection. The CESC refused. It wants the mill to pay up the total dues.																								Initially, when CESC officials went to snap the power line, residents forced them to leave. On Saturday, a team of four from Entally police station went to the spot and snapped the line.																								The mill workers, however, see a ray of hope. We met the personnel manager on Monday and he assured us that the line would be restored in a day or two, said mill worker Mohd Moinuddin.

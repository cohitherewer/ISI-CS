The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Surcharge waiver for trader tenancies
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 																								In a move designed to boost rental housing in Calcutta, the civic authorities plan to do away with the 20 per cent surcharge that is levied on tax collected from commercial rent.																								My objective is to encourage house-owners to let out more premises for commercial purposes in the city, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Thursday. I also want to ensure that the property tax affair is no longer subject to the whims and fancies of assessment inspectors.																								The specifics of the planned measure were expected to be finalised at a meeting slated for Friday, civic officials associated with the exercise said. 																								Calcutta is probably the only city where property is treated as liability, Mukherjee pointed out. If you happen to possess a vacant building or have surplus rooms in your house, you never think of letting them out commercially. This is because the lions share (60 per cent) of the rent earning is taken away by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as property tax.																								In case of a building let out, the civic body charges 40 per cent of the total rent in a year as annual property tax. If a building is being used for commercial purposes, an additional 20 per cent is added on as surcharge .																								With mayor Mukherjee taking the initiative, the civic authorities have decided to scrap the practice of calculating annual property tax on the basis of rent and the imposition of surcharge on commercial use of a building.																								Instead, like water tax, there will be two categories of rate per sq ft for buildings according to their mode of use  commercial or residential. 																								The rate per sq ft for commercial buildings will be higher than that for residential ones.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 A pilgrimage of love
																								When the mind is restless, doubt-ridden or filled with dread, we turn inwards to seek solace for our hearts. We make an effort to derive strength from within our souls by recalling pleasant memories and remembering our loved ones. It is then that music offers us a welcome refuge from the miseries of the present moment. Songs enable us to enter a realm of love and happiness and by virtue of their enchanting quality, help us feel at peace once more with the world around us. Geeta Ghataks rendering of some selected songs of Tagore will lead the audience on such a journey of love. It is a journey that becomes a pilgrimage; where the distinction between love and worship becomes blurred to oblivion. This collection of Rabindrasangeet, from the Prem and Puja chapters of Tagores musical oeuvre, helps us comprehend how the object of our love and devotion is omnipresent in our hearts and possesses the power to protect us from all danger and evil.																								Event: A solo recital of Tagore songs by Geeta Ghatak																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

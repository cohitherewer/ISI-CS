The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Plans junked, question mark over Shalimar
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE AND SANJAY MANDAL 																								The fate of the Shalimar terminal appears uncertain after South Eastern Railway (SER) decision to scrap the earlier plan and draw up a fresh project report.																								A detailed survey has been taken up to assess the viability of setting up the passenger terminal either at Shalimar-Padmapukur or Majherhat.																								We are conducting a detailed survey to prepare a final project report. It is likely to be ready by the end of this year, Ashok Kumar, SER chief passenger traffic manager, told Metro on Thursday. The state government has formed a committee and we are discussing the issue. There is, however, no question of cancelling the project, he said.																								The plan for setting up the third passenger terminal after Howrah and Sealdah was adopted in 1999 to reduce the load on Howrah station. Then railway minister Mamata Banerjee flagged off the first train from Shalimar to Haldia, with the assurance that the project would be ready within three years. But the train stopped plying and work made no progress.																								Later, pressured by the state government and MPs from Calcutta, the railway ministry re-opened the file and decided to draw up a new plan. 																								In 2003, then railway minister Nitish Kumar announced that a composite passenger terminal would be set up at Shalimar-Padmapukur. However, later in the year, on another visit to Calcutta to inaugurate the Contai-Tamluk section, Kumar expressed reservations about Shalimar-Padmapukur. 																								He felt the existing light-goods shed would have to be removed and there might be problems of a road network. 																								On December 31, 2003, former SER general manager V.N. Garg met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and proposed a terminal at Majherhat. The Railway Board has now asked for a detailed survey of the project.																								At a recent meeting between the state government and railway officials, a four-member committee was formed, consisting of R.R. Bhandari, SER general manager, Alapan Bandyopadhyay, CMDA chief executive officer, Debashis Som, commissioner, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and B.K. Sadhu, chief traffic and transport engineer.																								We have discussed the issue. Majherhat cannot be an alternative to Shalimar-Padmapukur, because many flyovers and a high bridge over the Hooghly will have to be built, explained Sadhu, convener of the committee. According to him, land acquisition would also be a problem. 																								SER officials involved in the survey said the main hindrance at Majherhat would be constructing a 80-ft bridge over the Hooghly between Vidyasagar Setu and Budge Budge, so that the movement of ships is not hampered. 																								We have not ruled out a terminal at Shalimar or at Majherhat, a senior SER official said. 																								 The state government has to develop the site to facilitate smooth passenger dispersal and vehicle parking. We have to look into that, said Tushar Mitra, CMDA director, project planning.

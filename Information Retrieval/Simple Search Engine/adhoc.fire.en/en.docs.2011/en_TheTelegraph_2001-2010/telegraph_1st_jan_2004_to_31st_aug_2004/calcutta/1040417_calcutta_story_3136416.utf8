 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Booked and bailed after 70-hour wait
 A STAFF REPORTER																								First, they could not decide what to do about him.																								Then, they claimed that tracking him down was proving to be mission impossible.																								Finally, they booked and bailed him out, all in a matter of minutes, after a 70-hour wait.																								Sanjay Bakshi, who allegedly abused an on-duty constable on Tuesday after he had hauled up the former Trinamul Congress MLA for jumping traffic lights, walked in and out of a local police station on Friday morning after securing his passport to freedom.																								Some 70 hours after the ugly incident, Bakshi came straight to Girish Park police station, walked into the officers room and emerged minutes later, armed with a bail order issued by the officer-in-charge (OC).																								He was booked for assaulting a public servant, which is a bailable offence. He obtained bail from the police station, confirmed H.P. Singh, deputy commissioner (headquarters).																								Bakshi will now have to be present and confirm the bail order in court, where the magistrate is empowered to cancel the order issued by the OC of a police station if he deems fit.																								On Tuesday afternoon, Bakshis car had jumped a traffic signal at the Chittaranjan Avenue-Girish Park crossing and was pulled up by constable Partha Banerjee of the Jorabagan Traffic Guard.																								The 50-year-old constable asked Bakshis driver to produce his papers, only to be heckled by the ex-MLA and his associates, according to a complaint lodged by Banerjee with his superiors.																								He (Bakshi) should have been slapped with Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code, which means obstructing a public servant from discharging his duties, grumbled a police officer, hinting at a deal between Girish Park police station and the Trinamul leader.																								I decided to obtain bail as the charge against me was bailable, was Bakshis explanation. I still feel that a section of the police is out to malign me, but let the law take its own course.

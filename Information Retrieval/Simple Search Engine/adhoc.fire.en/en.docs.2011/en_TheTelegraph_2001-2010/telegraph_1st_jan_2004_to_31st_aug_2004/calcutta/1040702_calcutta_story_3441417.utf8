 																											- Medical reports do not match, nor do witness versions, cry lawyers  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 I AM SATISFIED: Menoka Sen, mother of slain sergeant Bapi Sen, at her Parnasree home on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta																								The verdict is out, the guilty have been sentenced and its time for the court battle to begin. 																								Minutes after judge Basudeb Majumdar sentenced the five constables to life behind bars, their lawyers got together to work out a strategy to prove their innocence in the higher court.																								This will be done at the earliest, said defence lawyer Tapas Mukherjee. I filed a petition during Thursdays proceedings itself, asking the judge to release the certified copies of the order as early as possible. As soon as we get the copies, we will appeal before the high court.																								To start with, the defence team will highlight the discrepancies between the first and second medical reports of Bapi Sen. This is vital, as the prosecution underplayed the first medical report, which could go a long way in proving the innocence of the five constables, claimed Mukherjee. 																								According to the defence lawyer, the first medical report  penned on the basis of what Bapi Sens friends had told doctors  mentioned that the sergeant had consumed two pegs of alcohol and that he had been beaten up by a couple of people.																								But this was not discussed at length during the case, complained Mukherjee. The prosecution tried to suppress the first report in court and focused on the second medical report, where it was stated that Bapi had been assaulted by five persons. This suggests that Bapis four friends, who were also the prime witnesses, fabricated the second report in a matter of a few hours, Mukherjee alleged.																								The judge did not pay heed to this important lapse on the part of Bapis four friends, claimed the lawyer. In fact, their contradictory statements should not have been believed by the judge, he added. 																								Subhamay Bhattacharya, another lawyer appearing for the defence, reasoned that if five people had beaten up one man, the victim was bound to have suffered injuries to various parts of the body. Bhattacharya claimed Bapi had injuries only on his right side.																								Also, one needs to ask how no one else was injured. If five people were beating up Bapi, it is strange that his friends, all young men, should just stand by and watch and not intervene. Is this possible? he demanded.																								The lawyers also alleged that the statements of two prime witnesses, the taxi driver and his help, were not considered important. The two had clearly stated that no woman was involved, Mukherjee said. 																								Bapi had stopped the taxi and asked for the drivers licence when the occupants of the car  the five sentenced men  asked him to lay off. Bapi held on to the rear door as the driver tried to speed off. The sergeant lost his balance and his head hit the tram tracks, said Mukherjee.

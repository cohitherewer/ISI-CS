	The defective lights and public address system at the Vasant Utsav, recently organised by Indian Museum in association with the central governments tourism department, left the audience disgusted. Newspaper advertisements on the event had no mention of the entry tickets. So, many people who had turned up to watch the festivities had no clue that they would have to pay for a seat. Even some foreigners who sat through the event were puzzled by the mismanagement. Hope the museum authorities will not repeat the lapse.

	The Bengal Taxi Association runs a pre-paid taxi stand from the airport. But the association staff never bothers to return the 50 paise change to passengers. If the fares, including the service charges, are added up, it will be seen that they pocket quite a huge amount. I request the transport department to stop this malpractice that has been continuing for years now.

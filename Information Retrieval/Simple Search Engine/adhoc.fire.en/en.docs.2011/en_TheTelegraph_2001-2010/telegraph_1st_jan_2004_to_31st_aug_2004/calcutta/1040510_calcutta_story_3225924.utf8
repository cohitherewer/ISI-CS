	The condition of Vidyasagar Setu is deplorable. The road surface has worn out and the bridge railings are also in dire straits. The bridge will crumble if repairs are not undertaken immediately. The government must take action against those neglecting maintenance work.

	Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town.

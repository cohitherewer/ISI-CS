 Investigators on a search of the premises at Santiniketan after the medal theftIf I were in charge of finding Tagores stolen medal, I would was the question we posed in Time To Talk. International smuggling rackets to in-house foul play  Young Metro readers opinions stretch to conspiracy theories. But they are all in agreement about one thing  find Tagores Nobel to restore the countrys honour.First, investigators should co-operate with each other instead of fighting. Internal disputes are not only futile in recovering the lost treasures, but also questions the credibility of the security personnel. Refusing to co-operate with the CBI may also raise eyebrows about the involvement of insiders in the theft. VIPs may be visiting Santiniketan, but they are diverting attention from and hindering the investigation.				 				 																															Vivek MukherjeeI would begin by taking fingerprints from the Bichitra window, which was used by the burglars to enter, and the scene of the crime. I would then search for clues. Next, I would interrogate the security team and the faculty. I would alert police forces across the country, especially in the border areas, to minimise the possibility of the medal falling into the hands of international organisations. I would also fabricate a story about a prime suspect. This would make the actual criminals lax, thus making it easier for the police to catch them off- guard. A reward should be announced for any information.Rimli Datta,
Salt LakeI would start from the grassroots level. It is clear that the blue print of the loot was well chalked out, with the possibility of the involvement of international gangsters. Such a criminal act cannot be successful without the involvement of in-house people, who have knowledge of every inch of the museum.Tanmoy Ghosh, 
Asutosh CollegeSince elections are in the air, the inability to find the medals points to political conspiracy. It is impossible to imagine how such prestigious belongings, kept under tight security, cannot be recovered. I would have pushed the government for a detailed and speedy inquiry.Linda Lopa Ashok, 
Class XI, K.V.O.F Dum DumHad the onus of the investigation been on me, I would point the needle of suspicion towards the security system of the museum. The ease with which one could walk away with such valuables is astonishing. The lapses in the security arrangements leave a lot to be desired, and one can only wonder about the role of the caretakers.Rajdip Dey,
2nd year B.Sc, Chemistry (Hons), St Xaviers CollegeIn the wake of the recent pillaging of Gurudevs medal and other priceless artefacts, everyone is casting doubts on international trafficking rackets. But had the onus of investigation been on me, I would have suspected the so-called caretakers - the securitymen of the museum.Ruchika Dhanuka, 
2nd year, B.Com (Hons),
Shri Shikshayatan CollegeI would first make a detailed examination of all the clues. Then, I would interrogate the security guards. It is very difficult to fathom how the culprits could gain access to the room without internal assistance. Next, I would question the university authorities. I would also go through police records to search for possible suspects. Finally, I would submit all the findings to the press.Subhobrata Basu, 
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan A scene from A Midsummer Nights Dream. Picture by Rashbehari DasSummer on stage				 				 																															The newly-formed Dramatics Club of St James School took centrestage with their first production this weekend, playing to a full-house. The Shakespearean comedy A Midsummer Nights Dream was their first attempt, and a successful one.

Daily rehearsals from January ensured a polished production.				 				 																															As events coodinator of the production Sagar Daryani (along with Barnik Bardhan) puts it: Though it may not be midsummer yet, the production is definitely the beginning of summer.

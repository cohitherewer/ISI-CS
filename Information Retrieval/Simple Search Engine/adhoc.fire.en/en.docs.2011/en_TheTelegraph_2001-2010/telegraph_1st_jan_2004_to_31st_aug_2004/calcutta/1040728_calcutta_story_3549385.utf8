 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Cause to pack in more in Puja shopping bag
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Festive shopping at its peak: Celebration time																								With a proliferation of brands and organised retail chains, shopping trends in the city have witnessed a radical shift in recent times. To stimulate footfalls further and showcase Calcuttas buying power, a unique shopping carnival has been lined up in the lead-up to the Pujas on the lines of those in Dubai and Singapore.																								The Kolkata Shopping Festival (October 9-17) promises to be nine days of unalloyed shopentainment to go with the mood of the festive season. Organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (BCCI) in association with West Bengal Tourism, the first of its kind shopfest has been conceptualised with a view to change perception of the city and demonstrate its market potential, according to chamber president Biswadip Gupta.																								We are working on various ideas that would provide a memorable shopping and entertainment experience. If we get a solid critical mass, the festival should be a huge success, Gupta said on Tuesday when the chamber announced its plans. BCCI is working in tandem with the tourism department, the civic body and other agencies.																								Redeemable coupons linked to airline tickets, discount schemes, fashion and magic shows, fireworks displays, live music and art exhibitions would all be part of the carnival. While chamber teams will visit neighbouring states to spread the good word, the tourism department is chipping in with specially designed holiday packages.																								We would like to leverage this shopping carnival to project West Bengal as a tourist destination and so, traditional folk arts will be on display. Maybe it would be difficult to get in too many tourists in the first year itself. But it can serve as excellent exposure for the future, observed state tourism secretary R.K. Tripathy.																								Organised retailers and mall managers in town, gearing up for the festival boom, see synergy in the festival. Its a great initiative, particularly since retail is a priority sector for the government. We pledge full support for the festival and are working on many special offers in conjunction with the organisers, said Rahul Saraf, managing director of Forum.																								Swabhumi is ready to give out its urban court for festival-linked events. We will be happy to participate in the form of a fashion show and a textile exhibition. The park could also have a theme shopping spread. We are working out the nitty-gritty says general manager P. Sandeep.

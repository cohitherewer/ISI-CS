 BHAJAN GANGULY																								Having bagged a chunk of the central governments National Scavenger Rehabilitation Project funds, the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) plans to build a housing estate for the towns 136-odd sweepers and scavengers. 																								The estate will come up in Fakirbagan Lane.																								We have received Rs 68 lakh for the project from the Centre on a subsidised basis. The municipality will have to return half the amount after the project is completed, explained Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee.																								The estate is estimated to cost Rs 1 crore and 10 lakh, and the HMC plans to loan the remaining amount of Rs 42 lakh from a nationalised bank. 																								This loan will be repaid in easy instalments to the municipality by the dwelling unit-owners in the estate.																								The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Corporation of Howrah district, which forwarded the scheme to the HMC and egged it on to adopt some uplift schemes for scavengers, seems grateful to the civic body. We have propelled them to execute the scheme and the HMC has donated the land for the estate, said Jagannath Saha, district manager of the corporation.																								Each dwelling unit will cost Rs 50,000 and we plan to deduct the amount from the owners salary in easy monthly instalments, the mayor elaborated. 																								The estate will come up on a plot of 18 cottahs, on which the sweepers had been living in shanties for more than 20 years.																								According to HMC officials, each dwelling unit will comprise a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen, which they think is far better than the shanties in which the sweepers live now.																								The officials pointed out that the HMC is the first civic body in any district to donate an 18-cottah plot for the uplift of its scavengers. 																								The dwelling units will be given to the sweepers on ownership basis and they will not have to leave the area, they added.																								The quarters will be handed over to the 136 families some time this year. 																								We will start work very soon and try to hand over the quarters before the monsoon, mayor Mukherjee added. 																								Asked what the HMC had in mind for the uplift of the next batch of sweepers and scavengers that comes in after this set retires, the mayor said it was a long way off. A solution will be worked out when the need arises, he added. 																								The housing estate is a boon for the HMC sweepers but they must keep in mind that they will have to repay the amount of Rs 34 lakh to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Corporation within 20 months of the date of allotment, according to the terms of the project warned the corporations district manager Saha.

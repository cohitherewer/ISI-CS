 															- Domestic discord: judge dilutes command of daughter-in-law OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Power to the mother-in-law was the basic ingredient as Calcutta High Court added meat to Eakta Kapoors serial stew. 																								Even if a mother-in-law does not like the looks of her daughter-in-law, the bou must leave The daughter-in-law has no right to harass her mother-in-law, was the crux of Justice Barin Ghoshs observations, in a somewhat twisted tale of family ties.																								The conflict dates back to 2000, when D.P. Bose shifted from Chennai to his Salt Lake house in 2000, along with his son. He was joined a year later by wife Deepali, a former actress.																								According to a complaint filed later by 62-year-old Deepali, she came from Chennai to find a teenaged girl named Lipika living in their Salt Lake home with her husband. She protested and demanded that Lipika leave the house. 																								But Deepali alleged that this sparked her torture and harassment at the hands of her husband and Lipika.																								Unable to bear the torture, she filed a complaint against Bose with Bidhannagar (North) police station in October 2003, alleging that her husband was engaged in an extra-marital relationship with Lipika.																								Bose denied the allegation and claimed to the cops that Lipika was married to his son, but Deepali was refusing to accept her as their daughter-in-law. Bose produced a photograph of the wedding to prove his point and said Deepali had even filed for divorce in Barasat court.																								In January this year, Deepali moved high court, alleging police inaction and demanding why no action was being taken against her husband or Lipika, who was living under the same roof. When the case came up before Justice Barin Ghosh, Boses lawyer claimed that there was no truth in the allegations levelled against the 72-year-old by his wife.																								The problem, he claimed, had arisen out of the fact that the son had got married in Deepalis absence and she had refused to accept Lipika as a member of the household. Last month, Justice Ghosh ordered Bidhannagar police to ensure that Lipika left the Bose home.																								On Wednesday, Lipikas lawyer argued before Justice Ghosh that she had every right to live in that house, as she had married into it and there was nothing to prove otherwise. 																								If a mother-in-law does not want the daughter-in-law to be in the house, the daughter-in-law must leave, observed Justice Ghosh. The hearings will continue.

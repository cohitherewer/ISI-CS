	The flow of migratory birds to Alipore zoo and around Santragachhi  Lake has dropped this winter. Even a couple of years ago,  the gardens and the waterbody used to record a good number  of birds. City ornithologists and the authorities concerned  must probe the reasons  whether it was the chilly weather,  poachers or the filthy waters that stopped their annual  trip.

	Lack of proper toilets at most circuses across the city  poses a problem for visitors. Though some organisers arrange  for a few makeshift toilets, men seldom use them. As a result,  the grounds, once the circus winds up, are unfit even for  a stroll. The litter and the stench are overwhelming. The  circus authorities should make necessary arrangements, as  many people shell out a good amount to see the shows. Besides,  the routine Hindi film songs can be replaced with other  items, like balancing acts, keeping the child viewers in  mind.  
	Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road.

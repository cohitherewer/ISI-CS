	Off for distant shores: 
Kudos to Pradip Rudra Pal, our expert artisan from Kumartuli, for making a papier mache Durga, retaining the traditional clay look, which set sail for Delaware Valley, in the US (Something special, July 14). Let us hope that along with every Bengali heart across the seas, this idol brings joy to people of other faiths and religions too, thereby making the Puja a true success. 
Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum ParkApropos the report Council junks mayor home amnesty plans, July 14, it is a matter of utter bewilderment that our mayor Subrata Mukherjee is toying with the idea of according necessary sanction to unauthorised constructions under the jurisdiction of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on the plea that this will help generate income for the cash-starved CMC.  Is our mayor day-dreaming or trying to build castles in the air? Presumably after his defeat in the recent parliamentary elections, he has lost his senses. Even that is hardly excuse enough.  For, how can a man at the helm of affairs of a city dare think of giving legal sanctity to illegal structures? Then what is the point of having guidelines for construction of buildings at all?  If the mayor himself gives the go-ahead to illegal constructions, then the basic object of formulating guidelines, monitoring and obtaining permission will be lost.  The proposed illegal constructions may endan-ger the lives of people living in them. It is surprising how the mayor comes up with such hare-brained ideas, even if to garner more revenue for the CMC. Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
Nayapatty Road  The photograph of a 70-year-old woman lying unconscious in hospital after being found packed inside a gunny bag was depressing (Battered, bruised, dumped in a bag, July 9). Is this what old age deserves? It is evident that the unfortunate womans family members were behind her predicament. As Indians, we take so much pride in our culture and heritage, our tradition of looking after our old parents. May be when she was younger and stronger, this woman had devoted all her time and energy to the well-being of her family which now wants to get rid of her, as she is now a burden for them. Hope she gets better and names the culprits, who should be taken to task. Purnima Vasudeva,
Rowland RoadThe report on the abandoned baby girl in a drain (Crows peck discarded baby, July 14) was saddening. It showed how inhuman the parents of the baby and the people of the locality were. How can people behave in this way? Kalyan Ghosh,
Park Street  The residents of Dum Dum witnessed, without a trace of guilt, the grisly scene of a new-born baby, dumped in a canal, being eaten by crows. Where is our good sense, our moral values, when such incidents happen in broad daylight? It proves how pretentious our claims really are.Chandan Ray,
Sarsuna It was shocking to learn that a new-born baby was found dead and being pecked by crows in a drain in Dum Dum. The sordid phenomenon brings forth the reality of the increasing loss of humanity in the city, which kept the residents of the area from lending some dignity to the end of a life.  Prahlad Agarwala,
Majdia Apropos the report Axe tracks and other pet peeves, July 12, I am a resident of CIT road and have seen big trees felled at random. I understand that this is necessary for widening of the road, which is now being done. The loss of greenery has to be compensated by planting trees, perhaps of a smaller variety, in the remaining portion of the road divider. This should be made mandatory. Ashok Kumar Ghosh,
CIT RoadThe report Delhi nod for axed feasibility study (July 14) was proof of the good vibes shared between the Centre and West Bengal. Our chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee need not beg for help as it is a friendly government in power. When Assam and Bihar have so much monetary help for flood control, Bengal need not worry. Shiv Shanker Almal, 
 Lower Rawdon Street This is apropos the report Victims of harassment, July 11,which claimed that eve-teasing results only from a warped male attitude towards women. Nowadays, provocative dresses worn by girls, imitating film heroines, prompt men to make lewd gestures or pass comments at them. Vijay Jain,
Nandy Street. Thank you for highlighting the order passed by the high court regarding the title of our land (Institute wins right to build on Kasba plot, July 13). However, the agency in the report should have been KMDA and not CMC, as mentioned. Papiya Nandy,
Director, Jagadis Bose National Science Talent Search Apropos Rule flout powers mall raid there was a surprise check carried out at our supermarket, City Centre, Salt Lake by the legal metrology department on the basis of a supposed customer complaint about a mosquito coil which did not have the M.R.P. printed on the pack. Neither did the product have a C3 bar code pasted on it. So it was difficult to substantiate the fact that it was the same product which was bought from our store. I would like to point out that the department has subsequently dropped charges against C3 in the respect of the Good Knight coil. I never admitted of our having any loopholes and blocking them subsequently. Pabitra Dey,
Manager, operations, C 3 There were raids conducted at both C3 and Charnock City. At C3, some items were found without proper tags, whereas at Charnock City packets of rice, daal and sugar were seized.Office of the legal metrology department

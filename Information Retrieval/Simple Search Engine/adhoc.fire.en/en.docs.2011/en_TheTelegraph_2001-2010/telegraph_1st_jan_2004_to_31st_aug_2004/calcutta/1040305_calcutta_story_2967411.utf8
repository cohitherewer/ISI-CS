The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

	Traffic police have intensified their drives to pull up bus drivers who defy road rules. But the lengthy procedure of spot-fining the drivers, often unnecessarily, delays the passengers for no fault of theirs. Sergeants should let off the buses after noting down the licence numbers of the vehicles and the drivers. The penalty can be realised later. That will save commuters a lot of time, especially during office hours.

	Retired government employees should be issued photo-identity cards which they can produce at government hospitals while seeking medical help. In the absence of any such proof of identity, family members are forced to rush to the government department concerned and get hold of a free treatment certificate. This process is time-consuming, endangering the patients life. Relatives usually take their patients to private hospitals to avoid further delay. The system should be streamlined.
	 Md. Moinuddin, Ballygunge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Persistent cold? See doctor
Subir Ganguly, oncologist, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Kalyan Roy, Santosh Pande, Mandira Ghosal, Soham Chakrabarty, Goutam Saha, Sujit Kr Dey, Basudeb Choudhury, Abhishek Roy and Debashree Chakrabarty				 																																																																																																																																																																		Basudeb Choudhury: Cancer is still a dreaded disease. How does one know whether one has been afflicted with it or not?																																																			Though there are many tests to detect the disease, the simplest way is to visit a cancer specialist if any physical problem persists for an abnormally long time and shows no sign of cure. The ailment may range from a simple headache to common forms of cold and cough. Any type of ailment in any part of the body, however small and simple, should not be ignored. 																																																									

Basudeb Choudhury: What are the common forms of cancer treatment?																																																			Generally, three types of treatment are available. One is surgery, the others are chemotherapy and application of radiation. You will get all three facilities at all government hospitals. Only National Medical College and Hospital does not have a unit for providing radiation. Such facilities are also available in some district hospitals, like Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia.																																																									

Abhishek Roy: Is the disease connected to heredity in any way?																																																			Yes. But only a few types of cancer get transmitted through genes. Some forms of breast, ovarian and vertinablastoma-type cancers are hereditary. Only 10-15 per cent of offspring carrying such cancer-causing genes are affected. Some of these genes have already been identified.																																																									

Debashree Chakrabarty: How many cancer treatment centres are there in the city?																																																			As I have told you earlier, all government hospitals in the city have the infrastructure for treatment. Apart from these, only Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital, an autonomous institution under the central government, has the facilities. Most of the state hospitals can treat 96 per cent of the disease, except some rare cases which need more sophisticated treatment available outside the state. Now, several private health clinics are also installing updated equipment, but they are yet to gain a solid footing in tackling the disease.																																																									

Soham Chakrabarty: What is the prevalence rate of cancer in the country. Is there any reason to panic?																																																			There are no complete statistics on the prevalence of the disease in the country or in the state. According to figures available from various statistical publications, around eight to nine lakh people of our country get affected by the disease. In our state, nearly 64,000 people are being affected yearly. Of these, only 15,000 avail of the treatment at government hospitals and private health clinics. Nobody knows what happens to the rest. 																																																									

Soham Chakrabarty: What is the condition of treatment facilities?																																																			The situation is pathetic. According to WHO guidelines, there should be a radiotherapy unit for every lakh of population. Going by that, there should be 80 such units across the state, but we have only 15. It is not possible for the government alone to shoulder the huge cost of installing radiotherapy units, as each costs around Rs 2 crore. So, one has to stress more on information than on the curative part.																																																											People living in the rural areas hardly get the chance of availing of such medical facilities. When they turn to the city, the hospitals here have to take in an immense load. A doctor at a government hospital has to see at least 200 patients a week. (To be continued)

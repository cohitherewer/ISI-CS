 PRONAB MONDAL																								There is no missing the blanket of fear over Burrabazar. The business heartland of the city, extending up to Posta, is in the grip of the extortion-and-ransom machinery. And the lack of police action has fuelled fear and eroded faith in the system among the business community, based here for decades.																								Even if you have all papers in order and every relevant permission in place, you have to pay a price to the local goons if youre setting up shop or adding a wing. It has become really unsafe, said Rajesh Mundhra, a Burrabazar-based businessman.																								Hardly six weeks into the New Year, the Burrabazar-Posta belt has already accounted for five cases of armed robbery, all follow-ups to unrealised extortion attempts targeting traders.																								Thirty-seven such crimes were reported last year in this area, officials said, adding that all of them occurred after the victims had refused to meet the extortionists demands.																								Last year, there were at least five cases of abduction for ransom in this zone, where the victims families, instead of contacting the police for help, chose to settle things themselves.																								If we go to the police, all they tell us is to settle the issue, which means pay up and buy your safety, alleged Mundhra. And once you pay one gang, the others queue up. 																								Officials say a combination of factors has led to the spurt in extortion-related abductions, as also the victims reluctance to seek police help. Though most of the dreaded city-centre ganglords (Guddu, Nadeem, Gabbar) are now behind bars, their associates are ready to earn a reputation of their own.																								Part of the blame lies with some business establishments, claim cops, as they engage in illegal money-laundering activities. On the one hand, there is a new batch of criminals looking to make a mark, said a police official. On the other, there are a lot of cash-rich traders who are reluctant to come to us, he added.																								Another official spelt out another trouble point: When some businessmen asked for protection, it was discovered that they were in touch with a clutch of local criminals.																								Mondays abduction is believed to have been led by Pintu, who, officials probing the case say, is another gangster who used to work for Gabbar. We will now have to see whether Gabbar himself has masterminded the operation from behind bars, said Jorasanko thana officer-in-charge Timir Bhattacharya. 																								Other dreaded names doing the rounds of Burrabazar are Ullu Raju and Dhur Bapi.

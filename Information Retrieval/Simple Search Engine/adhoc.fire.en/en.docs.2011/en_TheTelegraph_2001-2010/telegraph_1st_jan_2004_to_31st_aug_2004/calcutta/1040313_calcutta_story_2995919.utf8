 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Stadium bill powers row
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Power minister Mrinal Banerjee on Friday faced the wrath of the Opposition in the Assembly for his failure to collect power dues from bulk consumers and take action against the defaulters.																								Leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee alleged that many bulk electricity consumers who had run up huge arrears still had their connections intact. His focus was on Salt Lake stadium.																								Banerjee asked the minister what steps had been taken to realise dues totalling Rs 3.78 crore from the stadium authorities.																								The stadiums electricity bill has not been paid for the past three years, but the power department has not taken any action. The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) disconnects supply if any common consumer fails to pay his bill for two consecutive months, Banerjee pointed out.																								In support, Trinamul Congress legislator Saugata Roy elaborated that the sports department charges a fee from the clubs holding football matches and other games in the stadium. Besides, he said, lakhs are raised from various organisations holding soirees and other events. Why cant the sports department pay the stadiums power bills and why is the WBSEB silent on the matter? Roy asked.																								Several Opposition members were up on their feet, protesting special favours granted to the stadium authorities.																								In his reply, minister Banerjee said the WBSEB had already served a disconnection notice on February 27. I have asked the officers to seek clarifications from the departments staff why effective steps have not been taken to collect the dues from the stadium authorities, Banerjee said. 																								He assured the legislators that action would be taken against the stadium authorities as per the provisions of the law.																								To another question, the power minister said the WBSEBs performance had recorded an upswing. We have cleared all our dues with the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and are now paying their bill in advance and getting a rebate for it. Besides, payments to Eastern Coalfields have been regularised. The Board has no dues now to any agency, he said.

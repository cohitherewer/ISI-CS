 NATURE amp; PROGRESS: Sunflower cultivation in the Sunderbans. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryParitosh Ghosh: The Sunderbans evoke an image of wildness. How has the present-day Sunderbans changed? Is it losing its wild environment with the developmental work going on in the area?																																																													Not at all. The Sunderbans is the largest delta and mangrove forest in the world and it commands special attention among environmentalists the world over. There are 19 blocks in this area. Six of them are in North 24-Parganas while 13 are in South 24-Parganas. Our major activity is confined to the peripheries of these blocks. Nearly 400,000 people live in the 5,263 sq km of inhabited area. But as you have pointed out, the major challenge before the Sunderbans Development Board is to retain the original natural character of the island, with its flora and fauna, as well as to carry out the developmental work for the inhabitants. So, its like a balancing act. We have to keep in mind that in the process of developmental work, like building bridges and laying roads, the wilderness or the forest should not be destroyed.

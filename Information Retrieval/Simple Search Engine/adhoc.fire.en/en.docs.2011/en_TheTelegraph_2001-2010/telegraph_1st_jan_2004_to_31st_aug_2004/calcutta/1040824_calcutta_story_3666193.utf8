 																											- CPM body to probe Singhs stay in SSKM, Sikdar role OUR BUREAU																								The burning question at SSKM Hospital  should Avtar Singh be in Woodburn ward or not  was temporarily doused late on Sunday.																								MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdars husband has been lodged in the VIP ward since his arrest on Independence Day for running a sleaze racket at his Hotel Merlin Park, in Salt Lake.																								But the question of Singh being given VIP status is expected to flare up at the CPM district committee meeting, beginning Wednesday. 																								Amitava Bose, CPM district committee secretary in North 24-Parganas, will head the one-man truth committee to find out if Sikdar herself was involved in the racket.																								On Sunday night, discussions over the telephone with the states highest authorities on this high-profile detainee kept officials of the hospitals administrative building on their toes.																								The decision to remove him from RG Kar Hospital to Woodburn ward after he complained of chest pain had led the Trinamul Congress to organise rallies in front of the hospital every day.																								The SSKM authorities, who till Sunday did not pay heed to the question of Singhs preferential treatment, changed their mind late in the evening. Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss was to be present at the inauguration of the MBBS courses on Monday, at a spot not far from Woodburn ward. The authorities feared that the Union minister might visit the ward and the Trinamul might organise a rally to draw his attention, a health department official said on Monday. 																								After the hospital authorities and state government officials discussed this issue, it was decided that Bangur Institute of Neurology would be asked to admit Singh. 																								Hospital sources said someone tipped off Singh over his cell phone that he was going to be shifted out of Woodburn ward. Immediately, he complained of a severe pain in the chest and pleaded that he be allowed to stay on. 																								Around 9.20 pm, the authorities, after a series of discussions, managed to shift Singh to an isolated cabin in the respiratory unit. 																								As an undertrial, Singh is entitled to free treatment. However, an official said, there are some medical tests, like MRI (brain scan), that dont come free at SSKM. 																								Now, jail authorities are planning to seek formal permission from the state government for getting the tests done free, a senior state health department official said.

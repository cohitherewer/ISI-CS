The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Fashion fun for freedom
				 	 Models at the Desi Nite show																								 Cloud 9, the resto bar at The Astor, hosted an Independence Day bash on Friday night. The signs of the Desi Nite were saffron balloons, tricolour dupattas distributed among the guests to drape around their necks, and some fun games distantly related to the concept of Independence. 																								A fashion show of sorts took place too, with the three colours splashed on the garments in some form or the other.

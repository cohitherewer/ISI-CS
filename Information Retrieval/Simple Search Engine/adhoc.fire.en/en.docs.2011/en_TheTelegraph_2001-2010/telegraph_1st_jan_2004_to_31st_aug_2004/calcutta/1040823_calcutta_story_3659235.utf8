 Kamalinee Mukherjee with Lake Town residents at The Good Life Talk Show on Saturday. Picture by Aranya SenWhat is the secret of a glowing skin? How can one make a face pack at home? What does one do to have silky, shiny hair? The questions flew thick and fast from readers of The Telegraph no sooner had Kamalinee Mukherjee, the guest at The Good Life Talk Show, settled down with anchor Rita Bhimani on Saturday evening. 																								Across the table in the Utsabshree hall were around 90 residents of Lake Town  men, women and a couple of kids  who had turned up to hear the upcoming actress share her beauty secrets.																								The chat kicked off with Rita introducing the 24-year-old beauty as one of the actors in Revathys forthcoming film Phir Milenge, starring Salman Khan, Abhishek Bachchan and Shilpa Shetty. From then on, it was all Kamalinee.																								A firm believer in natural products, the city girl in a green short kurta suggested some time-tested remedies with besan, milk, cucumber, potato, lime and rose water to solve skincare woes. While several queries veered around the use of correct makeup before venturing out for work, a good number of people also wanted to know the answers to hair hassles.																								The first poser came from Suchandra Saha who wanted the regimen for an oily skin plagued by pimples. The star guest advised her to wash her face a couple of times before dabbing on light moisturiser. Debapriya Basak was worried about falling hair to which Kamalinee suggested a scalp massage with some warm coconut or almond oil mixed with crushed methi seeds before shampooing her hair.																								Fifty-year-old Kaberi Das wanted to know how she could arrest hair fall along her middle-parting. The actress came up with a home-made recipe that her mother uses to check the same problem. Make a paste of reetha, methi and curd, apply it to the scalp and shampoo your hair after 15-20 minutes. And whats the best way to henna? Use it with curd and an egg, advised Rita.																								Engineering student Sudeshna Majumdar was dogged by a common problem  dark circles under the eyes. In her case, wearing glasses made matters worse. Soak a cotton ball in some fresh juice squashed from potatoes and put it under your eyes. The circles will vanish within a week, promised Kamalinee, while Rita nodded in agreement.																								Eena Bhattacharyas complaint, too, was one that most working women shared  not being able to use a sunscreen lotion due to excessive sweating. Then stick to these three commandments  cleaning, toning and moisturising, said the young expert. Washing the face with besan, toning it with an astringent or rose water and applying a light moisturiser were the best ways to a happy skin. But make it a habit to drink lots of water and have a balanced diet, cajoled Kamalinee.																								Then, the clamour for a home-made face pack. Make a paste of besan and milk and apply it on the face. Put two slices of cucumber on the eyes for a soothing effect. Keep the pack for not more than 10 minutes and wash it off.																								But dont men have any beauty problems? Rita steered the talk towards the husbands. Oh yes, we do, came the call from a corner. From the other end of the room, Amitabha Mullick broached his problem. After driving a long way to office, he suffers a burning sensation on his face that remains through the day. Kamalinee prescribed a bottle of rose water that Mullick could carry to office, if possible, to wash his face with.																								An hour had flown, but more posers poured in. Cracked heels, chapped lips, splitting hair ends, dandruff and so on. Use Vaseline, apply almond oil on the heels, trim your hair, the expert duo went on tossing tips, non-stop.																								At the photo session that followed, the participants got up close to Kamalinee and Rita, flooding them with yet another round of queries. And they went home with a smile, loaded with tips to look good and feel great.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

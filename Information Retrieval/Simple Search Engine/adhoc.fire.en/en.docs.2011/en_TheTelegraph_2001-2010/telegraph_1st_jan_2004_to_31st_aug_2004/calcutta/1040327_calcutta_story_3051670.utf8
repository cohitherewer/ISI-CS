 A STAFF REPORTER																								A team from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has begun assessments of Presidency, St Xaviers, Bethune and some other colleges that have applied for its ratings over the year.																								On Friday, Sambalpur University vice-chancellor M.C. Das, also chairman of the inquiry team, said the process of assessment had begun with South Calcutta Girls College, on Sarat Bose Road, which figures on a list of 100 colleges in and around Calcutta. A few of the better-known colleges, like St Xaviers and Presidency, will be taken up for assessment from next week.																								NAAC officials said their report on South Calcutta Girls and a few other colleges would be submitted to council headquarters in Bangalore for a final decision within a few days. 																								On getting our reports, NAAC will declare the colleges accredited to the council, said Das. The colleges will get their ratings within a month from the date of submission of our preliminary report, he added. 																								K.P. Singh, another member of the team, said South Calcutta Girls came as a surprise to the list. A college fully and creditably managed by female staff, strong discipline and quality environment  its a nice experience for us. We hope our experience will be the same in the coming days of our investigation, he elaborated. We are really happy the NAAC team came for an inspection, said principal Kabita Sarkar. 																								The NAAC accreditation will lead to enhancement of the quality of education the colleges are imparting. 																								About 13,000 colleges and 294 institutions, including universities and deemed universities, had applied for NAAC accreditation.

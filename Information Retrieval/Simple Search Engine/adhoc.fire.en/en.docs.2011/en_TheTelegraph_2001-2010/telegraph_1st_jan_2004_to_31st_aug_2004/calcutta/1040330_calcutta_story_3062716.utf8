The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Campus cradle for tech-skill tips
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 At work in a call centre: Theres a new course on offer that teaches the soft skills required for ITeS 																								Supply meets demand, academia meets industry, tradition meets technology. 																								Promising to plug an obvious need gap in the eastern market is the newest course that teaches the soft skills required for the IT-enabled Services (ITeS).																								Marking the first tie-up between academia and the industry, the St Xaviers-Technable ITeS Academy, launched on Monday, is a collaboration between the 143-year-old college and the new-age Technable Solutions Pvt Ltd.																								Spearheading the initiative is Santanu Bhattacharya, managing director of Technable Corporation, USA, and Technable Solutions, India. And lending a helping hand is Father Mathew, principal of St Xaviers College. The month-long course will be conducted in three to four batches of 20 students each, with four hours of classes every day, five days a week. At the end of the intensive programme will be an ITeS Competency and Employability Certification, testing the skills of students and helping the employers gauge the level of training received.																								We spoke to several individuals and companies in the industry, like PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and BNKe Solutions, before deciding on what the requirements were, and then designed the training programme accordingly, explained Bhattacharya. There is a big demand from the ITeS industry for young professionals, which is proven by the number of companies that come to St Xaviers for campus interviews. We will provide the training, so the companies get skilled individuals.																								To prevent a resource crunch, more needed to be done to prepare and train professionals to provide ready human resources in order to attract investors, felt Roopen Roy, managing director, PwC. And such collaboration between academia and business would help accelerate growth in the eastern region, he asserted.																								The course will be conducted in two areas  call centre (voice) track and BPO (non-voice) track. The students will be taught a variety of domain skills, like personality and communication skills development (American vs British and Indian English, cultural orientation and attitude building) and computer competency (fundamentals, data processing, Internet). 																								Call centre-specific training includes customer support, market overview and tech support, while the BPO course will cover subjects like document handling, logistics and transaction processing. The practical side incorporates group discussions, audio-visual presentations, mock calls and even office visits.																								The cost is Rs 8,000 with a Rs 3,000 discount for the first few batches, and it is open to those with 10+2 education and English proficiency. The faculty will initially consist of professionals from the ITeS industry, while members of the St Xaviers faculty will be trained to teach in due course.																								Education in Calcutta needs a paradigm shift, with the invasion of globalisation, was Father Mathews verdict, at the inauguration ceremony. We have to become very practical-oriented, to give students the tools to go out into the industry and find jobs.																								If this practical push on the Park Street campus works, the programme will be extended to bio informatics, operation management training and more.

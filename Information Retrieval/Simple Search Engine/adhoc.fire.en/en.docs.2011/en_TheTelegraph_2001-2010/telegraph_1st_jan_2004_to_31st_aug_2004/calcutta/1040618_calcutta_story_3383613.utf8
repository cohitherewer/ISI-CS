 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Fare-hike chorus by bus lobby
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Barely 24 hours after the diesel price hike, the bus and minibus operators lobbies in the city have raised a chorus for a fare hike.																								The Joint Council of Bus Syndicate has decided to pressure the government to meet its demand. On Thursday, it issued a two-week ultimatum to the government for an upward revision of fares, failing which its members threatened to yank their vehicles off the road.																								Another section of operators, the Bengal Bus Syndicate, has submitted a letter to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, seeking an upward fare revision. 																								According to bus operators, the price of diesel has been hiked thrice in the past eight months: in November 2003 (by Rs 1.09), in December (by Re 1) and earlier this month (by Rs 1.04).																								The fares were last revised in November 2003. We are not demanding any major hike. We only want to cover the additional expenses in buying fuel. It is up to the government to peg the hike, said joint council president Sadhan Das.																								However, the Bengal Bus Syndicate demanded Rs 4 as the minimum fare for buses and Rs 4.50 for minibuses. The minimum fare for buses and minibuses are Rs 3 and Rs 3.50, respectively.																								Taxi operators, however, do not want a meter increase right away, saying a hike will affect their already-dwindling trade.																								Transport department officials said a revised fare structure would be examined by a one-man committee of CSTC chairman S. Lamba. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty will meet Lamba and other officials to take a decision in the matter.

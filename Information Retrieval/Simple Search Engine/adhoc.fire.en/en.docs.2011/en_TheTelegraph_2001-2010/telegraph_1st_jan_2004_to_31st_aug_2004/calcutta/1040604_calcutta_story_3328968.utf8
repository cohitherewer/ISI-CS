The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Step ahead for east-west rail corridor
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The proposed East-West Metro Railway corridor moved a step closer to reality with E. Sreedharan, managing director of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), discussing the project extensively with senior government officials on Thursday. 																								The proposed 24-km rail route connecting Howrahs Dasnagar to Rajarhat will boast nine km of underground tracks, with a portion of it going under the Hooghly river.																								The DMRC has been recently appointed by the state government to prepare a detailed project report. We will submit it to the Bengal government by November. Actual physical work might be started in October next year, Sreedharan said at Writers Buildings, after the meeting. Work is expected to be completed by 2010.																								As of now, the DMRC has been appointed to prepare the detailed project report, but they may remain advisers to the state government for the project during the implementation stage. However, that would require a separate agreement with them, a senior government official said. On Thursday, Sreedharan briefed senior government officers on various aspects of the project, including technicalities. 																								The project has a price tag of Rs 4,500 crore, that may rise to Rs 6,000 crore at completion stage. We are suggesting to the state government that 40 per cent of the total cost be shared equally between the state and Central governments. The remaining 60 per cent can be borrowed, and this is where private partnership may come in, Sreedharan said. 																								One of the potential sources of private funds is Japan Bank of International Cooperation, with whom the project was discussed a number of times.																								Sreedharan said any modern city with a population of over five million cannot afford to do without a Metro these days. 																								After the success of the Metro Railway in Delhi, DMRC is involved in preparing detailed project reports for tubes in many cities all over the country, including Chennai, Mumbai and Bangalore. 																								The Metro Railway in Calcutta is not doing as well as the one in Delhi because of the basic difference in technology, Sreedharan pointed out. In Delhi, we have opened only one of three lines in the Metro and still, there has been operational profit from Day One. The new project in Calcutta would be made viable similarly, because it would be based on modern technology. 																								Chief secretary Asok Gupta, transport secretary Sumanta Chowdhury, finance secretary Samar Ghosh, urban development secretary D. Mukhopadhyay and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) chief executive officer Alapan Bandopadhyay were present at the meeting. The rail corridor was originally outlined by the Japan Economic Trade Organisation, that prepared a feasibility study of the project.

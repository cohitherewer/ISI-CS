 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Shuturmurgh
																								Asatire pertaining to the modern political milieu set against the backdrop of a kingdom with its vain ruler at the helm  this is the governing atmosphere of S.M. Azhar Alams rendition of Gyandev Agnihotris Shuturmurgh. The play is built around the fabled belief that an ostrich, on sensing danger, digs a hole in the ground and hides its head in it, thus shutting out the danger and taking relief in such ignorance. In Shuturmurgh, the ostrich metaphor is transferred to new-age politicians who wear a mask of decided ignorance in the face of imminent anomalies that they inflict upon society. The protagonist is a disdainful king who considers himself to be an aware Shuturmurgh and attempts to live a life grounded on his flimsy belief. Deception receives its due and the king is dethroned; the ostrich is compelled to confront reality in the face. How this eventual social unmasking takes place is what the content of Shuturmurgh is about.																								Event: Play Shuturmurgh by Little Thespian																								When: February 20 - 22; 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

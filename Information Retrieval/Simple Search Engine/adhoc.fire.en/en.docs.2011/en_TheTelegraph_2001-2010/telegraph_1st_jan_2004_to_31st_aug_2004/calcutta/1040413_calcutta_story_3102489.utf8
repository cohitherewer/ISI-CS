 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Diesel Amby: Stamped Stage II, flopping smoke test
 JAYANTA BASU				 	 A diesel Ambassador gets a tail pipe emission test conducted at Beltala. Picture by Aranya Sen																								A dense smokescreen hangs over the driveway ahead of the new Bharat Stage II diesel Ambassador. Test results on the new Symphony Gold diesel Ambassadors, conducted by the public vehicles department (PVD) at Beltala, indicate that around 50 per cent of these cars fail to conform to the government-prescribed emission standards. 																								The results of four computerised tail pipe emission tests on a new Bharat II diesel Ambassador (temporary no: WB-02 437), conducted recently by department experts at Beltala, gave values of 88.5, 78.7, 73.2 and 68.7 Hartridge Smoke Unit (HSU), with an average of 77.3. As per the rules, laid down by the central government, the maximum permissible emission value is 65 HSU. 																								We are aware of the development, said Abhijit Chakraborty, general manager, Hindustan Motors, adding that the matter was being looked into.																								Sources in the automobile major, however, put the blame on the department. Casting doubts over the machine and the testing procedures followed by the PVD, one of the officials said: We set our cars within 50 HSU. 																								But the company officials remained tightlipped on why the rate of failure in tests  using the same machine and the procedure  was lower in case of other diesel cars. 																								According to PVD sources, the Bharat Stage II Ambassadors have been failing the emission tests for the past few months. Even results of parallel testing in private emission monitoring centres have vindicated the departments findings, claimed a PVD technical hand. 																								The dealers know how many new Ambassador cars failed the emission tests in the past few months. They were sent back, said one of the inspectors.																								City-based dealers like Austin Distributors and Shaw Distributors admitted that they were aware of the problems regarding emission standards in some new Ambassadors, which had to be sent a second time for fitness tests. 																								R.L. Pasari, director, Shaw Distributors, told Metro: We had communicated the problem to the manufacturers after the matter was brought to our notice. 																								To understand the problems, experts from Hindustan Motors and representatives of some big dealers visited the department and discussed the issue with officials. But there was no convergence of opinion and the meetings failed to resolve the problems, added sources in the department. 																								But while the war of words between the manufacturer and department officials continues, the green lobby in the city has started questioning the manufacturers motive and the watchdogs efficiency. 																								Sibabrata Chatterjee, environmentalist and former member of the expert committee (environment) constituted by the government of India, said it was high time to take some action against the manufacturer for not complying with the statutory norms. 																								The manufacturer is supposed to provide the Form 22 as a guarantee during registration, which is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle. As per the rules, the manufacturer is liable to set the vehicle to desirable pollution standard or replace it free of cost if the vehicle fails to meet the pollution test, pointed out Chatterjee. 																								PVD officials admit that the provision of Form 22 has become a mere formality for most of the manufacturers and in most cases, the dealers or brokers fill up the form.

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Seven-week break for tax refund row
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								There has been yet another twist in the vehicular-tax conundrum tale, with an interim stay on Monday slamming the doors on the refund row for seven weeks.																								A division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee, passed the stay order on Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharyas judgment, that had set aside two separate government notifications requiring the owners of two-wheelers and four-wheelers to pay a lifetime tax and a five-year tax, respectively. The next hearing has been fixed for June 10.																								As a result of Mondays stay, the government will not have the right to collect penalties from vehicle-owners who have failed to pay the new taxes till the matter remains in court.																								The stay also gives the cash-strapped government much-needed breathing space in that it will not have to refund the huge amounts it has already collected by way of the new vehicular taxes.																								In his judgment passed on March 27, Justice Bhattacharya had asked the government to refund the amount with interest at State Bank of India rates.																								Moving an appeal before the division bench, advocate-general Balai Ray told the court that his government would have to face a heavy loss of revenue to carry out the order of Justice Bhattacharya.																								The advocate-general also questioned whether the judiciary could intervene in the execution of a decision taken by the state legislature. The new taxes were fixed after amending the existing motor vehicles rules by the legislatures of the state Assembly, said Ray.																								Counsel for the Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) and other individual vehicle-owners had opposed the governments prayer.																								P.K. Roy, counsel for AAEI, told the court that the state transport department was already accepting taxes from four-wheeler owners at the old rate. He added that if the court stayed the judgment of the trial court, it would result in a hotch-potch in the collection of taxes.																								At least seven lawyers representing other respondents supported Roy and pleaded with the court not to stay Justice Bhattacharyas judgment.																								The imposition of new taxes on private vehicle-owners has been a contentious issue for quite a while, with the government finally amending Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, in November 2003 with two separate notifications. 																								The government is now determined to mop up higher taxes from vehicle-owners to augment the road network.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 City Lights
Of fun folks amp; crazy cars 				 																																																											Kiera Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin, was in Calcutta for a week to slip into the role of a woman on a voyage of personal discovery in an English film directed by a city girl. The 21-year-old, all excited about her stint here, pens a diary for Metro on Sunday. Dont look for the dramatic legacy of great-grandfather Eugene ONeil, for cool Kiera is a film-and-fun freak.April 29				 																																																											It is nice to arrive here from Los Angeles, after 30 hours of travelling! I cannot believe how hot it is. Also what amazes me is the way people drive here, its like a roller-coaster-ride. Everyone is all over the place honking like crazy. The ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton, where I will be staying for more than a week, is a beautiful hotel. For dinner, I have some delicious Indian cuisine, with Rajshree (director), Sam (assistant director) and Tobi (deputy director).April 30				 																																																											Im off to a market to do some shopping. I want to bring back lots of souvenirs for all my friends and family, and of course also for myself. Then, with Rajshree we go all over town to see all the places where we will be shooting. Seeing all these places, I just cant wait to start the movie (Yatna). And oh yes, I spot a theatre named after my grandfather in the middle of a crowded marketplace!May 1				 																																																											Rehearsal day. Today, Im meeting Victor (Banerjee) and Rupa (Ganguly). We will go over a few scenes They both turn out to be wonderful people.May 2				 																																																											First day of shooting, with some scenes in a bookstore. The day goes by so fast. Its great fun. Rajshree (Ojha) is a talented young director and very easy to work with; Victor is a very experienced actor and great fun to work with, and Rupa and I get along just fine.May 3-4				 																																																											Sick. I am running a really bad fever and am unable to get out of bed. The doctor says its the change of weather and the result of having to work in the heat.May 5				 																																																											Still feeling weak, I go to the sets. Today, we are shooting at the Fairlawn Hotel. This is the perfect place for my character, a very sweet hotel with a feeling of warmth.May 6				 																																																											My day off. So first I go to the gym and then to the pool. Then, I go all around town. First stop, the Chaplin theatre and the Chaplin park, followed by Victoria Memorial. Calcutta is such an interesting place...May 7				 																																																											Back to Fairlawn Hotel, to finish all the bedroom scenes.May 8				 																																																											Today, we are doing all the outdoor scenes. From outside the bookstore to New Market to the Ganges. Before going to the Ganges, we have lunch at Grand Hotel. The scenes of the Ganges go really well. A crowd gathers around us, but as soon as Rajshree says action, everyone goes silent. Its a great day, followed by a wonderful dinner at Amber.May 9				 																																																											Last day of shooting in Calcutta. The week went by so fast! A long day at work, finishing at 2 am.May 10Today, Im off. I must say I had a really great time and I am sad to leave. But Ill be back in Calcutta very soon, that Im sure. I still have so much to see and someday my mother and sister India (an infant who has been named after a country the family has never seen) must come here!Turn the page 				 																																																											A brand-new and expanded kids corner, a comprehensive vernacular section, a more spacious and friendly Cha Bar On the whole, a brighter browse-stop with a more cheerful ambience.				 																																																											Oxford Bookstore is gearing up to reinvent itself yet again, dovetailing the brick with the click through fresh initiatives.

So we want to carve out more space for a better laid-out kids corner with a steady stream of events, together with Penguin, says Rajiv Chowdhury, who came aboard as head of the Oxford Bookstore family last year as general manager, E.Books World Pvt Ltd.				 																																																											While a lot of thrust will be on encouraging writing skills among children, an exhibition of books for them is being held in association with Penguin during the summer holidays in June. The vernacular exhibition is slated for July. In keeping with the changing mood, we will have brighter interiors too, promises Chowdhury.

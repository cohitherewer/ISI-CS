 Sunday, July 18, 2004 Bowl em over, babe
Street Party Mandira Bedi plays juggler to an awestruck audience on Saturday. Picture by Aranya Sen She steps out for a six with bat in hand, bowls maidens underhand. She woos with a word, charms with a smile. She acts like a child but shes always a woman  on and off the field.It was her I-dont-know-how-many-in-the-past-six-months visit to the city, but Mandira Bedi, as usual, lived and loved every moment of it.Furthering the cause of womens cricket in an innovative way was the prime agenda on Saturday, with some smart promotion for SET Max (shes the brand ambassador) thrown in.Gully Cricket was the event that brought out the cricketer in the cricket presenter, as she travelled to three corners of the city to have a ball.It was meant to be an exclusive ladies only affair with the woman credited with lending a feminine touch to a mans game. But thats not quite how it turned out. The ladies there were aplenty, some participating, others cheering Mandiras sixes and sweeps, but the men, both young and old, turned up in good numbers to gape at the girl in denim and pink sports vest.There were three addresses for the ladies day out with Mandira  Shubhash Udyan at Bhowanipore, Triangular Park at New Alipore and Subhash Sarovar Ground on CIT Road. In each, a group of women, selected randomly from the locality, bowled, fielded and batted with Mandira in the middle. Each time one of them got her out there were prizes to be won.By the end of the day, it was a tired but pleased-as-punch Mandira who had a hearty south Indian meal and was headed for the airport and back home in Mumbai. Its the most sports-oriented city, was how she summed up her experiences, all in a days work.A lot more women came out to watch here compared to other cities and some of them seemed far sharper in bowling and taking catches, she insisted.The weather stopped short of playing spoilsport in the city of her birth. Weve been very lucky with the monsoons in all the places, even escaping the rains by a day at some, added Mandira, who took to the gullies in Calcutta after covering those in Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Bangalore.The idea is to get more women involved with the game, said Tushar Shah, VP marketing and commercial for SET Max, who accompanied Mandira. With our cricket coverage we had turned them from passive to active viewers and with Gully Cricket we are giving them the opportunity to actively participate.But cricket isnt all that has kept maiden Mandira busy. She flew down recently to Los Angeles for an exclusive interview with the cast of Spiderman 2, including Kirsten Dunst (as leading lady Mary Jane), Alfred Molina (the notorious Doctor Octopus), director Sam Raimi and the spider himself, Tobey Maguire.That, of course, was great fun, but cricket for Mandira means serious business. Weve finally managed to get another sponsor for the Indian womens cricket team, beamed the champion for the cause.The city will soon have more of Mandira, back next week to auction cricket memorabilia and bowl em over again.SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

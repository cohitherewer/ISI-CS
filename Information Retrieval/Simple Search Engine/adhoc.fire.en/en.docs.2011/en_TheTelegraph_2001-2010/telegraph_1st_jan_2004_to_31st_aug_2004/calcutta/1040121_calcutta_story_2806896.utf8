The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004  Calcutta Column
 
	The clock at the main gate of United Bank of Indias head  office, on Old Court House Street, has been out of order  for a while, causing confusion amongst passersby. It should  be repaired. Also, the national flag on another building  in the same street, is not brought down after sunset. The  authorities should look into it.  
	Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane.  
	The MLA and state guesthouses are at one side of our house.  Across the street is the boundary wall of the Geological  Survey of India, which has become an open urinal. It is  a busy road, and people passing through have to suffer the  stench. But not the cops who are on guard. Also, the streetlights  are out for the past six weeks, but the Corporation turns  a blind eye. If the mayor walks down Kyd Street, through  Free School Street, take a left turn towards the five-point  Park Street crossing and proceeds to Exide House, he would  realise that there is no footpath here, forcing pedestrians  to risk life, limb and penalty.  
	B.K. Poddar, Kyd Street.

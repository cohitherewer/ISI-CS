 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Dacoity rerun in trade hub
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four armed dacoits walked away with Rs 3.25 lakh from an iron merchants office on Maharshi Debendra Road, in the Posta police station area, on Wednesday morning. Trader Bhagwanlal Goel, 57, who was struck on the head with the butt of a pipegun, had to be hospitalised.																								Police said the goons struck at around 10.35 am, just after Goel entered the office, took out Rs 1.25 lakh from the almirah and put it on the table.																								The owner of the shop was alone when the dacoits barged in and bolted the door from inside. While one of them stood guard at the door, the others gagged Goel with adhesive tape and tied his legs and hands with nylon rope, said an officer of Posta police station.																								One of the men picked up the Rs 1.25 lakh lying on the table, while the others opened the safe and took away another Rs 2 lakh. Before leaving the office, the goons hit Goel on the head, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Peeyush Pandey.																								Roshanlal Dalmia, Goels business partner, arrived soon after and found Goel lying in the office, bleeding. He was taken to Marwari Relief Society Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment, an officer added.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that the modus operandi was similar to two earlier heists in the Posta-Burrabazar belt. We suspect this gang has struck twice in the past four months. In both cases, they had entered the offices/shops, locked the main entrance from inside, gagged the victims and carried out the dacoity, said an officer of the anti-dacoity wing.

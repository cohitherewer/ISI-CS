 SANJAY MANDAL 				 	 Vidyadhar: Sons quest. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Red tape has thwarted a man from getting back his father, languishing for years in a Pakistani jail. Vidyadhar Patri, a resident of Bhowanipore, who earns his living as a priest at Kalighat temple, thought he had lost his father way back in 1965. His father Ananda, then a sepoy with the Indian Army, never returned from the Indo-Pak war in 1965. Vidyadhar was seven then.																								Almost 40 years later, Vidyadhar and his relatives saw an advertisement in an Oriya daily about a prisoner in a Pakistani jail, who was mentally unsound but could speak Oriya fluently.																								Vidyadhar is now running from pillar to post to get back the man in the photograph, who he identified as his father. Now that the expectations of his family have been raised, it is his job to set in motion the vast, faceless bureaucracy in the external affairs ministry. 																								We have told him that we are still not very sure about the latest development, but we have taken steps to identify Ananda Patri. We have sought recent photographs of the prisoner in the Pakistani jail. We will give Vidyadhar Patri all help in his mission, Arun Singh, joint secretary, external affairs ministry (Pakistan affairs), said over the phone from New Delhi.																								Ananda Patri is from Sashan, Dhusuri, in Bhadrak district of Orissa. I still remember his steel trunk and the army boots when he returned home the last time, Vidyadhar said. Three days after the war broke out, Ananda had sent a telegram to his family asking them to send a message to his bosses to the effect that either his mother or his wife was seriously ill, so that he could return home.																								Three days later, Anandas brother sent an urgent message, but it came back from the warfront. Several days later, a letter written in English reached us but no one in our village could read English, the son said. 																								In 1970, the letter and all the documents relating to Ananda were destroyed in a fire. After his mothers death, Vidyadhar came to Calcutta. After he saw the advertisement, he contacted the Orissa home department and the Bengal Engineer Group and Centre, where his father was recruited. The Orissa government told the external affairs ministry that Vidyadhar has identified the picture as his fathers. But after several months, the government is yet to decide on the issue. Vidyadhar refuses to give up. The officials have promised me to send a larger portrait of the prisoner. But they have not sent it yet, said Patri Junior.

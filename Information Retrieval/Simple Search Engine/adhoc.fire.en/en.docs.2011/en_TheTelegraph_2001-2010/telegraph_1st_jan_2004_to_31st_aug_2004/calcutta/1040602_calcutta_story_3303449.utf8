 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Signs of the times: silence zone boards
 SWATI SENGUPTASOUND CHECK  A list is being readied of some well-known hospitals, nursing homes, courts, schools and colleges where signboards saying silence zones will be put up  Buildings like Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, National Medical College and Hospital, Calcutta University and Calcutta High Court already figure on the list Theres a proposal to include some other important buildings, like Raj Bhavan, on the list Signboards informing people about the dos and donts in silence zones  no honking, ban on firecrackers and microphones within 100 m of the building  will be put up near some of these buildings NGOs may be drafted in the drive to spread awareness about the rules, as its impossible to put up signboards in all the silent zones  Encourage institutions to file complaints with the PCB and/or police if silence zone rules are flouted Silence! The court is in session! Schools and colleges are at work, too. And as for hospitals and nursing homes, round-the-clock silence is mandatory to make patients feel comfortable. 																								Very soon, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) and the city police plan to make motorists and pedestrians aware of this. They have big plans to keep noise levels under check in the designated silence zones of the city. 																								Under the Environment Protection Act, noise level must be maintained at 50 decibels during the day and at 40 decibels at night within a 100-metre radius of schools and colleges, courts, hospitals and nursing homes. These are already identified as silence zones, a PCB law officer said on Sunday. 																								The Noise Pollution Regulation Rules also mention that there must be a complete ban on the use of firecrackers and microphones in the areas, he said. 																								Flouting the rules can lead to fine or imprisonment, or both, according to state PCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar.																								Going by the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules, motorists honking in the no-horn zones can be fined Rs 100 the first time, and Rs 300 from the next time. 																								But we know that many have very little idea about silence zones and in many places, there are no signboards. It is also difficult to monitor motorists all the time. So, we are planning to repeat the rule to everyone concerned, Sarkar said.																								To implement this, the PCB and Calcutta Police are drawing up a list of buildings  all major hospitals, schools, colleges and courts  that will be designated silence zones. 																								It is impossible to erect such signboards at all hospitals, nursing homes, schools and colleges all over the city. That would be expensive and, moreover, the idea is to spread awareness about the rule so that people follow it in all the silence zones of the city, the state PCB member-secretary added. 																								Officials of both wings will meet soon to discuss the matter and chalk out the details. We will discuss what must be written on the boards as instructions to motorists, where they will be displayed and how NGOs can be involved, Sarkar signed off.

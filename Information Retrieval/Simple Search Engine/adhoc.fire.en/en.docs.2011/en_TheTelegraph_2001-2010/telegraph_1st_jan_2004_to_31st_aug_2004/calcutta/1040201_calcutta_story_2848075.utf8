 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Students of Chowringhee KG amp; High School accept the ICC Trophy for Outstanding Achievement on behalf of the school at the Better Calcutta Contest held at Science City on Saturday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Mission impossible  creating a better Calcutta  seems a few steps closer to becoming mission possible, thanks to the efforts of not-so-covert agents  50,000 students from 35 schools  who have taken the challenge head-on.																								Awarding social responsiveness amongst school students, the Better Calcutta Contest is organised annually by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Calcutta Foundation, supported by The Telegraph. Through the years, student involvement has grown and some of the social initiatives undertaken as part of the project have blossomed from sincere efforts to constructive developmental plans, as was clear at the ceremony held at Science City on Saturday, where snapshots of the year-round work were on view.																								For its 365-day dedication to improve health around its humble Sudder Street address and far beyond, the ICC Trophy for Outstanding Achievement was handed over to Chowringhee KG amp; High School. The tiny school has been a consistent award winner at the event, and this year, bagged top honours for enhancing its projects, which include malaria, cardiac and eye camps for all, and medical check-ups and sponsored treatment for the underprivileged. They constructed and maintain a public urinal near Indian Museum. Recently, they have adopted a village in South 24-Parganas, Ghoshpur.																								Another regular chart-topper  Loreto Day School, Sealdah  carried away The Telegraph Trophy for Social Excellence. Maximum use of real estate is how host Barry OBrien summed up the spirit of the school, where every inch is put to use not only for academics, but also to care for the needy. Coming second in the category of social projects was Apeejay School. Sharing third place were Bhowanipore Gujarati Education Society School and G.D. Birla Centre for Education.																								Honouring health-based initiatives, the ICC Trophy for Healthy Living went to Aditya Academy Secondary School, which has added a new project to its varied portfolio  AIDS awareness. Future Hope School stood second, with three schools sharing the third berth  All Bengal Womens Union Primary School, Sir Syed Group of Schools and St Joseph amp; Mary School.																								Upholding sustained efforts with long-term impact was the focus of this years selection. It is nice to give in charity But that is only a temporary solution, explained jury member Lee Alison Sibley, who also sang at the event. Which is why those schools that teach people to help themselves were specially awarded, she added.

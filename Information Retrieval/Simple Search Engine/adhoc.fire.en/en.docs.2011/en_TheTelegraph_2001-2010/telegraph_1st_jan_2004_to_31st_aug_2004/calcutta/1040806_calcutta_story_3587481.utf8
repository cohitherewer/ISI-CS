 															- Banks slash interest rates, open flurry of new loan accounts as Saltlec shops for shares DEVADEEP PUROHIT
	CRAZE FOR: TCS public issue
	CRAZE AT: Saltlec
	BANKING ON: Interest rate on loan dropping from 11 to 12 per cent to 7 to 8 per cent
	SAMPLE SIZE: In three days, SBIs Saltlec branch got 253 new loan accounts and disbursed loans of over Rs 5.66 crore for the public issue
Two-hundred-and-fifty-three new loan accounts in three days at one branch. A bank battle that brings down interest rates on loans from 11 to 12 per cent to around 7 to 8 per cent. A mad scramble at the finance counter of a one-stop shop in tech town.																								Its all happening in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), but, for once, it has nothing to do with software or salaries. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees blue-eyed boys in the states IT hub are all caught up in their new-found craze of capital markets and a mad scramble for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stocks.																								The Tata Sons-owned technology major is going public by issuing 55,452,600 shares to raise around Rs 5,000 crore from the market. The initial public offering, in the price band of Rs 775 and Rs 900, was oversubscribed by 3.40 times by the end of the five-day bidding period, ending Thursday.																								The past two weeks saw hectic marketing activity at Saltlec, with both public and private sector players intensifying their presence. The interest rate on loans was pulled down from 11 to 12 per cent to around 7 to 8 per cent. Participants in the rate push included ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, UTI Bank, State Bank of India (SBI) and Indian Bank.																								The response was phenomenal. We launched a loan scheme for TCS employees on July 29 and in just three days, we got 253 new loan accounts. For this public issue, we have disbursed loans of over Rs 5.66 crore, said Biswatosh Misra of SBIs Saltlec branch. The loan amount ranged from Rs 20,000 to Rs 18 lakh, with a maximum payback period of 60 months.																								According to the branch manager of the leading public sector bank, employees had to work through the night to process so many loan applications in such a short period. Applicants queued up even on August 2, the day Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress called a 12-hour bandh.																								Before this, I had never invested in stocks as I had no knowledge of capital markets. But everyone is saying that the TCS returns would be good. I have applied for 49 shares with the hope of being allotted at least 14, said a young techie in Sector V. The Jadavpur University graduate took a loan from a private sector bank to finance his investment and debut at the bourses.																								The all-action finance counter at Fingertips, the one-stop shop in Sector V, found the tech crowd trooping in to collect share application forms. 																								Saltlec seems really bullish about the TCS issue. Many among the tech brigade didnt even have a demat account (where shares are parked in paperless form), but there was no stopping them, said Alok Mishra of Fingertips.

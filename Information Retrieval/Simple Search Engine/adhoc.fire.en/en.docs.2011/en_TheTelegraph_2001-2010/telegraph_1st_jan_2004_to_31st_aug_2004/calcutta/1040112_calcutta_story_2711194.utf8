 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Mayor lets greens be grabbed and shrunk
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								In 2002, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had announced he would create 100 new parks in the city. Over the past two years, he has not created a single. On the contrary, he has allowed several to be destroyed.																								A good portion of Park Circus Maidan had been fenced off by a tennis organisation for the past several years. On December 21, the mayor inaugurated an indoor badminton stadium there.																								Opposition councillors in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the existing parks are shrinking and thanks to encroachments, the people do not have access to them. 																								The Opposition also accused the mayor of having a double standard: he allowed a badminton stadium on Park Circus Maidan, but had sent civic officials to remove encroachments in Deshapriya Park last year. 																								How can the mayor allow a badminton stadium for a local club at Park Circus, when the Maidan has already shrunk to half its original size because of encroachments? asked local Congress councillor Shammi Jahan. 																								The Opposition alleged that people were grabbing land in parks to build clubs and other establishments. A substantial portion of Park Circus Maidan has been given to a booster station, a gymnasium, a tennis club and now the badminton stadium. The CMC has also been using part of the open space as its own junkyard for handcarts and condemned vehicles, said Jahan.																								 The mayor said the indoor stadium came up with funds provided by MP Ajit Panja from his local area development funds and the inauguration was organised not by the CMC but the club. 																								The encroachments occurred mostly during the tenure of the previous CPM-led civic board, said member, mayor-in-council (parks and gardens), Hridayanand Gupta.

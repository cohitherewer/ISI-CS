 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Oar amp; sail, a crew that dared to tame the tide
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The NCC team of 40 cadets sails into Man-o-War jetty after the 21-day trip. Picture by Aranya Sen																								After braving water currents, at times touching 20 knots an hour, bad weather and incessant rain and the treacherous bends of the Hooghly for 21 days, four Drop Keel whalers touched the Man-o-War jetty on Friday morning. 																								Forty young boys and girls got off the 27-ft boats, which traversed over 430 km just with the help of sails and oars, to tell their tale of courage and conviction. 																								I really enjoyed the sail, though at times I got scared, said Joyoshree Mukherjee, in customary white shirt and trousers with a yellow life-vest wrapped around the neck. The 20-year-old National Cadet Corps (NCC) member was part of the naval NCC sailing expedition team, that started its journey from Farakka and passed through Raghunath Ganj, Plassey, Mayapur and Dakshineswar, before reaching Calcutta.																								For the first-year student of Serampore College, the expedition was great fun. Though Joyoshree hasnt yet drawn up her career plans, senior cadet Mrinal Bairagi said joining the armed forces had always been on his agenda and NCC was the stepping stone. 																								I want to join the armed forces and do something for my country. I have been part of such expeditions earlier and like the tours, as they have made me tougher, said Bairagi, a student of Baruipur College. 																								For Bairagi and the others in his crew, who want to man the borders, guard the coasts and protect the airspace, the preparation could not have been better. A host of senior officers from the Indian Army and the Navy assembled at the jetty to welcome the kids and lauded their efforts. 																								We organise adventure programmes like these for our cadets across the country to prepare them to face challenges. They learn to live on their own and understand the importance of team-work at such outings, said Lt. Gen. B. K. Bopanna, director-general, NCC. 																								According to him, the NCC is kicking off various new adventure programmes for its cadets (over 1.3 million in the country and around 80,000 in the state). 																								We want some of them to join the armed forces, but we are also keen to see them successful in other vocations. Our effort is to inculcate basic citizenship among the cadets and make them more responsible and stronger human beings, added Bopanna. 																								He, along with Srikumar Mukherjee, minister of state for home and civil defence, flagged in the cadets at the jetty. We are trying to broaden NCC involvement in various activities, like disaster management, anti-smoking campaigns and environmental awareness programmes, quot; said Mukherjee.

  Frontier friendship: The tour members back from the TTIS trip  Apropos the report Holiday cut to complete syllabus (Jan 19), it is interesting to note that the Higher Secondary (HS) Council is considering the feasibility of curtailing holidays in order to cover the revised syllabus.  It is acknowledged that schools under the council have less working days compared to those under ICSE and CBSE boards. The syllabus has been remodelled to meet the present-day requirements. In these times of competition, a proper education has assumed increased significance. In some schools, the syllabus is not covered or covered in a half-hearted fashion, and students face an uphill task for the examinations. So an increased number of working days will yield little appreciable results unless a drastic change is brought about in the attitude, habit and philosophy of teachers.  The students also need to be interested enough to attend school regularly and come prepared in class. Simultaneously, something should be done to help bridge the wide gap in standards between the secondary and HS courses. Piyal Mukherjee,
Lake Town. Kudos to Metro for highlighting the experiences of students and teachers on the trip to Lahore organised by The Telegraph in Schools, during which they interacted freely with Pakistani students. (Peace quest begets friendship fest, Jan. 19). These kids are far better ambassadors than A.B. Vajpayee or Pervez Musharraf can ever be. Such goodwill visits will create better understanding and ease tension. Bhupen Bose,
Dum Dum Park. The report Unpaid bills snap Lalbazar phone lines (City diary, Jan. 16) was a glaring example of the lackadaisical attitude of a section of government officials. We should not blame Calcutta Telephones for disconnection of the phone lines for non-payment of bills. After all, the phone lines were restored after the bills were paid on the same day. Mohan Lal Sarkar,
Budge Budge. Apropos the report 18 years to rip off thief tag (Jan. 16), it is sad to note how long it takes for a case to be resolved. During this period, Animesh Sengupta had to live with the tarnished name of a thief. Even his son deserted him. The case urgently calls for a review of our judicial procedure so that cases, specially of such a sensitive nature, can be cleared in haste. Sengupta suffered despite being innocent. Rabindra Nath Sarkar,
Sankar Ghosh Lane. The struggle of the Barailys of Behala touches ones heart (After killer oil, cold shoulder for family on crutches, Jan 14). As public memory is too short to remember them and as this will not affect the poll prospects, nothing will be done for them. Is this Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees better governance? Sayan Ghosh,
Baghbazar. The government is least bothered about the sufferings of the Barailys. But now that the incident has hit the front page after 14 years and the polls are knocking at the doors, the party will lend a shoulder to these victims for the time being. Gunjeet S. Wadhwa, 
Rai Bahadur Road. The report Dogfight over canine control (Jan. 14) points to the lackadaisical attitude of the NGOs funded by the government. The stray dog population is a problem. The government should help NGOs who can do the job. Sunil Banerjee,
VIP Road. It is sad that the appointment of a permanent director for National Library has caused a controversy (Discord over director for National Library, Jan. 19). Although the library is one of the largest in Asia, its service leaves much to be desired. An administrative head is sorely needed. Prahlad Agarwala,
Nadia. The fire services departments plan to conduct a safety check on big commercial buildings and highrises through private agencies is quite reasonable. (Private agencies to monitor fire safeguards, Jan 20). Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
Behala.

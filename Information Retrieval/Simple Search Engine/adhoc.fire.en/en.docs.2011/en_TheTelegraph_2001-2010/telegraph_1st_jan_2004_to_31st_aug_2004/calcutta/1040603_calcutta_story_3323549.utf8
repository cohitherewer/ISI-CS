 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Graft-bust NGO in line of doctor ire
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An NGO authorised by Alimuddin Street to weed out corruption from Medical College and Hospital (MCH) is embroiled in a controversy, after doctors of the hospital objected to charges levelled at them. 																								A delegation of doctors met health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and Jayshree Mitra, college principal, a few days ago to lodge complaints against the voluntary organisation, Sajan, which, they alleged, is conspiring against the doctors instead of counselling patients.																								Doctors, owing allegiance to the pro-left Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD) told both the minister and senior party leaders that the NGO be instructed to stick to counselling and not spying on doctors. 																								They claimed that the NGO did not have the necessary clearance from the government to conduct independent inquiries. 																								They are supposed to counsel patients and direct them to the right places, but of late, the NGO members seem to have forgotten that, said a doctor, who was part of the delegation.																								On Wednesday morning, the situation worsened when a Sajan member was chased by an armed man, who allegedly threatened to kill him. The NGO immediately lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station. 																								Bhaskar Sinha, secretary of Sajan, said he was not worried at all by the recent controversy. We know that doctors have met the principal and even the health minister. We have stumbled upon corruption at the Medical College and Hospital and it seems that some doctors do not want us to work here, Sinha said. 																								He added that of late, he was under tremendous pressure from a wide cross-section of medical personnel, who, he said, were trying to throw him out. What they dont know is that we will also do the same work in other hospitals, he observed.																								For the past several months, the NGO has been trying to help patients not to fall into the tout trap at the hospital. On numerous occasions, the NGO caught several touts red-handed and handed them over to the police, but things took an ugly turn ever since the NGO started pointing fingers at doctors. 																								Recently, they sent a secret report to the state health minister and other senior health department officials about the activities of some Medical College staff, including doctors, which AHSD members dismissed as false.

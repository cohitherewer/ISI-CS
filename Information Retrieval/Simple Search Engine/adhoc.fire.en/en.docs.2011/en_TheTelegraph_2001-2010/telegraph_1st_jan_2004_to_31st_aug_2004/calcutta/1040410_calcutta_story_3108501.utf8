The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Diary quest in blue-film bust
 															- Shadow of sleaze syndicate on husbands clamour for contacts A STAFF REPORTER																								Lone pervert or cog in the sleaze wheel? Was S.K. Nayar trying to make a foray into the world of pornographic film-making alone, or was he acting on the behest of a large organised racket?																								These questions dominated the probe into the sex, abuse and videotape scandal at a Lake Town home. Sleuths grappled with the loose ends on Friday, even as Nayars wife complained that some unknown men were threatening her for blowing the whistle.																								The woman, according to a colleague, was also being hounded from various quarters following her decision to file a complaint against her husband and have him arrested.																								As reported in Metro on Thursday, a 26-year-old woman had accused her husband, S.K. Nayar, of hounding her for contact details of some sex workers and call girls she had been counselling as part of a project for the non-government organisation (NGO) she works for. Nayars wife went on to allege that he had been torturing her for months as she refused to pass on the names and numbers. 																								I realised that he wanted to contact the girls to engage them in a blue-film racket, she had complained to police. Nayar was then arrested and is now in jail custody.																								Police suspect that it is virtually impossible for Nayar to pull off a sleaze racket alone, as he was unemployed and did not have the required resources. 																								There must be an organised group he is working for. So, we are not just interested in Nayar and the crime he has committed. We are looking at a group that is possibly behind him and the bigger picture of a sleaze syndicate, said an officer on the case.																								Police are still on the lookout for the womans diary, containing the names and phone numbers of women her organisation was working with. Sitaram Sinha, officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station, said: The root of all the trouble seems to lie in the diary. A lot of things would become clearer once we get that.																								An officer said there was some concern over the woman not pushing the case against her husband. When contacted in office, a colleague, who had accompanied her to Lake Town police station to lodge the complaint, said on Friday: She is under tremendous pressure. She has a job to keep and there is the social stigma.																								According to the colleague, Nayars wife has been ordered out of their rented flat by the landlord. She went to the house with her father  who has come down from Chennai  to plead with the landlord.

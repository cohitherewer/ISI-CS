 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 From here to Dee, a boat in hearty hues
 															- Collaborative link in tribute chain				 	 Scotsman Kenny Munro supervises the Sonar Tari painting workshop. Picture by Amit Datta 																								Sonar Tari, the 18-ft-long wooden boat adorning the School of Art and Crafts sprawling courtyard in Asgar Mistri Lane, towers above the painters  mostly in the three to eight age-group  trying to draw patterns. 																								The excitement is palpable, for the concept is new and the choice of canvas unusual. Also, the idea that the painted boat will set sail on the river Dee, in Scotland, in autumn this year makes the spirits soar.																								Mixing colours on a palette, Scotsman Kenny Munro occasionally glances at his young students so keen on fortifying the link he has forged between India and his homeland. 																								Under Munros supervision, the boat-painting workshop, part of a chain of events celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Sir Patrick Geddes, is on in full swing, with about 100-odd students of the school run by the artist couple Tandra Chanda and Pulak Ghosh. 																								The Scottish ecologist and humanitarian Geddes worked in India in the 20th Century and had struck up a friendship with Rabindranath Tagore, who shared with him the ideas of cross-cultural exchanges, says Munro, in the city as part of the Ballater Geddes Project 2004. 																								With adequate experience of carrying out collaborative programmes with Australia and France, the 50-year-old had breezed through Calcutta in 2002 and also taken a trip to Santiniketan to study the contemporary education system. 																								The other task was to carry out a feasibility report on forging links between schools in Scotland and India.																								This time though, the visual artist-cum-sculptor is at the helm of affairs, reviving the historic link with a reciprocal programme through the expressive arts involving schoolchildren. 																								We are also planning to organise web-conferencing between the schools here and there. I have brought pictures and other materials as gifts from two schools in Scotland, while the School of Art and Craft students plan to gift them the boats they have made from paper in various shapes and sizes, says Munro, who has practised visual arts for about 25 years. 																								In the past 15 years, though, Munro also became interested in education and diversified in order to survive. Apart from sculpting and painting, I am into creative writing and playing music, and also like to act as a catalyst in raising awareness on cultural diversities, he smiles. 																								He will soon take a trip to Balagarh, a village of boatmakers about 65 km from Howrah, to document the people and their habitat.																								Coming up on the School of Art and Craft premises over the fortnight are a discussion on the philosophies of Sir Patrick Geddes and Rabindranath Tagore, to be followed by a cultural procession with the painted boat on and around the CIT Road area. In August, Sonar Tari will travel to Scotland for a journey down the Dee.						 RESHMI SENGUPTA

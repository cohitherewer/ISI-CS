The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Let the PMs office go pro
 Pop picks: ( from  top) Jassi for her integrity, President A.P.J. Abdul  Kalam and Prof Amartya Sen for their intellect The readers of Young Metro speak  about politics. Dwindling faith in the powers that be is  the tone of this weeks e-mail responses to the Time to  Talk question: Who would you want as Prime Minister (politician/non-politician)  and why?				 				 																															Jassi, or Jasmeet Walia, the lead  of the soap Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, ought to be the  Prime Minister of our country. Though the suggestion may  be shocking to some people, this would be the right choice.  Jassis confidence and style may need some polishing, but  she is hardworking, trustworthy, sincere, intelligent, dutiful  and truthful. But that might also make her the worst Prime  Minister, in the eyes of most. No scams, no dishonesty,  no scandals, no crafty lies Adwaita Das,
 Jadavpur University l would definitely go for a non-politician.  Politicians in our country have become a clan of people  who work for vested interests and have extremely inflated  egos. I would want someone who is not self-centred. We must  rid the system of bribery and fraud. There are many promises  made before taking the chair, but unfortunately, these are  usually broken. To see India through these challenging times,  a serious change in mentality is what we need. Tanmoy Das Lala,
 St Xaviers Collegiate School Politicians are not interested  in the welfare of the country and the uplift of the people.  They only care about power. They are known to have underworld  contacts, leading to the spread of crime through political  circles. Muscle power is being used to grab votes. So I  would prefer a non-politician to be the Prime Minister. Saurabh Dhanuka,
 Class XI, Birla High School Politics is getting murkier these  days. Few politicians rise above party ideology with action,  not just words. A Prime Minister with no political past  might be a refreshing change. The first man that comes to  mind is President A.PJ. Abdul Kalam. His clean image and  inspiring words, along with his courage to breach protocol,  set him apart. He is a visionary who can bring in meaningful  change. Koyel Basu,
 Media Studies, Calcutta University Since Independence, politicians  have not really helped the countrys economy. Only after  economist Manmohan Singh took charge as finance minister  did we progress. Intellectuals can solve the nations problems  better than politicians. 				 				 																															President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam should handpick a team of ministers from the available talent in the country and nominate one as Prime Minister. Two names come to mind: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and former IIT director Dr P.V. Indiresan.				 				 																															C.V. Krishnamoorthy The most suitable person for the  post of Prime Minister would be a politician. An experienced  hand will better apprehend the various problems associated  with politics, security and foreign relations.

	A Romantic affair The week was a run-up to Valentines Day, but it was romanticism of a different kind that was the talking point at Jadavpur University, and the names doing the rounds were Keats and Coleridge, Byron and the Brontes. 				 				 																															The 11th annual seminar of the Centre for Studies in Romantic Literature started on a supernatural note. The opening paper was Mesmerism and Shamanism and Coleridges supernatural ballads by Timothy Fulford from Nottingham Trent University in the UK. The paper discussed how James Anton Mesmer created a stir in that period by curing patients with a material fluid that he claimed to be transmitting from himself to the patients and back. This phenomenon, Fulford claimed, offered a key to the politics of the age as well as the use of the supernatural in Coleridges poetry. 				 				 																															Debnita Chakravarti showed how Mary Robinson, a famous actress and mistress of the Prince of Wales, tried to regain a lost name by writing poetry under the pseudonym Sappho. Rimi B. Chatterjee provided an insight into Shelleys view of social change. Young scholars Amrit Sen, Nishi Pulugurtha and Niladri Chatterjee also presented interesting papers. But the presentation that sparked the maximum discussion was Souvik Mukherjees take on computers in the Romantic Age, bringing in algorithms and artificial intelligence in the literary setting. The link with literature  Ada Lovelace, said to be the first computer programmer, was Byrons daughter.				 				 																															The second day, which opened with Prof Fulfords paper on British Orientalists in Calcutta in the 18th Century, featured the Know Your Romantics quiz, an event for undergraduate students that traditionally brings the curtains down.				 				 																															The preliminary round was held in the suitably romantic setting on the banks of the university pond. Five teams made it to the final, which now moved into the HL Roy auditorium. The teams were quizzed on a variety of topics  from biographical anecdotes to happenings around the world in those times. Even Bridget Jones Diary and The Doors made an entry due to their connection with Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice and Blakes The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, respectively. The frantic acting in the dumb charade raised a lot of laughter but brought in crucial points in the penultimate round. It came down to a tie-breaker in the end between Don Juan, the defending champions comprising Debojoy Chanda and Abhishek Sarkar of UG II, and the Knights at Arms, Soumik Datta and Somnath Basu of UG I. The decider saw experience scoring over innocence, with Don Juan romping home.				 				 																
	 Get real				 				 																															The B.Com students of St Xaviers College have, for the past few years, been making the real corporate world their lab. Beyond Chalk and Talk saw second-year students presenting reports on their summer projects of 2003 at the college auditorium. The 11 projects covered issues including Indias emergence as the back office of the world through the business-process outsourcing boom, emotional intelligence and the possibilities of credit cards for college-goers.				 				 																															Three projects shared first place. One traced Reliance Infocomms success, the other examined ITCs foray into greeting cards with Expressions, and the third unearthed the changing values of todays youth. The last project revealed that 80 per cent of students bother little about whether a mosque or a temple comes up at Ayodhya. But at the same time, they support cause-related marketing of products.

	 V for values				 				 																															The holistic development cell of JD Birla Institute presented an open-house symposium. Held on February 9, at the Vidya Mandir auditorium, it set out to promote value inculcation in institutes of higher studies. 				 				 																															It began with a welcome note by college principal Jharna Sengupta, after which chairperson Prof Sanjoy Mukherjee, of the Centre for Human Values, IIM Calcutta, took over. T.R. Krishnaswamy of Chinmaya Mission, Mumbai, Muralidhar Koteshwar of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir Trust and Father P. Eaton of St Xaviers College discussed the approach to value-based education. The audience of students, parents, alumni and teachers took part in the interactive session.  Nishi Jalan,

	 Clone conflict				 				 																															The Debating Society of Loreto College organised an intra-college debate and an elocution competition. The motion before the house was whether human cloning should be banned. Seven teams from various departments were moderated by Shreya Shukla. The English department, represented by first-year students, emerged clear victors, while Sravasti Datta from the history department was declared best speaker. At the elocution competition, Shaon Roy Choudhury and Penelope Braganza were declared the best in Bengali and English, respectively.  Suchi Arya,

	 Special mention				 				 																															Arunika Das, a student of Our Lady Queen of Mission school, bagged the Jurys Special Mention Award at the National finals of Classmate Young Author contest. She was up against over 15,000 students from 500 schools across Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kochi. Arunika got to meet Ruskin Bond and other jurors after her victory, which was a dream come true for the Class XII student.

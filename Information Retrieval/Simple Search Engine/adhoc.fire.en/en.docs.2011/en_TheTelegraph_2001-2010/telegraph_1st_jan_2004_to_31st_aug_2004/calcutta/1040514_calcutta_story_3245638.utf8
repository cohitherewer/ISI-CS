 Friday, May 14, 2004  The City Diary
																																																																																		Thursday was the hottest day of the season so far with the mercury climbing up to 40.3 degrees Celsius. Officials at the regional meteorological centre at Alipore said the maximum temperature was four degrees above normal. This is the highest temperature we have recorded so far and tomorrow, too, the maximum temperature is likely to hover around 40 degrees, an official said. The Met office explained that from Wednesday itself there was a change in the wind pattern with hot and dry air rushing into Calcutta and the districts from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Though earlier a lot of moisture had come in from the Bay of Bengal, the sudden change in the wind pattern has raised the temperature. So, the weather has become both hot and humid, the official added. 																																																		A cyclist was run over by a private bus on Southern Avenue, in the Lake police station area, at around 8.30 am on Thursday. Twenty-year-old Sumit Das, a resident of Telipara Lane, was thrown off his cycle after a motorcycle hit him near Southern Park. A bus on route 234, which was overtaking the two-wheeler, crushed him under its rear wheels. Das was killed on the spot. Both the motorcyclist and the driver immediately fled the spot fearing the wrath of the local residents, police said. Das was taken to National Medical College and Hospital where he was declared brought dead. The identities of the motorcyclist and the bus driver have not been established yet as eyewitnesses had failed to take down the registration numbers of the two vehicles. 																																																		Four persons were injured in a fire in an embroidery workshop in Kazipara, under Shibpur police station, on Thursday morning. Two fire engines from the Shibpur fire station reached the spot within half an hour and doused the flames. Police said the four persons were under medical supervision at Howrah District Hospital. According to the fire brigade officials, the primary cause of the blaze appears to be a short-circuit in the main electric meter-box located inside the shop.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Reshuffle at hospital
 															- SSKM eyes emergency wing revamp A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government is considering a revamp of the emergency set-up at SSKM Hospital, the apex teaching hospital in the city.																								The hospital has recently been in the eye of a storm after a series of deaths  starting with Rajnis Patel in June 2003 and the most recent casualty being 74-year-old Subhendu Bikash Ghoshal last week  rocked the hospital.																								Last Wednesday, Ghoshal was made to wait for 40 minutes without any medical attention. Then a ward boy transferred him to the Mackenzie ward of the hospital and whipped off the oxygen mask without even bothering to wait for attending doctors or nurses. 																								The government had sought a report from the SSKM authorities after health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra paid a surprise visit to the hospital.																								Health department officials said the hospital authorities had suggested a reshuffle of manpower in the emergency wing. The emergency wing now has two sections  the outpatients department and the observation ward, where eight sets of health personnel work. A merger of the personnel has been suggested, in addition to a request for more doctors and nurses. 																								All we are trying to do is revamp the emergency wing so that people can benefit further from the facility. We have received a lot of equipment, said Santanu Tripathi, hospital superintendent.																								Health department officials indicated that the hospital authorities have stressed on fresh ideas. Two senior on-call doctors, instead of one, has been recommended. We would benefit even if we have more junior doctors at our disposal. The idea is to have more doctors for round-the-clock service, an official said.																								This apart, officials said the government would grant permission for more manpower and equipment. Similar changes will also be made in other city hospitals plagued by the same problem.																								The hospital recently got a few trolleys equipped with in-built oxygen cylinders. One such trolley was used to take Ghoshal to the ward, but that did not help, as he died within minutes of reaching the ward.

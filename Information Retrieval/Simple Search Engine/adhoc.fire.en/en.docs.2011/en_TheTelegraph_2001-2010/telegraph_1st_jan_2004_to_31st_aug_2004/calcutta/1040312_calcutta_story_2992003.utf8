The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Twins ring up dues in crores
 																											- Defaulters range from blue-chip firms to man next door, plus cops SUNANDO SARKAR																								The sins of the past are visiting Calcutta Telephones.																								Ever careful about plugging leaks in revenue (in the form of pending bills), the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd subsidiary and its twin that manages telecom services elsewhere in the state are having to face the onslaught of private service-providers with a millstone weighing Rs 334 crore around their neck.																								A huge percentage of the outstanding bills  that Calcutta Telephones and West Bengal Telecom has not collected  can be traced back to the addresses of some of the other government offices and public sector units working from the city, say officials.																								From a blue-chip public-sector giant to the police station where one goes to lodge an unpaid-bill complaint, the list of defaulters taking advantage of the telecom giants refusal to check its leaking taps is lengthy and looks familiar.																								These units are not running at a loss, said a BSNL revenue wing official. But, taking advantage of BSNL laxity and often using their influence, they stonewall our repeated reminders for paying up, he added.																								The largest subscribers forum in the city, the Telephone Services Society (TSS), has suggested that BSNL, like banks and other offices dealing with huge arrears, set up a task force to deal with the problem.																								These people have to be shamed into paying their bills, said TSS secretary T.S. Srinivasan. Something like stickers outside their gates, or lawful demonstrations, can do the trick, he added.																								The number of factories shutting down in the Calcutta Telephones area over the past few years, too, has hurt. It is next to impossible to collect arrears from these firms that once existed, said a BSNL official.																								Most of the remaining outstanding bill amounts can be traced back to the gentleman or the lady next door who, after running a business from home  and running up a bill of lakhs  would shut shop when slapped with a disconnection order.																								Some recent rule reforms have given BSNL more teeth to deal with errant subscribers. They involve disconnecting  first the outgoing-call facility and then the incoming calls, as well  before the expiry of a cycle if the bill remains unpaid.																								But the citys growing pay-later breed has found a way around that as well. 																								There are several extended families that have many lines in the same building, said a Calcutta Telephones official. If one line is disconnected, theres no stopping service to another line, he explained.

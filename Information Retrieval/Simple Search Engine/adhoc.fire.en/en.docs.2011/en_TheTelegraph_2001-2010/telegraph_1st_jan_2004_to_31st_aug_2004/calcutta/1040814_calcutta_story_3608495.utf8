Baby's Day In Kids have fun with colours as they try their hands at printing. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya. Location courtesy: Kislaya Montessori Making a mighty mess is what toddlers love to do. Going out in the rain for a splash in muddy puddles might be overdoing it, but restricting them to the home this monsoon need not necessarily be a hectic hell. Keeping the kids occupied is not a tough task, especially if you let them cut and paste, colour and print and generally be creative without being catastrophic.With a few precautionary measures, it could be as easy as one, two, three for mothers and babies  well, at least for a while. One of the most painless and simple art-and-craft Montessori methods to help them pass time and learn is printing. Nothing makes them happier than colours and paints. And what better way to hear the delightfully naughty giggles than giving them the perfect opportunity to play with paint.Dont panic  the mess is eminently cleanable without too much fuss and with minimum precautions. Every activity should be supervised by at least one adult. However, to avoid being stuck indoors everyday, you could take turns, clubbing kids together with one parent watching over them per session.Print modeMethod: Just let the youngsters dip the items into large bowls of poster paint and dab them on paper. As easy as apple pie.Creative tools: Hand, foot, finger, flower, vegetable, sponge, straw all materials easily available in the house. When it comes to vegetables, potatoes and ladyfingers are usually the obvious choices. Try and cut capsicum or beans, while half onions create symmetrical rings. Squeezy sponges are also ideal for tiny tots, since little hands find it easier to grab and dab. Big, fluffy flowers like marigold provide hours of delight, too. Straws are another favourite  dip them in paint and blow them on paper for a random splatter. Flat or round thick brushes and empty thread spools are an option, too.Caution: Keep large bowls of water and a cloth around, for easy cleanup. A big plastic sheet spread over the entire area is a good idea, as well as small plastic aprons for the kiddies. Poster paint is easily washed off, so dont worry about stained hands, feet or faces. As for the paper, the flip side of used paper is fine, as are newspapers (not the days, please).Some other optionsColour crazySticking to the theme of colour, just leave the children with some paper and crayons and let them doodle to their hearts content. But keep an eye out for wall graffiti. You could give them shapes to trace or an object to copy, an idea to mull over or just outlined drawings to colour in. The good ol colouring book is usually a hit.Crafts cornerDraw a big shape on a large sheet of paper and paint it with gum. Provide the tots with kite or crepe paper, let them tear it to shreds  something they absolutely adore doing, anyway  roll them up and then paste it inside the shape. Gum is messy and tearing is destructive, so the youngsters are sure to love it. To avoid chaos, cover the area with a sheet, use aprons and leave bowls of water and a cloth around.Rhythm rageTheres nothing like a song and dance to get the little ones going. Put on some music and let them hop around. Just make sure theres a big empty space so they dont bump into things. Teach them some new tunes with catchy words and actions to match. But this is a time-consuming exercise. While a new song or a dance is more interesting, reciting the old nursery rhymes in a new way never fails to make them smile. Kids love a stuck record, so play it againAnd finallyChildren love storytelling sessions, with loud sounds and exaggerated actions and expressions. A few impromptu puppets or soft toys acting as the characters of the stories add to the entertainment. Story-telling requires time and effort, as a simple reading from a book will bore them after a while.NISHA LAHIRI

 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Blacklisted billboard in vanish act
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The morality brigade of Calcutta Police has undertaken a drive to give the city a more sober look by blacklisting billboards and advertisements portraying women in an indecent fashion.																								To kick off its campaign, the detective department has slapped a criminal suit on sponsors and organisers of a show to be hosted on April 23 by a city hotel.																								According to deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh, several complaints had been lodged against an obscene billboard portraying a scantily-clad woman atop a popular restaurant at the Park StreetAJC Bose Road crossing.																								The hoarding may prove to be a distraction for motorists, and even cause a fatal accident. So, the anti-rowdy section of the detective department has started a suo motu case at Beniapukur police station, explained Singh.																								The case has been registered under Section III of the Indecent Representation of Women Prohibition Act, 1986, which can lead to up to two years of imprisonment.																								Deputy commissioner (traffic) Piyush Pande received the complaint and met commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty before we decided to undertake the task of giving the city a cleaner and more sober look, Singh added.																								By Wednesday evening, however, the billboard of contention had somewhat mysteriously disappeared from the spot.																								The sponsors and the hotel management hosting the programme have been in touch with some senior officers, but the law will take its own course, said an officer on the case.

Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Siamese similarities with Indias culture and religion have prompted yet another Thai festival in the city. On till April 7, the festival will feature a wide variety of Thai dance, hugely inspired by Indian mythology and cuisine.																								Kicking off the festival at the Hyatt Regency on Thursday, ambassador of Thailand to India Chirasak Thanesnant said: Our language, art, dance, customs and religion have been influenced by Indian culture and we are glad to present this bouquet of Thai delights at this meet. 																								Pentip Chuntoodom director of the Lopburi Dramatic Arts College, Thailand, was absolutely thrilled at the opportunity to bring 20 to 30 forms of dance from various regions of the country to the festival.																								The clutch of exotica will also feature a brand new mask dance culled from the Ramayana, reveals Pentip.																								Thai consul-general Wanna Perngmark echoed her sentiments when he took a walk through history to recount the close bond shared by India and Thailand over the years.																								The two countries have been close for thousands of years now. It is but imperative that it should be so as our primary religion  Buddhism  has also come from India, he explained.																								Stressing his commitment to the promotion of cultural ties between India and Thailand, he said that an MoU has been signed by the two nations to further such cultural exchanges.																								The mood of friendship was reflected in their dance, the first of which took place at the Salt Lake hotel on Thursday evening. The dance drew inspiration from the Ramakien or the Thai version of the Ramayana. Themes include praise of Krut or the giant bird Garuda, the vehicle of Vishnu.																								The sensuous moves of the dancers, who rely heavily on the use of hand mudras, are accompanied by the lilting beats of traditional Thai music, reminiscent of the Indian tabla and sarangi. The costumes are rich in colour and style and vary from region to region. 																								The marriage of cultures is found in Thai cuisine as well, evidence of which is at hand at the food festival, also on till April 7, at the Waterside Cafe.																								One will get glimpses of the festival at CC amp;FC on April 3, Tollygunge Club on April 4, Madhusudan Mancha on April 5, Science City on April 6 and the Hyatt Regency through the week. The festival is slated to travel to Hyderabad for a similar show.																								The week-long fiesta is organised by the Royal Thai Embassy, New Delhi, and the Thai Consulate-General, Calcutta, in association with the Information and Cultural Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal; Anamika Kala Sangam, Calcutta; Hyatt Regency, Calcutta; Tollygunge Club; CCFC; and Thai Airways International Public Co. Ltd.

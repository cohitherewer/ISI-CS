The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Court defence for doctors in the dock
 															- Mistrust in patient-physician relationship ruining healthcare, says judge OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Bruised by horror stories, ranging from negligence to money-spinning, the citys medical community on Tuesday was administered a balm by Calcutta High Court.																								There is a trend these days to malign doctors or drag them to court over negligence of duties. But remember, doctors are not killers. They perform their duties to save the lives of patients, said Justice Barin Ghosh.																								He was disposing of a writ petition filed by Kaushik Das of Contai, in East Midnapore, alleging that his brother Tapan, 30, had died due to negligence and rash treatment at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals in July 2003. Das had also alleged in his petition that the Phoolbagan police refused to act when he lodged a complaint against the hospital on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.																								Petitioners lawyer Anil Jana told the court that Tapan had been admitted to the hospital on July 29, 2003, at about 9 am. At around 9.30 am, he was sent for endoscopy, where he started bleeding profusely. He died nearly three-and-a-half hours later, the lawyer said.																								The judge then turned on the petitioner who had lost his brother, allegedly due to negligence on the part of the doctor. Did he (the doctor) know your brother before you approached him for his treatment? If not, then what could be the motive that prompted him to kill your brother? You are indirectly suggesting that the doctor is a murderer. I would request you and like-minded people to ponder the issue before dragging a doctor to court, Justice Ghosh said.																								How will the healthcare system work if the public loses its faith in the doctors, demanded the judge. The entire system may collapse due to the present state of affairs, the distrust in the doctor-patient relationship, he observed.																								After hearing both the parties, the judge disposed of the matter with a simple directive to Phoolbagan police to complete their investigation within a reasonable period. But before that, he stressed how the present trend to blame doctors for wrong treatment with the passing away of any family member was affecting the entire healthcare system. Doctors are unable to perform under the pressure, as they are constantly thinking about the reaction if they fail to save the ailing, said Justice Ghosh.																								According to the court, if a doctor loses his confidence, the patients will suffer the most. What does the doctor do these days? When one goes to him, he simply refers the patient to a pathological laboratory and asks him to get the several test reports. The patient, in turn, spends a fortune to meet his demands. The health deteriorates with the rising bill and by the time the treatment is started, the patients family cannot make two ends meet, observed the judge.																								In the past, doctors used to carry out diagnosis by observing the patient and studying the symptoms, Justice Ghosh said. They would not take any time to start treating the patient. But doctors nowadays do not take that risk and depend on pathology reports, he added.

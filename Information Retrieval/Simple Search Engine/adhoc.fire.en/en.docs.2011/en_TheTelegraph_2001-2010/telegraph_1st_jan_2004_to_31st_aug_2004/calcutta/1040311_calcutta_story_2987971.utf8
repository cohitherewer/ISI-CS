 																											- Engine upgrade only way out, transport lobby tells minister A STAFF REPORTER																								With three weeks to go for the Calcutta High Court deadline on Bharat Stage II compliance, the transport operators lobbies have acted as expected  reiterating their inability to keep the tryst.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, along with his departmental officials, sat at the Bharat II talks table on Wednesday with transport operators.																								The common cry from the transport lobby was that switching engines was just not feasible, so upgrading the old engines with anti-pollution devices was the only way out.																								Chakraborty informed the operators that they were expected to abide by the court order and adopt concrete measures to comply with the Bharat II norms.																								We have received a report from the technical committee, set up by the government, to find out ways and means for Bharat II compliance. I request you to submit a detailed report on the matter, the minister told the transport operators.																								We will soon appeal to the court, citing the problems as per the technical committees report, and seek an extension of the deadline. You may like to become a party to the case to voice your problems or suggestions, Chakraborty added.																								Though some private car-owners have changed their old engines and some have switched over to LPG, commercial vehicle owners, especially those of buses, minibuses and goods vehicles, are still reluctant to toe the Bharat II line.																								Of about 100,000 non-Bharat II commercial vehicles (7,500 buses, 5,000 minibuses, 30,000 taxis, 15,000 autorickshaws, 15,000 trucks, 12,000 medium goods vehicles and 15,000 other vehicles) plying in the city, not a single commercial vehicle owner has changed engines yet.																								We have to spend at least Rs 3 lakh to replace the old engine with a Bharat II-compliant one. But if we fit one of the proven anti-pollution devices to the engine, it will cost, at best, Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. Many such devices have come up in the market. Let the transport department take the responsibility to choose any of these, Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said during the meeting.																								The transport department had earlier rejected the transport operators plea to allow anti-pollution devices, saying they were not approved by the authorities. Besides, there was no provision in the existing Motor Vehicle Rules for such devices.																								According to transport department sources, the government is likely to appeal to the court next week and seek more time for the implementation of the Bharat II standards.																								This pushback plaint will be based on the technical committee report and observations from the transport operators.

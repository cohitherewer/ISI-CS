																																																		Raids at two units at Barrackpore and Shyamnagar, in North 24-Parganas, have busted a racket in poppadoms being sold under a reputed brand. The poppadums were manufactured, packaged and distributed from the units, police said. Owner Rajesh Khanna was arrested. The Mumbai office of the brand-owners, Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad, had received numerous complaints about the quality of its product, police said. The packets of the fake papads have one difference with the original: the registered office address printed on the packet reads differently. The original reads: Oracle Point, Third Floor, Next To Sahakar Bazar, Opposite Railway Station, Bandra (West), Mumbai -- 400050. A spokesperson for the Udyog said that consumers of Lijjat papad should check the address printed on the packet before purchasing it to avoid fakes.																																																		A tramcar jumped the rails at the Hatibagan-Bidhan Sarani intersection around 7.15 pm on Sunday, causing massive traffic disruptions for over half an hour in north Calcutta. Traffic on Bidhan Sarani, near Hedua, came to a standstill, with half the road blocked by the derailed tram. The other half got clogged in no time as drivers, in their attempts to manoeuvre around the tram, got in the way of oncoming traffic from the other side. The snarl extended well past Vivekananda Road, up to College Street.																																																		A 26-year-old housewife committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling fan in her room at Garia on Sunday evening. After receiving a complaint from her parents, the police have detained the husband for interrogation.

(Right): Sanjit Kumar Naskar with his parents																								Sanjit Naskar can now breathe easy. After having ranked 32nd in Joint Entrance Examination 2004, he was not being able to realise his dream of becoming a doctor. 																								All because his family cant afford his education any further.																								Reading about his plight on the Net edition of a city-based daily, two Calcuttans studying at the State University of New York have decided to contribute a part of their stipends to help Sanjit pursue his dreams.																								Gautam Kumar Paul and Sohini Bose, both residents of south Calcutta, will send $25 every month to Sanjit, whose father ekes out a living selling fruits at Jagubabur Bazaar, Bhowanipore. 																								The first cheque for $25 reached Sanjit last week. Gautam and Sohini both assured the budding doctor that they would be sending the amount every month for the entire duration of his course  four years.																								Gautam stood second in the Madhyamik examinations of 1995 and is presently doing a Ph.D programme in computer science and technology. 																								Gautam got in touch with his father soon after he came to know about Sanjits plight.																								In an e-mail to his father, Gautam wrote: I can feel what sort of nightmare a brilliant student has to experience if his study faces a sudden halt only because of a monetary problem. So, I want to help him. You speak to him and tell him that I want to help him. 																								In New York, Gautam spoke to his friend Sohini, who, too, is enrolled in a Ph.D course in micro-biology. 																								Sohini reacted promptly and agreed to join Gautam in helping out Sanjit. 																								She told me to contact Sanjits parents and do the needful, Sohinis mother Geeta Bose told Metro at her Behala residence. 																								I went to Jagubabur Bazaar to meet Sanjits father, Subol Naskar. I gave him our telephone number. But two weeks had passed and there was no response, elaborated Sohinis mother. 																								I went to meet him again. A few days later, Subol Naskar got in touch with us,she added.																								The families of Gautam and Sohini then decided to speak to Sanjit. 																								We wanted to know what sort of help he would need, said Jharna Paul, Gautams mother. 																								A one-time contribution of a huge amount was not possible for the two students. Their idea of sharing their stipends for the entire duration of Sanjits study is brilliant, she added.																								Sanjit, who now stays at a Park Side Road house, was relieved on hearing about the decision of Gautam and Sohini. 																								It will help me a lot. At least now I can pay my tuition fees, Sanjit said, while accepting the first cheque. 																								I am grateful to Gautamda and Sohinidi. I will never forget what they have done for me. Had they not come forward, I could never have got myself admitted to a medical college, Sanjit signed off.

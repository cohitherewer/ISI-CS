Victor Banerjee The castle of Vaux le Vicomte decorated for the Mittal wedding Parisian Masala: les Chat (not chaat) I finally made it to Page 3 on the same day that the Mittal wedding was front page news and their friendly Bihari cook, Munna Halwai, now known as Munna Maharaj and originally known as Dipak Singh, till he migrated to Calcuttas vegetarian upper echelons, made it to Page 2.It was one thing revelling in the fact that I was a Main hoon na making a comeback and quite another to be invited to sing for my supper at the Palace of Versailles where half a millennium ago old King Looie had actually forgotten, believe it or not, to construct loos.Do you think Louis IV had foreseen his palace being hired out some day for just 40,000.00, a paltry Rs 30 lakh, to a merchant king from a nation that would have nuclear power in its food but, back home, no toilets nor sanitation to speak of, in most of the country?By the way, let me digress from the Mittals and inform you that the raw banana is the most maligned of vegetables. For one, when youve got the runs it is the most effective binder of all and second, and most importantly, it is excellent roughage that assures regularity and prevents colonic cancers. Half our population misunderstands its properties and shuns it when it should really be making a diet of it.Now back to the wedding, after a little preamble that might interest you. One of the finest restaurants in London, or anywhere in the world, is the La Tante Claire, run by one of the worlds best chefs, Pierre Koffmann. I had taught him to make Kaanch Kolar Kofta curry and rescued him from chronic constipation. In eternal gratitude, he never again charged me a farthing at his fabulous restaurant. Then, disaster struck.I had flown all the way from Calcutta to London to impress a producer who was thinking of me as a viable replacement for DeNiro in his next film. I had, with mustered spontaneity, invited him to the Tante Claire and promised to pay Pierre for the house Pinot Noir and the Dom Perignon. He in turn would serve up his legendary Pigs Trotters and a Risotto flavoured with truffle (a fungus that is as expensive as gold ore and is only dug up by pigs whose snouts detect them underground).To cut a sad story short, unbeknownst to all, a disgruntled cockroach that I had tried to exterminate in my cupboard had peeked into my passport and decided to flee the country. It had flown across the continents in my briefcase. Sensationalism being the preoccupation of us Calcuttans, it picked its moment in the plush restaurant to creep out and waddle across the carpet till a Baroness at table number 9, who had just swallowed a raw oyster, saw the little creature, screamed and spat the gelatinous marine mollusc towards table number 7 where it landed atop a portion of Pat de Foie Gras. The health department shut down the place for almost six months and I was never again allowed inside.Back to the wedding. By the way, have any of you read Archy and Mehitabel by Don Marquis? Its a classic about a philosophical cockroachs discussions on life with a cat that in a previous incarnation was Cleopatra. That ends my convoluted introduction of a roach, a scatter-footed scarab from Baguiati that happened to travel, with an entourage, to this wedding of an empress to a bank clerk, in Paris. Everything you are reading in this piece is an extracted and toned-down version of this Baguiatians scrawls. His diary was smuggled into the country by Parisian cockroaches who returned with the leftovers and were fooled, like our innocent migrant workers are about the Gulf, into believing that they would live happily ever after in Pondicherry and Chandernagore. Instead, they found themselves crawling in the tannery sewers beside Sonar Bangla and among the garbage heaps of Dhapa that coincidentally produce Calcuttas juiciest chemical vegetable compounds; trs miserables.Now lets get back to the wedding. In short, a scintillating melee. Hey, main kya bolun? What makes me proud, however, is that the Mittals who hailed from Calcutta, had their daughters wedding here, flew Munna with gobindo bhog, phulkopi, chandromukhi aloo, kafshicam, motorshuti, enchr and kancha pp from Calcutta, to make sure our flavours were a vital part of the 30 million he spent on an unforgettable aish.Darn. I forgot to give you the menus. Let me tell you, though, that seated at the Sea Lounge in Mumbai the charming Hemant Oberoi, who cooked for the Mittal wedding, would be happy to chat about his memoirs and oblige you with a plate of indescribable Pot Au Feu as you watch the sun go down over the Gateway of our India  the land of clever cockroaches and kaanch kola.P.S. Kitchen gossip: Hemant has been commissioned to work on a Mittal Pao, for the general public. Recipe, when made available, shall be divulged in this column.

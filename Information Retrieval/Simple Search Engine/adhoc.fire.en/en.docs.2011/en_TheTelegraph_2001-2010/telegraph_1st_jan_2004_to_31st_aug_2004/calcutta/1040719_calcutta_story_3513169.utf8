 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Its all over: SMS to sister
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 An empty bottle of soft drink in the Saha kitchen on Sunday morning. Shibendu bought a similar bottle on Saturday to poison his family. Picture by Pabitra Das																								The suicide note left behind by Shibendu Saha before he hanged himself holds the vital clues to the tragedy that befell the Saha family on Saturday night.																								Around midnight, Shibendu is said to have sent an SMS on his cellphone to his sister Jayashree at Beleghata. Didi, shob shesh hoye gechhey (Didi, everythings over). Whatever I have to say and all the reasons for this incident are there in the suicide note, the message says.																								Spanning three pages, the note Shibendu left under his pillow reportedly indicts a family member for pushing him to the brink. Shibendu is said to have blamed uncle Amalendu for the familys financial ruin. 																								According to police officers probing the incident, Amalendu was actively involved in the grocery wholesale with Shibendu.																								Possibly written some time between poisoning his family  including a three-month-old son  and hanging himself, the note refers several times to debts incurred.																								Investigating officers believe Shibendu was up to his neck in debt and couldnt think of a way out. The victim has repeatedly referred to bank loans and other liabilities, which he feared he would not be able to repay. 																								Also, the income he had expected the family assets to yield was blocked. The note essentially deals with despair and financial misery, said an officer. It pins the blame on a particular member of the family who had abetted the tragedy. It appears that the Saha family was in a financial crisis, which prompted Shibendu not only to take his own life but that of his entire family.																								The question baffling investigators till late on Sunday was whether Shibendu was responsible for administering poison to the rest of his family.																								There are two theories. The first is that Shibendu hanged himself in a fit of remorse after poisoning his family. The second possibility is that he was poisoned by an outsider, who then hanged him to make it look like suicide and hoodwink the police, an officer of the detective department said. 																								Neighbours corroborated the theme predominant in the suicide note. They said the Saha family was in a financial crisis, with both the bakery and the wholesale trade in the red.																								We shall examine the suicide note in the perspective of how the business was being run and the family members responsible for the mess that it is in at the moment, an official said.

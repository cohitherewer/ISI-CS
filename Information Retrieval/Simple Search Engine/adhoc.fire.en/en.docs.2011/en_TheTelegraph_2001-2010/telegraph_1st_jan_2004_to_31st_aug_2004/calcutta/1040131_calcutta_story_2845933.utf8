 Pix by Rashbehari Das Mallika Sarabhai,  Rahul Bose, Sharmila Singh Flora, Jayabrato Chatterjee  and Shobhaa De at the launch of Sharmilar Ruprahasya  and (above) Rituparna Sengupta, Rituparno Ghosh  and Bibi Ray at the same do After two beauty studios  one  for women and the other for men, 14 years of experience  and a client list that reads like a veritable whos who  of the Tollywood fraternity, beauty expert Sharmila Singh  Flora has shifted the focus of her attention to writing,  though her subject of choice remains the same. Sharmilar  Ruprahasya, a book packed with a whole lot of tips,  tricks and techniques is what the popular beautician has  come up with for all those beauty-conscious women out there.  The book, which is also available at the Surya Publishers  Stall No 543 at the Book Fair was recently launched amidst  much fanfare at The Golden Park, with the vivacious Shobhaa  De, actor Rahul Bose, danseuse Mallika Sarabhai and filmmaker-writer  Jayabrato Chatterjee present to do the honours. Also spotted  at the occasion were actress Rituparna Sengupta, ace filmmaker  Rituparno Ghosh and interior designer Bibi Ray among others. As a young Bengali girl married  into a Sikh family, Sharmilas interest in the world of  beauty developed right after she finished reading a biography  of herbal guru Shahnaz Husain. What followed were intensive  courses in Calcutta and Delhi, followed by one in London,  soon after which Sharmila set up a small beauty parlour,  Floras, on Sarat Bose Road, at a time when the beauty business  was just about starting out in the city. Today, the original  Floras is a parlour for men, while the one for women has  shifted to larger, more swanky digs close by, with Sharmilas  clientele including such names as Indrani Haldar, Debasree  Roy, Laboni Sarkar, Rituparno Ghosh and Tollywoods reigning  hero, Prasenjit. Sharmilar Ruprahasya, quite  naturally, is a culmination of years of experience, and  delves into every possible aspect of grooming  be it skin,  hair, make-up and even food. There are do-it-yourself recipes  for that extra glow, information on manicures, pedicures,  threading and waxing and diet charts for those looking to  shed the kilos in a hurry. For would-be beauticians, there  are step-by-step instructions for various beauty treatments,  make-up tips for different skin types and the book is peppered  with interesting anecdotes, right from the origins of cosmetics  to beauty rituals practised by the ancient Egyptians. All  this, at a price of Rs 120 from Sharmila, who has previously  written in a number of magazines and dailies including Sananda,  Pratidin and Bartaman and is presently in  charge of the beauty column in the recently-launched Inner  Eye.

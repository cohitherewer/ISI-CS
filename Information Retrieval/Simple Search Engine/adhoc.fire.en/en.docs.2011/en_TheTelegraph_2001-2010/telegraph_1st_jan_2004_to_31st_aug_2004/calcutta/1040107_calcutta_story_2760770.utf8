 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcuttans are jaywalkers by nature. And teaching them road-rules is next to impossible.																								This is the bottom line that the traffic wing of the city police has arrived at after a bitter experience during last months week-long drive against jaywalkers. 																								While inaugurating the road safety week on Monday at Madhusudan Mancha, the police top brass decided to give up their efforts to teach adults to obey traffic rules as it is just not in their system. So, theyd much rather focus on the children than the incorrigible.																								Children are more open to suggestions and easier to work with. When they grow up, they will not be found wanting in traffic education. And it is expected that they will follow the basic road rules, explained Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic).																								The city police have already recommended that the state school education department incorporate a paper on traffic rules in the curriculum. Once, road rules was a compulsory chapter in the work and physical education syllabus in secondary-level education. Later, sadly, it was made optional, pointed out Prasun Mukherjee, additional commissioner of police (I).																								According to him, police sent a proposal to the education department, requesting it to make the road-rules chapter mandatory. We have already talked to the transport department in this regard and its officials have agreed, he said. But the file is moving so slowly that we dont know when our idea will take shape.																								Joint commissioner Basu, however, agreed the fatality rate on city streets is alarming. One per cent of the worlds vehicles plies in India. And surprisingly, six per cent of the worlds accidents take place in this country, he elaborated.																								The statistics, however, do show that awareness among Calcuttans about traffic rules is increasing, but slowly. In 1991, more than 600 people died in accidents. In 2003, the figure has dropped to 442. And in the past two years, the figure was 457 and 440, said Basu. In 1995, the number of vehicles in the city was 558,956. The figure has gone up to 853,000.																								There has been a rapid growth in the number of vehicles and pedestrians on city roads, joint commissioner Basu admitted. Naturally, the probability of mishaps has also increased. But the figures show a different picture. This confirms that the people have become a little more conscious about traffic rules, he explained.																								Police, however, are now focused on the schoolchildren. This time, we have involved the students of 640 schools in our road safety week and at 20 important intersections, they are assisting police and making people aware of traffic rules, said Basu. We hope that these children, when they grow up and hit the roads, will follow the traffic directions imparted to them by us now.

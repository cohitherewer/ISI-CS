 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 HIV sweep in southern tract
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than six per cent in a population vulnerable to HIV/AIDS in South 24-Parganas have tested positive for the virus since October 2003. Child in Need Institute (CINI), which has been given permission to counsel and test for HIV in the rural areas, has counselled 123 people, mainly families of migrant labourers, of whom 111 were tested. Seven tested positive.																								Through our work with reproductive health, we found that many women were suffering from sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs). We realised that they were also vulnerable to HIV/ AIDS, as many of their husbands were migrant labourers, says Rumeli Das, assistant director, HIV/AIDS programme, CINI, on Friday, when a group of infected women and their children were taken for a day out at Nicco Park.																								In all, of the 188 tests carried out by the organisation, 12 positive cases have been detected. Of these, seven are women, and one is a child. This figure does not include those husbands who may have succumbed to the disease after passing it on to their wives. 																								Some of these women were tested when they went to CINIs medical centre with allied problems like tuberculosis and STDs.																								A resource centre has been set up in a village in Bishnupur (Block I). Though some of the women have been able to come out in society, others have not. We have to break the self-stigma that can lead to depression, which in turn, can lead to worsening physical health, adds Das. Treatment has been integrated with the NGOs existing health programme, concentrating on early detection, treatment and proper nutrition. 																								Training is also being given to people within the home to enable them to provide the necessary care and prevent further infection.

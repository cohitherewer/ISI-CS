 SANJAY MANDAL				 	 Bal Bahadur Chetri outside his one-room home in a Panditiya Road slum. Picture by Amit Datta																								He fought for the British army, was taken prisoner by the Japanese. He then fought the British for Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses Indian National Army (INA), and was taken prisoner again. The heros whereabouts: a dingy eight-ft-by-10-ft room that he shares with eight family members in a south Calcutta slum. 																								Bal Bahadur Chetri lives under a tiled roof with cherished memories of World War II and the battle for freedom as an INA soldier. 																								Hes also waiting for chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees reply to a plea on his behalf by voluntary organisation Diganta, seeking a two-room government flat.																								Its very difficult to accommodate so many people in such a small room. I think I am entitled to a little comfort after all my years of struggle, sighed the 84-year-old, clutching the INA memento presented to him by former chief minister Jyoti Basu. 																								The discomforts are many  a bullet stuck between his kidneys since 1944, a wound he sustained during a battle with the British in Assam, and an injured leg. The bullet, which cannot be extricated, causes much pain and Chetri has to be hospitalised. 																								Chetri shares the room with wife Laxmi, younger son, daughter-in-law and two grandsons. His youngest daughter and her child, too, live with them in the slum on Panditiya Road. They share a toilet with 25 other families and bathe in the open.																								Born in an obscure village in Nepal, Chetri joined the 2/9 Gurkha Rifles in 1938 at Dehra Dun. In 1942, he was transferred to Singapore in the war against Japan. 																								He was taken prisoner by the Japanese and detained at a camp in Singapore. There, he came in contact with Rashbehari Bose, Mohan Singh and other INA big guns. 																								I was inspired by their speeches and decided to join the INA, though many officers in our regiment tried to persuade me and others against the idea, Chetri recollected. After a dramatic escape from the camp at night, they were recruited into an elite group of the INA under Puran Singh and Baharuddin, a pilot in the British Army.																								In 1943, I first saw Netaji at a rally, Chetri recounted. After Netaji declared war against the British, Chetri and other members of the brigade entered India through Myanmar (then Burma). In 1944, he was shot in the stomach in Assam and was finally arrested in Kohima.																								I was taken to Jessore, where I was detained for two days, and then to Multan, where I was released in 1945, Chetri recalled.																								Then, he proceeded to Lahore, where INA officers asked him to return home. Chetri, however, wanted to take part in the freedom struggle and went to Lucknow to work with Govind Ballabh Pant.																								He came to Calcutta in 1946. After doing a few odd jobs, he met INA functionary Debnath Das, who put him up till 1974. Since then, he has been living in the Panditiya Road slum. Wife Laxmi, a heart patient, is sometimes forced to shift to her elder daughters place in Tollygunge for want of space. 																								We cannot imagine taking up an apartment on rent. The familys income is too meagre, Laxmi said.

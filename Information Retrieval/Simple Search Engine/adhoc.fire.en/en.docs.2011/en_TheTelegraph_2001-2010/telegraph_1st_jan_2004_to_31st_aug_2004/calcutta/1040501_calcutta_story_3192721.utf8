 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Molest protester killers get life term
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								While the family of traffic sergeant Bapi Sen awaits justice for his death, a court in Howrah has sentenced to life imprisonment the killers of Shakti Shankar Kanrar in a similar case. 																								Bapi Sen was grievously assaulted on the last night of 2002 for protesting eve-teasing. He died in hospital a week later.																								Kanrar, too, had to pay with his life to save a few girls at Sankrail, in Howrah, from molesters. For his death, fourth additional district and sessions judge Nihar Chakraborty convicted Abid Ali Sardar and Khokon Sardar to serve life terms.. 																								Government lawyers in the case said the incident occurred on the eve of Vishwakarma puja, 2003, near the Sankrail minibus stand. As it was a festival, revellers were on the street. The two young men targetted a few girls moving through the area, said Pratap Kanrar, Shaktis brother.																								Angered by their behaviour, Shakti came out of a nearby tea-stall and asked the two men to stop teasing the girls and leave the spot. The two youths, instead of heeding the advice, walked into a nearby tailors shop, picked up a steel plate and battered Kanrars head with it, cried Pratap.																								Government lawyers Chinmoy Chowdhury and Tapan Kumar Singha Roy said Kanrar was taken to SSKM Hospital, which refused him admission. He was then shifted to the Calcutta Medical Research Institute in a critical condition. He succumbed to his injuries two days later.																								The punishment for such a crime should be exemplary, asserted lawyer Antara Naskar. Nobody should dare to even think of such behaviour.																								In court, the government lawyer pleaded for justice for innocent Kanrar, who lost his life at the hands of the two miscreants. 																								Apart from sentencing the duo to life terms, the judge ordered that Abid Ali Sardar and Khokan Sardar pay a cash fine of Rs 10,000 each, or serve another two-month term.																								During the hearing, the government lawyers lamented that in such cases, police investigations left a lot to be desired. The probes were mostly lackadaisical and slapdash, they said.																								nMarga mourning: The Ananda Margis brought out a silent rally on Friday from Deshapriya Park, in south Calcutta, to mourn the killing of 17 members on this day in 1992. The massacre had taken place on Bijon Setu, where the Ananda Margis ended their procession on Friday. More than 5,000 persons from Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar participated in the rally.

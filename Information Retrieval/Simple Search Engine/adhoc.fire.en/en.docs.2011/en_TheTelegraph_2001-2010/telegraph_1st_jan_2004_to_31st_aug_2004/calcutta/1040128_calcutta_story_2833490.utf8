 Wednesday, January 28, 2004  Guide to City Living MRS SEN OFFERS SOLUTIONS TO YOUR DAY-TO-DAY PROBLEMS				 																																												Q: I am a 31-year-old man working in the financial division of a reputed company. I am an MBA and a chartered accountant and have a very good reputation at my workplace as also a great relationship with my colleagues. A problem, however, has arisen recently, ever since my boss son joined the business. Hes a graduate with no experience in the field and has only joined to learn the ropes as he will be inheriting the company one day. 				 																																												 However, that doesnt stop him from throwing his weight around, refusing to listen to reason or the advice of others, as a result of which, he has taken several wrong decisions that have proved costly for the company. Every time, though, he gets away by blaming others, who end up taking the flak. I am afraid that the same thing might happen to me and the last thing I want is to jeopardise my career. How do we handle the situation discreetly? Please advise.  Name and address withheld 				 																																												A: I think you need to put things on record. Thus, whenever a decision is taken at a meeting, make sure that there is someone around to take minutes. If decisions are taken informally, then send a mail to your boss, with copies to everyone involved, placing on record who took the decision and why. If you have any reservations about the decision, place them on record as well. With all this paperwork on record, there is no way that you  or anybody else, for that matter  can be blamed for somebody elses mistakes.

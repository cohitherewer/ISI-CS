 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Contract killer clues elude cops
 															- Murdered 71-year-old cremated, family mourns behind closed doors A STAFF REPORTER																								The veil of mystery shrouding the Lalita Devi Goenka murder case refused to lift on Friday, with cops continuing to grope for clues and the body of the 71-year-old being cremated by a family in mourning behind closed doors.																								Lalita Devi was killed in her 10th-floor apartment of Shriniket Building, in Alipore, early on Thursday. Her head was smashed with a crowbar before she was dragged into a storeroom, where her throat was slit.																								The needle of suspicion in the whodunnit swung wildly, with clues to the identity of the assailants remaining elusive.																								Lalita Devi was cremated on Friday and the grief-stricken family was in no position to make any statements. So, we could not interrogate any of those who had been closely associated with her, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Peeyush Pandey.																								We are certain about one thing  an outsider or a gang was engaged by one or more insiders to commit the murder. None of those who could have played a role in the murder from the inside was capable of the sheer brutality exhibited in the crime, Pandey added.																								The strong suspicion is that contract killers were brought in from adjacent districts or states for the dawn murder. The detective department team investigating the Alipore murder has drawn up a shortlist of family members, domestic helps, security guards and a lift-operator. They will all be interrogated on Saturday, sleuths said.																								With the family busy with the last rites of Lalita Devi throughout Friday, the sleuths took their time over combing flats 10 A and B of the Alipore highrise which had witnessed the brutal murder.																								Officers of Alipore police station, busy all of Friday in the run-up to the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, will be able to focus on the murder from Independence Day, officers said.																								According to police, Shriniket Building on Ashoka Road was secure and well-guarded, so it was impossible for an outsider to carry out the killing without insider help.																								The involvement of the insider was not limited to just opening and closing the points of entry and exit for the murderer(s), sleuths believe. A professional killer would have been more clinical about disposing of the body, officers added. The fact that there were bloodstains in the bedroom and the body was found dumped in the storeroom, with the storeroom locked from the outside, suggested insider involvement after the murder, too.																								Murder for robbery has been ruled out as the motive, with just Rs 15,000 missing from the flat and a whole lot of valuables left untouched.																								Against this backdrop, sleuths have decided to put the will Lalita Devi is said to have left behind under the scanner.

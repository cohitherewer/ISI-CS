 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Kingpin plus three in promoter killing net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four more youths, all in their early 20s, were arrested in various areas of Rajarhat and Salt Lake in connection with the murder of trader-turned-promoter Pradip Roy. Roy was shot dead at his residence on April 24. Two others had been arrested earlier. Police suspect two more youths may be linked with the killing.																								The kingpin of the gang is Babai, 16, who used to secure contracts for the suppliers of building materials from the developers of Rajarhat and Salt Lake. Three others  Debajyoti Ghosh, alias Kelo, 21, Sujoy Das, 19, and Siddhartha Ghosh, alias Sunny, 20  were also arrested, said Parthasarathi Ghosh, additional superintendent of police, Barasat. Two motorcycles, including the one that was used in the murder, and a few firearms were seized from them.																								According to police, kingpin Babais version of the murder was straight out of Bollywood. Pradip had started construction work in the Post Office area of Baguiati. Babai asked Pradip to allow Pallab, a local supplier, to provide the building materials. Pradip did not oblige. Enraged, Babai plotted to kill him, said a police officer. Police later traced the calls made from the mobile phones of these youths to reconstruct how Babai, sitting in an air-conditioned restaurant (Mishras) in Salt Lake, directed his three henchmen to exterminate Pradip. 																								Babai hired Kelo, Sujoy and Sunny to bump off Pradip. The three men entered Pradips house and asked him to come down. 																								Pradip was sleeping in his room on the first floor of his house, Ashakunja, a well-known marriage ceremony hall in the area. As he came down, Kelo told him to ring Sujoy, who asked him if he had changed his mind about the supplier of building materials.																								As he again turned down their demand to change his supplier, Babai asked Pradip to hand over the mobile phone to Kelo and ordered him to shoot Pradip down. As evidence of completion of the assignment, Babai asked Kelo to keep the mobile phone on while shooting Pradip, so that he could hear the gunshot. The three then rode off on their motorcycle.																								Later, two local suppliers were arrested on the charge of conspiring to murder Pradip.

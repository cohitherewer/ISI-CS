The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 04, 2004  Prt passion playZeeshan Jawed  Model Sheena displays an Ekru outfit															Lakm India Fashion Week is coming to Calcutta  or at least some of the creations that were seen on that ramp in May can now be found at Ekru.																					On Tuesday a number of collections from this years national fashion gala hit the racks of the Rowland Row boutique. Suneet Varma, Malini Ramani, Monisha Bajaj, Sonali Mansingka and Priya Awasthy are the designers on display.																					The demand for designer clothes in Calcutta is on the rise but the supply is not sufficient. There are only a few stores in the city that stock clothes from national designers, feels Ruchira Kandhari.																					The modern Indian woman too old to wear a skirt and too young to dress like a grandmother was the target group Ruchira kept in mind while procuring the collection. So the mix is vibrant yet subtle, she stresses.																					The Suneet Varma line  not available anywhere else in the city  is full of happy clothes in bright shades, shirts with florescent trimmings and asymmetrical skirts, Ruchira adds. In contrast, Malini Ramanis line is of glitzy T-shirts. 																					The prt collections from Monisha Bajaj, Priya Awasthy and Sonali Mansingka are also at hand.																					Ekru was set up by Ruchira and her friend Ekta Jaipuria when, after having small exhibitions around the city, they wanted to set up their own outlet. It also stocks an original collection.

Pictures by Rashbehari Das 												Tribal fair																					Honey, rare herbs and spices vie for attention at the Vanbandhu Parishad stalls at an exhibition at Ice Skating Rink, on till tomorrow. The parishad, which works with tribals, was formed 10 years ago by housewives to address their developmental problems. 																					A team from Calcutta visited tribal belts around the state, deciding to form a platform that could serve their needs. 																					The programme made a beginning by adopting 30 schools in the tribal areas of the eastern region.																					The 10-year-old organisation has adopted around 7,000 schools so far and incurs an annual expenditure of Rs 10,000 on their upkeep. 																					The exhibition, an annual feature, is used as a platform to display exotic produce from tribal areas. We run swayam nirbhar programmes in tribal villages where we try to engage every member of the family, said the spokesperson of the organisation. 																					The body also gives housewives and budding talent a chance to hire a space in the exhibition, the proceeds of which would go to provide insurance cover to tribals. 																					Gold brush																					A crown of gold may not be up your street but you can still bask in gilded glory courtesy the new autumn-winter hair shades from Germany-based Wella titled Mystic Gold. Sylvia Chen, technical manager, Wella, demonstrated her streak skills on models Sheena, Priyanka and Piyali at June Tomkyns beauty salon, a partner in the crown connection. 																					e Sheena got a warm heather and rich heather combination at the workshop to complement her brown complexion, Priyanka got the mystic jewel treatment  a mix of the four shades of soft cendre, celtic copper, soft flame red and rich heather for a subtle yet modern look. Piyali walked out with a mystic flame treatment, using colours from the cool red family to enhance her dark skin tone.																					For those unable to decipher the colour code, the shades veer between warm blonde and copper shades that go well with Asian complexions, explained Sylvia. 																					She advises three different techniques to compliment the natural movement and length of hair. So straight hair gets the mystic jewel treatment of golden blonde and reddish brown shades to make the hair look more voluminous. Curly or wavy hair warrants the mystic flame treatment, combining a golden brown shade with a reddish tinge to highlight the thickness and strength of such hair.																					ours vary according to cuts as well. Layers and fringes are given light streaks or highlights by sectioning the hair and short hair goes the mystic flow way with a mix of copper, gold and brown to give more volume, especially in case of fine hair. 																					Rich mahogany, vibrant autumn chestnut, rich heather, soft flame red, warm burgundy red, copper gold, celtic copper and soft cendre are a few of the shades being promoted. 																					But if you thought a hairs breadth separated a black beauty from a blonde or a brunette, think patience. Keep aside a good one-and-a-half to two hours for a complete makeover. 																					The damages read in the same vein too with a price tag of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. The saving grace is that you dont need to loosen your purse strings too often to maintain the lock lustre. One will only require to touch up the roots every seven to eight months. 																					In the meantime, Sylvia advises aftercare with shampoo and conditioner especially designed for coloured hair. Its a good idea to stick to the product range from the same brand of hair colour you used. The product range usually works in synergy with each other, taking care to maintain the pH balance, signs off Sylvia. Models sport the new collection at Footsee.

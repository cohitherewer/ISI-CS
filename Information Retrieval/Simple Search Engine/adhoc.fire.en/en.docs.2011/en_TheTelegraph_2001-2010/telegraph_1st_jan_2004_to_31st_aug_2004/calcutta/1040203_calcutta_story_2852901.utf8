 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE																								The cable industry in town is finally putting self-regulatory measures in place.																								Key decisions regarding cable operators shifting to a different multi-system operator (MSO) without clearing their dues have been taken jointly by service providers and broadcasters, after a series of meetings over the past few days.																								And while the minutes of the meetings are currently being signed, an official understanding is scheduled to be inked at a meeting on February 5.																								Marking a first, three out of the four MSOs - RPG Netcom, SitiCable and Manthan  have spoken in one voice to lay down the ground rules for the cable industry in Calcutta.																								Every industry has some rules, said Amit Nag, CEO of RPG Netcom. Unfortunately, there have been no rules for the cable industry here. This is a move in that direction.																								The major agreements include deciding on the time-span that operators will be allowed for clearing their dues before moving on to another MSO. The dues deadline will be arrived at by dividing by three the number of months of arrears. For instance, an operator with dues of nine months will have to clear payments within three months. If he does not do so and still wants to shift, the MSO to which he is moving has to take up the responsibility for the payments.																								In case either signatory to the agreement does not adhere to the rules, the prospect of a boycott, through a switch-off by MSOs and broadcasters, looms large. In case an MSO doesnt keep his side of the bargain and continues to feed rogue operators, broadcasters are free to switch off their signal to that MSO. And in case a broadcaster does the dirty, the MSOs can block his beam.																								A redress committee, comprising MSO and broadcaster representatives, is also being formed to look into disputes  from turf trouble to disagreements over outstanding amounts.																								The intention is clear, said Manthan director Sudip Ghosh. An MSO should not shelter any defaulting operator. Not observing a basic code of conduct has had its effect on the industry. These steps, properly implemented, will help undo that damage.																								While the rest of the industry has welcomed this long-awaited regulatory move, the lone voice of dissent comes from Cablecomm, the citys fourth MSO. We want a total solution and not an agenda-based one, said Raj Singh of CableComm. Operators working at the ground level must be consulted, he added.

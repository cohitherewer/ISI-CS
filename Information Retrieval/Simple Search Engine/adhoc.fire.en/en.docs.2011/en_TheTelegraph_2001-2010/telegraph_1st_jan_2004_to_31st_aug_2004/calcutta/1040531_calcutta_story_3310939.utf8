The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Wanted by the Calcuttan: wish-list with a shorter vision
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Vision statements, in case you have noticed, almost always relate to a period that will come two decades later. It almost appears axiomatic that the longer the distance, the better the visibility; or, longer the vision, greater the visionary.																								Several states took a leaf out of Chandrababu Naidus book and hastily prepared visions of 2020, by which time, they must have reckoned, they would get away with four or five elections.																								Another distinct advantage is that the authors of the vision statements would safely retire by then and could not be hauled up for slippages.																								It came as no surprise, therefore, when the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) came up with a vision statement for the city a few years ago. Typically, the vision is for the year 2025, which, given the trend, neither surprised nor shocked. Citizens will be far better off with shorter visions.																								A crisp set of realisable goals over the next 18 months or two years is what people can usually relate to. But grand-sounding vision statements with idealistic goals or projected requirements can only serve as reference points for experts.																								Much of it is also meaningless, without specific mention of revenue models and details of how projects would be financed, sustained and maintained. Even more disappointing is when such vision statements on the city confine themselves to, largely, traffic and transport.																								Flyovers, subways, Metro Railway, trolley buses, etc, look dazzling on paper but almost all of them only change the landscape of the cities but rarely the lives of people.																								They will, of course, cost a fortune, displace a large number of people, take a long time and, with no regular revenue model in place, are bound to have poor maintenance.																								There are several studies on the city and one of them estimates that 30 per cent Calcuttans live on less than Rs 30 per day. One-and-a-half million people are believed to be living on the streets, at least 200,000 of whom happen to be children.																								The city is known for its energy-sapping heat and humidity, shortage of open space and its penchant for endless chatter. Add to this the inhabitants perceptible indifference to hygiene and one can see why it is so difficult to have a short and yet realistic wish-list.																								Even then, a short wish-list for a foreseeable future is what agencies like the CMDA should set for themselves. For a city where people sweat it out virtually throughout the year, and which luckily is next to a river that provides perennial source of water, Calcutta makes miserly use of water in architecture and urban landscape.																								In hot and humid conditions, even the sight of water, still or otherwise, is soothing. We can draw lessons from several European countries that make effective use of water fountains and other waterbodies.																								The opportunity to dip ones ankles or knees in clean, cool and regularly-recycled water or just to have the pleasure of sitting in a shade and watch still waterbodies can provide the relief that people not sitting in air-conditioned comfort deserve.																								The cost cannot be so prohibitive that urban development agencies cannot afford; nor is technology so complicated that we will require help from abroad.																								Even more important is the urgency to put up drinking water kiosks at street corners for the large number of pedestrians. Some public urinals have come up in the city during the past few years. But they are pedestrian and precious. It would help greatly if a few proper public washrooms can come up in the business district at least, for visiting traders and tourists alike.																								The next achievable improvement in the city one would wish for is permanent taxi stands with telephones. The luxury of being able to call a cab at all hours, and to the doorstep, is reassuring. The system can start off, for example, at 24-hour petrol-pump outlets.																								These two visions before the next summer appear eminently achievable on paper. But it would, of course, be nothing short of a miracle if they do actually crop up, given our reputation of being laid-back. The idea, however, is to plead the case for short vision statements.																								To cite just one more example, the city could do with one light-and-sound programme on Rabindranath Tagore and another on Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, the latter presumably at Belur.																								A go-getting MD can put them on the ground in six months. A more cautious deadline would be the winter of 2005.																								A longer vision, like tomorrow, is bound to be elusive.

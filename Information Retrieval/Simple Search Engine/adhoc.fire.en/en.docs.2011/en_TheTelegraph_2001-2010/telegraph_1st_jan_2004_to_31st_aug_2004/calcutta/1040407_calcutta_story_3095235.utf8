The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 A star a day for voter sway
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Does participation of non-political personalities enhance/ diminish the appeal of elections? Govinda (top) on campaign trail and Smriti Tulsi Irani at a BJP rally: Of heroes and hero-worship Tipu, 
																		Library Lane, Serampore.																																																														Politics is a distinct domain. So, if non-political personalities get into politics it will not affect the appeal of the elections. Voters are sensible enough. Stars cannot cause the voter to waver in his loyalties to a party or its credo. 									

Kaberi Mukherjee, 
																		Santosh Roy Road. 																																																														Filmstars can do no good to politics. Yes, they are important for politicians who lack confidence and often do not have the trust of the people. So, they borrow glamour to draw the crowd. But they fail to realise that people are not fools. The stars merely add a garish feather to the sordid caps of the politicians. 									

Chameli Pal, 
																		Batanagar. 																																																														The trend is alarming for Indian democracy. Almost every other celebrity, past his or her prime, seems to jump onto the bandwagon of politics. Since political parties always look for an opportunity to fish in troubled waters, the celebrities are often netted at election time to campaign for the party. Had this not been the case, by now the parties would surely have developed some rules to regulate the entry of outsiders into politics. It should be made mandatory for aspiring politicians to render a specified minimum term of social service to qualify. 									

Gunjeet S. Wadhwa, 
																		Rai Bahadur Road.																																																														The more famous the personality, the bigger the turnout at the rallies. At the same time, the trend proves the lack of self-confidence of a party that tends to depend on stars rather than its own candidates to garner votes. Political parties should know that voters are conscious of such hype and propaganda. Hence, the partys votebank would not flourish by spending crores on such campaigns. Instead, they should prove their merit during their tenure of governance.									

Priyanka Aich, 
																		Address not given. 																																																														With the polls approaching, all parties are unveiling a star everyday. One might be led to believe that the real contest is of garnering as many celebrities as possible. In a nation obsessed with heroes and hero-worship, this is but a natural phenomenon. However, while the star appeal of these celebrities might lend an initial thrust to the election campaign, ultimately it is the work done by these parties that will be the decider. In India, politics and non-political personalities have always had a symbiotic relationship. While on one hand, the participation of the celebrities enhances the appeal of the elections, the public is also aware that they have chosen to support the parties for personal gain.									

Subhobrata Basu, 
																		Ballygunge Station Road.																																																														Are Bollywood stars joining politics really taken seriously? The voters will, no doubt, enjoy the clash of the stars. But such enticements are not enough to woo them to vote in favour of the party. Of course, a handful of crazy people get carried away by these publicity stunts. But their numbers are too few to make an impact. More often than not, the stars participate in the polls for their own gain. And some are paid hefty sums to do so. Addressing a rally is like mouthing dialogues for them. However, one has to admit that personalities like Smriti Tulsi Irani can single-handedly woo the womenfolk to vote for her party. If we ignore such occasional success stories, the exercise is otherwise totally futile. 									

Rima Das, 
																		Belghoria.																																																														This will entirely depend on the fields the non-political personalities come from. If the person is a scholar, educationist or an efficient bureaucrat or technocrat, chances are that he or she will be in a position to contribute to the cause of society and the country. Their participation will also add to the appeal of the elections. But if the person belongs to the entertainment fraternity, he or she will never be taken seriously by the electorate. 									

Ananya Banerjee, 
																		Address not given.																																																														Inspite of being from a non-political background, people like Ronald Reagan of the US and M.G. Ramchandran and Jayalalithaa down south have done well in politics. So what is required is political acumen rather than background. Otherwise every campaign will result in waste of resources. The tactic would fail to fool the politically conscious electorate.									

Adwaita Das, 
																		Bansdroni.																																																														Politics acquires a new definition depending on who does the campaigning for a party. Whether it is a movie star, writer, scientist, social worker or a sportsperson, the voters are drawn by their interest in the non-political life of the person. The party cashes in on this very point. 									

Lalita Agarwal,
																		Address not given.																																																														Voters are disgusted with political parties that are tall on promises but short on delivery. Since voters have limited choices, a non-political candidate in the arena ushers in new hope. It is generally thought that this candidate, without any ideological trappings, would act more responsibly and try to live up to the trust reposed in him or her.									

Tanmoy Ghosh, 
																		SM Nagar Housing Estate.																																																														Most of the non-political personalities are treated like milch cows. The parties seek to derive maximum benefit from them in a short time span. In the third world countries, the middle class have fixed loyalties. It is the lower class electorate for which the views fluctuate. And since this uneducated lot is the most vulnerable, political parties attract them with glamour. After all, everything is fair in love (for power) and war (between parties). 									

Arijit Ghosh, 
																		Shyamnagar.																																																														The majority of our voters, whether literate or illiterate, get carried away by the charisma of their favourite stars. This obviously affects the election results. A cinestar undoubtedly manages to draw votes for the party. 									

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 
																		Arabinda Nagar.																																																														The goal of contesting the elections is to reach the seat of power. The current scenario reflects that many inefficient people with bad track records can also campaign on behalf of political parties. An option should be given in the ballot paper or on the voting machine which would give people the right to decide whether they want a particular candidate to contest the elections in the future. 									

Anil Kumar Sen, 
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.																																																														Why shouldnt non-political personalities take part in the process and enhance the appeal of the elections?

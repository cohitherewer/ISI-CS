 Actress Reshmi Bhattacharya samples the Bengali fare at the 
Peerless Inn on Friday. Picture by Rashbehari DasBengali food just like mom used to make it is what Peerless Inn promises to help celebrate Poila Baisakh. Mustard and poppy seeds are the flavours of choice at the Bengali restaurant Aaheli, with dishes like Potol Posto, Chamaki Chingri Posto, Murgi Postor Jhuri and Posto Mangshor Paturi.																								A non-vegetarian thali, priced at Rs 414, includes Chholar Dal, Doi Potol, Chingri Malai Curry or Bhapa Ilish and Murgir Jhol or Mangsho Kassa. The vegetarian bhoj throws in Chhanar Mahima and Enchorer Kalia, for Rs 350.																								We tasted authentic dishes made in Bengali homes, and included the ones we liked, explains executive chef Md Qureshi. The preparations were then modified, toning down the spices where they felt necessary.																								What the Peerless lacks in quality, it makes up for in variety. The Bengali festival is on through April, as are promotions at three other outlets at the hotel. Bichitra is hosting a Thai festival. A Burger amp; Beer festival is on at the coffee shop, Nishidin, where off-beat concoctions like lentil burger are being served up. Snacks are being thrown in free with drinks at Lahari, the bar. Prices range from around Rs 80 to Rs 450.																								Though earnest efforts are on to revamp the hotels F amp;B offering  which is, apparently, gaining ground with the younger crowd  the fare has some distance to go yet. Can we please have it a little less bland?
	Fusion feast The Trincas spread. Picture by Rashbehari DasChicken a la King and Enchorer Ghoogni, Chicken Steak Sizzler and Chhana Palonger Chop. A fusion food festival with an Anglo-Bangla twist  is what Trincas has come up with to usher in the new year.																								Calcuttans are known to be very experimental with their taste in food, and they have always been fond of Continental cuisine. Thus, we thought of giving our menu a different spin on the occasion of the Bengali New Year, smiles Shashi Puri of Trincas.																								So, one might as well give the usual favourites like Chicken Drums of Heaven and Chilli Garlic Noodles a miss, for the a la carte fare throws up an interesting assortment.																								Shrimp Cocktail or Hawaiian Cocktail, Chicken Tetrazini, Chicken a la King, Chicken Steak Sizzler, Chingri Cutlet, Fish Fry with Tartare Sauce, Kosha Mangsho, Vegetable Au Gratin, Chhana Palonger Chop, Baked Aloo with Cheese, Enchorer Curry and Ghoogni are a few of the special dishes. The dessert menu is also a mix, including Tutti Fruiti, Chocolate Brownie ice-cream, Caramel Custard alongside Pantua ice-cream.																								For the main course, dishes will set you back by between Rs 55 and Rs 120, while the desserts come for Rs 50 to 75. The festival starts from April 13 and will continue till April 20.

 SANGITA S. GUHA ROY				 	 Youngsters make a move on the dance floor. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								To beat those blues or to break into the circuit, all you need to do is make the right moves  on the dance floor. With party-hopping and stress-busting becoming the names of the survival game, the need to just jive is more acute than before.																								Ask Swapan Ray of Z-4 Dancing Network, whos got three-year-olds to three-score-and-counting measuring the length and breadth of dance floors with their lithe or lumbering steps.																								Fox trot, waltz, Cha cha cha, Rumba, Samba, hip-hop and filmi jhatkas are the tools of his trade. Trained in ballroom and Latin American dance forms, Ray runs 10 centres in town, with plans for five more by July this year. More than 300 students train under him at present and many of them have gone on to win national-level competitions like Boogie Woogie on Sony.																								Dancing, especially modern western dance, is big among youngsters today. It helps them gain popularity in school and social circles, which serves as a massive confidence booster, smiles Swapan, who also gets a lot of older students keen to learn the ropes and move up the social ladder.																								Middle-level executives and their wives are doing a lot of entertaining these days and often come to me to learn the nuances of ballroom-dancing. If you get invited to a high-society party, it helps if you are in the know of a few basic dancing steps, explains Swapan.																								The therapeutic nature of the act of dancing draws in some. At my institutes in Salt Lake, I get a number of IT professionals from the Infinity building for the evening sessions. Dance helps them unwind after a hard days grind, claims the man who entered the Guinness Book of World Records for dancing non-stop for 75 hours at a Channel V party at Ibiza in September 2001.																								But now, Ray is eyeing his own slice of the prime-time pie and has already canned the preliminary portions of a 52-episode rehash of the Sony show, which hes planning to call Dhin Tak Dhin. Talks are on for a slot on a private Bengali channel for the screening of the show, reveals Swapan. Once he grabs enough eyeballs, he hopes to go national.																								There are yet more movers and shakers in the circuit, of which Padatik Contemporary Dance Centre is the most prominent. It now boasts of three branches at AJC Bose Road, Salt Lake and New Alipore with over 500 students.																								We teach contemporary forms of jazz and ballet including hip-hop, salsa, filmi and free-style dancing. There are few takers for purely classical dance forms, explains Shoujit Das, chief instructor, Padatik. The five-year-old institute, however, believes in a more academic approach and even its free-style dance forms are syllabus oriented at the end of which students are awarded a certificate. 																								Not surprisingly, teenagers shy away from such a regimented approach and its mostly kids and toddlers Shoujit has to deal with. We have students as young as three years old, whose ambitious parents want them to grow up to be happening people! We teach a couple of teenagers as well, but they are more fickle and often leave midway owing to other pressures like exams, says Shoujit. Those who stick around are rewarded with a place in the centres dance troupe, Beat Busters, that has a number of stage performances to its credit.

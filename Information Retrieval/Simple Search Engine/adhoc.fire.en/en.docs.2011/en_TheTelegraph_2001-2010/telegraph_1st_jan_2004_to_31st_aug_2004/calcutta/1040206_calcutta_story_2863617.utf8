 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Mayor rules out mercy for culture club 
 							 - Book Fair stung by tax slap A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has slapped a Rs 1.93-lakh amusement tax bill on the organisers of the Calcutta Book Fair. The levy has evoked strong protest from the Publishers and Booksellers Guild. A guild delegation, led by general secretary Kalyan Shah, met Mukherjee at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters on Thursday evening, with a request for a slash in the tax. 																								Mukherjee told the delegation: The Book Fair got off lightly last year on the chief ministers request for clemency, but the organisers cannot enjoy the privilege every year. The fair this year has been extended by four days and the CMC is charging amusement tax for 10 days only, instead of its entire duration of 14 days.																								The mayor added: What rankles is that every year, on the eve of the fair, the organisers seek permission from the CMC, giving an impression that they are ready to clear all the legitimate dues. After the fair starts, however, they start haggling over payments.																								Mukherjee saw a caste system prevailing among the city businessmen. Otherwise, how is it that the organisers of Lexpo (the annual leather goods fair) shell out amusement tax while the organisers of the Book Fair are accorded special exemption? he asked.																								The civic bodys deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh explained: The CMC Act, 1980, empowers the mayor and the municipal commissioner to allow exemption only to charitable institutions. The question of collection of amusement tax from the Book Fair organisers would not arise if they did not charge an entry fee.																								Contesting the CMCs version, guild general secretary Shah said: The Book Fair differs from other trade fairs because it propagates culture, learning and education. It offers readers a rare opportunity for direct interaction with their favourite authors. Besides, the guild is a non-profit organisation and, so, deserves amusement tax exemption.																								The mayor countered: If Rs 5 is collected from each visitor to a fair or a spectator at a tournament, then it is irrelevant to me whether the visitor is there to enjoy a book or a cricket match. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and Royal Calcutta Turf Club, too, had reacted strongly when I demanded amusement tax from them. In time, they have started paying up their dues.																								Mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb said the services provided to the fair cost money. Litter that fills several trucks has to be removed from the ground daily. Besides, the CMC supplies drinking water to the book fair.

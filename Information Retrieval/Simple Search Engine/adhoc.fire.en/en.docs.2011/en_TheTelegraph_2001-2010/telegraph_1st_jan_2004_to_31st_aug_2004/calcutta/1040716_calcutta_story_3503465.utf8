 Friday, July 16, 2004  Mix amp; match Model Sreshtha sports an FI outfit. Picture by Rashbehari Das												FI, or First Impressions, launched its second outlet in the city on Wednesday. The City Centre outlet follows its first venture at Forum, which opened in April. 																					Fusion is the flavour of the store on the ground floor of the mall. A similar collection of womens wear  kurtas, kurtis, suit lengths, skirts and pants that can either be worn with ethnics or westerns  is in stock at Salt Lake.																					aunch saw models Devdutta, Tina and Sreshtha show off versatile ensembles that could be mixed and matched for either a purely ethnic or to more funky fusion effect. Like the first outfit that Tina kicked off the show with. While the model wore the purple poncho-style kurti with a short denim skirt, changing the lowers could easily transform it to a trendy ethnic look.																					Our emphasis is on natural fibres and fusion. The modern woman wants contemporary clothes with an Indian touch, feels Sharad Nawalgaria, director, Albeli Fashions, the garment company that has started the FI label. 																					An in-house team of designers has created a line splashed with bright hues and ample embellishments. Most of the clothes are embroidered, but there are more innovative creations as well. A number of kurtis that have T-shirt style prints, designed to get the younger crowd hooked.																					The next FI destination is Bangalore, where the retail chain will start its third outlet by year-end. Rajasthani spread at ITC Sonar Bangla. Picture by Rashbehari Das												Just deserts																					As the desert birds put their best foot forward and spread their colourful plumes to celebrate the magic of the monsoons, Calcutta is being treated to the famed flavours of Rajasthan. ITC Sonar Bangla has zeroed in on the cuisine this time as part of their regular food promotions at the Eden Pavilion. 																					Chefs Akshraj Jodha and Karan Singh Rathore have lined up an extensive buffet menu (for Rs 600 per head) that packs in some elaborate meat preparations apart from usual delicacies from the region like Gatte ki Sabji, Kair Sangri, Dal Bati Churma and Bajre ki Roti. 																					Contrary to the popular belief, Rajasthani cuisine is not all about vegetarian food, said Jodha. Game meat like that of deer, rabbits and even wild animals used to be an intrinsic part of the food habits of the Rajputs and Kshatriyas, which the warriors used to hunt themselves. With increasing restrictions on hunting, game meat gradually gave way to chicken and mutton, explained Jodha.																					One can cool off with Kaanji, a refreshing drink made of fermented red mustard seeds flavoured with moong dal pakoris or dumplings. Pyaz ki Kachori and charcoal grilled Sakiodo Murgo are ideal to start off with before you get into the meat of the matter with Laal Maas (spicy mutton preparation swimming in red chillies), Maas Makkai ka Soyta (mutton cooked with grated corn), Sula (mutton kebab cooked on charcoal grill). 																					The largely vegetarian Rajasthani community in the city have plenty to dig into as well with Papad ka Saag, Aloo Methi, Mirchi ke Tapore, Chakki ka Saag that use dried lentils, beans and gram flour as the main ingredients. These are best tried with Bajre ki Roti or Missi Roti for a wholesome meal. 																					Do take care to leave some space for desserts like Moong Dal Halwa, Malpua and Motichur ka Laddoo, that is if you are not given to counting calories. Revellers at the French National Day party at the Oberoi Grand. Picture by Aranya Sen 												French toast																					Red-white-and-blue paper lanterns and balloons swaying with the merry mood, a plaintive voice belting out the popular classic Ma plus belle histoire damour on the microphone, TV5 telecasting live from Paris President Jacques Chiracs acceptance of salutations on two giant screens  the ball room of the Oberoi Grand was set for the celebration of the national day of France. 																					The spirit of the evening was set by the opening speech of honorary consul of France in Calcutta Mahendra Kumar Jalan, highlighting the ties of amity that bind the two nations and the immortal slogan that was the war cry on the fateful day during the fall of the Bastille in 1789  liberty, equality, fraternity. 																					And then the spirits flowed freely. The hall was abuzz with the whos who of Calcutta  mayor Subrata Mukherjee and home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, Gaurav Swarup of Paharpur Cooling Towers and Sanjay Budhia of Patton, author Sunil Ganguly, artists Paritosh Sen and Shuvaprasanna, dancer Tanushree Shankar, singer Anjan Dutt and a host of francophones and francophiles. 																					We had sent out 800 invitations, informed Emmanuelle de Decker, the tall and graceful deputy director, cultural events, of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta. The queue round the table of canaps was proof that most had accepted the invitation. From Avocado Mousse on brown bread, Chicken Liver Pat on mini briche, Bruschettas, Vegetable Crudits with guacamole  the spread at the canap bar was rich and varied. On circulation were quiche and fritters, pizette and croquette, vol au vents and sausage puffs. But the bar was where the connoisseurs flocked. Its a cocktail and snack dinner with the highlight on wine and cheese, said executive chef George K. George. Of the 10 kinds of cheese on offer, Alliance Francaise de Calcutta director Nicolas Blasquez chose Roquefort with his red Syrah wine, passing on a spirited tip or two to the less informed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Amherst Street, being one-way, has nowadays become a heavily-travelled road. About three years ago, after a student was run over near the Amherst Street Post Office, a speed-breaker was constructed to prevent accidents due to speeding. A signboard was also erected to alert drivers about the bumper on the road. But the signboard has now disappeared. The drivers are unable to spot the speed-breaker after dark and as a result have to jam the brakes at the last minute, causing much discomfort to passengers. Sometimes they miss the bump altogether, causing severe injuries to both man and machine. It will be convenient for the commuters as well as the drivers if a board is placed on the roadside with a bump ahead caution written on it. Also, the bump can be painted in white so that it is easily noticeable even after dusk.

	Banks keeping open on Sundays have given a large number of people, who are busy otherwise during the week, a chance to enjoy banking facilities when they have time on hand. But unfortunately, Sunday banking facilities at the Lake Town branch of Union Bank of India have been withdrawn. The authorities concerned are requested to consider customers pleas to resume Sunday banking, for it was a big help.

	The citys telebhaja culture, so popular even two decades ago, especially in north Calcutta  at Bagbazar and Shyambazar  used to attract hordes of customers. Even foreigners used to flock to well-known telebhaja shops. Swami Vivekananda is said to have been fond of such delicious snacks. But now, with the advent of instant or fast food shops, most of these ventures are struggling for survival and operating at a much smaller scale. Even the traditional food habits of the citizens have undergone dramatic changes. Could something be done to prop up this intrinsic feature of Calcutta?

	The mini bus on Banerjeehat-Milk Colony route was withdrawn three years ago for reasons unknown to us. It used to be of great help to students who studied in central and north Calcutta colleges or in Calcutta University. Present students are forced to take admission in nearby colleges as, in absence of a direct route, it takes them a good two hours to reach those destinations. The route C-9, from Sarsuna Housing Complex to Ultadanga, covering a large area of north Calcutta, is also not operative. It is high time that the transport authority looks into the matter.

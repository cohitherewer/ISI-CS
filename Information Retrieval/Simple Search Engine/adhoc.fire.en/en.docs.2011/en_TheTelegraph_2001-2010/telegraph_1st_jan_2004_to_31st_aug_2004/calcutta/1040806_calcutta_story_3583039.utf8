The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 20 years minus amenities
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Residents of the added areas of the CPM-run Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) are being deprived of amenities promised to them 20 years ago, when the civic body had been upgraded by merging these areas with it.																								Around 500,000 people live in these added areas, measuring 1,000 sq km. 																								HMC officials said tax assessment hadnt been carried out in these areas. The residents neither pay any taxes nor enjoy any civic benefits. 																								No one has taken the initiative to conduct a tax assessment. So the area hasnt seen any development, pointed out a civic official.																								Thanks to the nonchalance of the civic body, residents of Shibtala, Unsani, Arupara and Kasipore dont have paved roads, a planned drainage system, adequate drinking water supply or streetlights. 																								Its strange that such a large number of people have been kept out of the tax net at a time when the HMC is starved of funds, civic officials said.																								Municipal commissioner P.C. Patra, however, refused to explain why no tax assessment drive had been undertaken in the added areas. 																								We come across problems at every step and we have no time to explain why we have not carried out the assessment, he told Metro. Aamra eshob katha kauke boli naa (we dont talk about these issues with anyone), he added.																								Bikash Jana, a resident of Shibtala, lamented: We wish our areas had not been merged with the civic body. We would have been better off had we still been under panchayats. At least we would have clean water to drink.

Inner world of dark desires Soha Ali Khan (above) and Jackie Shroff (below) in stills from the look test for Antarmahal				 																																																											1878, Bengal. A complex tale of love and longing takes off in a bustling zamindari household busy preparing for Durga Puja against the backdrop of political tumult				 																																																											2004, south Calcutta. Comfortably cocooned in his new work station, director Rituparno Ghosh is drawing up the blueprint for a black film with Jackie Shroff, Abhishek Bachchan, Soha Ali Khan and Rupa Ganguly as the key players.				 																																																											Loosely based on  or maybe inspired by  a short story by Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay, Antarmahal explores the inner world of a zamindar (Jackie), his wives (Rupa and Soha) and a Bihari potter (Abhishek), trapped in feudal, colonial, patriarchal and religious set-ups.				 																																																											Its about the ruler and the ruled (with Queen Victoria having a strong unseen presence), about the voices of rebellion that germinate within. Theres a lot of latent violence at various levels. Antarmahal may lack the charming quality of my other films. But its also a love story, Ghosh explains.				 																																																											The story idea was there in my mind for a long time but finding a face resembling Durga was difficult, says Ghosh. Till Soha happened. She says very little  her Durga-like eyes do most of the talking. Abhishek doesnt speak good Bengali either, but then he is a Bihari potter. I told him he must learn clay modelling and he readily agreed, adds the director.				 																																																											Jackie Shroff, for me, was the obvious choice for the character of the zamindar. His face, his age and his physicality were just the right combinations for the role.				 																																																											The middle-aged macho man from Bollywood, for whom Antarmahal will be his first feature film in Bengali, will remain instinctive in the way he works on this role. As its my first Bengali film, I will keep my ears open and mouth shut, is his missive from Mumbai.				 																																																											The only Tollywood star in the twinkling Bollywood brigade plays the extremely complex character of barobou. My role is multi-dimensional and very, very challenging. On the one hand, I sympathise with chhotobou, on the other, I hate her for usurping my husbands affection, says Rupa.				 																																																											The silence is subversive  and will make its presence powerfully felt  in Antarmahal, which, incidentally, is a name suggested by Sujata Gangopadhyay that Aparna Sen had thought of using for Paromitar Ekdin.				 																																																											The film will also be the first to be produced by Ghosh himself, with help from friends. I want to do this film my own way, without any sort of interference from the producer, he stresses, hinting at some hard-hitting statements to be made.				 																																																											The film hits the floors on September 5 for a 25-day shoot, in the Tollygunge studios and in an old house in north Calcutta.Reshmi SenguptaMigration moods, going places From Calcutta to Dallas and Toronto  the city film-makers celluloid net has spread far and wide. Tridib Poddars yet-untitled debut feature film  also being touted as the first crossover film from Bengal  has three college friends migrating to the West to crown their careers.				 																																																											On a Rs 1-crore budget, Poddar has sketched a triangular love story involving Jishu Sengupta, Reshmi Ghosh and Parambrata Chatterjee pushed to the brink of an emotional crisis.				 																																																											Jishu, Reshmi and Parambrata are part of a typical disco-hopping, college canteen crowd that dreams of making it big in the West. In the course of their journey, they find themselves enmeshed in a complex building and breaking up of relationships, explains Poddar.				 																																																											The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute graduate had his first brush with fame when his half-hour diploma film Khonj was nominated in the Cine Foundation section of Cannes 2002.				 																																																											The migration in this film is at two levels  once when they shift base and again when something happens to them in Dallas. Reshmi is the central thread running through the story. Shes a bit confused being at the centre of the emotional upheaval, he adds.				 																																																											Poddars leading lady is due to join the cast in Calcutta in a few days. I can emotionally relate to the character I play because I myself am passing through that phase. The role will give me a lot of opportunity to act. And I think I have improved a lot, says Reshmi from Mumbai.				 																																																											The script developed from an idea floated by the films producer around a year ago. Shiladitya Sanyal has drafted the dialogues for this commercial film with song sequences, while former Krosswindz member Neel Mukherjee has scored the soundtrack.				 																																																											While shooting for the Calcutta chapter starts in August, the Dallas-Toronto scenes will be canned in and around the US-Canada border.Plans are also being drawn up to release the film in Toronto, Los Angeles, London, Mumbai and Delhi, alongside Calcutta.Shes got the look: Reshmi Ghosh is groomed for the groove She has quit the ramp, parked herself in Mumbai, picked up acting tips at Kishore Namit Kapoors academy and morphed into an actress. And the makeover is certainly ringing in a change. Reshmi Ghosh has her hands full with two Bollywood films on the floors, and two ready for release. I have groomed myself a lot... I have also matured with age, says Reshmi, whose sharp features and pretty poise have made her the epicentre in an emotional upheaval involving three friends in Tridib Poddars film. Tug of love, right Reshmi?

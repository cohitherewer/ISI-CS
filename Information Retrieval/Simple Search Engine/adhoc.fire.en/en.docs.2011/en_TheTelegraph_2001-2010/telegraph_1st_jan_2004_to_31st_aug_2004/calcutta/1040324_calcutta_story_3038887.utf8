 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Family ruin in frame-up death
 																											- Bank manager cleared of swindle slur, widow moves court for dues OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								In January 2000, bank manager Mihir Dutta, unable to bear the burden of the accusation that he had misappropriated Rs 3 lakh, took his own life. He was innocent, he wrote in his suicide note, and that some influential people were framing him.																								In January 2004, the complete police investigation has proved that Dutta was right. He was innocent, the report said, adding that a local political leader, abetted by two of Duttas colleagues, had swindled the bank.																								Tuesday found Duttas widow Vidya in Calcutta High Court. She knew the judiciary could not bring back her husband (or her mother-in-law, who died shortly after Dutta committed suicide).																								But it could make a huge difference to her life and the lives of her four children, she said, explaining that it was the banks FIR that had put the police on the trail of her innocent husband.																								In the absence of a steady income  and the banks refusal to pay the family the officers financial dues (including his provident fund)  the family had been reduced to penury, her petition said. Her children had suffered the most, with each one of them being forced to give up on studies.																								Dutta was branch manager of the Birbhum District Central Cooperative Bank, in Dubrajpur. On January 15, 2000, the branch could not account for a sum of Rs 300,000. The authorities lodged an FIR and Duttas name led the list of suspects.																								The police, armed with that FIR, paid several visits to the Duttas home over the next three days. Shamed in front of the neighbourhood, which saw policemen raid his house, Dutta took his own life.																								The suicide note, however, made it clear that he was not ending his life because of any sense of guilt. He was clear that he was innocent and the victim of a conspiracy.																								Duttas septuagenarian mother lost her mind a few days later. Unable to bear the shock of her sons death, she died within a few months. 																								It was obvious that her death was the result of her sons suicide, advocate Uttam Majumdar told Justice Pratap Ray on Tuesday.																								Vidya, with four children, was left to fend for herself. She approached her husbands bank repeatedly, pleading in vain for the release of his financial dues. 																								A lower court that she approached backed the bank because of the continuing criminal proceedings.																								Vidyas petition demanded that at least one of her four children be given a job by the bank, which should also clear their dues and compensate her adequately. Justice Ray asked the bank authorities to file their reply within a fortnight.

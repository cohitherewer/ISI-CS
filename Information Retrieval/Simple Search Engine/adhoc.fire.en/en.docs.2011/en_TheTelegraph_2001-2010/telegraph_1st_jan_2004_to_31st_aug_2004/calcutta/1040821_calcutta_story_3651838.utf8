The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 The killer looks like a college kid
 PRONAB MONDAL				 	 Suvojit Dey: Sharpshooter																								Hes 24, tall and handsome, matches a pro in shooting with both hands, speaks three languages fluently and sets the dance floors afire.																								Thats Suvojit Dey, arrested on Thursday in connection with the murder of civic employee Nakul Mahato two months ago. Two foreign-made revolvers and 25 cartridges were seized from him. 																								Better known as Shanu in the citys crime circuit, Suvojit had passed Higher Secondary from a central Calcutta school. Sleuths in the know said luck had been Suvojits most trusted companion till Thursday, when he was rounded up by plainclothesmen from Taltala thana while parking his motorcycle in Doctor Lane.																								What surprised officers was Suvojits style of functioning. When he walks down a road, he looks like any other college student. No one can imagine that he is actually going to extort money or kill someone, said A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Taltala police station.																								Always in jeans and T-shirt, Suvojit would carry two loaded revolvers  one tucked in his waist and the other in a bag, that resembled the ones used by college-goers. How can any one suspect him of being a notorious criminal? asks Majumdar.																								Suvojit was not one to give his rival a chance. After firing all six bullets from one revolver, if necessary, he would take out the other and empty it. He is deft at pulling the trigger with both hands, said an officer of Taltala thana.																								About Mahatos killing, Suvojit told the police during interrogation: I went on a shooting spree with my associates. The attack was a fallout of a land-dispute. We went there to kill one of our rivals. I first hurled bombs and then started firing indiscriminately. One of the bombs hit Mahato and blew his head off.																								Three of his alleged partners in crime had been arrested earlier.																								Recounting his rise in the underworld, a police officer said: Suvojit had his initiation six years ago. He knew there was a vacuum in the citys crime circuit following the arrest of the likes of Gabbar, Binod and Nadeem. He had seen himself as the one filling up the blank. 																								In the late 90s, Suvojit had formed a group and started extorting money from the businessmen of Taltala, Entally, Muchipara and New Market.

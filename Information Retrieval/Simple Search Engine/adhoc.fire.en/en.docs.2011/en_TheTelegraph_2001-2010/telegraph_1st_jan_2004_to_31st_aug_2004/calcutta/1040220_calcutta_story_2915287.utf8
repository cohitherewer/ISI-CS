 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Marks mess costs 18 years
 																											- 9 years after failure, man passes B.Com; case heard after another 9  OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								B.Com fail in 1986; changed to pass in 1995. Moved court against the injustice in 1995; first hearing in 2004.																								Sandipan Boses misfortunes have multiplied, with nine as the recurring number, as he has lost 18 years of his life to an error on his Calcutta University (CU) marksheet.																								It all began in 1986, when Bose of Belghoria appeared for the B.Com final examinations from the Bonhooghly College of Commerce. He did not expect to top the class, but he certainly did not expect to fail either. 																								But the mark of failure on his marksheet brought his world crashing down.																								All his dreams of appearing for competitive exams and building a career, block by block, had been dashed by that one small entry in the marksheet, designating him a failed B.Com examinee.																								Picking up the pieces, but refusing to take another crack at graduation, Bose cast aside his books and stepped out into the job market as a mere under-graduate.																								From giving tuition to schoolchildren to part-time jobs, he set about stitching together his means of sustenance.																								Then, one day in 1995  nine years after he had appeared for his B.Com exams  Bose received a letter from his college, asking him to collect his B.Com marksheet.																								When he contacted his college, he was told that a corrected marksheet had arrived. It showed that he had, in fact, passed the 86 examinations. Somebody, somewhere in CU, had messed up and Bose was a hapless victim.																								Bose decided to put up a fight against his misfortune. He moved Calcutta High Court, seeking a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for all the opportunities he had missed and the mental agony he had suffered.																								His lawyer argued in the petition that Bose could not appear for a number of competitive examinations as he was just an under-graduate. By the time he was informed that he was, indeed, a B.Com graduate, he had crossed the age limit.																								For a full nine years, Boses petition lay buried under more important matters and was passed from court to court  until it finally surfaced on Thursday.																								Eighteen years after the marksheet muddle ruined his life, Boses case came in the court of Justice Pratap Kumar Roy. His lawyer presented the case before the judge, who set Tuesday as the next date for hearing.																								Lawyers said Boses case might not have come up for hearing even on Thursday, had it not been for an initiative taken by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur.																								The chief justice has set aside two days  Tuesday and Thursday  for the hearing of cases that have been pending for a long time and for speeding up the process of justice.																								No one can give back Bose the 18 crucial years of his life. But he could be inching close to a belated glimpse of a measure of justice.

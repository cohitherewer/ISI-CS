 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Defence grills father in tears
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For the second day on Tuesday, defence lawyers grilled Manoj Patel, father of budding cricketer Rajnis Patel, who died in SSKM Hospital last June after a series of botched surgeries.																								The defence tried to pick holes in Manojs contradictory statements in court and the declaration in the complaint he had lodged with the police.																								On behalf of physician Nirmalya Basu, defence counsel Tapan Kumar Choudhury and his deputy Malay Choudhury asked Manoj whether he had been in a proper frame of mind while making his statements in front of the police on June 20, 2003. I had lost my son only a few days before and I told the police all that I remembered at that moment, Manoj replied. 																								Satisfied with the answer, Choudhury started cross-examining Manoj. Was it true that (doctor) Banerjee had advised you to admit your son to SSKM? Who had asked you to sign the document while Rajnis was undergoing his fifth and final operation? Did (doctor) Hira ever treat your son? How did you come to know the names of all the doctors? Choudhury asked.																								(Doctor) Souvik Bardhan advised me to put my son into SSKM. However, during the fifth operation, it was Nirmalya Basu who asked me to sign a paper. That surprised me, as I was not asked to do so on previous occasions. Basu asked me to sign it a second time and I gave my consent, said Rajnis father.																								Pressure was building up on Manoj as the defence was trying to get to the details, picking up dates at random from the four-month period that Rajnis had undergone treatment. The father put on a brave face and continued to answer the defence lawyers questions.																								Santosh Ghosh, one of the patients, had helped me identify all the doctors when I was groping in the dark. If he had not named them, I would have been unable to identify them, Manoj said. 																								The defence lawyer then put forward the clinching poser: If he knew the names of all the doctors why did he not name all of them and, mentioned only a few? 																								Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh, present throughout the grilling, intervened whenever required and urged sub-judicial magistrate Manjit Singh to help Manoj, the prime witness, understand the defence lawyers questions before he answered them. 																								Please ask the defence counsel to frame the questions in a simple manner, he said. 																								By the end of the one-hour session, Manoj was in tears, recalling his sons last moments. Sensing his agony, judge Singh adjourned the hearing for Wednesday noon.

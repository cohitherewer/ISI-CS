 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Home charity fails to save inmates life 
 PRONAB MONDAL																								It is known to be a nightmarish place, inhabited by people who have no humanity left in them. But even they have a streak of compassion that defies logic. 																								The residents of Liluah Home for Destitute Women used to regularly donate blood for another inmate suffering from leukaemia, till she died on Friday. 																								Namita Bhattacharyas battle for survival started six years ago. She was abandoned by her family in south Calcutta, but made a place for herself at the Liluah home.																								She was admitted to SSKM Hospital three days ago and we made arrangements for blood transfusion for her yesterday. Her condition started deteriorating during transfusion. She fought for life all night, but did not survive. This morning, we received the news that she is no more, elaborated superintendent Seuli Bala.																								The 22-year-old inmate of the homes rescue section had to spend seven years in the state-run refuge centre after she was thrown out by her brother and sister-in-law, who live in Behala. Her nightmare began six years ago, when the deadly disease was detected. 																								Namita used to require four units of A-positive blood once a month. Doctors declared that transfusions would help her survive but would not cure her fatal disorder.																								When she was alive, Namita had no one but the much-maligned sisters of the Liluah home by her side in her battle for survival. On several occasions, they came forward to donate blood and proved themselves to be her saviours. 																								One-and-a-half-years ago, they snatched her from the jaws of death. Seven girls, including Sabita, Mundori and Sujata, had launched a joint effort to bring her back home. They donated blood when the authorities of the home looked around in vain. 																								When news of the critical condition Namita was in reached the home on Thursday night, the inmates again declared in one voice: We dont want her to leave us. Once again, the inmates came forward to save her.																								Namitas co-inmates were shocked when the home authorities announced that Namita was not even in a position to accept blood. Tears started rolling down their cheeks.																								It was a sleepless night for the inmates. They held a prayer session through the night to see Namita back again, said an official of the destitutes home. 																								There was total silence when the news of her death reached us. Some of them left their rooms with tearful eyes. 																								The superintendent said Namitas family was informed about the death on Friday morning. 																								No one had come to collect the body so far from SSKM Hospital.

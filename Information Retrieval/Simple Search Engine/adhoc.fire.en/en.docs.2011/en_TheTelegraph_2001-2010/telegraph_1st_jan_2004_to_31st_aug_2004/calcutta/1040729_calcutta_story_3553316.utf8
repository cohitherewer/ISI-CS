The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Bengali at heart, Asian in bonding
				 	 K.V.P. Nair																								He came to Calcutta as an employee of a European company in 1961 and never went back. K.V.P. Nair set up a business here in 1966 that he hopes will be in the family for generations. Now, he calls himself an honorary Bengali, even though he doesnt speak the language. While it was a love for leftist ideals and the citys reputation of culture oozing from the taps that kept him here, his ties with the place have grown far more tangible.																								The man from Trivandrums business of supplying raw materials for Oriental medicines to South and Southeast Asia developed in him a passion for Asianism. At the forefront of his activities is developing relations in trade and tourism between West Bengal and southwest China. Starting in the 1970s, the 69-year-old has participated in numerous cross-border cultural and trade events, seminars to fairs.																								We need to develop better pan-Asian relationships, because those countries are our neighbours, explains Nair. And it is a testament to these efforts that the proverbial doors are open for the man from Ritchie Road in the most remote and inaccessible places. He has been welcomed in Mongolia, Siberia, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan among others.																								His explorations to far-off lands are also sparked by a quest for knowledge  a research on movement of civilisations and the geo-political associations between different regions in Asia. He has been up to the Arctic Circle  on occasions as the only Indian  and even studied the methods of treatment in a Shamanist hospital in Siberia. He has twice been the subject of interactive seminars and exhibitions at Gorky Sadan.																								Nairs Mongolian sojourns have often been possible with the Prime Ministers help (a personal friend), the last being a guided tour of the Nadaam festival in 2002. But the crowning glory, admits the father of two while fondly rifling through photo albums, was being the private partner for a cultural exhibition in Phnom Penh a couple of years ago. The Cambodian partner was the ministry of culture, and it was inaugurated by the minister, Princess Bhupa Devi.																								The man who set up the Asia Centre three years ago to promote Asianism returned in June from a trade fair in China, where he was the sole West Bengal representative, promoting tourism. And he will be taking some members of the group from Yunan, who will be here in August on a trade trip, on a days tour of the city. Although the non-profit group he had set up to promote upcoming Asian artists is currently inactive, his passion for culture is alive, be it through Asia Centre or ASEAN activities.

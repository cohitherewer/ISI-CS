 															- World yoga contestant has no money to go to spain NISHA LAHIRI				 	 Amit Dey. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								He is fit enough to warrant a place in the world yoga championships to be held in October. But he doesnt have the funds to make it there.																								Amit Dey is one of 15 contestants selected by the Yoga Federation of India to participate in The 13 World Yoga Championships on October 16 and 17, a world cup of the ancient sport, in Madrid, Spain. The 27-year-old is a district and state champ of yoga, and was second in the national championships held in Madhya Pradesh.																								He began yoga at a neighbours behest in 1991  she saw me playing at home and was amazed with my flexibility  and practised at the local club. He has since appeared on Doordarshan and participated in several competitions, at the state and national level. His next target is the Spain conference, in the athletic, artistic and rhythmic yoga categories.																								I can afford to go for the coaching camp in Haryana, from October 1 to 13, but gathering around Rs 70,000 for the trip to Spain I cant do, says Amit.																								The young man from Sukantapally, in Subhashgram, lives in a small home with his wife, parents and younger brother. Amit had to give up college due to financial constraints, and joined an accounting job, but gave it up to pursue his creative interests. Having learnt from an artist uncle, he now designs and hand-paints saris and kurtas. 																								Although portraits are his favourite, Amit recreates Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Jamini Roy, Madhubani, abstract and even the entire tale of Goopi and Bagha onto fabric, first sketching and then painting them, with a little help from his assistants. But the rewards for his painstaking efforts are Rs 40 to Rs 50 for a kurta and Rs 200 for a sari.																								I feel very happy when I see people wearing the clothes, particularly famous personalities. For instance, at a musical programme at Nazrul Manch recently, saris and kurtas painted by me were given to the celebrities, smiles Amit.																								However, it is small satisfaction, with a family to run and a passion to pursue. His fathers business had to be wrapped up due to an illness and the elderly invalid now sells lottery tickets at the station with his younger son. 																								I would love to go to Spain, but I know that if I dont get financial support, I wont be able to sighs Amit.

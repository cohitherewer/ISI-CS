 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Bowled over on charity pitch
 Chandrasekhar, Bedi and Prasanna at the auction. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								Souravs boys may have received a thrashing in the Asia Cup at the hands of Pakistan in Colombo on Sunday, but, at about the same time, there was far more to cheer at the cricket memorabilia auction at ITC Sonar Bangla. 																								Big bucks and some spirited bidding saw Nishant Singhals collection of autographs garner a total tally of Rs 10,80,000.																								Organised by the Lions Clubs International District 322B1, the proceeds of the auction will be donated to the Bless A Child programme for underprivileged kids undertaken by the club.																								The cause  and the goods under the hammer  evoked a generous response from bidders, with most of the autographed bats and other knick-knacks fetching five figures, with a few rare gems like the Douglas Jardin linen touching a six-figure high.																								Indias living legends like the spin trio of Bishen Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar spun their magic on buyers, alongside pitch-side queen Mandira Bedi. It wasnt a wonder that the audience was soon bowled over and cricket crazed enough to pull out their chequebooks without a thought.																								Add to it a sleek talker like emcee Kishore Bhimani and the bats did a much better job off field than on this particular evening.																								The linen featuring 97 autographs of cricket giants like Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Imran Khan, Dennis Lee, Tony Greig, Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly was the prize catch that was gloved for Rs 4,25,000 by Jagdish Sharda.An autograph book inscribed by the 1932 Indian cricket team boasting names like Lala Amarnath, C.K. Naidu and Vijay Merchant came a close second at Rs 2,40,000, grabbed by Dubai-based collector Shyam Bhatia over the phone.																								The current crop of cricketers were not far behind with a bat bearing the insignia of only Sachin, Sourav and Jadeja going for Rs 50,000, a little less than what Mandira expected.																								This bat shouldnt go for less than Rs 75,000, she urged. At her behest, the bid immediately went up from Rs 30,000 to 50,000, where it closed. The one featuring the TVS Cup Australian team that visited India in 2003 also did well at Rs 55,000.																								The spirit continued with a bat autographed by the rampaging Indian team that went to Dhaka in 2003 after the World Cup, featuring young guns like Yuvraj and Kaif, touching the Rs 50,000 mark, too.																								If there were hits, there were misses as well. The bat signed by the newcomer Bangladesh team that took on Zimbabwe on home turf in 2001 went for Rs 25,000, while that signed by the 1996 champion Sri Lanka team notched up only Rs 11,000, which Bhimani put down to bidding fatigue. 																								But the most disappointing sell was the autograph book featuring the likes of C.K. Naidu, Wazir Ali, Kartik Bose, Amar Singh (in Hindi) and Douglas bodyline Jardin that went for a measly Rs 5,000.																								Singhal sat impassive as he watched his 40-year-old collection slip out of his grip. But he didnt seem to care. If I kept it all for myself, Ill only be rich in kind. There is no proper museum where all of it could be preserved. Im happy to have given it away for a good cause, he said.																								But he couldnt help holding back two bats for his seven-year-old son, one signed by Sachin and another by Sourav, specifically addressed to the young fan. 																								Singhal, with cricket clearly in his blood, proved unbeatable. He started his second innings then and there, proudly displaying a bat signed by the three cricketers present. See, Ive started all over again, Singhal smiled.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

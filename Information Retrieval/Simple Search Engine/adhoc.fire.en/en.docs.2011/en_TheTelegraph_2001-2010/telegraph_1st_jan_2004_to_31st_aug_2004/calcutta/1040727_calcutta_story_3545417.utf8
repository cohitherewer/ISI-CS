The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Say no to noodle straps
Mandira Bedi. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Over a Sunday brunch in south Calcutta, designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh decided on a wardrobe makeover for Mandira Bedi.																								Clothes with spirit and style, sexy in shape but bindaas in attitude is what Kiran prescribes to turn the spirited TV personality into a glam style diva. The one no-no: noodle straps (been there, done that). Oh, Im tired of wearing saris, pouted Mandira while flaunting a gold and off-white crinkled skirt fringed with some shiny gota lace in trademark Kiran style. Teamed with a matching gota backless choli, Mandira pulled off the ensemble to a stunning effect, effervescent smile firmly in place. 																								Kirans clothes have a lot of spirit, Mandira gushed, trying out a flaming red skirt splashed with plum and magenta frills and tissue for an antique look. Teamed with a magenta T-shirt, Mandira lent new meaning to contemporary chic. 																								Mandira admits to an instant connect with the designer, and the two hope to stitch together many more collaborations and collections. 																								With the prettiest face of cricket making news with her clothes as much as her way with the game, both designer and damsel, we are sure, will take care to play to the galleries.

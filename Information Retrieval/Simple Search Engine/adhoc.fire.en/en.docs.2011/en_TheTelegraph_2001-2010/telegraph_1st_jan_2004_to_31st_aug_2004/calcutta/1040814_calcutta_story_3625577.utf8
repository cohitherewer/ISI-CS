TUBE TALK - Independence Day Special Amitabh Bachchan in Deewaar: Patriots all Your ambitious plans to celebrate Independence Day might just go down the drain if the rain gods decide not to take the day off. But you would have enough happening on the small screen to keep you glued to the couch. So stock up the fun munch and bite into the best on the beam this August 15:Zameen (Star Gold, 12.30 pm) The two cool dudes of Bollywood play the lead in this Pakistan-bashing saga. Colonel Ajay Devgan strays into the hyper Sunny Deol territory by bashing up any desh ka dushman in sight while ACP Abhishek Bachchan spends some high-voltage time with sultry siren Bipasha Basu when off-duty. Sholay (Zee Cinema, 12.30 pm) Time to tune into Satyajit Rays fave commercial film from Bollywood yet again. Spend the afternoon with Thakursaab, Jai, Veeru, Basanti, Radha and, of course, Gabbar. Karma (Set Max, 5 pm) This Subhash Ghai-directed multi-starrer is patriotism personified. Powerhouse performances by Dilip Kumar and Naseeruddin Shah make it worth a watch. Deewaar (Zee TV, 8 pm) Zee pulled off a coup of sorts by bagging the television rights for this recent Big B-starrer. Though the film did not set the box-office on fire, the performances of Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt would be enough to warm up your monsoon evening.Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai (Sony, 8 pm) Govinda plays an innocent villager in Mahesh Manjrekars directorial debut. With the leggy Sonali Bendre and the chirpy Rinke Khanna keeping him cosy company, Govinda is the one to watch.

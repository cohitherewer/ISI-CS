 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Kills wife, drinks poison
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A middle-aged man, employed with a transport company, tried to kill himself by consuming poison on Sunday evening, shortly after murdering his wife in their Jatin Das Road house, in south Calcutta.																								Anil Mandal, 40, killed Alpana, 33, with a blunt kitchen object, following an altercation. Their 16-year-old daughter Banashree was not at home when the tragedy unfolded.																								There are reasons to believe that the relationship between the two was strained, said a police officer. As a quarrel broke out in the kitchen, Anil suddenly started beating up Alpana. He then picked up the pestle and smashed it down on her head. Alpana slumped to the floor, dead.																								When he realised what he had done, Anil went to the toilet and consumed a bottle of phenyl in a bid to end his life, the officer added.																								Banashree returned home to find the main door locked from inside. She made her way in through the back door, only to find her parents lying on the kitchen floor. 																								After the teenaged girl raised an alarm, Anil was rushed to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where his condition was stated to be critical.Murder protest: Traffic was disrupted for nearly an hour at Madhyamgram, on the citys northern fringes, on Sunday following the murder of a Trinamul Congress worker allegedly by a CPM activist. 																								The victim, identified as Habu Mallick, 30, was fired from close range at Purba Udayrajpur. He was declared dead at a local hospital. Trinamul workers put up a roadblock demanding arrest of the culprits.

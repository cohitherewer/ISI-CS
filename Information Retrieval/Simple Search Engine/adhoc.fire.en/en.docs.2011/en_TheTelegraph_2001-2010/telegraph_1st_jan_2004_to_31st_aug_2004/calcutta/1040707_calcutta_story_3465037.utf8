The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Ringo StarrWhen you speak, others pause to listen. You are gentle and romantic, but with sharp business sense. You are original in your approach to things. Material and mental satisfaction help you enjoy life. You have an inherent knack for art, though you may not use it often. You are fond of films, picnics and other sources of fun.  Kusum Bhandari

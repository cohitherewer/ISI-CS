Feng Shui Pinky Kapoor Wanna set sail? A picture of a ship is all you need to give shape to your travel plans, advises Feng Shui. (AFP)Q I am very fond of travelling but rarely get the opportunity to do so. I would especially like to venture out of the country. Could you please suggest appropriate pictures or motifs that will help activate my wish? Do placing overlapping slippers outside the door help? Please advise.																								Mridula Sen, Ultadanga																								A: Since you are keen on travelling to distant lands, you should put up pictures of specific places you would like to visit in the north-west area of your bedroom. As this area is connected with travel and movement, images of ships and aeroplanes would greatly enhance your prospects of travelling. 																								Alternatively, hang a world map and highlight the places you wish to go to with a yellow marker. Your dreams will only materialise when the placement is done with powerful and positive thoughts on an auspicious day. 																								It is an Indian superstition that you are going to travel when unknowingly your slippers or shoes overlap each other, but it doesnt help if you intentionally let them overlap each other.Q: I got a Chinese pig as a gift, which a friend brought from China. But from the time Ive got it, Ive been troubled with some problem or the other. First my father was diagnosed with a serious disease. Then I brought the pig to office and ever since Ive been having problems at the workplace. I would gladly get rid of the creature but am scared of worse consequences. Please suggest a way out. (DOB: 02.04.1977).Sunetra Saha, BeckbaganA: Chinese animal signs are like zodiac signs in Indian astrology. According to your year of birth, your animal sign is Snake. In Chinese astrology Pig clashes with the Snake. So its obvious that you are not comfortable with the figure of a pig around. It is recommended that you either keep the figure or a picture of your animal sign to give your sign the required strength or one that protects you from the clashing figure. The Tiger is a good option in your case. You can safely gift the pig to someone who belongs to this animal sign or simply remove it from your surroundings. Alternatively, you can float it in running water. Q: We have no option but to hang our used clothes on pegs in our bedroom for future use. Is it supposed to create bad chi? The pegs are placed at right angles beside the bed. Please suggest alternatives if it is not a healthy practice. But we cant really afford to take the pegs out of the room.Raina Banerjee, Lansdowne																								A: Used clothes can be hung in the room during the day but the Chinese believe that during the night they absorb yin energy. It is best to keep them in cupboards if they are to be worn again. It is not advisable to be surrounded by clothes worn during the day while sleeping.																								Q: I really like the Thai practice of keeping water features outside the entrances of houses and rooms. I keep a similar arrangement outside the door of my bedroom that holds water in a rectangular glass vessel with some seashells at the bottom. I sometimes put fresh flowers from my garden in it. There are also two red candles by its side. Is this a correct practice? If not, please suggest a Feng Shui-friendly arrangement that will be as auspicious as it will look good.Priyanka Mishra, Southern Avenue 																								A: This is definitely a wonderful practice, but you need to make a few changes to bring out the best results from this arrangement. The water and the flowers in the vessel should be changed every morning without fail. Introduce the missing metal element in the form of coins to complete natures perfect blend of the five elements. It is best placed at the focal point in front of an image of god. Apart from looking beautiful and creating a calm and peaceful environment in the house, it also helps family members tap their favourable personal elements.

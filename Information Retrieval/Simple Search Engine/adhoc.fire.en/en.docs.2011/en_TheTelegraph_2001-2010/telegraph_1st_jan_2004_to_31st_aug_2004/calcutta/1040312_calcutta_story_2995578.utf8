Pix by Rashbehari Das  Models Sharan (left) and Jenny with fashion designer Abhishek Dutta at his new studio												Fashion designer Abhishek Dutta has not only carved a niche for himself in the fashion world but has also set up his own studio called Couture. Billed as being more than just a design studio, Couture will make available personalised and customised clothes from the young designer. With rugged wooden interiors fashioned out of blocks of wood, the studio has a contemporary feel to it. A glance at the garments on display and you know that there is a generous collection of ethnic, Western as well as Indo-Western garments on display. Abhishek attends to his clients by prior appointment and suggests accessories to go with each outfit. He attempts to put emphasis on the entire look and style.																					Abhishek Duttas latest collection consists of fusion street-wear inspired from street plays and jatras. It consists of glimpses of different epics in the form of embroideries and embellishments. He experiments with asymmetrical cuts and different embroideries and re-works them to suit contemporary trends. Leather patch-work with kalamkari mark his designs and a contrast compilation of jersey and denim, jersey and hand-woven fabrics showcase this to best effect. Leather rivets, brocade, zardosi and denim fringes mark his garments. Abhishek has used hand-woven matka silk with lycra in his signature fishtails. The silhouettes consist, apart from signature fishtails, of capris, knitted churidars, corset-styled tops, jackets and T-shirts. Present at the inauguration was actress June Maliah. Models Jenny and Sharan walked the makeshift ramp in the designers creations.																					A fashion designer from Wigan amp; Leigh College, Abhishek bagged the Smirnoff International Fashion awards title in 1999. He supplies to 14 national stores and decided to open his own studio to cater to the need for high-fashion garments. At his studio, the couture collection starts from Rs 15,000 onwards and extends upwards depending on the exclusivity of the outfit. So, if youre someone who doesnt mind coughing up that extra bit, Couture gives you a chance to look trendy while maintaining your personal style. Aruna Dhanuka receives the Millennium Mams award for continuity with excellence at the annual symposium of the organisation												A step ahead																					Millennium Mams was set up in 1994 by Bishnu Dhanuka and Sanjay Bhuwania to further the cause of womens liberation, the upliftment of the fairer sex, and focus on a programme wherein women develop their understanding and awareness of business and economy. To celebrate womens empowerment, Millennium Mams organised its annual symposium at The Taj Bengal. Millennium Mams believes that every woman is multi-faceted, each facet adds a dimension to her personality and between all her roles, she balances herself perfectly and forges ahead. 																					Taking off from the premise that women are rated three per cent higher in intelligence than men and are naturally gifted with extrasensory skills, a presentation was made on all products made with pride in India and imported abroad and the concept of spiritual quotient. Members celebrated the change in societal outlook and the ever-evolving cocktail culture and shopping experience. 																					A group presentation by some members dwelt on the fact that the conversations between women have undergone a sea change from gym and weight- loss to Sensex figures. Lauding the successful entry of women in male-dominated sports, politics and entrepreneurship, the presentation focussed on the inherent ability of women to anticipate change, adapt to it and change to a fast track. With the General Elections round the corner, there followed a presentation titled Kaun Banega Pradhanmantri. At the end of the symposium, Aruna Dhanuka was awarded the Millennium Mams award for continuity with excellence.																					With 325 members, Millennium Mams runs classes in two batches. The classes focus on capital marketing, finance and accounts and stress the importance of reading business dailies and magazines to remain abreast of economic changes. Classes are held once a week. Millennium Mams also organises Millennium Youth Summer Camps at regular intervals.  Painters Partha Bhattacharjee and Wasim Kapoor with actress Piu Sarkar and guests (left to right) at an art exhibition at The Park												Art with a heart																					City artists got together to paint a pretty picture at The Park, Banquets recently. The meet was made prettier by the fact that the proceeds of the exhibition will go to Anubhav, a social welfare project dedicated to providing quality care for underprivileged children and the elderly. 																					The swish set of Calcutta admired the works of eminent artists such as Suhas Roy, Wasim Kapoor, Partha Bhattacharjee, Avijit Dutta, Pintu Paul, Shubhra, Gaurango Beshai, Sukanto Das and Anita Gurbaxani. The paintings captured the essence of life through a variety of subjects and styles  landscapes, nature, women, mythology and more. While Pintu Pauls acrylic on canvasses depicted voluptuous women in various postures, Sanatan Dindas cracked wall-effect drew admiration from all present. Worth special mention are also Samir Pauls old Calcutta paintings with an interesting play of light and shade. In the same vein were Kallol Basus water colour works depicting an old haveli and more. Offsetting this old-world charm were vibrant flowers by musician Louis Banks, achieved with acrylic on board. 																					Partha Bhattacharjees painting titled, Boat of Love, depicting a woman playing the flute with a paper boat by her side, impressed many. Bhattacharjee, winner of the President of India Silver Plaque as the artist of the year 2000-2001, sought to explain his composition thus: The boat in the painting symbolises unfulfilled dreams, while the flute stands for love that is seldom found in this world. The monochromatic tint of the painting, on the other hand, speaks of our struggle in day-to-day existence that often renders our lives drab. But above all, I like playing with moods and expressions, thus the moving expression of the woman in the painting.																					Seen mingling with the crowd was painter Wasim Kapoor at his charming best, who had been able to exhibit only one of his works at the exhibition, owing to his busy schedule. It stood out, nevertheless, due to its deft lines and minimalist approach. It was a Conti sketch, a medium highly preferred by old masters, depicting a face with its eyes covered with a band of dark lines. The composition seemed to veer towards abstraction, but Wasim shrugged it off. The subject here is secondary. What is of interest here is the play of light and shade and the minimal number of lines used. The eyes are darkened simply because the light is falling from above, he said.																					The presence of actress-cum-painter Piu Sarkar added to the glamour. This show is especially enjoyable for me as I personally know all the artists, she gushed. Piu went on to add, Art is beyond canvas and each one of the painters here has a signature style that sets them apart from one another. Much as I would love to be diplomatic, I cant refrain from admitting that I absolutely adore Wasims works, they seem to have a life of their own. This apart, I feel Parthas works stand out on account of his unique technique. Model Pinky shows off jewellery from the new range at Jewel Co. 												Jewels in the crown																					Old is gold and antique is in, if the Victorian jewellery exhibition at the Jewel Co. store at HHI is anything to go by. Showcasing baubles, pendant sets and bracelets studded with precious and semi-precious stones in gold, silver and a combination of both, the exhibits have been given an oxidised finish to lend an antique look. Ive been travelling abroad a lot and have culled many of these ideas from a variety of jewellery exhibitions across Europe and America, says Nikunj Lodha, a young designer and owner of the store. 																					The jewels are high on detail and finesse and reflect the design sensibilities of the Victorian era, while a few of the pieces showcase motifs put together from the Mughal era as well. Most of the pieces are crafted out of 50 per cent gold and 50 per cent silver and are encrusted with a glittering array of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, blue sapphires, yellow sapphires, blue topaz, yellow topaz and tourmalines. While the delicate pendant sets pair best with Westernwear and Indo-Westerns, the chunky danglers and earrings go well with saris and lehengas. Leaves, flowers and bells are the motifs to look out for. Prices start at Rs 5,000 and can go up to Rs 3 lakh. The exhibition is on till March 15.

 															- 12-yr-old film-makers offer hot meal, Buddha proffers production facility  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ami director Ashikul Islam (left) and photographer Saiful Mondal show chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the movie camera they won at the Athens film festival at Writers Buildings on Tuesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Jethu, tumi jethima aar didi-ke niye amader home-ey esho (Uncle, do visit our home with aunty and sister).																								Khichuri khaoabey to (Youll treat us to khichuri, I hope)?																								A deal with a difference was struck on Tuesday in the chief ministers chamber. 																								The deal-makers  all on the same side of the table  were two 12-year-olds, Ashikul Islam and Saiful Mondol, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								Ashikul and Saiful promised to serve piping hot khichuri to the chief minister, his wife Meera and daughter Suchetana if and when they visit Muktoneer, a home for destitute children in Madhyamgram and cradle for the creative pursuits of the boys and their friends.																								Ami, a 20-minute documentary by the children of Muktoneer, won the overall grand first prize at the Kids for Kids International Film Festival at Athens in June.																								Its a deal, we will serve you khichuri, just let us know the date of your visit, smiled Saiful and Ashikul.																								Aami porey janabo, barite boltey hobe to, (I will let you know later, I will have to first tell my family about it), Bhattacharjee told the boys.																								Directed by Ashikul and shot by Saiful, Ami, dealing with things children are curious about, won the grand first at the June 18-21 meet in Athens, explained Muktoneer secretary Swapan Mukherjee. 																								There were 323 films in the festival, from 112 countries, of which 45 were selected for the competition. Ami was the lone entry from Asia and the Muktoneer boys won a movie camera for their efforts.																								I dont know how to use a movie camera, the chief minister confessed, and the boys immediately turned tutor.																								Dont worry, well teach you how to use it, piped up Saiful and Ashikul.																								As home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and other senior officials looked on in bemusement, the two boys proceeded to hand the states chief minister (who spends almost every evening at Nandan) his first tips in camera-handling.																								Then, it was time to show Jethu some still photographs they had taken with their camera at the home. Take the ones you like, Ashikul told Bhattacharjee.																								Initially hesitant, the chief minister soon warmed to a particularly poignant frame in which Ashikul is seen playing with a duck at Muktoneer. All right, let me keep this one, he said.																								The boys had more in store for the chief minister. Next up, a plea: please tell film-maker Goutam Ghose to help us learn the craft (and fast). After all, the two have already conceived their next venture.																								On his part, Bhattacharjee promised to roll out the red carpet at Roopkala Kendra if the boys ever wanted to use the Salt Lake facilities.																								It was well past 1.30 pm, the half-hour at which Bhattacharjee leaves Writers Buildings every afternoon and heads home for lunch.																								But on Tuesday  much to the surprise of Writers  the chief minister happily missed his departure deadline by a good 15 minutes. Before finally taking his leave, Bhattacharjee asked his staff to ensure that his special visitors did not leave on an empty stomach.

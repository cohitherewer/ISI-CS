The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Mar the wall, bar the leader
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should candidates be penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days? defacing democracy? Poll posters on a city road. (A Telegraph picture)UJJAL Bhattacharyya, 
																		Entally. 																																																														The huge expenditure on any partys poll propaganda is a waste of money and effort, as such publicity is valid only before the elections. After that, they merely add to the citys visual pollution. It is unfortunate that local people, and not the parties, have to remove the graffiti. It would be a well-justified move to penalise a candidate if the partys poll graffiti are not removed within seven days. Political honchos ought to set examples by cleaning up the city. However, reality is a far cry from the ideal. 									

Suchismita Chakraborty, 
																		Jadavpur.																																																														As residents of a democratic state, we are all expected to be more sensible, responsible and conscious of our civic rights and duties. Poll graffiti fail to impress upon the majority of people a candidates credentials and worthiness to be elected. They succeed in motivating only a handful to cast their vote in favour of the respective candidate. So, soon after the election, candidates should remove the graffiti within a stipulated time.Seraj Alam, 
Bansberia, Hooghly. India is a democratic nation and election is a part of the democratic process. Though poll graffiti are unnecessary, they are reflectory. So, any material publicising poll content should not be removed within a stipulated time period. It all depends upon the bearing of the people. Therefore, no candidate should be penalised for not removing poll graffiti. 									

Vivek Mukherjee, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														Candidates should be penalised for not removing poll graffiti on time. A fine should be charged from them, if they delay the work. If a warning fails to work, they should be restrained from putting up poll graffiti during future election campaigns. Lack of stern action against errant candidates encourage them to carry on with their misdeeds.									

Nupur Banerjee,
																		Sarsuna.																																																														The candidate contesting the polls has no right to rob the city of its charm and beauty by putting up publicity material. The election commission should not allow display of ugly paintings or posters for political purposes. Only items which can be removed easily should be allowed. 									

Arfeen Ariff, 
																		Moti Sil Street.																																																														Candidates should not be penalised. Instead, it should be made mandatory for all parties to pay a tidy sum in advance to the civic authorities for removal of poll graffiti after the elections. Usually, the winning candidates become too powerful to attend to small and insignificant jobs like removing graffiti, while the losers usually go on self-imposed exiles for a few weeks, away from public glare. So, it is futile to expect them to remove the poll graffiti.									

Amarnath Chowdhury,
																		Barrackpore.																																																														Poll graffiti make the city resemble a garbage dump. They are a nuisance. Candidates should be punished if graffiti are not removed within seven days. In fact, they should not be given even seven days for the job. They should be asked to clean the city immediately after the election. 									

Joydeep Chatterjee, 
																		Shyambazar.																																																														Poll graffiti should be removed or erased after election. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) should set a time-limit within which all parties must clean up graffiti. If they dont, the CMC should take legal action against them, maybe by issuing a fine.									

K.L. Ghosh, 
																		Kalindi. 																																																														Poll graffiti should be allowed only on condition that they should be removed within seven days after election. Non-adherence should be treated on par with the offence of flouting any other law of the land. 									

Arijit Ghosh,
																		Shyamnagar.																																																														There is simply no reason to punish the candidates if their partys poll graffiti are not removed. The graffiti look colourful and they lend a new look to the city in the election season.									

Satyen Biswas, 
																		Behala.																																																														Cleanliness is next to godliness. Once the votes are cast, the candidates should erase the graffiti as they serve no purpose any longer. Apart from the candidates, it is also the partys duty to ensure the removal of the graffiti. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should write to all the parties and urge them to keep the city clean. 									

Ronita Dutta, 
																		Jadavpur.																																																														Though poll graffiti is necessary to disburse information about the contestants and the parties, it is also important that an earnest attempt be made to beautify the city. In that case, it becomes essential to erase the graffiti as early as possible. 									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia, Nadia.																																																														Since poll graffiti deface the walls of residential premises, the candidates concerned should be penalised if they are not removed within seven days. This rule will provide great relief to house-owners. 									

Pijus Kanti Sarkar, 
																		Narendrapur.																																																														As soon as a person builds a house, the facade gets defaced by graffiti. Parties should be allowed to use only banners, hoarding and cut-outs for their campaigns. Removing them will be easy. 									

Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna.																																																														The election commission stipulates a fee to be charged when the candidate files the nomination paper. It would be a good idea to charge an additional amount from all the candidates or political parties towards the government exchequer to create a fund that can be later utilised for removing the poll graffiti. Reluctant politicians must be penalised. 									

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 
																		Chandbati, Hooghly.																																																														During the recently-concluded Lok Sabha election, there were huge cut-outs of the mayor of Calcutta all over the city. Pedestrians faced the risk of getting squashed under the huge wooden frames during Norwesters. Did Subrata Mukherjee take permission from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) before putting up the displays? The same CMC pulled down billboards and hoardings, claiming that their owners had not purchased the licences for the same. Henceforth, the CMC should impose similar charges on politicians for putting up hoardings as well.

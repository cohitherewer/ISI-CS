The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004  Calcutta Column

	On days when the Opposition parties call bandhs, a large number of state buses are seen plying on the streets. It seems the state administration makes a serious effort to activate its transport service only on such occasions. However, the absence of state buses is conspicuous when the strike is supported by the ruling party. Even on normal days, hardly 25 per cent of the full strength of state buses are seen on roads. The authorities should ensure a higher frequency of CSTC buses throughout the year to ease our problems.

	Chicken is sold in every nook and corner of the city under the most unhygienic of conditions. The sellers usually dip the fresh meat in a bucketful of dirty water. The scene itself is enough to repel buyers. With the bird flu sparking a panic everywhere, the Calcutta Municipal Corporations health officials should ensure that utmost precautions are taken in the meat shops.

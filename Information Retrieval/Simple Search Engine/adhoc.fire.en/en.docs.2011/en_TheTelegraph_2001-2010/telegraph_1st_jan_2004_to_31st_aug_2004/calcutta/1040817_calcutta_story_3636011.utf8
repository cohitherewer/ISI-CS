The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004  Star Spot
				 	KARAN GOENKAKaran GoenkaReady, steady, go...Is what this youngster has been used to since the day he was born. This 14-year-old has many a title to his credit, from dancing to quizzing, all-rounder to participation in fests, painting to scouting and generally being outgoing. But driving  on the race track  is where his particular talent lies. Vroom, vroom...Thats the sweet sound of success for the former student of Birla High School. Although now in Sarla Birla Academy in Bangalore, his go-karting career began right here, in the city of his birth. Score card...Includes titles like the go-karting championships in association with The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS) and inter-school go-karting championship in Clown Town. Came first in both challenges. Karan also gave the competitors a run for their money in national competitions in other parts of the country, including second in the National Rotomax Challenge, third leg, in Bangalore last month. That was after the top prize in the first leg.Right track...Karan is on. First second or third places are usually his position on the award podium, go-karting or otherwise. Intra and inter-school competitions, certificates of excellence in painting and the first prize in the smart kid painting competition, participation in the Bournvita Quiz contest, best scout and best all-round boy in junior school in Class V, excellence in extracurricular activities... the list is varied and long. A high achiever from a young age. Shake a leg...He knows how to, having done so at quite a few dance competitions. This smart and savvy Aries, however, aims to stick to what he knows best when it comes to career  go-karting. Not that it stops Karan from trying everything at least once. And usually doing it quite well, too. Keep an eye out, for this new fast kid on the race track might be blazing across the international scene pretty soon. For now, though, studying is equally important.

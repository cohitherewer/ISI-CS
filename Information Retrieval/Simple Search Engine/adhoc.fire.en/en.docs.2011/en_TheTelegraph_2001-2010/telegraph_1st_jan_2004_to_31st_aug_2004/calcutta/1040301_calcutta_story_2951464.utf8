 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 This Madhyamik, an oasis for guardians
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								A Behala club has come up with a cool plan to help parents who wait under the scorching sun for their children appearing in the Madhyamik examination.																								The club will set up camps in front of 12 schools in the citys south, at which guardians will not only get a place to rest for three hours but also avail of newspapers, periodicals, the TV, drinking water and free tea and snacks.																								About 200,000 students will write the Madhyamik exams this year. The club authorities try to help many of their guardians. The camps, to be set up in the Behala and Thakurpukur belt by Barisha Shakti Sangha, Behala, will remain open on all days of the exam, starting March 5 till March 16. 																								Club secretary Tarun Kumar Mukherjee said members had been planning for a long time to arrange for places where anxious parents can wait in front of examination centres all over the Thakurpukur-Behala belt. Last year, we set up four camps and got a good response. This year, we plan to do it in a bigger way. About Rs 10,000 will be spent on each camp, he said. 																								Camps will be put up in front of a dozen schools, including Brahmachari Pranesh Kumar Girls High School in Thakurpukur, CNI Boys High School on MG Road, Purbapara High School on James Long Sarani, Barisha Asar Girls High School in Silpara, Baidyapara Girls High School on Motilal Gupta Road in Sakherbazar, Janakalyan Girls and Uchcha Balika Vidyamandir on James Long Sarani near Behala Chowrasta, Children Welfare Association for Girls and Basudebpur High School in Sarsuna, Behala Shikshayatan and Behala Girls High School, both near Behala police station, and Paschimputiari Sukharanjan Vidyapith, in Thakurpukur. 																								An auto-rickshaw will wait in front of each camp to help students, if any one forgets to bring his or her admit card or any essential paper related to the examination. This auto service will be free. Each school has about 500 examinees. The exam routine for each day will be on display. Signs will direct buses and autos where to stop.

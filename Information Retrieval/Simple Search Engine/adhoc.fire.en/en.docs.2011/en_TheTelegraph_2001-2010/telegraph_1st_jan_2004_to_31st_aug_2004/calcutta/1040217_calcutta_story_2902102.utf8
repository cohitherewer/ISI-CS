The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Grab-after-dark fee for all
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND JULIUS GOMES																								When you forked out that extra Rs 100 note last week to reach home after 10 pm from Howrah station, you ended up being part of a multi-crore racket  at your own expense.																								And if you think that the taxi driver  more extortionist than knight rider  and his colleagues pocketed all the spoils after dropping you off, youre way off the mark. For, the taxi driver who operates after the pre-paid counter at Howrah station packs up for the night is just the most visible face of a racket that runs deep and wide.																								The grab-after-dark chain starts at the door of a political party (whose leader, incidentally, heads the firm that controls taxi operations near the station) and ends at the door of the policeman (with whom the citizen is supposed to register a complaint).																								It, therefore, becomes all but impossible for the passenger to wriggle out of the vortex without paying his/her way out of Howrah station.																								But the economics of the coercive system is such that it makes it difficult for the rogue driver to escape unscathed.																								According to estimates drawn up by police, at least 7,000 of the 25,000-odd taxis that ply in the city daily pass through the station. If even a fifth of these operates at night, that makes 1,400 taxis touching Howrah station every night.																								Again, if each taxi pays the Howrah Government Railway Police station Rs 100 every day  this estimate, too, is drawn up by senior police officers themselves  it translates into a cash flow of Rs 1.4 lakh daily to this small office, or roughly Rs 5 crore every year.																								If each taxi pays Rs 20 every night to the tout, keeping a kitty for the leader, it adds up to another tidy sum of Rs 1 crore per annum. If the touts network has to be paid Rs 10 separately, it adds up to another Rs 50-lakh figure.																								The driver, however, is left with a fraction of Rs 6.5 crore. We will have to starve if we go by the meter even at night, said driver Sanjay Yadav, as he waited outside the station for passengers to fall into his taxi trap.																								Most taxis that touch Howrah station ply on the basis of a baat-cheet system  that is, a driver hires a taxi for a specified period from its owner. For hiring a taxi from 8 pm to 6 am, a driver has to hand over Rs 150 to its owner. Then, he has to buy 12 litres of fuel, which costs Rs 288, going by the current market rate.																								So, before he has earned a single paisa, the taxi driver has already spent Rs 438. Then, he has to meet the demands of the policeman, the politician and the tout. All this sets him back by around Rs 130, pushing his expenses up to around Rs 568.																								Assuming that the driver takes the longest trips (say, south Calcutta), he would be getting anything between Rs 100 and Rs 150 every trip.																								But every night, a driver cannot hope to make more than two trips out of Howrah station. And, while coming back, he cannot hope to get too many passengers. So, the cabbie makes as much money as possible by fleecing the night-train passenger and making up for his losses.																								The black ants fuelling a lucrative and illegal business patronised by policemen and politicians, they are, they argue, as much victims of the system as the passengers they exploit.

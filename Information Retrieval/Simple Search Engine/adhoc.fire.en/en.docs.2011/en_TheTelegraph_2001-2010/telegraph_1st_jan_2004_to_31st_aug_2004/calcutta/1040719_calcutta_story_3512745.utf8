 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Sniff of chemical as killer potion
 A STAFF REPORTER																								No strangulation mark. No sign of pain. No contortion. Only traces of blood in the nose and the mouth. 																								The dexterity with which, apparently, Shibendu Saha had wiped out six members of his family on Saturday night has rattled even forensic experts. Most believe the killer used a very powerful chemical  the like of which was used to kill Swarupa Guha in the Eighties  and not sedatives, for that would not have ensured death. 																								Most believe the chemical used was mercuric chloride, an ash-white powder that would kill old people and children in minutes. Only blood in their nose or face would tell a tale. Readily available over the counter, this chemical compound would put victims in a depressive mode.																								Since the tissues of both the old and the young remain tender, the chemical spreads fast and does not cause convulsions in seniors. Once in the bloodstream the chemical first affects the brain  putting the body in a depressive mode  and then works on the heart, lungs and the kidney. Death is thus a certainty. 																								Sedatives are the most commonly used poison. But for someone not willing to take chances, the choice would be a chemical that is readily available and would ensure certain death. Considered in this light, perhaps the assailant used mercuric chloride, observed A.K. Gupta, forensic chief of Calcutta Medical College. Others hold that the killer could also have added sedatives with the chemical to eliminate the chances of convulsions and, hence, detection.																								If their maid, Soma Das, is to be believed, a soft drink and not food was poisoned. But police and forensic experts hold that mercuric chloride does not dissolve in water or any other liquid but floats on top. So it would be noticed. However, a senior investigating officer stressed that the killer may have poisoned everybodys food save the maids to create confusion about the killers identity.

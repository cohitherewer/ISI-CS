 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Indian Museum will soon set up a gallery of paintings. 																								Over 300 paintings will be on display at a 5,000-sq-ft area, which the museum recently got from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI). This is one of the initiatives the museum has taken to mark its 190th year.																								The museum previously had a small gallery devoted to paintings on the second floor of the building on Chowringhee. 																								We could not display all our rare and valuable paintings at the old gallery. But the ZSI has recently vacated the ground-floor space that they have occupied for the past 65 years. Construction of the new gallery is already on, said Shyamal Kanti Chakravorty, museum director.																								About 300 rare paintings, belonging to the Pal and Mughal periods, will be displayed in two rooms, one measuring 2,500 sq ft and the other 2,600 sq ft. 																								Oil paintings will be kept in glass cases. It is to be insect and fire-proof, with ample security for the valuable display. Closed-circuit television sets will help the museum monitor visitors.																								A number of Iranian masterpieces are to be part of the new painting gallery, officials said.																								The museums 190th year is being observed in a big way, added Chakravorty. A documentary on the history of the museum is being planned, for which Raja Ghosh is to be roped in. 																								The museum authorities are also borrowing some paintings and other displays from the State Museum of Andhra Pradesh, in Hyderabad, Chakravorty explained.																								We will also organise a seminar called Destination Museum. All the heads of major museums in the country will attend the seminar and deliver lectures on museology, said a senior official at the museum. Nitish Kumar agenda																								Union minister for railways Nitish Kumar is scheduled to be in the city on Monday.

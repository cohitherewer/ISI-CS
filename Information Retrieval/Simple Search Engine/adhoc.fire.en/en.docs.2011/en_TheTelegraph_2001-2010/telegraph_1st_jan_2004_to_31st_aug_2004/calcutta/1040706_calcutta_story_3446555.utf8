 Dolly Roy, June Maliah and Kiran Uttam Ghosh at a recent CRY-sponsored programme. Picture by Aranya Sen CRY (Child Relief amp; You) turns 25 this year and its flavour of the season is the chakri, or spinning-wheel. The silver anniversary calls for celebration, and CRY is going about it in its own unique way. According to Soha Moitra, assistant manager, youth and volunteer action, CRY: We are starting an intense mass awareness campaign on child rights in our 25th anniversary year, which we are using as a launching platform.				 				 																															She emphasises that in spite of many NGOs working in the child relief sector, more than 111 million children in India are still deprived of their basic rights. The key to this problem lies in spreading awareness among the masses so that there is a collective action by individuals to enable people to take responsibility for the deprived Indian child. 				 				 																															Conscientious and caring citizens can do these kids a world of good by signing a CRY free-a-child chakri and receive a batch in return for a nominal amount. The campaign was kicked off in April, and is all set to culminate on Childrens Day in November, when a staggering 1 million signed chakris would be exhibited across Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore along with celebrity endorsements and performances. 				 				 																															The aim is to present a charter of demands to the powers-that-be. The demands include the following  all persons under 18 should be defined as children, an increase in expenditure in child health and education, prohibition of child labour, ensuring that all children pass Class X and the national policy for children should be comprehensive and in line with the constitution and the United Nations Convention of Child Rights. 				 				 																															The chakri was chosen as the motif because it symbolises children and fun, is universally recognised among all ethnic groups in India and is dynamic in nature and therefore indicative of the movement. It is also analogous with the spinning wheel of the Indian freedom struggle. 				 				 																															CRY has already approached institutions like St Xaviers, JU, Presidency, NUJS and other schools and colleges, inviting them to be a part of this movement. Volunteers have already begun the mass contact programme whereby they explain the charter to people and collect their signatures, satisfying the dual purpose of sensitisation and support.				 				 																															So dont be surprised if you see CRY volunteers in popular city hangouts, chakris in hand, approaching you for signatures. A minute of your time could dramatically improve many lives.

	 Surging ahead				 				 																															The 32nd Indian Oil-Servo National Inter-school Rowing Competition was held recently at the Lake Club, Rabindra Sarobar.

But he made the parents promise that they would spend more on their childrens sporting activities. Dutt also promised that his government would try to make it compulsory for all schools in India to include sports in their curriculum.

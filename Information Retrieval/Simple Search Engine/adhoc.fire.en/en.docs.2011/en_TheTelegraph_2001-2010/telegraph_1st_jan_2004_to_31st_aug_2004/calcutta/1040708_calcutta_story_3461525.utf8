 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Amenity boost to life in the alleys
 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Pearabagan, after the start of the CMC project. Picture by Pabitra Das																								It is lunchtime at Pearabagan. The children are bathing, getting ready for their meal, as the women finish cooking. Vegetables are being chopped, dishes washed as dal simmers away on kerosene stoves.																								These simple tasks have become simpler since last March, with water running from taps and tubewells across the cramped colony. The slum of over 1,200 families and 6,600 inhabitants in south Calcutta has become a model of sorts for development at 141 settlements across the city. Running water, latrines and electrification are the main civic amenities that residents have received, under the ADB loan-funded Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) project for slum improvement.																								Apart from 113 latrines spread across the 4,000 sq mt area, with running water round the clock, there are taps and tubewells for the Padmapukur para, which mainly consists of domestic helps and day labourers. The paths have been paved after the underground sewer system was completed. Lights have also been installed in common areas. The improvement-package price tag? Rs 44.26 lakh.																								Residents of Pearabagan still have some complaints. Water supply has been irregular these past few weeks, complain residents. According to CMC officials, some pending infrastructural adjustments are needed to rectify the water pressure. 																								Sumitra Sardar, resident of a tiny hovel for the past three decades or so, admits the situation is much improved now. But, for the past few days, the supply has been faltering and the water is filthy. On such days, we draw water from the tubewell as we used to, she explains. Basanti Mali has another complaint. The drains have been clogged for the past few days they are not cleared regularly, the elderly woman explains.																								It is their nature to complain, because the people are getting the services for free, is what Subrata Mukherjee has to say about the issue.																								A walk through the narrow alleys is evidence enough that while some things are flowing smoothly (on Monday at least water appeared to be in plentiful supply), there are other areas that are desperately crying out for attention. Heaps of garbage  solid waste from households  strew the tiny pathways and block the drains. CMC inspectors tell the people not to throw garbage in such a fashion.																								If ADB has not made provisions for major awareness drives and education projects in this scheme, what are we to do? asks Mukherjee. This, after all, is just one tiny part of the city improvement package that is being funded by the ADBs $250 million loan.																								While there is a small budget for education, action taken till now has been minimal. TERI is one of the NGOs that has been engaged to spread the word on health and hygiene in the area. We have run some general health awareness programmes, but our efforts do not have a lasting effect, admits Ashim Chattopadhay of TERI.																								Two self-help groups have also been set up for micro-finance schemes for local women, with more to follow. But on building knowledge about hygiene, there are few schemes on hand. Maybe if the people of the area are made to pay for the upkeep of the facilities, it will be more effective, Chattopadhay suggests.																								This slum was chosen as the first because it was large and faced the risk of epidemic and infection due to poor sanitation, says Tarit Mukherjee, DG, bustee services and social sector elevation programme.																								For the residents, however, water in the taps is just the beginning of the battle.

Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ We live in a desolate area and do not want to keep a security guard. Is there a Feng Shui remedy to give us a feeling of security?																								Rakesh Kanoria																								A: Define your main entrance with two wall lights and heavy, large potted plants or protective statues placed on either side of the door. Pictures of guards, lions or dogs on the walls will give you a feeling of security even if they are not physically present.																								Q: I am basically a lazy person and do not look into household repairs much. My wife says that according to Feng Shui, everything should be in working condition in the house. How far is this true?																								Sushil Agarwal																								A: Repairs to your house should not be considered as an expenditure, but as an investment. The benefits derived from a neat house with everything in working order far outweighs any expenses incurred.																								Things like leaking taps, creaking doors, broken steps and furniture, peeled paint, clocks, watches and torches with exhausted batteries, fused bulbs and others need to be regularly maintained.																								Leaking taps may symbolise the drainage of wealth and creaking doors should be well oiled to ensure smooth progress of life. Fused bulbs and stopped clocks symbolise hindrances and obstacles. Do away with cracked or broken mirrors, glass panes and chipped crockery. It is better to discard useless items, rather than let them occupy valuable space in your house. Even a picture of a lion or a dog may be enough to ward off thieves, according to the principles of Feng Shui (Reuters) 																								Q: In our house, the kitchen is located in the extended southern side. Ever since we moved in, there have been a lot of arguments and disharmony amongst family members. Nobody wants to eat in the house and most of the time the cooked food goes to waste. Please help.Rupali GhoshA: The southern part of the house is ruled by fire energy. When this area has a projection, the fire energy increases and the effect doubles when the kitchen is located here, because the fire energy of the stove is strong. This is leading to rising tempers. The best remedy is to exhaust the fire energy by balancing it with the earth element. Painting the kitchen in shades of beige, cream or yellow can do this. Display earthen objects like ceramic flowerpots with yellow flowers, yellow crockery, yellow jars, kitchen towels and square trays. Fill a transparent glass bowl with yellow or earthy coloured marbles in the extreme south of the kitchen.																								You cant blame your family for eating out as this can happen when the kitchen is outside the main living area. When you balance the fire energy, things will go back to normal.																								Q: There is a square pillar at the entrance of our house. Children bang against it when they run inside. It is an eyesore, and I believe it is not Feng Shui-friendly. We were told to cover it with mirrors, but it did not sound too appealing.																								Sujata Chatterjee																								A: Square columns should be strictly avoided as the first feature encountered on entering a house. They block chi and work like barriers and obstacles for its occupants. Mirrors are not a practical solution. Cosmic energy bounces off reflective surfaces. The easiest remedy is putting plants near the sharp angles or by hanging crystals to help deflect the negative influence of the pillar. Hidden lights in the plants, focussed towards the pillar, will also help balance the negative energy. A stone sculpture kept with the arrangement will also help distract the eye.

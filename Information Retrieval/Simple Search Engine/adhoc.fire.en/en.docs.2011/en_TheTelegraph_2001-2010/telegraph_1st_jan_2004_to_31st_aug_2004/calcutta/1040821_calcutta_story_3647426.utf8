 																											- Worried doctors warn against strain amp; silence BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								People prefer not to talk about it, but a majority of them, especially men in Calcutta, are being affected by it.																								Hernia has become a cause of worry for doctors, as studies show that at least 25 per cent of males above 40 and 10 per cent of females above 30 are suffering from the ailment. 																								Hernia develops when the abdominal wall becomes weak and intestinal or other abdominal contents permeate through a gap in the wall, causing pain and other discomfort. 																								A defect in the abdominal wall, usually at birth, results in hernia. It also develops with age and because of injuries and surgeries, says gastroenterology surgeon Sanjay De Bakshi.																								Doctors warn that chronic cough, strains during bowel movements or urination, and even persistent twists and muscle strains can cause immense pressure on the abdomen, resulting in the contents jutting out through a gap in the weakened part of the wall. 																								We ask people not to strain themselves. The other common reasons, apart from the congenital ones, are recurrent sneezing and even obesity, said another surgeon. 																								The symptoms for hernia are fever, excessive swelling and pain in the abdomen, urine retention and bleeding. Doctors say the ailment doesnt heal by itself, and if left untreated, can turn fatal, especially because of chances of further complications, like gangrene. Even surgery at times fails to cure it. 																								If patients who undergo surgery have weak muscles, chances of recurrence are high, says surgeon A. Maiti.																								To avoid recurrence, doctors ask patients to quit smoking, reduce weight in case of obesity and avoid lifting heavy objects. They are even advised to stop driving and avoid diet that can cause constipation.																								But the biggest obstacle for treating hernia, according to doctors, is the peoples reluctance to talk about it. To save themselves embarrassment, they either ignore the problem or wear belts, further complicating the disorder. 																								To educate people on the prevention of hernia, city doctors have joined hands with Rotary International District 3290 to organise a series of seminars, starting next week.

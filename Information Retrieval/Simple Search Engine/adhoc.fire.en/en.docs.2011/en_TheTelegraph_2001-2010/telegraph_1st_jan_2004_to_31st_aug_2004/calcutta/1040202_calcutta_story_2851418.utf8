								Post-Independence, either the public works department or the central public works department had enjoyed a monopoly in constructing most government buildings in Calcutta and they have left their stamp of sarkari ugliness on whatever they created. 																								The problem is that both the government behemoths have no accountability and they get away with engineering monumental monstrosities in public space, that besides being ugly, are often not suited to our hot and humid climate.																								Such ugliness is also the outcome of closed-door decisions. Where the international norm is to hold design competitions, here in Bengal, that is practically unheard of. The public has never had its say in public projects. 																								The root cause of this proliferation of beastly buildings is the lack of imaginative and enlightened architects. Our institutions have produced more civil engineers than architects and the former dominate most government agencies and undertakings. However, it is undeniable that architecture cannot come into its own without patronage, and in this state there is hardly any with either the vision or generosity to foot the bill.																								Thus, unlike Mumbai or Ahmedabad, Calcutta today resembles an upwardly mobile shantytown. Cramped, airless boxes of concrete dot the cityscape. 																								Salt Lake was meant to be a showpiece. But today, it has a concentration of ugly structures, although they must have cost a packet. 																								The builders have forgotten their social responsibility of creating public architecture that exudes the gravity of the agencies of the government they represent. Sarkari ugliness has become institutionalised in Salt Lake, too. BHASHA BHAVAN: Ungainly  boxes of dark glass with grids is what many office buildings  along the EM Bypass have settled for, and this is the kind  of chic that the building, soon to house the largest collection  of books in the country, has opted for. The new National  Library shatters the grace of the old building that was  Warren Hastings residence. And the annexe is no better  SCIENCE CITY: In spite  of the considerable expense, the half-egg structures of  reinforced concrete are quite regressive in terms of design  and technique. The overall effect is shabby. The Evolution  Theme Tour, with its nodding and tail-wagging dinos moaning  and groaning in the dark, could be dubbed Death of Science.  The large concrete spiral looks like a biblical illustration  4 CAMAC STREET: The cream-and-black  colour scheme is perfect. All else is wrong. Convex in the  middle, like a beer belly, and with two small outstretched  wings, it is like a toad squatting on Camac Street. In spite  of post-modern pretensions, the railing and lamps are colonial.  The location of the new Writers Buildingson an already-congested  street couldnt have been worse. The motif is suspiciously  like Ganesha BIDYUT BHAVAN: They tried  to give it a hi-tech look but it ended up looking like a  huge grounded spaceship. It was apparently inspired by the  aatchala, the roof that covered Bengal huts, but  this West Bengal State Electricity Board mega-structure  is a garbled copy of an American original. Like the Salt  Lake stadium, it is an eyesore that this satellite township  just cannot wish away.  Pictures by Aranya Sen

 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Metal magic
																								Gallery Kanishkas on-going exhibition of tribal dokra handicrafts by artists from the Bastar region in Chhattisgarh is best described as unconventional. Fittingly called Metalcraft, the intricately designed tribal crafts on display are distinguished by their unique styles and their likeness to the local tribal idiom. Showcasing dokra, terracotta and beaten iron work, the exhibition specially focuses on the creations of the National Award winning artist, Rajendra Baghel, whose innovative creations have lent a new and distinctive dimension to the traditional dokra art form. Combining dokra with beaten iron work, Baghels creations are born of ideas that are traditional, yet bearing the stamp of his originality. From three-inch tortoises to over three-feet high figurines, masks, bugles and images of Ganesha, Shiva and other tribal deities, the exhibition also includes an awe-inspiring range of hand-crafted metallic items, all made by the tribal artist community of Bastar.																								Event: Exhibition of tribal dokra work from Bastar																								When: Till March 31 (except Sunday); 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

 VICTOR BANERJEE																								Of the hundreds of soups you can choose from, isnt it amazing how we gravitate around just a few? Hot and Sour for one, Sweet Corn Chicken a second, and then, invariably, we sit back with nostalgic elan and order a tomato soup. A safe bet. 																								Yet today, you can have tomato soup flavoured with coriander or basil and even cooked in coconut milk. Each one is brilliant and I suggest you try them all after analysing the psychological state you are in. Cooked plain, you have to be in an Eurocentric frame of mind; with basil you ought to have a lover beside you and with coriander you might want him or her on your lap; while cooked in coconut milk, you might as well be alone pondering on the swaying palms on Kovalam Beach, or Calangute or Galle Face.																								Given that we still have the time to sit back and applaud the virtues of a five-day cricket match, and, presuming that fact points to vast unemployment or plenty of free time at someone elses expense, I shall proceed to give you a tomato soup recipe that was taught to a Mugh cook my parents inherited from a retiring Yorkshireman. He was the best cook we ever had. He worked with us for over 30 years until his fourth and fifth wives caught up with his sixth and he mysteriously disappeared.																								Special Tomato Soup with Saffron Cream																								Ingredients (serves 6): 3 lb ripe tomatoes; 1 tbsp honey; 3 tbsp/1  oz unsalted butter; 1 pint chicken stock; 1 large onion, peeled and chopped; freshly ground black pepper to taste; 2 cloves of garlic, smashed, peeled; 1/2 tsp or a fat pinch of saffron strands chopped; 2 tbsp hot milk; 1 inch piece fresh ginger peeled and finely chopped; 10 fl oz heavy cream;  tsp ground cardamom (optional); 2 green chillies, seeded and chopped; 3 slices stale white bread, crusts removed; 1 tsp salt, butter, oil or bacon fat; 1/2 tsp ground cumin; sprigs of mint																								Method: Peel the tomatoes by immersing them briefly in boiling water. Remove the skins and discard. Now chop them finely and set aside. Heat the butter in a large saucepan and saut the onion till it becomes limp, then add the garlic and ginger and cook over low heat for five minutes, stirring frequently. Add the tomatoes and chillies and season with the salt, cumin and honey. Let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes, stirring from time to time.																								Place a sieve over a bowl and pour the contents of the pan into it, stroking the mixture through the mesh with the back of a wooden spoon. Rinse the saucepan and return it to the heat. Pour in the sieved tomato and add the chicken stock. Cook gently until the soup is the texture of cream. Season with pepper and set aside. Soak the saffron strands in the hot milk. Place the cream in a bowl and blend in the saffron liquid. Dice the slices of bread after removing the edges. Heat the butter, oil or bacon fat in a pan and fry the croutons until golden and crisp. Drain them on paper towels and pile into a bowl and serve separately. Divide the soup into six bowls and swirl in the saffron cream. Sprinkle lightly with cardamom (if you wish) and plonk a sprig of mint at the top.																								For the fashionably proletariat, mint (pudina) cream is a pleasant alternative to saffron. Stir two tablespoons of pureed mint leaves into the cream, together with a pinch of salt, and swirl the soup with paled Mohun Bagan green instead of the jaundiced East Bengal gold. 																								Diehard cricket fans will remember Englands Captain Jack Hobbs remark when Hazare in the 40s saved the day for India by scoring about a dozen runs after hours of batting. The scoreboard is an ass, he said, referring to a glorious stand that didnt tot up runs. Well, if you can summon up the diligence and patience of a Hazare while spectators get bored, you can painstakingly make and serve them a tomato soup they will love you for, forever.

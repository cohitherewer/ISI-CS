 A STAFF REPORTER																								Is the disappearance of the three Higher Secondary (HS) answer-scripts, only to be found two days later, the handiwork of the students themselves or the result of negligence by certain officials?																								 The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Thursday decided to refer the matter to its malpractice and misconduct committee to seek an answer. The urgency lies in the fact that 10 people died in a chain of events in Midnapore after the invigilators at an HS examination venue wrongly accused an examinee of walking off with his answer-script.																								Our primary duty is to ascertain how the scripts were smuggled out of the examination hall at Tiljala High School. The malpractices and misconduct committee will probe this and the next course of action will be taken on the basis of its recommendations, said council secretary Dibyendu Chakraborty.																								Three mathematics answer-scripts written by St Lawrence School students went missing under mysterious circumstances on Monday from an HS exam centre at Tiljala High School. They were recovered from a vat off the EM Bypass in the Purva Jadavpur police station area.																								However, during a conversation with Metro at Tiljala High School, where they appeared for Thursdays examinations, the three students said they were not to be faulted. 																								There is no way the invigilators can hold us responsible. We had handed over the scripts to them before we left the hall, said the trio. While two of them wrote the biological sciences paper, the third appeared for the business economics and business mathematics paper.																								The boys said two of them were present at the venue when the invigilators detected that the three scripts were missing on Monday. The third candidate had left for home. I was going back with my father. In fact, I was half-way there when the invigilators called my father on his cellphone and we immediately returned to the centre, he said.																								However, council secretary Chakraborty, admitting that it was the responsibility of the invigilators to ensure proper protection of each and every script in their custody, said the inquiry committee will interrogate the students as well as the officials.

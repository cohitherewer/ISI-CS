 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Lock-up tour cut short by guides
 PRONAB MONDAL																								A team of legislators, representing the standing committee for review of the condition of lock-ups, visited the Lalbazar police headquarters on Monday afternoon. It toured the central lock-up and inspected the cells for about half-an-hour, escorted by the police top brass, but left unaware of what it had missed. 																								The three-storeyed lock-up building houses 11 cells. 																								The police bosses, including commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty, made sure the team did not get to see the two well-appointed cells reserved for first-class political prisoners. These have been taken over by the detective department and are being used as a malkhana (storeroom). The police escorted the team to the first and second floor of the lock-up building and convinced the members that there was nothing more to be seen. So, the team came down without examining the third floor, where the two cells are located.																								Subrata Narayan Sarkar, special additional commissioner of police (organisation), who was among the guides, said: Yes, the two cells are being used for storing papers and recovered goods. But the team has seen all the other cells.																								The standing committee, comprising five legislators headed by chairman Gyan Singh Sohanpal, reached the police headquarters around 2 pm. Two of the 11 cells are reserved for female accused. Each cell can accommodate 30 persons. The team entered the cells and examined each thoroughly. They checked the ventilation system and the condition of the toilets, said an official. 																								The members talked to some of the accused inside the cells. The legislators asked them about the condition inside the cells during summer and winter. They wanted to know from the accused whether their basic requirements are being provided or not, said the official, adding: The team members wanted to know what food the inmates get.																								Senior officers never let the legislators out of sight. The city police had taken the trouble of sprucing up the building and the public works department did up the entire lobby, working round-the-clock on Saturday and Sunday.

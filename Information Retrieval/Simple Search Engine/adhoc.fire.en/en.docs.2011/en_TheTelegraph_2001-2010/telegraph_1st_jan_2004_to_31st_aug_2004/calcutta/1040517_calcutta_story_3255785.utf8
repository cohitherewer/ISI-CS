The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Demolish cry over Bypass billboards
 SANJAY MANDAL				 	 One of the billboards along the EM Bypass that adds to the visual pollution. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Come June and a drive down the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass could be far easier on the eye. 																								The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is planning to clear both sides of the street by pulling down all illegal billboards.																								We are planning a major drive against illegal billboards on either side of the Bypass from May-end, Alapan Bandopadhyay, chief executive officer of CMDA, told Metro on Sunday. This is a drive to end visual pollution on the Bypass, he asserted.																								Official estimates suggest there are around 80 illegal billboards on the 17-km stretch from Ultadanga to Garia. The decision to take up the drive was taken at a meeting just before the Lok Sabha elections, sources said. 																								But in its battle against illegal billboards, CMDA will have to lock horns with a number of government and semi-government bodies, including the Salt Lake municipality and the sports and youth services department.																								There are many billboards of the Bidhannagar Municipality, the irrigation department, Yuba Bharati Krirangan and other such organisations in the area. These must be removed, said a senior CMDA official.																								There are billboards that have been given a licence by these local bodies. But the right of providing a licence lies with us, he added.																								With requests yielding no results, these organisations have now been served an ultimatum.																								In a recent letter to one of the government departments, CMDA officials wrote: You were requested to remove the hoardings abutting out of the boundary wall of Yuba Bharati Krirangan and overhanging the footpaths on EM Bypass within February 15, 2004 (As no action has been taken so far) You are requested kindly to take action within May 21.																								Similar letters would be sent to Bidhannagar Municipality and other bodies, sources said.																								The Salt Lake civic authorities, however, hinted that the billboards wouldnt budge.																								Who will earmark the boundary between the municipalitys land and CMDAs land on the Bypass? demanded Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. This is a matter of policy and there is a need for detailed discussion, he added.																								The CMDA employees union has hailed the clean-up drive. We had submitted a proposal to the authorities requesting them to either remove the illegal billboards or claim licence fees from the organisations to boost revenue, said P.B. Nag, general secretary of the CMDA Staff Union.																								According to sources, the CMDA is planning similar drives against visual pollution on the Kona Expressway, the Barrackpore Expressway and the Kalyani Expressway.

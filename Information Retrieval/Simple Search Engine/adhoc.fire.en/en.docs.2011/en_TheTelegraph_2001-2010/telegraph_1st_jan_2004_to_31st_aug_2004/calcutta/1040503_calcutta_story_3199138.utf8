 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Crackers burst, kids injured
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two children  one five years old and the other six  and four adults suffered burns during a display of fireworks at Lake Towns Green Park on Sunday night. The six were rushed to a local nursing home. 																								Former deputy inspector-general of state police (headquarters) Narayan Ghosh, who now heads a cell to combat financial crimes under the state government, inaugurated the annual function of Green Park Recreation Club, where the incident took place later. 																								The function started around 6 pm. Local residents and their children started lighting crackers. Suddenly, at around 7 pm, some crackers exploded and at least six persons were injured, including the two children, said officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station Sitaram Sinha. 																								Police suspect the crackers were of inferior quality and are investigating where they had been bought from. 																								The sudden blast sparked chaos on the spot, close to Jessore Road. People started running helter-skelter, though the injured had nowhere to flee. Some others were released after first-aid. 																								The injured are all local residents who had come to attend the function. Police feel that if the venue had been bigger, the number of injuries could have been less. They did not get the time or opportunity to move away when the crackers started exploding all at once. Also, since the place was packed, no one got a chance to flee, the officer-in-charge observed.

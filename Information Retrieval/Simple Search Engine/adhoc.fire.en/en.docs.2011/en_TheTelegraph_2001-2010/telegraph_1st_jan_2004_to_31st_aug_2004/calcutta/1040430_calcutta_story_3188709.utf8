The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 30, 2004 Life - Passing Through				 New role for Rahul
Rahul Khanna. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								When the future of a bunch of beauties rests in the hands of a bonafide bachelor, the poor chap is bound to feel nervous. The man in question is actor Rahul Khanna and the occasion, the Tilottama beauty pageant. I have hosted two Miss India contests but never judged such a competition. I must admit there were butterflies in my stomach as I was aware of the huge responsibility I was entrusted with, confided Rahul in the comfort of his suite at ITC Sonar Bangla the morning after. 																								The contest over, he had time to take in the pleasing ambience of his surroundings. Mishti doi and warm, friendly people are a few of the things Rahul likes about Calcutta, but what hes really charmed by is the new look of the city.																								I came here about eight or nine years back and my memories of the place were overcrowded streets and a lot of rickshaws. But I was in for a pleasant surprise this time around. The roads are broader, there are more flyovers and somehow there seem to be less people in general, said Rahul, a few hours before he left on Thursday afternoon.																								Europe is yet another destination Rahul has been frequenting of late, thanks to Vikram Bhatts Elaan, which he is busy shooting for these days. The multi-starrer sees the actor indulging in some high-voltage action. The story revolves around Rahul, playing a young businessman, whose father is killed by a mafia don (Mithun) who lives in Europe. Rahul enlists the help of an ex-cop (Arjun Rampal), an ex-convict (John Abraham) and his girlfriend (Lara Dutta) and a journalist (Amisha Patel, the leading lady) to bring the villains to book. 																								The film is an out and out action adventure and I had great fun doing it, said Rahul of his first big break in commercial cinema. One can expect sizzling car chases in the Alps, he revealed. 																								Cine-goers, who are more used to seeing Rahul in sensitive roles like the masseuse in Deepa Mehtas 1947 Earth, may be surprised to see this sudden indulgence in car chasing. Rahul, however, has no time for such generalisations. Movie action is like smoke in the mirror. It may look great on screen but in real life its not so fancy. Its just like playing with a toy gun, he said.																								Its been quite a transition for the MTV VJ, from stints in alternative cinema spanning Bollywood and Hollywood, to a commercial flick. Even though he studied acting at Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in New York, he plunged into VJing for MTV. I did that for four years and had quite a blast, but at the end of it, I was ready to move on, reminisced Rahul. Unlike elder brother Akshaye, Rahuls career graph has been rather erratic. Im quite choosy about my roles, he explained. He found satisfaction in doing an odd play in New York, Deepa Mehtas Hollywood Bollywood and a small role in a Universal Pictures project in New York called The Emperors Club.																								 Rahul is determined to hold on to this versatility. I would love to do a murder mystery that is presented in a slick, stylish way. I would like to play a negative role, maybe that of an unassuming villain, he laughed.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

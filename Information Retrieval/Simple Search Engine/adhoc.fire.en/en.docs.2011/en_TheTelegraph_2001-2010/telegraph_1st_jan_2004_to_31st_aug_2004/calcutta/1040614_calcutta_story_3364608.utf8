The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Oh, for better buses, better bus services amp; better bus drivers
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Except for the minibuses, wrote Dominique Lapierre, the city does look like a City of joy. One wonders what he would have said if he had taken a ride in one of the private buses here. One of the visitors we know did not mince his words. The hard and narrow wooden seats did not treat his back too kindly and the bruised traveller darkly declared that he felt like lodging a complaint in the consumer court.																								We do also know of the reaction of an American researcher, William Kanner, who described the buses here as massive, intimidating, crowded and dangerous and noted in passing that they rarely stopped. 																								He thought it odd that passengers were expected to run alongside moving buses, grab a bar and pull themselves in. A bus in Calcutta, he wrote, was the king of the road and nobody dared come in the way.																								But unlike Kanner, not many visitors dare to board buses, most of which appear to be driven by maniacs who believe there is no tomorrow, and which look and behave as if they have been driven out of garages to settle scores with everyone in sight.																								There are several hilarious accounts of the buses in Calcutta. Many of them are indulgent while referring to the running commentary that the attendant or the assistant delivers in the buses. They do not always succeed in amusing the passengers, though, especially when they instruct the drivers to shake and go (hilake chalo). The coded instruction is to apply the brakes suddenly so that passengers, standing like sardines, fall on one another and, in the process, create enough space for the entry of other passengers.																								No research has been undertaken by any department of psychology into the minds of bus drivers, but everybody agrees that when a man becomes a bus driver in Calcutta, he undergoes a transformation.																								It is possible that both in New Delhi and Calcutta, the bus drivers watch too many Hindi  or even Hollywood  films and are influenced by them, because nothing can really explain the speed they pick up while driving through crowded and relatively-narrow roads  SN Banerjee Road, for example.																								Thats not all. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, we assume, does not read the letters to the editor column in newspapers. Nor does his department appear to have a system of bringing relevant letters to the notice of the minister.																								If such a system was in place, either the minister or the department would surely have reacted to a grievance that has been voiced repeatedly during the past year or so. All of them made similar pleas, that the minister ensure buses do not stop in the middle of the road. It is both unlawful and unsafe, the letters point out, but there is no reason to believe that they have been taken seriously.																								The minister will, of course, point out that it is up to the police to enforce traffic rules and his department has no role to play. The problem, however, is hardly so simple.																								Permits issued to the buses, the timings that they are called upon to follow, the method of issuing and withdrawing driving licences are all inter-linked and both police and the transport department must jointly hold the responsibility for the insanity one witnesses in the city every day.																								God is obviously a communist, say some, because nothing other than divine intervention could have prevented the occurrence of more accidents in the city. The presence of traffic policemen or sergeants rarely deter the Mobile Monsters, as the city buses are described, and often two or three of them together block the entire width of the road, forcing passengers to board them and get down in the middle.																								At many intersections, they come to a halt right in the middle of a crossing, stopping vehicular movement on all sides. Speeding, stopping abruptly without a signal, changing lanes, overtaking from the wrong side  many bus drivers in the city are guilty of all this and more. But how many of them have had their licence cancelled? Not many, we are afraid.																								As the city changes for the better and draws in outsiders in droves, courteous and safe driving by bus drivers will be a key element to refurbish the citys image. Calcutta certainly deserves better buses, a better bus service and, of course, better bus drivers.

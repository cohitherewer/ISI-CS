 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 The way of the woman
																								Folklore is one of the most interesting genres by way of its evolution. It has indeed travelled a long way from the days when folklore was handed down to generations as a story that was to be essentially narrated. Then came the day when someone decided to put it in print so it would survive the onslaught of time. Sayaks Badhutantra is a comedy based on a Kannada folk tale about a woman who is at loggerheads with a goddess. She believes that contrary to Her duties, the goddess only but stares at her plight and makes a rather shameless show of her amazement. Thus starts the conflict between the mortal and the Immortal which is resolved in the end with the triumph of the woman over the gesticulating goddess. An essentially comic play, Badhutantra also carries with it an underlying earthly wisdom that has been artfully combined with what Sayak calls an airy fairy tale.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Badhutantra, produced by Sayak																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

		 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Its a tout raj out there
 The menace of touts prevails at the public vehicles department. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryMd. Amiruzzaman: Touts operate around the office and they often force visitors to avail of their services. Moreover, it seems the touts can get the job done faster than the officials.																																																													There is a persistent problem with touts at every transport office. We had introduced a number of strict checks and measures in the offices and have succeeded in reducing the tout menace. Complaints related to a tout-official nexus are quickly looked into and steps taken against culprits. Generally, people who come here to deposit renewal fees and for fresh applications and dues inquiry fall victim to the touts. We are going to introduce new systems to make the procedures easier for the people. To root out the menace, we are introducing separate counters for people with single papers and those with multiple papers. Since touts generally handle several papers simultaneously to maximise their profit, they will be using the counter meant for multiple papers only. Presently, several associations of public vehicles are already paying the taxes in a group system, which is easy to process.

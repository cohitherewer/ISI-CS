The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 If theatre be the food of life...
																								To celebrate the completion of 56 years of Bohurupee, one of Indias leading theatre groups, its members hold a festival of four of its well-known plays (Phullaketur Pala, Rajdarshan, Chhanch Bhanga Murti and Mister Kakatua) over the weekend. To be staged this evening at 6.30, Rajdarshan is a brilliant satire that chronicles the adventures and misadventures of Lambodar Bhatta, a wily old Brahmin, in search of wealth and fortune. It is made up of skillfully constructed, witty episodes, and makes an effort to perceive contemporary reality through a veil of comedy and fantasy. Charged with human passions and a series of tragi-comic events, both ominous and funny, the play has the perfect ingredients to entertain and enthrall the audience. Rajdarshan also makes us aware of our need to search for our roots.

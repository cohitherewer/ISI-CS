 															- Woman grapples with armed goon to rescue neighbour A STAFF REPORTER																								A young womans exemplary act of courage saved the life of a trader on Tuesday morning. Rakhi Bhowmick leapt on an armed criminal in a brave bid to rescue her neighbour. The 34-year-old resident of Shibtola, Arjunpur, is now admitted at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital with splinter injuries. 																								The attacked man, 38-year-old trader Utpal Das, is also in hospital, in a critical condition.																								Pintu Naskar, also known as Poka, a local criminal allegedly with CPM links, went to meet Das, a trader of building materials, at his Arjunpur home in Baguiati at around 11 am on Tuesday, accompanied by a teenaged boy. The three left Das residence together, and soon, a quarrel broke out between Naskar and Das. 																								Naskar, in his 30s, known for a volatile temper and his trigger-happy ways, pulled out a country-made, single-shot pistol and pumped a bullet into Das stomach. The incident occurred less than half a kilometre away from the Baguiati police outpost, in the Rajarhat police station area.																								Rakhi, Das neighbour, was passing by when she saw the attack. But, rather than panic and run for cover, she decided to step in. Just as Naskar was about to shoot Das again, having reloaded his pistol, she pounced on the burly criminal. A scuffle ensued. Naskar wrestled with Rakhi and managed to break free. In the process, he dropped his pistol and mobile phone.																								Both the criminals started running, but even then, Rakhi wouldnt give up. Naskars henchman then hurled a bomb at her. Though the bomb missed its target, Rakhi and a bystander  a five-year-old boy  were injured in the explosion.																								Das, Rakhi and the unidentified boy were rushed to RG Kar Hospital. Doctors said Das was in critical condition, with the bullet lodged in his abdominal cavity. He had lost a lot of blood. Rakhi sustained serious splinter injuries, though the bomb had exploded some way off. She was also suffering from trauma. The boy got away with minor burns, though he had been, according to police, in a great deal of pain on reaching the hospital.																								Police raids led to a few local petty criminals being rounded up, who provided leads on Naskars possible whereabouts. Around 1 pm, police nabbed Naskar and his young accomplice from their hideout in the Doltola area, near Madhyamgram. Naskar is now in police custody, but his henchman managed to give cops the slip.

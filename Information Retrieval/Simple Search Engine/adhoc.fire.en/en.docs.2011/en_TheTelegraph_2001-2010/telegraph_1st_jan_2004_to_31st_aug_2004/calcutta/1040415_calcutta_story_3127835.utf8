 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Missing HS scripts found off Bypass vat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The answer-scripts have been found, but the plot has thickened.																								The mystery of the three mathematics answer-scripts, that had gone missing on Monday from the Higher Secondary (HS) examination centre at Tiljala High School, was partially resolved on Wednesday afternoon.																								The three scripts of St Lawrence School students were recovered from near a vat off the EM Bypass, in the Purva Jadavpur police station area.																								An officer of Tiljala police station said a resident of the area spotted a newspaper parcel lying next to the garbage vat.																								He opened the bundle, found the answer-scripts and immediately alerted the local police station. Officers of Purva Jadavpur then passed it on to us, as the official complaint had been lodged here after the answer-scripts disappeared, he added.																								We have informed the authorities of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education and are awaiting their instructions, said Salil Bhattacharya, inspector in charge of Tiljala police station.																								Council secretary Dibyendu Chakraborty said that as Wednesday was a holiday, the council had not received the answer-scripts. Once we get the scripts, we will decide on our course of action, he said.																								Chakraborty, however, made it clear that the answer-scripts were no longer valid, as they had disappeared and were later found abandoned.																								Once scripts are taken out before being corrected and marked, they become invalid, according to existing rules, explained a council official.																								Sources said the high-power committee of the council had initiated an inquiry into the missing answer-scripts. But now that the scripts have been found, we have to review and revise our plan of action, an official of the panel said.																								From the unspoilt condition of the scripts, found lying wrapped neatly in a newspaper, police sources suspected a design to their disappearance and the subsequent reappearance.																								According to Prabir Shankar Sengupta, Tiljala High School headmaster, the three students had been the first to submit their papers after the mathematics paper II on Monday.																								The three answer-scripts were lying on the invigilators table while the rest of the scripts were being collected. When the invigilator returned to the table with the other scripts, he found the first three missing, said Sengupta.

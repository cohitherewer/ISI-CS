 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Pay channel boycott call over rate hike
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The apex body of consumer forums in the state has called upon cable TV viewers in and around Calcutta to boycott all pay channels to protest the recent rate hikes, urging the state government to bring the trade under the organised sector through a regulatory authority.																								Federation of Consumer Associations of West Bengal president Mala Banerjee said on Tuesday: We are appealing to all cable homes to stop paying their local operators for the pay channels and give their decision to boycott the products in writing as documentary evidence. If the service providers continue to beam the pay channels after that, it is their problem.																								Banerjee said a boycott was the only tool left for consumer bodies if an ordinance is introduced to stop CAS, since it cuts off all our legal avenues, including a public interest litigation we were planning. The federation, which opposed any rate hike prior to CAS rollout, asked viewers deprived of STAR channels to discontinue payment for the bouquet till a full-fledged boycott was in place.

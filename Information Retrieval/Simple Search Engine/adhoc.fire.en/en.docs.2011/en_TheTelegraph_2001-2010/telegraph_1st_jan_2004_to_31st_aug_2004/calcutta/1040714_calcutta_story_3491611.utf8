 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Delhi nod for axed feasibility study 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Centre has cleared a Rs 2- crore feasibility study on public-private partnership in the water supply and solid waste management sectors, to be funded by the French government. 																								The pilot project, to be taken up in Bidhannagar Municipality, was grounded by the former NDA government at the Centre, saying monetary assistance could not be sought from France. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had earlier written to then Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha, asking that the scheme be treated as a special case and requesting for an early clearance for the study. 																								Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has communicated the clearance in a recent letter to urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. Under the study, researchers will also examine the possibility of setting up water meters in households to monitor consumption.																								The Union finance minister also okayed a Rs 125-crore soft loan agreement on the Italy-aided project for water supply and solid waste management in 14 municipalities after talks with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Delhi on Monday. Eight of the beneficiary civic bodies belong to north Bengal; the other six are in south Bengal. 																								Early in June, minister Bhattacharya had dashed off a reminder to Union minister for urban development Ghulam Nabi Azad, seeking a nod for the execution of the loan agreement in the Italy-aided project.																								The chief minister will meet the chairmen of 40 municipalities next month to review their performance in the Rs 700-crore Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor scheme, sponsored by Britains department for international development.

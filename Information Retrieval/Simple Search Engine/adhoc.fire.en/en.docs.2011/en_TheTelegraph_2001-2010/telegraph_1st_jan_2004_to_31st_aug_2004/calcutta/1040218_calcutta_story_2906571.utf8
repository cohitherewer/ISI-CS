The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Court order on cheaper device plea
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to hear all views relating to the implementation of Bharat Stage II norms to control auto emission.																								Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya directed the principal secretary of the state transport department to hear, within 10 days, suggestions of the Jatri Paribahan Parisheba Samity, a bus-owners lobby, on the use of affordable devices to check bus engine emissions. 																								Justice Bhattacharya also said in his order that Samity members would be given the chance to explain the utility of catalytic converters to curb emissions.																								The court order followed a petition filed by the Samity, alleging that the authorities were not allowing them to instal the device in their buses. The technology was less expensive than the one prescribed by the government, but conformed to Bharat Stage II norms, it argued. 																								This technology will only cost Rs 15,000. But the state government is in favour of a system that will cost Rs 3 lakh for each bus, the lawyer said.																								The state government has not commented on the introduction of the device, said Samity members. But, as per a high court directive, all vehicles in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area are to be re-engineered to comply with Bharat Stage II norms by April 2004. The Samity added that repeated appeals to the transport authorities have yielded no response.

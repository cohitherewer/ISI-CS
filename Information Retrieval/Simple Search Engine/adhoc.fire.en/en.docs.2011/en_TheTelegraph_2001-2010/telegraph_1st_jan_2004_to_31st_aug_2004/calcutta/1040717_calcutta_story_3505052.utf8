 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Mayor scoffs at govt seal on felling ban
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Round I: The pollution control board (PCB) imposes a blanket tree-felling ban on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).																								Round II: The mayor says ban or no ban, trees will be felled in the name of development.																								Round III: The environment minister backs the PCB play, makes the ban official, rolls out a replantation roster.																								Round IV: The mayor refuses to blink, declares that whatever tree needs to be cut will be cut, and, yes, they will be replanted.																								The foliage fight on the city streets took another turn during state forest week, with minister Manab Mukherjee stressing on Friday that the tree-felling ban slapped on the CMC for failing to comply with conditions laid down by the PCB would be in place, at least till July 20. 																								That is when a competent representative from the CMC must attend the PCB hearing with all tree-felling data.																								Talking of figures, the minister also rattled off replantation plans drawn up by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC). They have cut 410 trees in the past two years (for flyover construction and widening of roads). They have planted 440 in different corridors of the city (AJC Bose Road, Ballygunge Circular Road, APC Road and Park Circus maidan). They will plant 1,610 saplings before the end of monsoon, said the minister.																								The CMC, on the other hand, has not cared to keep the PCB posted about its replantation and transplantation programmes. The civic body had obtained permission to cut down 125 trees and transplant 334. 																								But the CMC has given no information about the replantation, and according to our estimates, no more than 34 trees have been transplanted, complained the minister.																								By presenting the HRBC vs CMC score-sheets, the minister sought to nullify the mayors allegation that the PCB ban on the civic body was politically motivated. We have only acted as per law and the ban stays till July 20, stressed Manab Mukherjee.																								If the civic body violates the ban, warned PCB sources, the Environment Protection Act of 1986 could come into play.																								The mayor was in no mood to toe the tree-fell line drawn by the ministry. Let them move court if they want to We will cut and replant trees and explain things to the court, if need be, Subrata Mukherjee thundered on Friday.																								Sources in the environment ministry revealed that the CMC  despite the mayors belligerence  has submitted a report to the board on Thursday and also dashed off a cheque for Rs 12,78,700 to the state forest department towards planting of new trees, immediately after the ban.																								nSee picture on Page 19

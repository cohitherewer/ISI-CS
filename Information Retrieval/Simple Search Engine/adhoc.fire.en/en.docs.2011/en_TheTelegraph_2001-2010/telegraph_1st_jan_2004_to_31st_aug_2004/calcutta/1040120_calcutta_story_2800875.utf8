The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Friends won, ties renewed
				 Jubiliation after  touching base at Howrah station. Picture by Aranya Sen  The train pulled up, doors opened,  the youngsters poured out and mayhem reigned. Long live  India and long live Pakistan were shouted in the same  breath. Then, they sang a Pakistani song they had learnt  in the three days spent at the Schools Educational Olympiad  at Karachi High School. While one student was taught how  to use the e-mail by a Pakistani friend, another was touched  by the Hindi words of brotherhood from an illiterate taxi-driver.  Heres what some TTIS team members had to say about mission  Pakistan. The friendliness and warmth of  the common people bowled me over. It was overwhelming. A  sweet-seller talked to me about Haldirams, and a lady in  a McDonalds took a photograph of herself with us when she  heard who we were and why we had gone to Karachi. The shopkeepers  literally gave things away to the kids at throwaway prices.  I had gone to Pakistan to ensure that no parent should feel  the pain of losing a son to war, the way my husband and  I have. We cant often speak openly, but the grief is always  in our hearts. I was moved by the understanding, sympathy  and affection from people when I talked about my son (Anirban),  even retired army officers. I learnt a lot from them, and  I would love to do more such exercises in future.  Shukla Bandhopadhay, 
 Teacher, St Teresas We had all thought the people  would be conservative, but they werent. In fact, at one  point, when we were going up on stage, a Pakistani girl,  a student, wolf whistled. When I came back, I told her to  do it for the camera, because no one would believe me if  I told them in India. I had taken a lot of questions from  my students for the children there, and I have brought back  about 40 replies, taped on my handicam. And theyre all  very interesting points of view. The rest, the kids promised  to write in reply directly to my students. We invited all  the schools there for a Friendship Fest in October, as a  reciprocal gesture. Michael DCruize,
 Headmaster, National Gems They thrive on everything Indian,  from democracy to Bollywood, sandesh, rasogolla  and laddu to clothes and jewellery. Our favourite  pastime was playing antakshari, and they sang only  Hindi film songs. And Karachi is so like any other Indian  city, you wont know its in Pakistan till someone tells  you. And theyre so friendly. Ive already received four  phone calls from students in Karachi, and one from Lahore,  just to say hi. The scroll of names of potential pen friends  I had taken with me from my school, we presented to a Lahore  school. Also, I have brought back 40 names and addresses  from Class XI students. Ankita Rathi, 
 Student, Mahadevi Birla Girls After our long journey, when we  finally reached Karachi late in the evening on January 15,  we were exhausted. But the reception we received made us  forget about our tiredness. Wherever we went, people hugged  us, and all the shopkeepers gave us huge discounts and reduced  prices by more than half when they found out we were from  India. One shopkeeper was almost in tears while talking  to me. He said his sasural (in-laws) is in India  and he loves coming here when he can. In fact, students  from a Lahore school cancelled their flights just to stay  with us for two extra days. Satwik Ghosh, 
 Student, Apeejay School My school principal was born in  Lahore, and she hadnt been back since she left as a child.  So, before I left, she gave me a picture of herself to show  there. When I told them her story, they were very emotional.  I presented her photograph to the principal of Karachi High  School. She then displayed it for all to see.  Swagoto Mallick,

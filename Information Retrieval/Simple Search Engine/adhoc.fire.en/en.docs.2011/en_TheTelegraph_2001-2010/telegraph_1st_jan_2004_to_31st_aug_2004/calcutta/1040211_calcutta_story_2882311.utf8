Picture by Pabitra Das																								The 1826 sundial at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) has been witness to several generations of golfers teeing off  from the Ashok Maliks and Raj Kumar Pitambars to the Arjun Atwals and Jyoti Randhawas.																								But in its 175th year, even as the oldest golfing address outside the British Isles plays host to the second oldest running golf meet in the world after the British Open, a blueprint to reinvent Royal is being readied in the boardrooms of the south Calcutta club.																								Ever since the heritage institution reopened in October, following an unprecedented five-month closure, the buzz at 18 Golf Club Road is that golf alone will not drive the grand Royal resurgence. Woo the wives, call in the kids is a common cry off the hallowed greens.																								The idea is to make the Royal one of the most happening hangouts in town and introduce elements that would make the place rock, observes Brandon DSouza, president, Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), which drives the Indian Tour. DSouza, coordinating the 175th anniversary celebration plans of the club, adds: Yes, people need to be reminded this is the Mecca of Asian golf, this is where it all began. But to carry the story forward, we need to broad-base the club profile and bring in youngsters and family.																								Club captain Ashit Luthra agrees that reinvention is the road ahead: To bring in the sponsors, we must have more social and entertainment-oriented events.																								So, the 175th birthday bash promises to be a non-stop party, with a gala members week leading up to the three-day extravaganza (November 27-29). A string of sub-events, like pancake breakfasts and cheese-and-wine evenings, will make the club swing off the fairways, too.																								We are also planning an Oh Calcutta evening, a throwback to Park Street of the Sixties and Seventies, with the likes of Louis Banks and Pam Craine, declares Luthra. Efforts are on to rope in Leander Paes and Usha Uthup as brand ambassadors of the club.																								But for now, the 7,200-yard, par-72, 18-hole championship course is busy with the 103rd edition of the Eveready All-India Amateur Golf Championship. Among the clutch of international golfers is a Pakistani team, competing in Calcutta after more than 15 years, say club officials.																								The greens are in great shape, smiles Vaqas Ahmed from Rawalpindi, who, along with colleague Shahid Javed Khan, has been overwhelmed by the hospitality, but bugged a bit by non-stop cricket queries.

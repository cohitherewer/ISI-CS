The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 01, 2004  Brave amp; bright, a citys pride
 The hero On the last night of 2002, Bapi  Sen was mortally wounded by a group of drunken constables  while trying to save an unidentified woman from their clutches.  After six days in coma, the 35-year-old sergeant died, leaving  behind a grieving widow, two sons (the elder, eight-year-old  Shomsubhra is seen performing his fathers batsarik)  and a city shocked. A brave police officer (he) laid down  his life in the line of duty to save a citizen... We appeal  to the unknown lady to come forward to help us (in) establishing  the case, was the plea from the police boss. It remains  unheeded. A class apart Iti Baidya, who lost her Ichhapur  home in the 2000 flood but still managed a place in the  Top 10 of Madhyamik 2001, re-emerged as a shining example  of excellence against all odds. The vegetable-sellers  daughter ranked high enough in the Joint Entrance Examination  to book a berth in Calcutta  Medical College and Hospital.  I have always dreamt of becoming a doctor and serving  the poor, said Iti. But with a monthly income of about  Rs 1,000, the family could not possibly fund her dreams.  Then, the government stepped in to waive her tuition fees. Mastermoshai On his haunches, but head held  high, he laboriously hobbled three kilometres, through rain,  mud and shine, to the broken doors of a school little better  than a shed in Barasat. Now, Chandanpur Prathamik Vidyalaya,  the dream Manoj Ghosh has built and nurtured over 31 years,  is home to 300 students. The mud track was transformed into  a paved road so the man from Jessore, who lost the use of  his legs at age 12 to meningitis, could ride his hand cycle  to work. And Ghori was never late for school.  The retired headmaster was presented the Lifetime Achievement  Award at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence. Street legal Traffic-stopper rallies are a  reality weve lived with. This autumn, one man all  but achieved mission impossible a restriction on  rally raj. Justice Amitava Lala of Calcutta High Court took  the traffic police to task and told the administration:  stop that! For a few days in October, Calcutta actually  witnessed considerate rallies sticking to one  side of the streets. Then, a rally row erupted, with the  49-year-old judge at the epicentre. But the commuter was  all for Lala. Goodfella When he stumbled upon a bag containing  Rs 1,26,550 a few days after the Pujas, Ajit Guha picked  it up and ran from Rabindra Sarani straight to the  door of the police commissioner at Lalbazar. The home guard,  who was earning Rs 3,100 a month then from his temporary  job, breathed easy only after handing over all that cash.  The 45-year-old man, whose wife suffers from cancer and  whose college-going daughter has had two heart surgeries,  said: I cannot fulfil the material needs of my children,  but I always tell them to be honest human beings.  They could not find a better role model. Green man Whenever you see green, think  of Subhash Dutta. The 52-year-old has emerged as a lone  crusader for all things environmental. With the PIL as his  prime weapon, the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity honcho  achieved one breakthrough after another this year  from the clean-up of the grounds around Victoria Memorial  to a deadline for the shifting out of fairs from the Maidan.  His mission for 2004: to save two internationally-acclaimed  heritage sites of the state, Santiniketan and the Sunderbans.

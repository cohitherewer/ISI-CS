The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Blaze blame warrant on promoter
 A STAFF REPORTER																								On a complaint lodged by the fire services directorate over Sundays blaze at a Shakespeare Sarani highrise, the city police have decided to arrest the buildings residents association secretary, promoter Pradip Kundalia, and its president, S.L. Thard, on charges of gross negligence.																								Deputy commissioner of police (south division) Anuj Sharma told Metro the local police station has been asked to round up the two persons named in the FIR by the fire brigade personnel for the blaze at Kundalia Towers. 																								The complaint has been viewed very seriously and we will make all efforts to arrest Kundalia and Thard, Sharma said. 																								Around 1.30 pm on Sunday, a mystery fire broke out in the ground floor of the building and spread quickly to the 10th floor through the electrical wires. Fortunately, all residents of the highrise could be evacuated, but the fire personnel found that the fire escape route was locked and the fire-fighting devices were not maintained at all. 																								The fire brigade then brought in a hydrant platform and five fire tenders to douse the flames. The apartment owners told police that despite repeated complaints about the ill-maintained fire-fighting devices, the apartment committee did nothing.																								The fire brigade then filed a complaint against the two office-bearers of the buildings association at Shakespeare Sarani police station. The complaints were lodged under Section 11C of the Fire Services Act and the Fire Prevention Act, 1996 for alleged non-compliance of the fire safety norms on the part of the buildings maintenance personnel.																								B.M. Sen, fire services director, said the FIR against the duo was registered because the fire inspectors had found the fire-fighting gadgets ill-maintained. 																								Kundalia Towers had proper fire-fighting equipment, but the firemen could not use it because it was not in a condition to use at all. Many lives would have been lost but for the effort of the fire-fighters, Sen said. 																								Based on the complaint, Shakespeare Sarani police station registered a case (no. 173) late on Sunday and swung into action. 																								The fire brigade report has been very helpful, but to build up the case further, we have asked the forensic sciences laboratory officials to come a take a look at the fire site, said Sharma, who is overseeing the probe.																								At Writers Buildings, Pratim Chatterjee, state fire services minister, said the cramped space in front of the building had prevented the fire-fighters from using the 52 -metre ladder to douse the flames. Our men could have reached the top of the building, but space constraints hampered operations, said Chatterjee. 																								The offence of the buildings maintenance personnel was very serious, he felt. Police have been urged to arrest the duo as soon as possible, he added.

 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Talking through canvas
																								The paintings of Ram Kumar speak a language of such eloquence which is only befitting an artist of his aesthetic calibre. Starting out as a priest of the art of painting, he splashed about in the vibrancy of the colours that life revealed before him. His work was his escape into a world that he could create and master, intensely subjective yet with a brilliance of the universal that lends objectivity to art. It was his retrospective date with Banaras that allowed for a submission to the mystery of black and white that encompasses several of his later works. Calcuttans may experience life through an exhibition of the paintings of Ram Kumar to be inaugurated today at 5.30 pm.																								When: Till January 31 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

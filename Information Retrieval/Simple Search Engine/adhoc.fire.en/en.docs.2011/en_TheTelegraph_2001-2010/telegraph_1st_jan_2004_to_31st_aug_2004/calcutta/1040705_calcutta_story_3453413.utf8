 An employees PF details are being stored for future use. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryBimal Bhattacharjee: You are set to introduce a common PF number. What is this all about?																																																													Say, for instance, an employee of a certain company joins another organisation in a different location. By the present system, we have to change his code number and start a new account. We are trying to introduce a system that will designate a unique number to the person that will remain unchanged throughout his career, irrespective of the number of organisations he works in over the years. This you can say is like a Permanent Account Number (PAN). The primary benefit of this number, known as social security number, will help us identify the person immediately, wherever he may be working in India.

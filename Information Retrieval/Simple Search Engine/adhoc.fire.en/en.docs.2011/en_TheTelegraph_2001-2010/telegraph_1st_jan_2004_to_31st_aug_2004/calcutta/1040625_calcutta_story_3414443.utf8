																																																		Two persons were arrested on Thursday on charges of kidnapping the headmaster of a school. Basudeb Biswas, headmaster of Alida Bagnar High School in Magrahat on the southern fringes of the city, was going to school on a train on Thursday morning. Biswas, a resident of Narendrapur, was to get down at Dhamua in Eastern Railways Sealdah-Diamond Harbour section. As he was about to detrain, Gulam Laskar, a local contractor, and his two sons obstructed Biswas. They later forced him to get down at Basuldanga. Following complaints from passengers at the station, a joint team of the local police and Government Railway Police conducted a raid and rescued Biswas. Laskar and one of his sons, Habibullah, were arrested. Police said investigations had revealed that Gulam was given a contract to construct the school building. However, after the first floor was built, the school authorities were not happy with his work and scrapped the contract. But Laskar alleged that the school authorities owed him money and were unwilling to pay up.																																																		The contempt case against Biman Bose, chairman of West Bengal Left Front, came up for hearing in Calcutta High Court on Thursday. Bose is facing contempt charges for his alleged public statement criticising Justice Amitava Lala of the high court after the judge had restricted rallies on city roads.

Justice A. Banerjee of Calcutta High Court allowed Aruna Bose and others to withdraw their writ petition filed against a private company seeking a court order directing Gariahat police station to help the petitioners get possession of a flat on Rashbehari Avenue, presently occupied by the company.

On hearing Mukherjees plea, the petitioners prayed for an order granting them permission to withdraw the case.

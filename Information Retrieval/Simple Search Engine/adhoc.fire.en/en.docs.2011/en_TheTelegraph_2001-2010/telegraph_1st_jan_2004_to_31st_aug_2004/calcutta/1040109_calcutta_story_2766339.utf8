 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Wheels levy on course
 OUR BUREAU																								Four-wheelers must pay road tax for five years at a go and two-wheelers have to cough up a lifetime levy by January 31.																								The deadline was reiterated by the government on Thursday, the day before a division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, hears a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the notification.																								State advocate-general Balai Roy has been served a copy of the case. The hearing in the division bench, presided over by the chief justice, assumes special significance as two judges have been hearing the matter separately and have already passed interim orders. If the chief justices division bench admits the PIL for disposal, the cases pending in the trial courts will become invalid.																								The Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) filed a petition before Justice B. Bhattacharjee seeking an order restraining the government from giving effect to the notification for payment of five-year road tax by owners of four-wheelers.																								Justice Bhattacharjee admitted the petition and passed an interim order, allowing the state to collect road taxes at new rates, but added that the government must reimburse vehicle-owners if the petition was allowed after final hearing. The judge fixed the matter for hearing on January 14.																								Justice Bhattacharjee also heard the petition filed by some two-wheeler owners and passed an interim order staying the government notification, asking them to pay the 15-year road tax by January 7.																								Some other two-wheeler owners filed a separate petition before Justice P.K. Roy during the Christmas vacation, challenging the validity of the government notification. Justice Roy observed that the notification for collecting lifetime road tax was bad in law and stayed the operation of the order. The hearing was fixed after four weeks.																								Thursday found the transport minister ruling out a rollback. He asserted that the government had introduced the new system of levying tax after amending the existing Motor Vehicles Act and so there was no going back.																								Alleging that confusion was being created over the tax citing a stay order, Chakraborty added: We do not have any information so far on any stay against the lifetime tax on two-wheelers. Also, we have not received any copy of such an order yet.

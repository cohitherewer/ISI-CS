 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Campus alarm over ransom note
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fear stalks lecturers on the Rajabazar Science College campus after a senior scientist received a ransom note last week. A security ring has been thrown around the college and the police are frisking every visitor.																								In the letter, an unidentified person threatened to abduct the senior scientist if she did not pay Rs 5 lakh within a few days. On receipt of the letter, the scientist contacted the authorities.																								Alarmed, the college authorities lodged a complaint with the local Amherst Street police station and demanded an inquiry. 																								The scientist who is the target of the threat letter is a veteran teacher of the university and there is no reason why she should be singled out. For security reasons, we have lodged a complaint with the local police station, said Manab Kumar Sengupta, secretary, science and technology faculty of the university, who is also in charge of the overall supervision of the Rajabazar Science College campus.																								Police however, believe the letter is the handiwork of a prankster. A probe is underway, but the threat doesnt seem to be serious at all, said deputy commissioner of police (north) P. Ravi.																								However, in the wake of the incident, security arrangements have been beefed up in the college. A section of senior teachers and scientists, who work till late in the evenings in their laboratories, had approached the authorities for additional security personnel to be deployed on the campus after 5 pm.																								Officials said the college authorities, during recent drives to beef up security, had noticed that outsiders entered the campus during class hours every day. These people often stayed back in the departments till late in the evenings. 																								We are trying to find out if these outsiders have any connection with the threat letter, said a senior police official. 																								 A section of employees, however, complained that the overall security on the campus was spinning out of control, because of a manpower crisis. At least 10 posts of durwans are vacant, with no signs of fresh recruitments, they alleged.

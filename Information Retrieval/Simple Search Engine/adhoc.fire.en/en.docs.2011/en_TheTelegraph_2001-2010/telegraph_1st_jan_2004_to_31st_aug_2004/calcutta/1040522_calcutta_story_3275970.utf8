The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

	Many minibuses in the city seem to charge different fares for the same distances. The rate charts are also not prominently displayed inside these buses. Recently, I took the Baishnabghata-Diamond Park minibus from Exide House to Howrah Maidan and back. While I was charged Rs 4 on my way to Howrah, during the return journey the conductor insisted that I pay Rs 4.25. The authorities should make sure that uniform fares are collected from passengers.

	The mayor should take steps to stop the wastage of water from the Corporations roadside taps. Often people do away with the taps to speed up the flow. This way a lot of water is wasted as the flow continues without a check. Why does the civic body not conduct a survey to locate such broken taps and take measures to seal them? Such a move would help overcome the problem of water shortage that is plaguing us in the summer months.

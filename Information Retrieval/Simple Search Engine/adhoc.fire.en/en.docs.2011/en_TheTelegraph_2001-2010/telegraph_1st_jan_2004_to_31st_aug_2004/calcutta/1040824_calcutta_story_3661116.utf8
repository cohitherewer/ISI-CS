 															- BLANK FIRE: LACK-OF-SAFETY FLAK FOR OTHERS, WHILE WRITERS SITS AT RISK SWATI SENGUPTA 				 	 Writers Buildings, where three minor fires were reported in less than 48 hours last week																								Its a case of doctor failing to heal himself. While the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has consistently frowned on malls, markets, educational institutions and crches for not adopting stringent fire-safety norms, Writers Buildings, seat of governance, is as prone to a fire as any of these. 																								And it is Rs 1.5 crore that is holding the government from replacing the age-old electrical wires. 																								Three fires were reported from Writers in less than 48 hours last week. On Wednesday night, smoke was spotted from the room of fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, on the second floor of the protected area. Panic-stricken officials informed the fire services, and fire tenders were rushed across. It wasnt a major blaze, though. 																								The next day, a press conference at the Rotunda, on the first floor, was all set to be cancelled, as something burning sparked a similar panic. It wasnt a big fire either: only a portion of a wire connected to a tubelight was burning. Early on Friday, there was yet another small fire in the room of a senior official. 																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee, who had threatened to close down AC Market, on Shakespeare Sarani, because the authorities had not adopted a modern fire-safety system, told Metro: A lot of measures need to be taken to make Writers fire-proof. After issuing warnings to others, were sitting tight on a safety mechanism for our administrative headquarters. 																								PWD minister Amar Choudhury, whose department is in charge of Writers maintenance, said: The wires are very old. We need Rs 1.5 crore to rewire the entire building. 																								Fire minister Chatterjee said he would write to the chief minister about last weeks incidents. I will tell him that something needs to be done urgently. A committee, formed six years ago, had suggested a set of recommendations. After that, Rs 32 lakh was spent on replacing the electrical wiring in the VIP corridors. Pumps were installed near Laldighi, Chatterjee added.																								He, however, admitted that this was not enough. Gadgets for fire and smoke detection need to installed. I often see files lying in the corridors. This can be dangerous, as people smoke there. I have been told that those who stay on overnight also cook their meals here, the minister pointed out.

 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Abortion link leads sleuths to clinic door
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sleuths on the Sushil Pal murder trail have sniffed an abortion racket, which could have sucked the gynaecologist into its vortex. 																								Investigation has revealed that Pal, attached to the Serampore Walsh Hospital, was in Bandel to perform two abortions on the day he went missing from his Bright Street residence. His body was found in a Sankrail canal the next day.																								Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials said this is a significant development, as an increasing number of female foeticide cases are being reported from the districts. Mondays revelation came after a four-day-long probe carried out on the basis of the call statement of Pals cellphone.																								Initially, local police had registered the case as an unnatural death. Later, post-mortem conducted at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital revealed that Pal was murdered, triggering the detective inquiry.																								Officers investigating the case identified the nursing home on GT Road in Bandel where Pal spent two hours on July 2. The nursing home staff confirmed he had been there. We are now trying to trace those who accompanied him, said a senior official at CIDs Bhabani Bhavan headquarters. 																								The sleuths said it was not the first time Pal had been to the Bandel nursing home. He was a regular visitor there for the past month. He went there only to perform abortions, confirmed a CID official.																								Police also came to know that one of Pals colleagues, a doctor attached to the same hospital, had introduced him to the nursing home authorities a month ago. We are questioning the doctor to verify whether he was also in Bandel with Pal on the same day or not, said an officer of CIDs Hooghly district unit.																								The detectives found out that Pal was getting increasingly involved in private practice, though he never failed to show up for his hospital duty, said a CID official.																								According to the call statement, Pal reached Bally around 1 pm. Around 1.20 pm, the first in-coming call was delivered from the cellphone service providers Bally tower. The statement shows he was in the same locality till 3.30 pm, when he received the last call delivered by the same tower, said the CID official.																								The investigators are convinced that the killing took place somewhere in the Bally area. We traced the landline number from where the last call was made to Pals cellphone. But the owner of the house denied having any knowledge about Pal, police said.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday gave the contempt case against Left Front chairman Biman Bose a new twist when it asked three television channels to produce footage of the press conference held by him, in which he allegedly made derogatory remarks against Justice Amitava Lalas order on restricting rallies in the city on weekdays.																								The meet was held at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters on October 4. A division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar directed channels Khas Khobor, ETV and Tara Bangla to produce the footage containing Boses remarks on Justice Lalas rein-rally order by August 5.

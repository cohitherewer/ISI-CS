 SUBHRO SAHA																								Log on to the Internet and run the office on remote control, call colleagues over for a board meeting or catch a favourite flick with family and friends  all from your hospital bed. Welcome to the world of lifestyle healthcare. No more antiseptic smells or depressing wards, no more bound by four walls of clinical whitewash and restricted visiting hours. And, no more sacrificing valuable manhours at work while recuperating.																								If Ruby General Hospitals exclusive lifestyle floor, The Enclave, has been making medical leave more productive than ever for four months now, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals is readying its luxurious Presidential Suites for an end-January launch.																								The feature details on the comfort corridors may vary, but the common thread is providing an in-hospital extension of the workplace for todays corporate executives, who dont mind paying that bit more  almost a 50 per cent premium  to remain in hospital but not out of the loop.																								There is no denying the demand. Today, top-rung professionals cant afford to stay away from work, never mind if they are recovering from surgery or a bout of illness. While there are luxury rooms with swank furniture and fittings in many city hospitals, they are not office-ready. We decided to plug that need at The Enclave, says T.K. Mukherjee, joint director, administration amp; operations.																								So, all eight luxury units on the lifestyle floor at Ruby have a computer with Internet connectivity, secretarial services and a VCD player, captive kitchenette, microwave oven, refrigerator, wardrobe, online workspace, drawing room and even a bedroom with a view. Besides, to cut paperwork clutter for the CIPs (commercially important persons), admission and discharge are from the same floor.																								If Ruby had first-mover advantage in lifestyle healthcare with workplace facility and is running at 95 per cent occupancy, also on the EM Bypass, Apollo Gleneagles hopes to carry the concept forward. Each of the 20 Presidential suites on the super-deluxe floor now on trial will have a remote-controlled cot, TV, VCR, kitchen, drawing room, games room, sit-out and a fully-equipped communication centre, according to CEO S.N. Reddy.																								The workstation-by-sickbed concept could be novel in town, but deluxe treatment suites arent. At Belle Vue Clinic and Woodlands, the luxury air-conditioned rooms have all the trappings of comfort, like TV, fridge, sofa sets, telephones, closets, special nurses and flexi diet, while Peerless Hospital, too, is upgrading its Executive Ward of super deluxe and deluxe rooms. At Bhagirathi Neotia Woman amp; Child Care Centre, the suites have an annexe sitting room with TV, telephone, kitchenette with personalised crockery, fridge and microwave.																								Ruby and Apollo Gleneagles, however, believe their workstation bonus will be the clincher. And part of the target segment could well come from overseas, with health tourism a clear focus area for the Apollo Group, and the Ruby management initiating dialogue with the UKs National Health Service (NHS) for transporting wait-listed patients.

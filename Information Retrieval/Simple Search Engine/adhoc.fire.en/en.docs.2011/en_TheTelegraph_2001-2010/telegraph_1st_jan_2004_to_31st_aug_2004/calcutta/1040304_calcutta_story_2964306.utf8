The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Delhi Metro counsel for corridor
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The state government has received the feasibility report on the east-west Metro Railway corridor from Rajarhat township to Dasnagar, in Howrah, drawn up by Jetro of Japan. 																								It now plans to ask the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to draw up the detailed project report.																								Senior officials said the detailed project report would cost about Rs 5 crore and 40 per cent of the funds would be sought from the Centre. Once the report is ready, we will seek funds from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), an official of the urban development department said on Wednesday.																								To implement the east-west corridor project, the government also plans to set up a separate company with the Metro Railway, as in Hyderabad and Bangalore. In both the cities, work is progressing well, pointed out the official.																								Jetro has said in its report that institutional arrangement for project implementation must be started immediately and carried on without interruption.																								Both direct and indirect benefits will accrue to a considerable degree in Bengal, especially by relieving transport constraints, such as reduction of accidents and congestion and strengthening of social and cultural links between eastern and western areas of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, the report stated.																								Officials on Wednesday added that real estate consultant C.B. Richard Ellis has carried out a preliminary study on a proposed township in Dankuni. It will draw up a similar report on a proposed Howrah township.

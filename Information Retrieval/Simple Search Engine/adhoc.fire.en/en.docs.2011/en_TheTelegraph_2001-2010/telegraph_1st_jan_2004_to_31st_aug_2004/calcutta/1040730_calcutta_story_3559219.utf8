The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Mixed-bag menu for retail boom
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bow out dying city, enter fun city, with civic mandarins partnering mall majors.																								A swank international book mall on College Street, housing the worlds leading publishers under one roof with ambience and back-end to match.																								A dose of aesthetics in new, renovated civic marts like Lansdowne market and Lake market to make up for eyesores like the New Market extension and the Ballygunge AC Market.																								Cleaner sidewalks, better civic amenities and all the support the burgeoning retail sector needs to sustain its acceleration.																								In a categorical statement of intent, municipal commissioner Debashis Som on Thursday chose the last leg of Retail 2004 to roll out all these plans  and other fringe benefits  to transform the city.																								Living in Calcutta should be fun and to ensure that, we are keen to overhaul both hardware and software in the city, Som stressed, while spelling out Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) initiatives to promote business environment in the city at the CII retail summit.																								In a huge confidence-booster to the real estate and retail fraternity, the commissioner confirmed that a move to the unit-area computation method for property taxes was being expedited.																								Its a more objective system compared with the existing rental method and a slightly modified version of the Delhi model will probably be adopted here. Our efforts are directed towards improving efficiency of the collection system and creating an atmosphere that is more tax-compliant, added Som.																								The major players in the citys fast-evolving retail matrix  the emerging and the traditional alike  welcomed the civic bodys pledge to prop high-street shopping and boost mall magic.																								The low cost index, higher disposable incomes, absence of distance barriers and a sprawling hinterland have made Calcutta one of the preferred destinations for retailers, said Rahul Saraf, managing director, Forum.																								The Elgin Road lifestyle mall houses the countrys highest-selling Satya Paul outlet and INOX, which is among the top three multiplexes in terms of box-office sales, while its Refuel counter clocks maximum per patron F amp;B consumption.																								Calcutta needs to celebrate its success stories, felt Pantaloons chief Kishore Biyani. His Gariahat outlet, unveiled in 1997, continues to do the highest per-square-foot sales in the country and Biyani insists that he has never faced any problem with clearances in Calcutta.																								While recognising the need for modern formats, Som pointed out that New Market was the original retail hub in India. It all started here, but sadly somewhere down the line, we lost the plot. Its important to analyse where we went wrong and get back on track quickly. Here, the authorities role should be that of a facilitator and protector, the civic commissioner stressed.																								M.J.Z. Mowla, senior vice-president, Bata India Ltd, echoed the civic commissioners call to understand consumer needs better. There was a time when Bata had around 1,500 stores all over Bengal. But we became complacent, didnt account for competition which arrived in the 80s and paid the price, he admitted.																								But with the civic body promising an end to inspector raj and red tape, besides ensuring sensitive handling of people and their problems, the retail fraternity is buoyant.																								The recreation part of shopping is as important as the economics of it, and more and more Calcuttans are realising that. Earlier, the perception was that well-done-up stores would be more expensive. That intimidation factor is now evaporating, said retail consultant D.P. Basu.

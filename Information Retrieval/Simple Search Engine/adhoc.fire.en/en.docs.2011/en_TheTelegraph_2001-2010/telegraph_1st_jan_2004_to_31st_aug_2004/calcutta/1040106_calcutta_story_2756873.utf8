 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Freeze factor sets off scurry for warmth
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Desperately seeking warmth. As the North Wind blows, the mercury dips and the city shivers, theres one thing thats hotter than ever before  the market to match a consumer scramble for all things warm.																								Lets start with the rush for room heaters. A pleasant surprise for sellers, but an unpleasant surprise for buyers, is how Sanjay Sinha of Zenith Electrics puts it. Despite the Ezra Street store stocking 30 to 35 per cent more room heaters than in the last winter, supply is just no match for demand.																								We have sold 300 room heaters in the past 48 hours. There is no way shops here can keep pace with such a rush, despite sourcing extra stocks from manufacturers in Delhi this season, says Sinha.																								The clamour for room heaters started around Christmas Day and reached crisis point this weekend, with the maximum temperature fighting shy of the 20s. And the grab for geysers, that normally slows down post-December, has shown no signs of slacking five days into the new year.																								For comfort from the cold, price is hardly a barrier. The convector-type heater, priced at around Rs 2,000, is the first choice by far over the conventional reflector-tube heater going for Rs 400. Similarly, shelling out Rs 11,000 to Rs 15,000 for a washing machine seems a good deal.																								With every household facing the problem of washed clothes not drying, the spin-drying system, that tackles 85 per cent of the moisture, has become hugely popular in the past couple of weeks, says Jiten Chawla, of the LG lifestyle shop on Camac Street.																								The want for washing machines is overtaken only by the craze for microwaves. This is the first Calcutta winter to witness a crazy buying of microwaves. From selling around 60 in November, weve sold around 350 in the past couple of weeks, observes Jiten, adding that consumers are happy to dish out Rs 6,000 to Rs 11,000 for hot food on the table.																								Crowding consumer durables on the shopping list are warm clothes. Pantaloons has seen a three-fold increase in the off-take of winterwear over last winter, with pullovers and full-sleeve T-shirts overtaking designer jackets.																								We normally forecast the winter to decide on stock, as no factory can deliver products overnight. This season, the winter was delayed by around two weeks, so the sales started a little late, but they have picked up now both because of the chill factor and the discount on winterwear, says R.S. Rekhi of Pantaloons.																								The sales spurt has taken a new entrant on Elgin Road by surprise. We were in two minds about the extent of stocking, as its the first winter for us in Calcutta. But the demand is so high that we are airlifting warm clothing from Delhi, says Somnath Sarkar at Shoppers Stop.																								New-age coffee shops are also making hay while the pale sun shines. Cappuccino and caf latte have suddenly replaced cold coffee as the favourite. The sale of hot coffee has doubled (500 cups a day over the normal 250-odd at the Park Street outlet) over the past few days, says Soubhik Pal of Caf Coffee Day.																								Those in higher spirits are pushing sales in the liquor market. Though the chill factor has knocked the cheer off beer by around 50 per cent, the rally for rum and whisky is rising. The weather has added to the festive spirit and rum and whisky sales are higher by around 25 to 30 per cent, says Vikram Soni of Essem Agencies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 21, 2004 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... Take a break, go on a holiday. Avoid speculation in financial matters. Do not be suspicious all the time. Your self-respect is a great asset. Watch out for throat-related problems. You make a devoted and generous spouse. Purple is a lucky colour.  Kusum Bhandari

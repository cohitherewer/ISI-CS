The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 24, 2004 Sandesh Samrat, 160, goes places 
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 A sampling of the sandesh fare, the trademark of Girish Chandra Dey-Nakur Chandra Nandy. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Not loud, but restrained, with just a hint of rose petals. 																								Thats Nakurs trademark golapi peda (or sandesh), which, along with the jalbhora talshaash and kora golla, have zealously guarded one of the last bastions of true-blue Bangaliana since 1844.																								If the sweetmeat capital crown still rests easy on Calcutta, the modest mishtir dokan Mahesh Dey started at 56, Ramdulal Sarkar Street (then Maniktala Street), can claim fair share of the credit.																								Now, after 160 years of upholding the fine art of sandesh-making, Girish Chandra Dey-Nakur Chandra Nandy has decided to venture out of its north Calcutta heritage hole and drop the we have no branch shop line.																								The sandesh samrat has opened a counter at the newly-built Mahalaxmi Temple complex on Diamond Harbour Road. And this could be just the beginning of a whole new sweet success saga.																								The world is changing all around us and we feel its time to reach out. So, to celebrate our 160th anniversary and in response to the persistent demand of connoisseurs, we have opened this new stall on the temple premises, says Prasanta Nandy, great-grandson of Nakur Chandra Nandy.																								The address with an exclusive sharp focus on sandesh, is also scouting for suitable sites to open two more outlets in Behala and Garia. And the fifth-generation partners even dream of taking the delicate art of sandesh-making beyond borders, maybe even overseas.																								This new aggressive marketing focus sits in stark contrast to the only-one-outlet philosophy embraced fiercely by the traditional sweetmeat house all these years.																								Much like those proud confectioners and bakers of Paris, who had perennially long queues outside for their special bread, baked with sawdust from the wood of a specific tree as fuel, observes a Nakurs loyalist.																								Although the origin of the sandesh can be traced back almost 500 years, the renaissance sandesh wasnt discovered till the early 18th Century, when Dutch settlers produced pot cheese by breaking milk for the first time in these parts.																								It sparked quite a furore, since breaking milk was considered taboo among a section of staunch Hindu Brahmins, who wouldnt have the phikey (meek) sandesh.																								Nakurs is credited with carrying the fine art of chhana sandesh forward and further refining it with single-minded ardour.																								And we have had to keep pace with the times too, smiles Nandy. So, while preserving the sanctity of the classic narampak and chandrapuli, the sultans of sandesh have now diversified into malai roll (inspired by the ubiquitous paratha roll), besides other innovations like Moushumi (a variety of nalen gurer sandesh with coconut stuffing).																								Orange, pineapple and strawberry sandesh, made from real fruit juice and fruit crush, have also been a huge hit and now, the management is replicating fruit-flavoured pedas at the temple built by the Goenkas to go with the usual spread.																								Decorative sandesh is another area of speciality that Nakurs is keen to leverage more in its broad-banding bid. 																								Of course, we use the expertise of idol artisans from Kumartuli, when we do things like wedding tatvas. But the tender care that goes into each piece is quintessentially ours, says Nandy.

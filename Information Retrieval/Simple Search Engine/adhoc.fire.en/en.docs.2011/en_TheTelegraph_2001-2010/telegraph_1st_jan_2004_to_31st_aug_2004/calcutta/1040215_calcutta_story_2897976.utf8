 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Heist of lakhs in sari shop
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In an audacious robbery that shocked central Calcutta, four armed men entered a sari shop in Posta and made off with Rs 5.5 lakh in cash after hitting the proprietors son on his head with the butt of a revolver. 																								The four robbers entered the shop on the second floor of a building at 37 Shibtola Street at 2.15 pm and forced one of the employees to empty the cashbox. They fled with Rs 5.5 lakh, police said. 																								The connivance of an insider is not being ruled out. An investigation is on but no arrest has been made so far.																								The shop-owner, Mahavir Prasad, and his son Gaurav Agarwal had withdrawn a large sum of money from the bank at noon and brought the amount to the shop. All of it was taken away, Rajeev Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central), said.																								Shortly after lunch, when all the employees still had not returned after the break and when there were no customers around, the four men entered the shop. Three of them positioned themselves inside, while one of them stayed outside to keep an eye. 																								After threatening the staff with dire consequences if they were disobeyed, the robbers asked the cashier to hand over all the money from the cash box and the safe. 																								When Gaurav protested, he received a blow on his head with the butt of a revolver. Seeing his boss son bleed as a consequence of his resistance, the cashier did exactly as he had been ordered. He emptied out the cash box and the safe and handed over the money to the robbers.																								Collecting what they had come for, the robbers walked out of the shop threatening to shoot anybody who dared to step out. They walked down the stairs, mingled with the pedestrians crowding the street, and disappeared before anyone could stop them.																								As news of the daring robbery spread, other shop-owners and businessmen expressed concern over the safety of their workers and the security of the area in general.																								Money transactions take place throughout the working hours in this area. All the shops function that way, and are thus soft targets of any criminal planning to make ready money. 																								The police should be more alert to ensure that such robberies do not recur, but they are not, one of the shopkeepers alleged, adding that the culprits should be arrested immediately.																								The shop is one of the many of its kind in central Calcutta. The heart of the city is a thriving trade zone comprising business houses as well as shops selling a wide variety of finished and unfinished products.

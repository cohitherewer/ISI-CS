 															- Couple teaches Ps and Qs of client service to state tourism staff  NISHA LAHIRI				 	 TOUR HIGHS: Itll soon be a pleasure for new-age tourists to visit places like Mukutmanipur.																								In the kitchen: Continental cooking tips and cutlery dos and donts. In the room: cleanliness and customer service. Behind the scenes: inventory management and innovative planning.																								People are going places and to keep pace with the times, the West Bengal Forest Development Corporation (WBFDC) is in makeover mode. The 18 resorts it owns are being revamped to bring in  and satisfy  the new breed of holiday-makers looking for out-of-the-way locations with modern facilities. 																								We were getting a lot of complaints, so we decided to upgrade the facilities, explains P.K. Shukla, general manager, WBFDC. Also, we are trying to attract non-Bengali tourists.																								Handling the get-set-go project from May 04 is the husband-wife team of Alok and Aditi Singh. The Ps and Qs of client service is what the couple is emphasising on. Having previously run a travel agency and a travel institute, the Singhs are incorporating the curriculum from travel and hotel management course textbooks. 																								Aditis area of expertise is the kitchen  teaching the forest department staff members how to make different types of tea and coffee, cooking continental and north Indian food like varieties of omelettes, sausages and salami and puri bhaji, and how to plan a menu. Alok backs her up with crockery and cutlery classes, and liquor lessons.																								Theyve archaic methods of doing things, from reservations to cooking. For instance, even Bengali food is restricted to dal, bhaat and machher jhol. And every fish preparation is with ginger and garlic. They dont even have a concept of napkins, and room service is poor. But they are very keen to learn and are picking up things fast, says Aditi. The recap sessions have gone off well. In fact, north Bengal is upset, because we havent started there yet.																								Alok is in Garpanchkot, south Bengal, at the moment, teaching lower-rung employees the finer points of laying and waiting on tables, three ways to serve a meal, types of and courses in menus, housekeeping (daily and spring cleaning), bed-making and turning down the bed, room and bathroom condition before check-in, inventory management, customer service (benefits, techniques, how to handle an upset customer) and room dcor and furniture maintenance.																								The WBFDC is paying about Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 for each workshop and a whole lot more to improve facilities. And the start is almost from the very beginning. For instance, these places host quite a few banquets and conferences  brainstorming sessions by companies  during which they are completely incommunicado since there are no communication tools. We have been advising them to have at least one phone per lodge. Plus, TV and radio are a must, explains Aditi.																								Next on the teachers timetable are workshops with supervisers on management skills, in Calcutta, including lessons on motivation, managerial and negotiation skills, administration (billing, discount, etc), basic accounting and environmental scanning. 																								But will it pay off? Shukla seems to think so. Its too soon to tell if things have improved and that will take about six months. But we arent receiving complaints any more. Besides, our revenue figures stood at around Rs 80 lakh last year and this years projection is already Rs 1 crore, he adds. Part of the plan is also to market the forest addresses in Bengal and the Singhs suggestion is to name the lodges and give them resort status, with logos on linen, and upgrade the website. While Shukla admits that the aim right now is to improve the facilities, online reservations through credit cards is in the pipeline, hopefully by April 2005.

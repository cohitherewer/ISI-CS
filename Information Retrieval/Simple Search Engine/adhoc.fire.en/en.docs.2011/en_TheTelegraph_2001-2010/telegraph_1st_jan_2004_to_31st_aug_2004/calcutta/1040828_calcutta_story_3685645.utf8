 															- Spurned suitor killed in scuffle after stabbing girl A STAFF REPORTER																								A desperate act of a teenager thwarted in love led to his own death and a narrow escape for the object of his affection.																								Kailash Raut and Rakhi Raut were neighbours at the staff quarters of the National Jute Manufacturing Corporation mill at Sankrail, in Howrah. When their relationship came under fire from Rakhis parents, she called it off. On Thursday night, an enraged Kailash tried to stab her. But in the scuffle that ensued when neighbours intervened, the 19-year-old youth was stabbed and Rakhi, 17, critically injured.																								Two suspects have been arrested and the police have charged them with murder. Three others have been detained, following a probe on the basis of a complaint lodged by Rakhis father Sankar Raut. The girl is in the intensive care unit of Howrah State General Hospital.																								Residents of the area alleged that Kailash had stabbed himself. But Howrah police are investigating other possibilities. It seems improbable, as he had been trying to free himself from the clutches of the mob, said Mihir Bhattacharya, Howrah police superintendent.																								A resident of quarter number 14, Kailash apparently had an eye on Rakhi for some time. Kailash was unemployed and it took him a while to win over Rakhi. But they were eventually involved in a relationship.																								When word reached Rakhis parents, her father vehemently opposed the match, as the boy was unemployed. He first asked his wife to persuade the girl to leave her boyfriend. But when that failed, Sankar Raut apparently threatened Rakhi, said an officer of the local police station. Rakhi soon stopped meeting Kailash and broke off contact.																								Distraught, Kailash stormed into Rakhis family quarters late on Thursday. After pleading with her, he grabbed a knife and stabbed Rakhi in the stomach. The girls screams alerted neighbours, who arrived on the scene. Catching hold of Kailash, they beat him up. Police believe that he was stabbed to death at this time with the same knife.

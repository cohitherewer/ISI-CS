 Candidates at a Higher Secondary examination centre. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryDebashree Bhattacharjee: Newspapers often report that examiners lose answer-scripts while in transit. The loss of even a single paper can damage the career of a student. How can such people, who are not even responsible enough to carry the answer-scripts carefully, be expected to examine them properly?																																																													I can understand your fears but rest assured. We have a regulation in place to tackle such a situation. Generally, once it is officially established that an answer-script has been lost, we call the candidate and ask him to choose one of two options. Since there are two papers for each subject, we ask the candidate to accept the marks obtained in one paper as the marks for the paper that is lost. If he disagrees, we ask him to take the percentage of his aggregate score as the marks for his lost paper. In case both the papers are lost, the student is given the aggregate percentage as the marks for the lost papers.

- Cool tools for the gadget geek TechTalkThey are tiny, they perform assorted functions efficiently and in style, and they are available here. The city may not be known for its range of gizmos, but thanks to the breed of gadgeteers (small they may be, but passionate they are), some wonders like the ones featured here can turn you into a modern-day Bond - James Bond (okay, minus the women and wine and the saving the world with 90 seconds to go). You just have to look a little harder.Techtip: Get in touch with Anil Bader at 9830040965.Note: All prices are estimates and include applicable taxes.Iogear Memory Mini MouseIf you thought the mouse is only good for point and click, this tiny one proves you wrong in a big way. Roughly one-third the size of a regular mouse, it not only has a long retractable cable coiled neatly in its belly, but also 32 megabytes (MB) of data storage capacity. The next time youre using the mouse and need to transfer word documents, photographs and even MP3s from one PC to another, simply store it in the mouse and take it along. No floppies or CDs required. The mouse plugs into the universal serial bus (USB) port present in most PCs these days.Price: Rs 3,500Travelpac Wireless PC Security LockAre you paranoid about someone messing up your precious PC in your absence? This may be your wish come true. The neat transmitter-receiver combo locks your computer when youre away from it. Plug the receiver into the USB port and keep the transmitter in your pocket. If you move more than two metres away from the PC, it enters lock mode and prevents anyone from using it. The PC automatically resumes operation when youre back in the range. In case the battery in the lock is running low, the PC flashes a warning indicating that.Price: Rs 1,200Travelpac Wireless Handsfree KitLike drinking, mobile-chatter too, shouldnt mix with driving. But what if the caller came over the radio and you could answer normally through the phone? Different from the run-of-the-mill handsfree kits, this set can be clipped on to your phone. Leave it on the dashboard, on your lap or anywhere else in the car when youre driving. Keep your car radio tuned to 88.7 MHz or 106.4 MHz FM. When a call comes, you can hear the phone ring and the callers voice on the radio and talk back through the phone. Helps to fool the cops too.Price: 1,100MSI Mobile Storage DeviceYou cant be blamed if you mistake this for a slightly bigger-than-usual cigarette lighter. But the truth is, this 57.5x69.7x13.1 millimetre object can hold a whopping 1.5 gigabytes (GB) of data. It works as a mini hard disk, which you can slip into your pocket and carry around for transporting files from one PC to another. And it weighs only 56.5 grams.Price: Rs 10,000MSI Mega Stick 256 MP3This MP3 player the size of a small penknife has 10 FM radio stations, stores 256 MB of data and allows voice and FM recording. Along with MP3, it also plays tracks in windows media audio (WMA) format. The LCD panel displays a graphic equaliser and information regarding the songs played. Attach it to the computer and copy MP3 files. Voice and FM recordings made on the device can also be transferred into the hard disk of the PC. A single AAA battery provides 12 hours of listening pleasure.Price: Rs 8,500For questions, comments and suggestions, write to techtalk@abpmail.com

 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 High court rebuff in death case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected a writ petition by US-based doctor Kunal Saha, seeking a directive to the West Bengal Medical Council to cancel the registrations of two doctors  Sukumar Mukherjee and Baidyanath Haldar  who were found guilty and convicted by an Alipore sessions judge in the death case of his wife Anuradha.																								Justice B. Bhattacharjee observed that as the doctors had filed an appeal against the trial court order and their petition was pending in the high court, Saha had no authority to demand cancellation of their registrations.																								The court said the petitioner (Saha) was at liberty to write to the medical council demanding cancellation of registrations only after the order of the trial court was upheld by the high court.																								A sessions judge had on May 29, 2002, held Sukumar Mukherjee and Baidyanath Haldar guilty of negligence in the treatment of Anuradha Saha and sentenced them to three months simple imprisonment. The doctors, however, got bail the same day.																								The trial court had acquitted Abani Roy Chowdhury, a third doctor accused in the death case.																								Saha and the accused doctors filed separate appeals in Calcutta High Court, challenging the sessions courts verdict. Both the appeals are being heard by Justice Gora Chand De.

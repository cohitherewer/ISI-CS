The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 26, 2004 At Metro, Friday new show
 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 The hall on JL Nehru Road: Makeover moves																								It opened on December 5, 1935, with Metro Goldwyn-Mayers (MGM) Hollywood film Bohemian Girl.																								On March 26, 2004, Metro cinema, at 15, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, will make a new beginning, this time with the release of Bollywoods Muskan.																								After nearly seven decades of high and low lights, there are grand plans now to revamp the historic movie hall.																								Set up by MGM early in the 20th Century, the responsibility for running the show was later passed on to Indian management.																								On Thursday, the deal was signed and sealed between the Guptas  who are also the owners of Mumbais Metro cinema  and the newly-formed Sri Venkatesh Films-Priya cinema partnership. 																								The reins of control change hands effective Friday, when the Manisha Koirala-starrer hits the hall that has lost its lustre.																								Along with Globe, we are going to make Metro the hub of cinema in central Calcutta. At Metro, English and Hindi films will be screened. The idea is for us to be able to do all three  film production, distribution and exhibition. This way, we dont depend on anybody, explains Arijit Dutta, owner of Priya and president of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association.																								But that doesnt mean good films from other production houses will not be screened, assures Mahendra Soni of Sri Venkatesh Films. There are a number of other films lined up at Metro. And while the new management stresses that there will be no overnight change, the plans are for a complete turnaround.																								Within the next six months, we want to upgrade the inside, from the sound system to the ambience. We will bring back Metros former glory, promises Soni.																								But first, its a facelift, adds Dutta, because the faade has been hurting my eyes for a while. The details havent been thought out yet, since the whole thing has happened in the past 10 to 12 days. There will be several new things. Metro has a lot of potential, says Dutta.																								The idea is expansion through consolidation, he points out. In fact, Priya will begin production of Bengali films next week, and we hope to have two or three films on the floor annually from next year.																								Metro general manager G.S. Mishra feels that although it remains one of the best halls, changes are required, in keeping with the times.																								We have tried our best to maintain the place. The footfall in most halls has gone down But Metro still gets about seven lakh customers a year, asserts Mishra.																								But the grand dame of Chowringhee hasnt quite dissociated herself from her foreign origins. It is still a US-registered company, but is managed by Indian executives, says Mishra.																								Only, from Friday, itll be a whole new set of Indian executives calling the shots.

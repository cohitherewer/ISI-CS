 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Scavengers of nature in numbers scare
 															- Virus behind vanishing vultures 				 	 A white-backed vulture eats meat under observation in the captive breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana. (Reuters)																								There are nine species of vultures in India, and a significant population is found in North Bengal and Calcutta. Among them, several, particularly of the Gyps species, are found only in this country, like the Long-billed and the Slender-billed (only found in the area north of the Gangetic valley). Once, these natures scavengers were available in abundance, cleaning up the countryside of animal carcasses. Now, they are close to extinction, unless something is done to prevent it, and fast.																								This was the subject of discussion on World Environment Day (June 5) at a programme organised at Nandan II by the wildlife wing of the government of West Bengal and Aranyak, the NGO patronised by Suchetana Bhattacharjee, daughter of the chief minister. The presentation was by Vibhu Prakash, a scientist of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), of a study conducted by him in two phases. Although the area was Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan, the findings are echoed in the precious few official and unofficial surveys in the country.																								In the first phase, he monitored the vulture population in the park from 1986-89. Prakash went back to review the situation in 1997-2000. The facts and figures were alarming  the scavengers had fallen in number by about 90 per cent. Unless it is stemmed, the majestic creatures of the sky will be lost to us forever. Like the Slender-billed variety, of which there are only about 200 pairs left in north and northeast India, explained the 20-year vulture veteran. These endangered birds are at risk of being lost to the world.																								The problem is, the birds used to be in such abundance that there was never any proper official study done on them, rued Kushal Mukherjee, secretary of the NGO Prakriti Sansad. I did a few rough surveys of numbers at Tollygunge Club, where I have been going every day since 1992. At that time, there were 25-30 nests. Now, there are none. There used to be large numbers at Victoria Memorial (a study, the first of its kind in Calcutta, had been done over a year ago by kolkatabirds.com, as reported in Metro). From 15 even last October, there are about seven or eight now.																								The decrease in numbers, attributed to a mysterious virus and fall in breeding, was first noticed by Prakash in 1997 as what is now referred to as the drooping neck syndrome. After much research, the cause was pinpointed by Pakistani scientists  diclofenac, a painkiller administered to cattle and sheep, the staple of Indian vultures. It causes build-up of excessive urea, which leads to dehydration in them, he added. Subsequently, a captive breeding centre was set up by BNHS, in association with the government of Haryana, at Pinjore. It has been successful, and we are building another in Himachal Pradesh. We would also like one near Siliguri, to monitor the Slender-billed vultures, Prakash said.																								The state government is very keen, observed conservator of forests (wildlife) V.K. Jadav. The BNHS has submitted a proposal. They have found funding and we are identifying land near Siliguri. We will start it as soon as possible, within the year. Our plan is three-pronged. First, ban diclofenac by talking to the veterinary association, the ministry of husbandry and even the drug regulatory authority. Then, a captive breeding project and third, awareness among the public with help from NGOs like Aranyak and Prakriti Sansad, he added.						 NISHA LAHIRI

																								Ever since man has known art as a creative form he has instinctively included it into the ambit of human happiness. It coaxes the mind to appreciate the beautiful and trains the eye to follow the mind in capturing that beauty. The paintings on display at the Idiyas Gallery have been created on a wide range of mediums that includes tempera, watercolours, oils, acrylics and charcoals on experimental forms like metal, bronze, marble and fibreglass. The subjects of the paintings range from landscapes and portraits to include realistic themes that have been moulded by the imagination to border on the surreal and the abstract. Among the painters whose artistic creations feature at the exhibition are Sukanto Das, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Chanchal Mukherjee and Shyamal Sen, whose painting appears above.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings																								When: Till May 15; 10.30 am - 7.30 pm																								Where: Idiyas Gallery, 15 Dover Road

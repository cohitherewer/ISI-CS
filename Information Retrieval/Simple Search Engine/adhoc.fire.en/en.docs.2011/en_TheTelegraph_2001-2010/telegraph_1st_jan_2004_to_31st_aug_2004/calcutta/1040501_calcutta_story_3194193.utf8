The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Drugstore kidnap was hatched in two days
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mohammad Naseem, who masterminded the daring abduction of central Calcutta drugstore-owner Mohammad Abbas in February, took only two days to chalk out his strategy. Naseem, also known as Nat in the citys crimeworld, was being interrogated by the police on Friday on the circumstances that led to the abduction.																								Naseem was netted from the Kalabagan area on Thursday by officials of Jorasanko police station. We were looking for him since the day of the crime. His associates have already been tracked down, said Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge.																								On February 14, Naseem and three associates  Raja, Pintu and Asif  had been sitting in a field in Metiabruz. It was plain adda. We were in a funds crunch. Naturally, the topic of discussion was how to get rich quick, recalled Naseem, sitting in a room in Jorasanko police station.																								Initially, Asif suggested that they wring money out of some promoters in Park Circus. But the plan did not gel. I, then, drew up a list of businessmen whom I knew I could fleece. After considering all aspects, I selected Abbas, said Naseem. 																								Explaining the selection, Naseem said: I used to live near Mohammad Ali Park and Abbas shop was also located there. So, I decided on him. Besides, the lanes and bylanes of the area are known to me.																								Naseem and the others then collected two revolvers with cartridges. The next day, they contacted Kausar, a local youth and driver of the bottle-green Maruti Omni, which was used to abduct Abbas. They settled the deal with Kausar. Asif was told to pay him Rs 1,000 for the job, said officer-in-charge Bhattacharya, who is interrogating Naseem extensively.																								Kausar, arrested on Thursday night, said: Around 11 am on February 16, five persons boarded my vehicle. First, we went to Park Circus. They got off, but returned within minutes. I was then told to drive towards Medical College and Hospital.																								The gangsters gathered in front of Abbas shop around 2 pm. Naseem wanted to avoid the evening crowd. So, he decided to complete the abduction by 4 pm. But he had to return, as Abbas was not in his shop, said Bhattacharya.																								The miscreants then had their lunch in a road-side eatery near the hospital. Around 5 pm, we went back to the shop. Abbas was there and I identified him to my accomplices, recalled Naseem.																								The mastermind was waiting opposite the shop in a taxi. Raja and Pintu got off the Omni and held two revolvers to Abbas temple. They dragged him to the car while Asif, who was on the rear seat, pulled him into the vehicle, said Kausar.																								I had kept the cars engine idling. Soon, I was driving down CR Avenue. All the tinted windowpanes were rolled up. I was told to head for Mayurbhanj Road. It was dark and nothing was visible at the spot where they asked me to stop. They vanished into the darkness and I returned home, Kausar added.																								Police are looking for Akbar, the person who helped Naseem to keep Abbas confined.

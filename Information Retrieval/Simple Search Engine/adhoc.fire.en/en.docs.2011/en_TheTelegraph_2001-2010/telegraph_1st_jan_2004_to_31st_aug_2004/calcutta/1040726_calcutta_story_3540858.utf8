 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Trio bid to break open ATM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In the first such crime case in the city, a gang of three raided an automated teller machine (ATM) counter in Park Circus, a stones throw from Beniapukur police station, and made a futile attempt to break open the machine at 2 am on Sunday. 																								The ATM security guard was threatened with a gun. No arrest has been made so far.																								This is the first attempt to rob an ATM counter in the city. Now, we will have to think of it from the security aspect, said a senior official at Lalbazar police headquarters.																								Three youths in their mid-20s approached the ATM counter of Federal Bank on Darga Road. One of them pretended to be an ATM card-holder and entered the counter. The two others stormed in after him.																								A gun was pointed at the security man, belonging to a private agency. He was forced to stand in one corner.																								Two of the young men tried to break open the machine, while the third stood guard outside, on the pavement. The two young men used their revolver butt and an iron rod to try and prise open the machine. But they failed to do so, said an officer of Beniapukur police station.																								Unable to take out even a single currency note from the machine, the trio decided to leave. 																								It seems the young men were from the neighbourhood, and they must have kept watch on the counter for the past few days. A hunt is on to track them down, said the officer.																								Police decided to review the existing security system of ATM counters. It is not possible for us to provide security to each counter. There are security guards of different private agencies to protect the ATMs. What we can do is intensify the vigil on the roads where ATM counters are located, said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters. 																								A.M. Pattanayak, assistant general manager (ATM), State Bank of India, said: Robbing an ATM counter by breaking open the machine is very difficult. Inside the machine, the cash is kept in an iron box. If anyone tries to open the box without keys, he will have to cut it open. 																								He added: ATM counters located in isolated places are equipped with alarms that are set off if anyone attempts to tamper with the configuration of the machine.

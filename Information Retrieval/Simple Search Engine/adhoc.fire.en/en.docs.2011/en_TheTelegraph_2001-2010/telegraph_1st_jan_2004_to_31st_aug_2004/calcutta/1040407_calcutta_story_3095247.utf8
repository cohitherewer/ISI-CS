 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Haul of fake cassettes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Piracy peril has been marked enemy number one by the entertainment industry for some time now. A glimpse of why was provided by Tuesdays enforcement branch (EB) swoop on a Chandni Chowk shop that netted pirated audio and video cassettes worth Rs 35 lakh, and six offenders.																								We had a specific tip-off that pirated CDs and audio cassettes were being packaged and sold from a shop on the first floor of 21, Chandni Chowk. The raid yielded 72,000 audio cassettes, 15,000 VCDs and 3.5 lakh inlay cards, all counterfeit, said deputy commissioner of police (EB) R.K. Adhikari, adding that the pirated items were probably manufactured outside the city.																								The cassettes bore a price tag of Rs 32, while the maximum retail price printed on the CD covers was Rs 100, police said.

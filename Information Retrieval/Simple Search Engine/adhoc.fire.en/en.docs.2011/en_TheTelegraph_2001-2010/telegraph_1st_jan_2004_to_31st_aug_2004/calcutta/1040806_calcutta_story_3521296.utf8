DESIGNER SABYASACHI MUKHERJEE PENS AN ODE TO A WAY OF LIFE LONG PASTSABYA SPEAKCaught up in the hectic pace, the creativity and beauty of slow, sensuous living is fast disappearing. But style is hardly just about clothes. It is about a way of life. The art of letter writing. Chulha ka khana. Hand-made clothing. Hand washed clothing, too.The things that have invaded our lives in an attempt to make them easier have also eroded the quality of life. Now, instead, we have deadlines and peer pressure.People are losing out on life because they havent made the effort to slow down. We have lost the capacity to invent, now we only innovate.Often, we dont even do that; we steal. We steal from the past and package it in the present.A lot of us are now feeling the need to slow down, but none of us are doing it because no one wants to be left behind. We are all running, pushing, shoving for more.Time has become such a luxury that we feel guilty when we go on holiday. That is why we all like bandhs. We cant do anything and it is beyond our control!But maybe there is now a kind of resistance to this forced life. Just look at the way dum pukht cooking has come back. My fashion week collection this year was also a result of the same rejection. It was a return to a time when it wasnt all about plastic perfection.A while ago, a man wrote me a thank you letter. It felt so good to get a hand-written letter after years. At one time, I used to wait for the mailman. I would sit by the window with the hope that there would be something for me. The sound of his bell is imprinted on my memory. Now all he brings is bills.Thx U. That is what communication, over SMS and e-mail, has become. Creativity is getting lost on the Internet.There are lost, fragrant memories, too. Mothers oiling and braiding their daughters hair. A grandfathers story sessions. Where does that happen anymore? Now kids come home from school and have Cartoon Network to fall back on. After a while, they will switch over to the music channels, and listen to the latest rap songs. (Those, I fondly call rape songs.)We have much to take from the west, apart from fast food and fast cars. They live fast, they also have made sure they enjoy life. They have taken pains to preserve the past.While we live in flats and decorate them with plastic flowers, in the developed world, they are making an active effort to marry the old with the new. They save their heritage buildings. They sit by cobblestone streets in open coffee shops. They go to flea markets.The things we have, we destroy. The pujas used to be such a beautiful time. Now they are so commercial that I hate being in the city during those few days.We have forgotten that nothing is more powerful than the human hand. We have all become so dependent on machines that I have noticed that no one wants to buy my cotton saris just because they dont want to take the trouble to starch them.When I try to slow down, I find myself making better clothes. We I take it slow, I find that I have the chance to actually learn from what I am doing.Maybe my love for stillness comes from my childhood. I used to go to school in Chandernagore. There was a 40-minute boat ride down the river to take us to school. I could look out of the window and see trees, see the water.Everyone makes an effort to work hard and party harder. What about just having some time to ourselves?It is time for five-day working weeks, and hour-long soaks in a tub.

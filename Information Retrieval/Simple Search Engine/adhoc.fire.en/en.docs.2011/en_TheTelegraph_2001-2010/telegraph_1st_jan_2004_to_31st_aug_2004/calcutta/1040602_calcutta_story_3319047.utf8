 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Torture twist to murder on Maidan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ribs broken, kidneys damaged, liver burst, mouth stuffed with mud...																								The mystery of the Maidan murder took a fiendish turn on Tuesday with the post-mortem report of the woman strangled to death with her dupatta late on Sunday revealing a tale of torture. But the identity of the woman, in her mid-20s  as also that of the killer  remained under a shroud, with not a single missing person diary having been filed at any of the citys police stations.																								The post-mortem report on Tuesday  36 hours after the murder  revealed serious internal injuries in the upper portion of the victims body. It shows that the deceaseds ribs were broken, kidneys were damaged and the liver had burst, said investigating officer S. Sanyal.																								The brutality stunned the cops. The post-mortem report suggested that the woman had been struck with a blunt object. There was no external injury on her body, except the strangulation mark, said B. Bhattacharya, assistant commissioner (I) of south division. She was also gagged. The assassin stuffed mud into her mouth so that she could not cry out The nature of torture proves that this was a deliberate murder and it also reveals the killers heinous nature.																								Around 11 pm on Sunday, the body of the woman was discovered after Basudeb Sarkar, a security guard with the Metro Railway cooling station, was alerted by her screams from Eliot Park, a joint-venture beautification project of Calcutta Police and Tata Group, under construction opposite the SAIL building.																								Sujoy, amaar saathe tumi erokom korte paro na (Sujoy, you cant do this to me), Basudeb had heard the woman scream out soon after he spotted her and a man making their way into the narrow pathway off Chowringhee, and heading towards Eliot Park. That was around 10.30 pm.																								The torture, said police, could have been inflicted after the woman was strangled with her dupatta. It was only to make sure that she was dead, felt Bhattacharya.																								But there was no clue as to her identity. Surprisingly, there is no missing diary in any of the police stations across the city about this woman. It is still not known whether she was from the city or its adjoining areas, said Bhattacharya.																								Police on Tuesday printed several copies of the victims photograph and distributed it to all city police stations. We are trying our best to identify the woman. The photographs are being shown to the caretakers and residents of housing complexes in adjoining police station areas, explained Bhattacharya.																								Though the police are still struggling to find a motive behind the gruesome killing, they have prepared a list of possible reasons that might have led to the incident. The woman may have been blackmailing her boyfriend to try and force him to marry her. Or, the incident could be the fallout of a triangular love story. The assassin may have got involved with another woman, mused Bhattacharya.																								No one has contacted us about the identity of the woman, yet. If she is from outside Calcutta, it could take some more time, admitted the assistant commissioner.

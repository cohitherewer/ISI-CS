The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 California call for surreal script
Passing ThroughHe was born in Calcutta (we wont say how many springs ago). One traumatic journey on a bus with Konkona and her baby for company, helped RAHUL BOSE add value to the worldspace of cinema from Bengal (if not, strictly, Bengali cinema). After that, and a bag ful of critically acclaimed films, he is set to make an international splash of his own. We caught up with the Mumbai-based Bose this weekend, when he breezed through town for The Telegraph Calcutta Club Debate. Here are snatches from the chat, squeezed in between autograph requests from a gaggle of giggling girls (and a few of their mothers, too):The lure  hotel California: Living out of a suitcase from now on is what Aparna Sens Mr Iyer is determined to do. It would be socio-culturally dishonest to set my script in the third world, feels Bose.So he is LA-bound, story in hand, this June. Bose is meeting a few producers, to get the moolah for his movie. I have always wanted to work with a few actors, too, he reveals. If all works out well, he intends to shuttle back and forth. What Bollywood is missing: Bose wants to tell a tale about two people who never really meet, who never really touch, who never really talk. Yet, the characters find strange, fragile, surreal ways of communication. Most of the relationship is played out in their heads.Edgy song for an edgy man:He may want to check out of the desi industry for a while, but he can never leave, no matter how bright the shimmering Hollywood lights are.Bose is now a busy man, working on two films. White Noise, the shooting for which kept him up all night before his weekend trip here, is about two damaged people in the television industry who heal each other. Call it love, he shrugs, collaborating once more with Everybody Says Im Fine star Koel Puri. Its the era of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. Its the era of incredibly surreal and fake values.Could it be an obsession? Surreal, once again, is how he describes his second acting commitment, to start before he leaves for the US. Kafka-esque, is Here and Hereafter, being made by an LA-based filmmaker. Here, love is more about the unsaid. It lies between the spaces of what is said, says the actor-director, who is not sure who his co-star will be yet.Bose-speak on Calcutta:The city with the greatest force of humanity (though not necessarily the most human city, he clarifies) with a life force not seen anywhere in the world may bring him back soon, though hes more likely to be on the CC amp;FC rugby field than in front of the Tollywood studio camera. He has seen a few scripts from this neck of the woods, but nothing has quite caught the fancy of this off-beat actor.

 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Duster fling wounds boy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Debasish, after his injury was treated in hospital																								A student of Class IV of a Howrah primary school, Debasish Chakraborty, narrowly missed losing an eye on Monday when his teacher hurled a duster at him, which hit him on the face, leaving a gash less than an inch from his eye.																								According to Debasish, his only crime was to have rubbed out a part of the notes scribbled by his teacher, Deepankar Roy, on the blackboard of the classroom when Roy had stepped out briefly to go to the staff room of Shibpur B.K. Pal Institution.																								An FIR has been lodged against the teacher.																								 I only rubbed a part of the writing on the blackboard. When sir returned and asked who had done it, my friends named me. Then, sir threw the duster at me, said Debasish.																								The teacher then, apparently, took the bleeding boy to the staff room and rubbed ointment on the wound, but, surprisingly, his parents were not informed about the matter.																								It was only when I went to bring him back home that I learnt he had been hit by his teacher, said Debasishs father, Samar Chakraborty.																								According to Chakraborty, this was not the first time that Roy had, thus, punished his son in class.																								Two months ago, Roy had hurled the duster aiming to hurt my son, alleged Debasishs father. This time, my son would have gone blind if the duster had hit him in the eye God has saved him, he added.																								After the injured boy was taken to the police station, he was referred to Howrah District Hospital for necessary treatment. According to the doctors, the injury report would soon be forwarded to the police.																								On Tuesday, we will seek permission from the magistrate and a case will be started against the teacher, said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of police, Howrah.																								Chakraborty said shortly after the police complaint was lodged, three teachers of the school approached him and urged him to forgive the errant teacher.																								We will discuss the matter with the managing committee and find out what had actually happened with Debasish, said Ranjit Roy, a teacher in charge of the primary section of the school. What the managing committee will decide will be final, he added.																								I want my son to get justice and the teacher to be punished in order to set a precedent and stop teachers from harming a child like this, cried Chakraborty.

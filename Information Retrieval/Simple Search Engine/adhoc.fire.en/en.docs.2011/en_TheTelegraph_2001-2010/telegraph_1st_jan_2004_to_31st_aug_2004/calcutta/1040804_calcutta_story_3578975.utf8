 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Court prod for painting restoration
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 Rabindranath, by Abanindranath Tagore																								Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the Rabindra Bharati Society to ensure the security of the 5,000-plus paintings stored in its strongroom on the Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) campus.																								Recently, a special officer appointed by the high court had opened the strongroom and inspected nearly 200 paintings by Abanindranath and Jyotirindranath Tagore, most of which were damaged, some beyond restoration.																								Shocked at the condition of the paintings, Justice S.K. Mukherjee directed the authorities to take prompt steps to salvage the situation, as well as renovate the building in which they were housed. 																								Debris from a collapsing roof was one of the causes for the damage suffered by the paintings. The court also pulled up the Rabindra Bharati Society for letting out its premises, taken on rent from the RBU, for social programmes without leave of the court.																								The university authorities had complained to the judge that the society was letting out its premises to various social events, including marriages and musical nights. 																								The commercial ventures are destroying the secrecy as well as sanctity of the university. The condition of the old building is deteriorating owing to the societys attitude, said junior standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay. 																								Justice S.K. Mukherjee asked the university to take necessary steps to renovate the building. The expenses of renovating the historical building should be borne by the university, the judge said.																								A tussle between the RBU and the Rabindra Bharati Society came to the fore when the society told Calcutta High Court that university teachers and students were preventing removal of Tagore articles .

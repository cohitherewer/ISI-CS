Picture by Amit Datta What happens when you have the police on your side and decide to run a sex-parlour in the city? You thrive, unhindered.																								Days before Avtar Singh was arrested for running a sleaze bar, Calcutta Police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty stumbled upon a nexus that allowed a saloon-owner in Posta to run a sex parlour with tacit support from his force. 																								Chakraborty showcaused two senior officers, including one from the detective departments immoral traffic section, which is supposed to keep an eye on such activities across the city. The officers were asked to submit their replies in writing or face departmental proceedings.																								This is the first time in recent history that two officers were showcaused in one go for a racket that exposes the corruption in the force.																								The story dates back to mid-June, when commissioner Chakraborty received a complaint from Postas residents, alleging that a sex racket was flourishing in a hair-cutting saloon in Madho Kesto Sheikh Lane. The complainants said the owner, Md Sayeed, was using his contacts with the local police. 																								Chakraborty entrusted the case with the detective departments immoral traffic section. A team was sent and a group was arrested from the spot, much on the lines of Avtars case. The owner, however, managed to elude the net, said a senior officer. THE CATCH Sec. 292: Display of obscene books and leaflets
Sec. 3 of the IT Act: Punishment of running a brothel or allowing a premise to be used as a brothel
Sec. 4: Punishment for living off or earning from prostitution
Sec. 5: Obtaining girls/women for the sake of prostitution
Sec. 7: Prostitution in a public placeCuriously, all the arrested were charged under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code  a bailable offence that concerns display of obscene literature and leaflets. 																								Accused bailed out, the racket was revived. In August, Postas residents approached commissioner Chakraborty again for his intervention. 																								This time, the case was handed over to an allied section in the detective department. On August 6, a raid was carried out and 11 persons, including four girls and the saloon-owner, were arrested. 																								The raid revealed that the parlour had two entrances, from the north and the east, and the customers were handed a rate-list on entry. The charges: Rs 300, Rs 600 or even Rs 900 for a full-body massage on the mezzanine floor. 																								However, since such cases can be dealt with only by the immoral traffic police, the case was transferred to the officer-in-charge of that section, a senior officer said.																								This time too, the accused were charged under Section 292 and bailed out, much to the dismay of the police top brass. This, despite the officers being aware that the accused should have been booked under Sections 3,4 and 7 of the Immoral Traffic Act. While the 10 were allowed to go, the saloon-owner was arrested, this time in connection with another case. 																								Five days later, on August 11, the police chief slapped showcause notices on the officer-in-charge of Posta thana and the section-in-charge of the immoral traffic section.

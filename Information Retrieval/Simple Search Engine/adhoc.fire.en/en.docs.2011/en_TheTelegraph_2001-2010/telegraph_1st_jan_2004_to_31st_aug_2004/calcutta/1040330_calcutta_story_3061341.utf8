 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Admit card delay leads to suicide
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Spurred by the fear that he would not be allowed to sit for his Higher Secondary examination, beginning April 1, a Class XII student, Ashis Sardar, hanged himself from a ceiling fan at home in Sundarpara, in Howrahs Sankrail area.																								Preliminary investigation revealed that Ashis friends had misinformed him about his admit card not reaching his school. So, Ashis, a commerce student, thought he wouldnt be allowed to sit for the exam and went into depression, said an official. 																								Ashis father, Ajit, said his son was very mild-mannered and could not bear anxiety. Without verifying the words of his friends, he went and hanged himself, he lamented.																								Nemai Ghose, secretary of the school committee, said the admit cards of all examinees had reached the school. We were to deliver them by April 1, he added. 																								According to the police, Ashis, a student of Raghudevbati High School, was depressed for the past two days as he had not received his admit card. 																								The cards were to be distributed last Friday, but some were held back for technical reasons. Ashis was among them. 																								We recovered a suicide note from Ashis room, in which he wrote that he was taking his life because he had not received his admit card, said a Sankrail police official. 																								Ashis parents and neighbours said he was a studious boy and spent 16 to 18 hours a day preparing for his exams. 																								We never found him idling. He was forever with his books or dropping into his teachers houses for last-minute tips, they said.																								Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya said the boys body had been sent for post-mortem.

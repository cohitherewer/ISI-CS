 Fist of Fury: When aggression blocks progress path Shabnam Mausi has paved the way for third sex emancipation in Indias political scenario. As members of the third sex have no familial backpack, people believe that their susceptibility to corruption is lower than that of members of the other two sexes. With credibility of political parties hitting a low among the electorate, the mainstream parties are going all out to woo them (Gentlemans word on eunuch payoff, March 1).  One fails to understand the bizarre logic behind such a murky deal. If the eunuchs are poor, and the Howrah-based CPM leaders genuinely feel for them, they are at liberty to donate to them as much as they want out of their own pockets. Giving the extortion some sort of validity is no answer to avoid violence. The state machinery is maintained at tax-payers money to curb extortion and deal with violence. And they are not preachers of non-violence, authorised to give extortion a social standing.  And the leaders even lack the finesse to maintain political correctness. Remaining in power for nearly three decades has given them a feudal bent of mind, which discriminates against gender, and they bring it to bear on public life. Otherwise, why are parents of baby boys being asked to cough up twice the amount than what parents of girls are told to pay?  Such sympathies are utterly misplaced. Eunuchs are no better or worse than their procreative counterparts. Any sleeper-class traveller to north India-bound trains knows this to his or her peril. Will the Howrah MP make a rate card for them as well? Chameli Pal, 
Batanagar.The Citus cry for shutdown of the state machinery (Power seat in shutdown mode, Feb 25) is a self-destructive move which will reverse whatever little IT infrastructure development that the state has seen of late. While the Citu is convinced that a days general strike would not hinder IT progress, the government thinks otherwise. Doomsday looms large for the guardians of the proletariat in Bengal. Chandan Ray, 
Sarsuna.When the state government is spending crores to provide cars to its white-collar officials, why cant it manage to supply life-saving drugs in hospitals (Cash crunch dries up supply of key drugs, Feb. 25)? Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
Beleghata.It was heartening to learn that the arms of the Kali idol at Kalighat would be covered with sheets of gold (Gold gift for Kalighat idol, March 3). I would also request the temple management to stop animal sacrifices on the premises, given that people from all sections of society visit the revered place. Prahlad Agarwala, 
Majdia, Nadia. Nowadays, a tendency to take the extreme step has taken root among teenagers whenever they face an adverse situation in life (Suicide reply to fathers rebuke, Feb 27). Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
Behala.It is high time that we ponder why our children have become so touchy. Perhaps, the nuclear family set-up and the rat-race of life are to blame. Sujit De, 
Sodepur. I cant imagine the mental state of the helpless girl who saw her mother die in front of her eyes (Child in bus, mother run over, Feb. 26). Nor can I perceive how the driver managed to flee. Kunal Ray, 
Santragachhi.On March 25, Metro ran a little piece on punishing children and the accompanying picture was of a girl in LMG uniform. The picture was taken some months ago for an interview on counselling in schools. I gladly gave permission for that. That article was published and the picture along with it. The use of the same picture in this context (quite different from its original one) seems to indicate that we punish children at LMG. This is not only untrue but shows us in poor light. Hilda Peacock,
Principal, La Martiniere for GirlsMetro replies: The picture was used inadvertantly. There was no intention to hurt anyones sentiments. The address of Vivekananda Mission School was wrongly printed in Metro Guide. The correct information is furnished below: Vivekananda Mission School, Vivek Ville, Joka, Calcutta- 700104, Phone: 2467-1010

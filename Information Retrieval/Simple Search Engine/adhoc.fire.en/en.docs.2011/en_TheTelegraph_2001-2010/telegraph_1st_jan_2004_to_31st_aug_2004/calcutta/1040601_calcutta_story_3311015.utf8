 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Vegetable wholesalers off to truck terminal
 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								As part of its drive to keep the city pollution-free and clean, the state government has asked all wholesale merchants of fruit, vegetables and perishable goods to shift their businesses outside Calcutta. 																								Some of them have chosen to move to the Dhulagarh truck terminal in Howrah, about 20 km from the city. 																								The merchants associated with the West Bengal Fruits and Vegetables Cooperative Society Limited have already purchased about 150 cottahs to set up shop at the truck terminal, said cooperative general secretary Joyprakash Sau on Monday. All the wholesale merchants of perishable goods in Calcutta will have to shift their units in phases from the city.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is likely to inaugurate the terminal during the second week of June. The terminal is a joint-venture project of the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC)  a state government undertaking  and the Calcutta-Mumbai Truck Terminal Limited  the private partner of the state government.																								Sau said the cooperative has members in Posta market in Burrabazar, Mechhua, New Market and other city markets. 																								All our members are worried, as the state government has decided not to allow perishable goods markets in the heart of Calcutta. So, we have purchased a vast plot at the Dhulagarh truck terminal, where we can construct our establishments, Sau explained.																								WBTIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee said Rs 38 crore will be required to complete the terminal, which will accommodate 1,500 lorries. 																								Dhulagarh truck terminal is not only for lorries, but it will also be the main business centre for perishable goods, like fish, vegetables and fruits. All these items will be transported to different states from Dhulagarh, and city merchants will bring their products from there to different markets in Calcutta for sale, said Mukherjee.																								Arindam Sanyal, general manager (marketing) of the Calcutta-Mumbai Truck Terminal Limited, the private company engaged in construction of the terminal, said the entire terminal has come up on about 100 acres, and will accommodate not only lorries. Drivers can stay the night there, too.																								We have constructed a number of terminals in different parts of the country. In every terminal we have made, you will find a complete infrastructure, like accommodation for lorry drivers, police outposts and many other facilities, he said.																								There will be a bank, a post office, STD booths and cyber cafes and all modern communication facilities for those who will use the terminal. A small cinema, too, will be set up there.

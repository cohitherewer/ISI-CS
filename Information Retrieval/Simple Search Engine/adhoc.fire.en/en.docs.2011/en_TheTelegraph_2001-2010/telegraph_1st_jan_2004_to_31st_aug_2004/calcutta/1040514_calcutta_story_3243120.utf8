The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Roadshow amp; unity clinch mark epic win
 OUR BUREAU																								Dekhe ja re, Mamata, CPM-er khomota																								The triumphant taunt was heard much later, but the mood could be sensed the moment one turned right from VIP Main Road at the Joramandir crossing and took Rajarhat Main Road. 																								Red was the dominant colour of the day, even if one wasnt aware that only half-an-hour ago, a little bit of history had been made in Dum Dum.																								Past the growing array of red flags and posters, past smiling faces flashing the V from doorways, was a sea of red. Clearly, the heart of the action.																								And in its midst, in white dhoti and kurta, looking battle-weary but beaming, was the man of the moment  the CPM candidate from Dum Dum, Amitava Nandy, who was to trounce BJPs Tapan Sikdar by 105,000 votes. The open space in front of Arunodoy Sangha, in Bablatola, near Derozio College, was where Nandy and his trusted team (growing in number by the May minute) chose to camp, count and cheer.																								Slogans of Amitava Nandy zindabad filled the air as the scene turned into a Holi rerun, with enthusiasts smearing each other with red abir. Na, na, aagey certificate pai, was the indulgent protest from the man in the middle.																								How did it feel defeating sure-shot Sikdar? The answer was as predictable as his win was not: The way the people have supported me and the way my party workers (read: the Subhash Chakraborty and the Manas Mukherjee camps) have worked, its a victory for them.																								The celebrations grew louder and wilder as news of the Left lead rolled in.																								Later in the afternoon, another part of the constituency was rocking. Baranday, roddoor, ami aram kedarai boshey du paa nachai re, the popular Bhoomi number rang through Jessore Road near Patipukur as CPM supporters hit the streets, band baaja and all.																								Around 5.15 pm, the stage near the stadium was set for a show of unity  Nandy and Chakraborty in a clinch, sunburnt cheeks bathed in tears of triumph. 																								We have kept our word to Jyotibabu. He asked me to wrest the seat this time and we have done it, smiled Nandy.																								At the end of the day, that was what mattered most. Give me back Dum Dum (and Barasat), Jyoti Basu had told his party a few weeks ago. 																								On Thursday, the message from the party to the former chief minister was clear: the rift in the ranks in Dum Dum has been repaired. 																								On Thursday, the message from the people was loud: its party time in Dum Dum.

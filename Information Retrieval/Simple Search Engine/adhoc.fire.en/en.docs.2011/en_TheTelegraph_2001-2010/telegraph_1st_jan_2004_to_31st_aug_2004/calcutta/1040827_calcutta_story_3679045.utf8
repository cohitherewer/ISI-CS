The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Witness, a Japanese juggernaut The Japan jamboree
 															- Pre-World Cup qualifier drawing soccer fans by the droves to the city PRATIM D. GUPTA				 	 Coach Zico: Behind the Nippon invasion																								Team India floundered in Amsterdam. Team India flopped in Athens. And short of a miracle, Team India will end up second best at Yuba Bharati Krirangan (Salt Lake stadium) on September 8. But not before Calcutta plays host to a mini Japanese invasion.																								Fourteen hundred and counting The second leg of the pre-World Cup football qualifier between India and Japan will witness an army of Japanese fans touching down in town to cheer the 22-strong national squad, headed by coach Zico, the Brazilian legend. Adding to the Nippon numbers will be a media team of 60-plus.																								I think this is the biggest football event to happen in Calcutta, said Indian Football Association (IFA) honorary secretary Subrata Datta, adding that he had received firm requests for more than 800 tickets from Japanese soccer fans, with the number growing every day.																								Travel agencies in town confirmed that the collective ranks of the overseas visitors had swelled to almost double that number. The score-line read 7-0 in favour of Japan when the two teams last met in Saitama for the Asian Zone qualifiers of the World Cup 2006. But the second leg has evoked interest enough in skipper Bhaichung Bhutias base for it to be marketed as a major event to boost the Incredible India tourism campaign.																								Last year, in-bound tourists from Japan had jumped around 24 per cent from the previous year. We already have 200-plus bookings for the match, with many more coming through, said B.K. Pal of Travel Corporation of India.																								Tickets for the visitors have been priced at Rs 1,000 each, while those hollering for the hosts can pick their spot in the stadium for just Rs 20 or Rs 50. 																								For the premium they pay, Japanese fans, however, can expect special foam chairs, bottles of mineral water and a military band to keep them entertained.																								The entire block to the right of the VIP section of Salt Lake stadium, which can hold around 1,400 bucket seats, has been blocked for Japanese fans. If there are more coming in, we can take another 600 seats in the VIP central block, said IFA secretary Datta.																								Its still not clear where all the fans will put up once they arrive in Calcutta on September 6 and 7, but the Japanese football squad and some of the media people have booked their rooms at the Hyatt Regency.																								The hotel  located inside the stadium campus and where the East Bengal team camps to gear up for out-of-town tourneys  should be the hub of all Cup activity from September 1.																								If one full floor is being taken up by the visitors, a specially-appointed media centre is being put in place to host press conferences every day.																								Considering the stature of pre-World Cup football, we consider being hosts for the event a matter of great privilege and prestige, said Praveen Chawla, general manager of Hyatt Regency. Our involvement with this event matches our tradition of being strong supporters of football at all levels, he added.

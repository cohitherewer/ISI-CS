The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Master of edible art amp; stagecraft
		 Rajesh Gupta By profession, he is a confectioner  and restaurateur. Or, if you want the desi version,  a halwai and also chief bawarchi of my restaurant.  But, the 34-year-old CEO of Gupta Brothers, The Abarkhabo  Shoppe, does much more than baking my own bread and churning  milk to make my butter.																								Rajesh, who wants to be remembered as a good human being above anything else, is a man of many parts. And arts. From digital photography and painting to poetry, theatre and telefilms to designing food brochures and publicity material  he treads myriad avenues with the same degree of passion.																								But it all started with food  edible art to him, and a powerful vehicle to get into peoples hearts. I remember my elder brother raving about grandmas coconut laddoos. I also remember the taste of the parathas my mother used to pack into my small tiffin-box. But, while the city knows him as the man behind the Gupta Brothers success saga, Rajeshs informed truck with other callings is as engaging.																								Theatre had always fired his imagination and he started his stage carrier while in college with Usha Gangulis Rangakarmee. Lokkatha, his first Hindi play, written by Ratnakar Matkari and directed by Ganguli, won the best production award of West Bengal in 86-87. Mahesh Elkunchwars Holi, also directed by Ganguli, won the Shiromani Purashkar for 1990-91, a major milestone for me.																								From Safdar Hashmis Apaharan Bhaichare Ka to Ashok Singhs hugely successful Khabsoorat Bahu, Rajesh has taken the stage for a string of critically acclaimed productions. Nothing excites me more than the challenge of different roles. And to take that challenge a step further, he has been dabbling in small-screen parts of late, working in Hindi serials for Doordarshan and telefilms for ETV Bangla. I was fortunate to work with Amrish Puri in the childrens film Sixer. But he is still waiting for a good break.																								His perennial passion for photography got a sharp focus when I bought my first digital camera  a Sony Mavica FD 90  in 1999. I started clicking everything and it has given a new dimension to my creativity, feels Rajesh whose favourite photographers are Raghu Rai and Ansel Adams.																								So what does 2004 have in store for him? I want to exhibit my digital paintings and photographs, and get my poetry book published, says the avid reader who has made Paulo Coelhos The Alchemist his best friend. Also on agenda 2004 is completing the degree in law, getting into the National School of Drama and to smoke a cigarette properly in front of the camera, even when I am paid for it.

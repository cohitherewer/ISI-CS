 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Bypass water park in joint venture 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government has decided to build a water park in the city in a joint venture.																								We have earmarked 26 acres on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital, for the park. Many private companies with experience in the field have evinced interest in the project. A final decision will be taken within a month, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Thursday.																								Officials of his department said the water park, the first of its kind in the state, will have arrangements for water sports, a floating restaurant, boating and a modern swimming pool. This apart, there will be green landscapes, a cultural complex, a musical fountain, a childrens corner, jogging tracks and rose gardens. An underwater aquarium can be reached through a tunnel.																								Minister Bhattacharya said a four-member committee had been formed, chaired by urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar, to hold discussions with the private parties and arrive at a final decision on the matter.																								Rajendrakumar said a large number of reputed companies had responded to the governments tender. Eight of them have been shortlisted.																								These firms have been asked to submit their plans, along with financial involvement, within a month. The project will be a joint venture, with the private party bearing the entire investment. The government will provide the land and other support and the income will be shared between the private party and government at a negotiable proportion, the minister said.																								The water park is the governments initiative to balance the growing construction activities on either side of the Bypass. Going by the number of housing estates, commercial complexes and fair grounds coming up, officials fear that within a year or two, the belt will turn into a concrete jungle. 																								The minister said many government departments and private companies wanted the particular plot earmarked for the water park for their projects, but he had not allowed it to be allotted to them because it is the single largest chunk of land in the region at the moment.																								The CMDA was also planing to develop some wetlands located in the area in a planned way so that people could use the place as a picnic spot.

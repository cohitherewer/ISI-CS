 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Patients rob doctors fees
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Dacoits struck at a doctors chamber at Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Thursday night. Four armed men, in the guise of patients, entered the clinic, in an annexe of his residence, and walked away with thousands of rupees in cash. They faced no resistance. 																								The doctor, Sunil Baran Pal, former medical superintendent and vice-principal of Dr BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in Beleghata, was attending to patients at the time. There were, however, no injuries.																								Son Sourabh was with Pal but the miscreants warned him not to raise an alarm. The doctor got involved in an argument with the dacoits. 																								His wife, who heard the altercation, came down to the chamber to find out what the exchange of words was about. The dacoits warned her not to shout for help.																								The doctor handed over the keys. It took the gang half an hour to empty the drawer and walk out.

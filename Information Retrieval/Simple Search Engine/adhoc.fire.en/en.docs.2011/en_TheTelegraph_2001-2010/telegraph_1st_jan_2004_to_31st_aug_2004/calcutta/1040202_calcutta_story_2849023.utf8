The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, February 02, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Farrah Fawcett, actress.  You have a strong humanitarian streak in you. You can  read people instinctively and give them excellent advice.  You have the capacity to keep a secret and help others overcome  their distress. In spite of your wide contacts, you suffer  a feeling of loneliness. Your colours are white, cream and  blue.  Kusum Bhandari

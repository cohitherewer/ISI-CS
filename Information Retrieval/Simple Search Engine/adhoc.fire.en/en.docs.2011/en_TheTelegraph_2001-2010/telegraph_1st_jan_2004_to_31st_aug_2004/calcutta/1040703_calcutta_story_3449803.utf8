Pictures by Rashbehari Das 												 Hawaii is quite a hit with city hotels this season. After HHIs Hawaiian festival about a month ago at Polo Club, now its the turn of Stadel to take Calcuttans on a trip to the beach destination  with dollops of willing suspension of disbelief, of course.																					Heka, the theme bar at the Salt Lake stadium hotel, is hosting a 10-day Hawaiian festival that ends on July 5.																					The main attraction of the festival is an array of Hawaiian cocktails and mocktails whipped up by celebrity bartender Irfan.																					The mocktails include Hawaiian Lagoon (a virgin mix of Blue Curacao, pineapple and lemonade) and Strawberry Waves (strawberry, lemon juice and lemonade). The cocktail section is more varied with names like Deep Sea (a minty cooler of rum, crme de menthe and Sprite), Sea Breeze (a shake of rum, Blue Curacao, black currant and litchi), Mango Mojito (rum with mixed fresh mango and mint leaves), Crazy Coconut (Pina Colada served in a coconut shell) and Hawaiian Fling (rum, lemon chunks, strawberry and watermelon).																					The food, too, is based on the same theme and the delicacies include Tropican Chicken Steak, Hawaiian Seafood Platter and Exotic Baked Fish in the non-veg category. For the veggies, there is Hawaiian Veg Steak, Cottage Cheese and Pineapple Rings in Green Island Sauce and Hawaiian Crepes Topped with Devil Sauce.																					There is also a live Hawaiian Pillaf Counter where one can get to taste this traditional Hawaiian delicacy made from a special kind of rice, shrimps and pineapple. The counter offers a host of mouth-watering salads like Hawaiian Coleslaw Salad, Cheese Cherry and Pineapple Stick in Watermelon Shell and Smoked Chicken Salad Ala Hawaiian.																					The gastronomic experience is accompanied by some jazzy Hawaiian music, belted out by Francis and Chenelle, along with in-house DJ Amit.																					The dcor of the bar strives to capture the essence of a Hawaii holiday. Coconut trees, waves, colourful flowers and green coconuts adorn the interiors, while the waiters are attired in bright Hawaiian shirts and straw hats. The bar counter, too, resembles a thatched beach hut.																					So, say hello Hawaii in Salt Lake! Model Moon gets an ayurvedic massage at June Tomkyns. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Kerala call																					 June Tomkyns, one of the most popular names when it comes to beauty and hair solutions in the city, now has a whole new experience to offer its customers.

The section, set up in association with Herbalplan Ayurvedic Centre, offers therapeutic as well as purification treatments, which apart from revitalising and de-stressing the body, also promise to help cure various diseases.																					Kerala massages concentrate on the mind, body and soul, all together. They work on certain philosophies and thats what makes them different from other massages, says G. Ghosh, consultant at the centre.																					He adds: Here, we will offer all traditional massages of Kerala like abhyangam, elakkizhi, navarakkizhi, pizhichil, udvarthanam (the only massage done with powder), tharpanam, sirovasthy and the most popular one called dhara, where a steady stream of oil or other liquids like milk and buttermilk is poured on the patients forehead from an earthen pot.

Most of these treatments come in packages, spread over seven to 14 days, and the price tag reads Rs 3,000 and above. The individual massages cost upwards of Rs 250.																					Ghosh explains that in all the treatments, first the body is cleansed through massages and only then is the medication started. The massages are done with oils, leaf bags and a special rice called navara which is available only in the Palakad district of Kerala. All oils, medicines and other ingredients at this new section of June Tomkyns are sourced from Kerala, assures Ghosh.																																														Image maker																					 If you have always wanted to get your face captured on canvas, heres an opportunity that brings you pretty close to your dream. 																					es, the gift shop on Park Street, has introduced a Sketch Express Machine that allows you to get a sketch or a caricature of yourself done within a couple of minutes. And not just any sketch, but in the styles of one of the four masters  Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Leonardo or Raphael.																					l you have to do is stand in front of the machine and let yourself be photographed by it and then indicate your artist preference. Your portrait will be sketched immediately and you will get a black-and-white print in two minutes. 																					If you are opting for the Rembrandt style, you get a dark charcoal look, with the Michelangelo style you get the pen-and-ink effect, while Raphael and Leonardo gives you pencil strokes. 																					There are also options for caricatures and you can choose a grumpy face, a smiling one, etc. You can also check out the after effects of a nose or chin job. 																					The portrait doesnt dig a hole in your pocket. You just have to dish out Rs 100 for a print. If you want to have it framed, that will also be done immediately, for an extra cost of course.																					The machine, the first of its kind in Calcutta, has been imported from the US and a portion of the cost of every print is contributed to the respective artists fund to use their styles. The machine is also let out for parties if you wish to entertain guests with this facility. Stylist Sabina Yah gives the hair extension treatment to a customer. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Hair and now																					Turning heads at a party has never been easier. A good head gear can do the trick, in minutes. Indeed, the latest concept in hair colouring allows you the luxury to add an electric blue or a shocking pink streak for the night and take it off the following morning when you are headed for the board meeting. 																					The Prolin Hair Enhancer, as the process is called, is already a rage among the youth brigade of the city. 																					Made from nylon, these artificial strands can be attached to the hair to give either volume or length or simply style to the tresses. 																					After a certain age, hair does not grow easily, then we can attach these extensions to the end of the original hair to give it a longer look, says Sabina Yah of Sunflower, the only beauty parlour in the city offering this facility. Also those with very thin hair can have their Rapunzel look now by adding just a few extensions, without the risk of anyone knowing the fake from the real. 																					The extensions do not have chemicals in them and can be oiled, washed, blow-dried and styled like natural hair. In fact, unlike hair colour, these extensions never lose colour. However, ironing the hair with the extensions on is a strict no-no, warns Sabina. 																					One can choose from a range of 24 natural and 16 fashion colours at the Russel Street style stop. In fact, the fashion colours range from electric blue to vibrant orange to shocking pink. Its all about turning a few heads wherever you go, suggests Sabina. One streak of the colourful extension could leave you Rs 250 poorer. 																					Once youve had your fill of the fiery flash, you can actually take it off without hurting your hair. You can keep the extension for future use too, says Sabina.

																																																																																		The city police, on Friday, arrested two persons, Salem and Ajmal, who had allegedly murdered their associate Abdul Mian in Chitpur two years ago. The two had been picked up from Dasnagar in Howrah in the first week of January. But the police had no idea about their involvement in the Mian murder as the duo gave false names. During investigation, their real identities came to light. According to officials of the detective departments homicide wing, Salem and Ajmal, along with two others in a Tata Sumo, had raided a hideout on Gopal Mukherjee Road in Chitpur and shot Mian. They picked up the body while fleeing and later dumped it by the Durgapur Expressway near Dadpur in Hooghly.																																																		A rumour spread across the city when the police headquarters at Lalbazar was informed that Anwar Ali Mollah, a rape case accused, had managed to give the cops the slip from Calcutta High Court on Friday afternoon. All police stations were alerted and instructed to conduct an extensive search. But later, police came to know that Ali had appeared before the court with an anticipatory bail plea. As soon as he reached the court, police started keeping a close watch on him. But after the bail plea was heard and rejected, Ali was nowhere to be found. There is no question of his escaping as we have not arrested him yet. The policemen on duty must have relayed a wrong message, said an official at Lalbazar.																																																		A delegation from Tuscany, including the minister for industry and handicraft Ambrogio Brenna, visited the Calcutta Leather Complex on Friday. Director of industries Moloy Dey and officials of ML Dalmiya and Company showed them around the complex.

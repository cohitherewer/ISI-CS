 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Dacoits held in Giridih village
 A STAFF REPORTER																								City sleuths arrested four men involved in a number of dacoities in the Burrabazar-Posta area from remote corners of Giridih, in Jharkhand. 																								A five-member police team arrived with the dacoits in the city on Wednesday. 																								Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department) identified the four arrested men as Vinod Turi, Anandi Das, Baleshwar Das and Doman Rai. The four had made off with Rs 16 lakh from Aravali Commercial Services, in Burrabazars Manohardas Katra, on April 22. 																								Before carrying out the dacoity, they stayed in the city for a month. During this period, they started a business of supplying food to various offices and shops in the Burrabazar area to keep an eye on the offices, Pandey said.																								An employee had tipped off the dacoits about the booty. They entered the office with firearms and bhojalis, injured two employees, forced open the lockers in which the money was kept and escaped with the cash. It was all over in less than five minutes.																								We had arrested Amit, a cell phone thief, in Calcutta some time ago. While interrogating him, we came to know the names of a few gang members that operated in the Burrabazar-Posta belt, the deputy commissioner said. 																								Further arrests were carried out and, subsequently, we came to know the names of the criminals from Bihar and Jharkhand operating in the city. We hope to nab the rest soon, he added.																								A five-man team of detectives left for Jharkhand a week ago. In Giridih, the sleuths requested a company of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to accompany them during the raids. 																								The team had to walk more than 18 km to reach Charki village, in the Gawan area of Jharkhand, to nab gangleader Vinod. His accomplices were rounded up in neighbouring Jamui, Pandey said.																								Sleuths are on the look-out for three other members of the same gang.

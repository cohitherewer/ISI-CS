Strike a PoseMODEL AND GROOMING EXPERT NAYANIKA CHATTERJEE SINGH SHARES HER RECIPE FOR SUCCESS ON THE RAMP The key requirement for being able to carry yourself on the ramp is the power of projection. Attitude and personality are the most important tools. To show off the clothes, power of presentation is crucial. The secret is to be unselfconscious. Walking the ramp is not an easy job because the feeling that all eyes are on you can be quite unnerving. The trick is to look through people. Keep your confidence high and feel privileged to be on stage with so many people watching you. You dont need a beautiful face. Great eyes or lips wont help because they can hardly be seen on the ramp. For media modelling, on the other hand, one should have a photogenic face. But there too, being able to project through your eyes and expressions is more important than having a pretty face. For the ramp, you must have a great body. Ideally, one should be 58 or above, but in India shorter girls make it, too. Generally, below 57 is not permissible. A slim and well-toned body is absolutely essential. Having clear and good skin is important. You might have brilliant features, but bad skin will mar all that. On the other hand, flawless complexion helps carry off even ordinary features. Good skin has to come from within, so you must drink lots of water. Cleansing the skin regularly is necessary even for people who have a natural glow. Those prone to pimples or acne should cut out oily foods and chocolates. Its essential to maintain yourself. Some people are lucky and have naturally slim figures. But if not, draw up a regular workout routine and diet. Crash diets are a strict no-no. For aspiring models, the first step is to have a good portfolio. Go for reputed photographers even if it costs more. Dont wear elaborate clothes while shooting, concentrate on your face. Practise by posing in front of the mirror to find your best angles. Distribute the snaps among agencies, model co-ordinators, photographers, designers, choreographers, and other people related to the industry. To be a ramp model, master a bit of catwalking before your start. Wear very high heels and practise walking in a straight line at home. A grooming school might help. When I started out, I had to learn through trial and error. But it really helps to have professionals telling you what to do and what not  teaching you the right ways to do make-up, training you for the catwalk, instructing you on your diet and drawing up a workout routine. Finally, in this industry, you have to be patient  success doesnt come overnight. You should also not try beyond a certain point. Since luck plays a huge part, stick around for six months to a year. If things dont shape up by then, consider other professions. Even if you are successful, have an option to fall back on, since the industry career span is not more than 10 to 14 years.

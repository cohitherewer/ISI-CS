 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Class X pass rate masks CBSE smiles 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The euphoria in Calcutta on Wednesday over the remarkable results in the Class XII Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examinations was blotted out on Friday, with the announcement of the CBSE Class X results. They showed Bengal trailing behind states like Orissa, Bihar and even Jharkhand.																								The position of the schools in Calcutta and elsewhere in the districts is far behind the Chennai region, covering the southern states, said Joseph Emanuel, assistant secretary of the board in-charge of the CBSE schools located in Calcutta. He spoke to Metro over the telephone from Allahabad on Friday afternoon.																								The official, however, said the 115 CBSE schools, almost all of which are located in Calcutta and the peripheral districts, are ahead of Delhi. 																								Calcutta is also marginally ahead of some other states like Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. 																								The overall pass percentage of the 115 schools of the Calcutta region is 78.48 per cent, against 85.3 per cent in Orissa. Bihar and Jharkhand have recorded the same success rate  81 per cent. 																								The highlights of the Class X CBSE results, however, brought glad tidings for the citys girl students. 																								In keeping with the trend at the national level, girls have fared better than boys in Calcutta. While the success rate of girls in Calcutta is 79.01 per cent, it is 78.12 per cent in the boys case. 																								Though the results did not show Calcutta in a good light, the authorities of a few top CBSE institutions in the city claimed a hundred per cent success rate.																								Mukta Nain, principal, Birla High School for Boys, said all the 208 candidates who had appeared from her institution have passed. The highest percentage recorded in her school is 93. 																								In Birla High School for Girls, too, all the 41 examinees have cleared the exams. The highest percentage recorded in this school is 91.2.																								Officials at Lakshmipat Singhania said the highest average recorded in their school is nearly 92 per cent. 																								Rita Chatterjee, principal, Apeejay School, regretted that the highest average marks recorded in her school in this years Class X exam is approximately 91 per cent, four per cent less than last year.																								Only two Kendriya Vidyalayas  one at Command Hospital and the other at Garden Reach  have recorded a hundred per cent success, J.N. Raut, education officer of the Kendriya Vidyalayas in Calcutta, said. Three other Kendriya Vidyalayas in the districts, too, have recorded a hundred per cent success.

 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 New Indian emis-sari 
Face of Fashion Kiran Uttam GhoshDuring her recent trips promoting her summer collection in Dubai, Kuwait, Jeddah, Hong Kong and London, Kiran Uttam Ghosh was amazed at the number of requests that came her way for the sari. That set her thinking...																								Strikes me, Draupadi and Anna Kournikova have something in common. The sari. When Kournikova hit an ace off-court for the Sahara Parivar, the great Indian yardage spanned centuries, continents and value systems. No two women further apart could have found a common link.The 22-year-old poor little rich loser on court who is once said to have quipped, My shorts arent shorter than anyones, its only that my legs are longer, found the sari flattering enough to those long limbs to carry home 20 saris she was given as gifts during her whirlwind promo tour last November. That makes the sari one of the worlds most successful sartorial emis-saris.																								The British, who loved our curries before our saris, are now on to power dressing with panache. Whoever said the sari was cumbersome, and thought of the Zandra Rhodes debacle, should check out Cherie Blair in a Bubs Mahil version of the five-and-a-half-metres. Modern British women have shed colonial prejudice and wear what they believe is flattering. They certainly dont skirt the issue of inspired dressing!																								Worn for more than five thousand years, the sari has not just withstood the test of time, its graduated with distinction. It has evolved in style, in fabric, and is as personal as perfume. What never ceases to amaze me about this one drape is its timelessness. And Im not talking of the seedha palla-ulta palla variation, neither the nine yards nor Shaina NC s efforts in various ways of sari draping. I think of it as a canvas with each of us our own artist. 																								And yet the sari has changed, when I wear it today I do so by choice, not social compulsion. Though it takes me much courage to wear a sari for an event, knowing that probably nobody else will. I do so, because it feels right today, its versatile, traditional, modern, it embodies glamour in a spontaneous, chic way that seems very different from todays contrived images. Honestly, the one thing that really looks fresh and appealing to me now is an elegant woman in a sari.I grew up following the thumb-rule  you avoid sitting down in a sari and you dont wrinkle it. Experience has taught me otherwise. Ive seen some of our most elegant women take their siesta in a woven cream cotton sari and still looking fresh at the end of the day.																								Little wonder then that two recent books on the sari, The Sari Shop by Rupa Bajwa and The Sari by Kavita Singh, have virtually sold out in city bookstores.																								The sari could also make a political statement. Indira Gandhi made it politically neces-sari, just as daughter-in-law Sonia does with her starched handlooms. Brinda Karat spends less starch on hers perhaps to spare some for the proletariat, and the result is a carefully careless look, while other ethnicwalas include Jaya Jaitley. Maneka Gandhis less starched no frills look seems to represent her austere philosophy in life. Then theres Maharani Gayatri Devi, who introduced us to the romance of the chiffon sari.																								In Bollywood the sari has found more interesting emis-saris. Rekha made sure no one can match her in clothes-horsing the Kanjeevaram while Ashs Devdas saris and cholis have become a fashion cult through the world. Sush Sens seductive Mumtaz style in Main Hoon Na was the highlight of the movie. We can credit Shilpa Shetty with creating the jaw-drop sexy, low slung silhouette that works wonders on elongating the female form. So, the way one wears a sari, whether you tie it above or below the navel, tells us who you are, what you consider fit to hide or reveal.																								As we continue to wrap, throw, pleat, tuck and drape a piece of yardage into a garment, I think its time to raise a toast to the sari. Its male counterpart, the dhoti, sadly is as rare as a plait on a Chinaman. At a time when classic has become boring the sari comes across as conventional chic.																								For those of us whove given it the miss, the writing is on the wall: sari, but the ultimate Indian garment is here to stay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Prized grande dame of the garden Ganesha in the garden
 															- AWARDS won versus armed forces A STAFF REPORTER				 	 GREEN QUEEN: Alka Bangur tends to the prize-winning flora in her Hastings garden. Picture by Pabitra Das																								She takes on the might of the Indian Army and the Navy every year, but winning the war of the roses has become a habit with her. Alka Bangur, surrounded by her armoury of roses and dahlias, manicured lawns and stylised creepers, is the undisputed garden grand slam queen of Calcutta. But now, shes ready to abdicate the throne that has been hers for a decade and more.																								Beating back what insiders term a surprisingly serious challenge from Fort William this time, Bangur has been adjudged winner of this years best garden awards  under heads like general design, quantity and quality of bloom and cleanliness  at the Garden Competition organised by the Agri-Horticultural Society of India.																								Bangur, who entered her green haven in Hastings under the name of son Yogesh, beat 20 contestants  from the army and the navy, to the railways and the corporates  to bag the BK Birla Challenge Cup for best gardens and the brand new Honda Cup for best lawns. She will receive the prizes on Sunday.																								But being at the top could be a good place to quit. Though my family members and the malis who help me maintain the garden want me to compete, I dont want to take part in the competition from next year, declares the vice-president of Agri-Horticultural Society, for whom the Calcutta competition is a no-contest.																								There is no national-level competition on gardening and I want to organise one where the judges will go around the country to select the best garden, says Bangur, meandering with a method up the 7 St Georges Road greens garden path.																								The garden  an integral part of the three-acre Bangur campus  revolves around a theme, with Ganesha surrounded by 12 varieties of roses, standing tall once the iron doors open up.																								Dotted with fountains and idols of Krishna and Garuda, three kitchen gardens, birds nests, an orchid house and a swimming pool, the sprawling lawns showcase the most exquisite varieties of palms, creepers, flowers and bonsai.																								How much time do you give to your child? I even work till late at night in the garden, smiles Bangur, who collects rare varieties of plants from all over the world and links her love for nature to her childhood days in Varsi, a village near Sholapur, in Maharashtra.																								Though she doesnt have any formal degree in the subject, friends, corporates and even government institutions consult her for tips on gardening.																								But maintaining the garden  that is visited even by botany students  and winning prizes year after year is easier said than done. From designing the layout to collecting the plants and maintaining the cleanliness and selecting flower pots, I am involved in every aspect of the garden, announces Bangur, who is also on the board of a number of companies owned by industrialist husband L.N. Bangur.

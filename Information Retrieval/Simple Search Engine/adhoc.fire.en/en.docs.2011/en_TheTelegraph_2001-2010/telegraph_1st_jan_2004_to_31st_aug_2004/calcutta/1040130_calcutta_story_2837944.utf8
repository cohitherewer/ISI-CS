 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Of temporal hues
																								Temporal is a very robust and earthy word that carries with it the connotation of worldly affairs, secular in nature, as opposed to spiritual ones. Four talented artists  Ashok Kumar Dey, Rajiv Deyashi, Pinaki Acharyya and Anindya Jashu  are very sensitive urban youths who witness and express contemporary times. They use bright colours, often juxtaposing them with deep, dark sombre tones. The artists have their individual styles and react in their unique ways to situations and ordeals of people living on the fringes of society in a manner that brings them closer cerebrally. Their canvases tell stories of triumphs and defeats of the subjects portrayed and, in the process, the paintings become symbolical of the agony and ecstasy of the human spirit. The works capture viewers attention for their originality.																								When: Till January 31; 10 am - 8 pm 																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery, Queens Mansion, 12 F Park Street

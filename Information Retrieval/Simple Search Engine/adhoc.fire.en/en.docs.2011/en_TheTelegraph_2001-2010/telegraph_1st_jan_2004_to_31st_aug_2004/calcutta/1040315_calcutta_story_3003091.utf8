The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 15, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Ila Arun. You have a sharp memory and are artistically inclined. You appear amiable, but tend to bottle up your emotions. A tremendous sense of self-esteem drives you. Your beliefs and principles are dear to you. Take care on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays.  Kusum Bhandari

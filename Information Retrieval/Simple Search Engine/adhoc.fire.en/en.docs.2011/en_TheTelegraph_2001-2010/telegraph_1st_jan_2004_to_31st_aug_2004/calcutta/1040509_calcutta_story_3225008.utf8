 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Book ban case rerun for govt
 OUR BUREAU																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is being drawn into a fresh legal battle over the issuance of notifications banning Taslima Nasreens autobiographical work Dwikhandito. 																								After being forced on the backfoot over its last ban order, the state has been challenged for slapping the fresh ban while the election process is underway. The charge is of flouting the model code of conduct.																								The state was compelled to issue the fresh notification  on April 30, 2004  due to technical reasons after being challenged by Sujato Bhadra, who had moved Calcutta High Court demanding its withdrawal.																								On the basis of Bhadras plea, Chief Justice A.K. Mathur had set up a special bench to hear the case. Counsel on behalf of the petitioner, Jaymalya Bagchi, had argued that the government had banned the book under Section 153 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which is applicable only in case of a possibility of disharmony due to clashes between two communities. Advocate-general Balai Roy then announced that his government had decided to withdraw its earlier ban order and would issue a fresh order.																								The fresh notification, based on IPC Section 295, charged the book with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of Muslims in India and insult or attempt to insult religion and religious beliefs																								Bagchi on Saturday said that his client would move court afresh challenging the validity of the notification since the election process is on and the government is not in a position to issue a notification or order that may oblige a particular community.																								A senior official of the state home department on Saturday, however, claimed that the notification was nothing new as the ban was already on. Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee refused to comment on the matter.Medical body chief: After 16 years, an Indian Medical Association functionary from Calcutta, Sudipto Roy, was chosen as the all-India president of the IMA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 13, 2004 All wide shut 
make Calcutta better - Metro Rail countersTwo minutes to go for the 10.32 am Metro from Rabindra Sarobar as you rush down the stairs. Doable? Of course.Not so fast, for the counter meant to provide a swift passage to the train invariably ends up doing just the opposite. Closed  rather than open  is the operative word when it comes to ticket counters underground.So, serpentine queues at peak hours in front of the precious few open counters slow down passenger passage to a crawl, causing those at the end of the line to miss the next train.S.K. Basu, a Metro spokesperson, all but dismissed talk of the windows being wide shut. The most plausible reason for some counters remaining closed is shortage of staff. It might happen that the person manning a counter hasnt turned up. Otherwise, I dont see any reason for the ticket counters to remain closed.We also learnt that the operational affairs department handling ticket counters cannot address the problem unless they get specific complaints about a particular date and time when the counter was closed.The complaint, dear Metro officials, is about any day, any time, any station. Can we please open up?

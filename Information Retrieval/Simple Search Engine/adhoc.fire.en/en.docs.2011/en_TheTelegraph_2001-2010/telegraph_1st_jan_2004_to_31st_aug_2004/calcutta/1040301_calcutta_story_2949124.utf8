 Monday, March 01, 2004  Talking Tagore CONTRIBUTED BY SOMA GHOSH, JANINE WYNNE-PETERS AND KAUSHIK GHOSH
					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee, Rita Bhimani, Chandreyee Ghosh, Sudipa Basu, Parambrata Chatterjee, Bijoylakshmi Burman, Suchanda Ghosh and Pramita Mallick (left to right) at The Bards Muse at Caf Coffee Day 															Caf Coffee Day believes that a lot can happen over coffee. And, in keeping with this, the caf recently played host to The Bards Muse  a performance comprising monologue plays and recitals to pay tribute to Rabindranath Tagore.																					Tagores works have a universal appeal and in his writings, he has underlined certain issues ahead of his times. To his women characters, he has imparted both beauty and brains. Discussing the universality of Tagores works at the event were public relations consultant Rita Bhimani, veteran stage actress Bijoylakshmi Burman, Rabindrasangeet exponents Pramita Mallick (who has also transcreated Tagores music in English) and Suchanda Ghosh, television actresses Sudipa Basu and Chandreyee Ghosh, stage and television actor Sudip Mukherjee and actor-musician Parambrata Chatterjee as well as Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee, who scripted the entire show. 																					To begin with, Rita Bhimani and Sujoy cited excerpts from Tagores works to indicate that his internationalism wasnt planned. The poet tried to understand the character of every person, Indian or otherwise and believed that, underlying every human being was a unity that was spiritual in nature. Suchanda Ghoshs rendition of Durey Kothay Durey Durey was an attempt at self-discovery. While Sudip embarked on a discovery of Tagores roots, the great prose epic Gora was discussed briefly. Gora is a story of self-discovery, a blend of ancient spiritual values and Western values, a resolution of inner conflict. Pramita Mallick broke into full throated ease with her recital of Sharthok Jonom Amar at this point. Chandreyee read excerpts from Tagores novels with particular emphasis on the character of Mrinal in Streer Patra to prove that Tagores heroines were self-assertive. What emerged at the end of her performance was that harsh words are the consolation of the weak. Kobe tumi aashbe bole by Suchanda Ghosh seemed an apt song for the extract. Sudipa Basu delineated the characters of Sohini and Nandakishore from Laboratory, Tagores last short story even as Pramita Mallick sang Kaar Milon Chao. Parambrata also made an impression on the audience with his reading and impromptu rendition of Tagores Aapnake Ei Jaana Aamar Furabe Na.																					Spotted at the show, which was conceived by Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee, were the US consul general in Calcutta, George Sibley and wife Lee Alison, author Bani Basu and actress Debolina Dutta among others.

Biplaw, who last year won the prestigious Presidents Cup from CSM, now wants to be a professional guitarist.

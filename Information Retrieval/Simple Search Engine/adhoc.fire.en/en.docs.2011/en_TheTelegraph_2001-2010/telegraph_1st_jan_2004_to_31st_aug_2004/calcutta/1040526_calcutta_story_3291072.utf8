	Pavements in many localities, from Salt Lake to Jodhpur Park, are blocked by private gardens. House-owners barricade the pavement in front of their house for the purpose. This forces pedestrians to walk on the carriageway in place of the pavement. As cars often speed through these lanes which are less crowded, residents might meet with accidents even during morning walks and strolls in the evening. No steps are ever taken against these errant house-owners. After all, they are no less guilty of encroachment than hawkers or pavement-dwellers. 
	Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake 
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is fixing slabs on the footpath along Theatre Road and its adjoining lanes. This is sheer waste of public money as the existing footpaths were good enough. Many bigger projects are in dire need of investment. Will the mayor be more pragmatic and stop his unreasonable expenditures from now on? 
	T.R. Anand, Budge Budge

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 15, 2004  Here comes the bride Models dressed in  bridal finery show off the latest make-up and hairstyle  trends at Habibs Pix by Rashbehari Das				 							 				With the wedding season in full swing, its time to redefine age-old trends in bridal make-up. Keeping this in mind, Habibs Hair and Beauty Studio on Ho Chi Minh Sarani has introduced special make-up packages that aim to impart a designer touch to the traditional modes of make-up that have adorned brides down the years. At a recent workshop at the studio, guests were treated to a live demonstration, where models dressed in their bridal best courtesy Gatha and Raju Duggar, were given makeovers according to the community they were representing.																																																				Having identified the typical hairstyles and make-up aspects of marriages in different communities and followed it up with minor experimentation, Habibs has come up with styles designed to make brides look their stunning best on the big day. In Hindu weddings, where saris have gone from the traditional broad borders to designer drapes, the studio suggests full eye-shadow matching the lipstick colour and small stones embellishing the sandalwood designs whereas hairstyles incorporate ringlets for a more romantic look. 																																																				In case of Muslim brides, the make-up should be kept heavy and resplendent with glitter and here, Habibs suggests light-violet and baby-pink for eye-shadow with the lipstick matching either the eye-shadow or clothes or complementing both. Interesting hairstyles include French rolls, top-knots and twists with decorative pins attached to the hair. For Punjabi weddings, Habibs advises heavy make-up in red tones to add a dash of colour while for Christian brides, light blue or steel for the eyeshadow and a silvery finish to the total look is recommended. 																																																				Armed with innovative ideas, Habibs charges Rs 3,440 for bridal make-up with hair-dressing. And grooms havent been left out either as Habibs offers make-up for them for as little as Rs 495.

Pinky strikes a  pose with the newly-revamped Happy Club card 				 															Happy days are here again 																																																				It may be almost a year since it first burst onto the citys clubbing scene but Happy Club is still forging full steam ahead. Always having claimed its target group to be the young-at-heart, it was hardly surprising that the one-of-a-kind virtual club chose to celebrate National Youth Day in its own inimitable way.																																																				The venue this time around was the cosy caf Coffee Pai and the glam factor was more than well taken care of courtesy model Pinky. Even as Pinky, dressed in a white top and cheekily-angled beret, put her best face forward for the cameras, chairman of the Happy Group, Sushil Poddar and son Rajiv spoke at length to the small gathering about the latest offerings from the Happy Club house. 																																																				Theres good news for those who get their highs from horse-riding as members of Happy Club now have access to the Calcutta Polo Club, membership to which would normally set you back by Rs 8,600. Happy clubbers can also gain entry to the members enclosure at The Royal Calcutta Turf Club and enjoy all facilities on race days. Then again, tennis enthusiasts can hit the courts at The Calcutta South Club in the evenings along with the already-available morning slots. Another plus to being a member of Happy Club is that one can enjoy members privileges at about 30 clubs across the country including Paradise Country Club in Pune, Presidency Club in Ooty, Rajmahal Vilas Club in Bangalore, not to mention access to the Royal Overseas League in London and Edinburgh. 																																																				l this in addition to the existing bouquet of services that takes in everything from major discounts at some of the best restaurants in town and free use of the gyms at The HHI, The Golden Park Hotel and Punjab Bradree to surfing, swimming and even free entry to select nightclubs. 																																																				The platinum card that throws up all these privileges (ordinarily adding up to over Rs 4 lakhs) costs Rs 15,567 for one year and Rs 5,500 for a four-month option. Whats more, if youre under 25 years of age and you register in the next few days, a free wrist-watch is thrown in for good measure. For details, contact 2282 6393.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 King in a battle of three aces
 															- Northwest back in communist fold after 48 years A STAFF REPORTER																								Jeetechhi, jeetechhi. The solitary victory chant of Zulfikar Ahmed carried far beyond Netaji Indoor Stadium, the counting centre for the critical Calcutta Northwest seat.																								Digging into the partys food packet (roomali roti, chicken tikka and laddoo) at high noon on Thursday, the resident of Marquis Lane and CPM activist laughed out loud: All these years we were leaving the counting centre with our heads down. The win this time is a great feeling.																								Not far from where Ahmed was sitting, the man they call Mintuda was left smiling the last, but smiling the last among the three Ss (Sudhangshu Seal, Subrata Mukherjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay), in what was billed to be the battle of the three aces.																								By the end of Thursday the 13th, the number three had assumed another significance for Seal  he was left wearing a three-in-one crown of councillor, legislator and parliamentarian.																								And no one seemed to grudge the 57-year-old his triple role. After all, he had just brought Calcutta Northwest back into the Left fold after 48 years. Except for scientist Meghnad Saha, who won uncontested from this seat in 1952, and Mohit Moitra, winner in 1956, Calcutta Northwest has always voted non-Left.																								I am happy with the result and am also aware of the responsibilities. For me, its a verdict of the people against the NDA government and their way of functioning. I will continue to work for the people in my area, smiled Seal, cucumber cool in trademark white kurta-pyjama with a dab of red abir on his forehead.																								CPM supporters were ready to break into a jig as Seal established an early lead over his Trinamul Congress rival. The margin continued to rise with every round and Seal ended with 151,481 votes, ahead of mayor Mukherjee by 42,823 votes. Reigning champion and Trinamul-turned-Congress-backed Independent Bandopadhyay polled 81,906 votes.																								A simple case of Left-vs-non-Left arithmetic, with the Congress a house divided? The fight in this constituency has always been triangular and I dont think you can attribute this win solely to a split in votes, argued Seal, surrounded by supporters sporting red headbands and draped in red flags.																								The mood turned electric, with celebrations being uncorked as early as round two. Seeing what was coming  and not liking the look of it  Bandopadhyay left the counting hall. Mukherjee did even better  he simply didnt show up.

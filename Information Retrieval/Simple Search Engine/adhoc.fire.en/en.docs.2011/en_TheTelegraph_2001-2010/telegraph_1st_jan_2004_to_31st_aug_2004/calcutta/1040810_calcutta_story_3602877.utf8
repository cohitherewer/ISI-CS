																								In a commendable effort to bridge the gap between children hailing from affluent families and those not as lucky, Prayasam and Salt Lake School have jointly conceived their pet project, Green Light. The project aims to form a students council in Salt Lake through which children can develop skills, identify their priorities, build up an effective communication system among themselves and learn from their peers. A two-day workshop will mark the inauguration of this noble venture, the main aim of which is to facilitate an effective interaction between regular students and their underprivileged counterparts, who form Prayasams cultural wing Ahlladi. As the name suggests, Green Light is also about working towards giving Salt Lake a greener look and rendering it a childs haven, where he can express his opinion, receive such basic services as health and education, and grow in an environment free from violence, abuse and exploitation.																								Event: Green Light, a workshop for children																								When: Today and tomorrow; 3.20 pm																								Where: Salt Lake School (English Medium), CA 221, Salt Lake

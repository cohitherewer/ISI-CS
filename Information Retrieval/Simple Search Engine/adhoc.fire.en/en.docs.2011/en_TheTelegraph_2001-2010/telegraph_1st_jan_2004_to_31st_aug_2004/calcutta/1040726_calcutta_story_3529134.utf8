 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Animal roundworms invade human skin
 A STAFF REPORTER 
	 Make sure that children wash their hands and feet with soap, specially after a game of football or cricket in open fields
	 Do not let rainwater accumulate near your house. Clear your locality of animal faeces
	 As a preventive measure, give anti-worm tablets to children as well as adults once every six months
	 Whenever you see a rash, which is spreading quickly, consult a dermatologist, because a worm might have penetrated into the skin When the boy first noticed a rash on his right arm, he did not pay much heed to it. But when the rashes began to spread in a line on his skin, from the back of his hand to the elbow, and then to the shoulder, Vinay was worried. 																								His perplexed parents took him to hospital, where a dermatologist found that the boy was not suffering from any ordinary skin infection. 																								Tiny worms had, somehow, penetrated his skin and were creating havoc inside his body.																								From their natural hosts in animals to the human skin, worms known as the cutaneous larvae migrans (CLM), a variety of roundworm that migrates inside the body, are causing concern among city-based dermatologists. 																								Found with the onset of monsoon mostly in the skin of animals and their faeces  in worst cases, the gastro-intestinal tract of the human body  in increasing numbers, these worms are trying out the human skin as their host.																								There was a time when we would never hear of these worms coming anywhere near human beings in city areas. But of late, we have been treating a number of cases from upmarket localities in the city, where children have been the worst sufferers, says Sachin Verma, dermatologist at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. 																								The worms get inside the sub-cutaneous layer, either in the legs or the hands, and slowly make their way through the skin, moving and eating into the skin, causing inflammation and rashes. 																								At times it can be fatal, because the worms tend to get to the lungs. These tiny bugs must be stopped quickly, said dermatologist Subrata Malakar. 																								To make matters worse, CLM invasion cases in the city have been wrongly diagnosed by many doctors as skin infections, lesions or some kind of allergy. 																								All sorts of medicines and ointments have been tried out by doctors, but to no avail. It only needs a proper clinical diagnosis to know that the rashes are caused by worms, Verma explains.																								Dermatologists explain that CLM worms mostly breed in open fields and in places where animal faeces are dumped in huge quantities and water accumulates for days. 																								Experts say that earlier, the prevalence rate of CLM cases among humans would be restricted to farmers. 																								So, they were surprised that the number of cases in the city is on the rise. At the moment, at least five to seven cases of CLM attacks are reported by city-based dermatologists every month from their chambers. 																								The bigger hospitals, too, have been reporting a rising graph of CLM cases.																								A specialist in such cases, Sandipan Dhar, from the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, believes that since most children play outside in open fields, they are the worst sufferers. Victims are dewormed for three consecutive days in such cases. Some even try to burn the skin and trap the worms inside the body by denying them oxygen or by making an incision, but that does not work, Dhar added.

																																																																																		Caught in a traffic jam? Call the traffic police on its new helpline at 98300 10000 or 98300 11111. The cops will suggest a way out. If required, a sergeant from the nearest outpost, too, may come to your rescue. 																																																								he helpline will be commissioned on Monday. The idea is to re-direct traffic from a route facing a blockade or clogged with vehicles. It helps a lot if one gets information about alternative routes, said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Banibrata Basu. 																																																								he traffic police have joined hands with a private telephone service provider to launch the helpline. A call on this line will be automatically re-directed to the Traffic Control Room at Lalbazar, where an officer will receive it.																																																								he helpline will also enable traffic cops reduce the response time in case of an emergency. With every call, the Control Room will get an idea of the traffic mess at a particular spot, and can send a team before things get out of hand.

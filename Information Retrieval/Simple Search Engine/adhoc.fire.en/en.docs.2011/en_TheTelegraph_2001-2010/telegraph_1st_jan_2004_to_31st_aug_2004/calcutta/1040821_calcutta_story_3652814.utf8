 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Hand over licence, demand seizure slip 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The next time a man in uniform demands your licence for a road-rule violation, youre well within your rights to ask for a seizure list. 																								You can even drag the traffic cop to court if you feel wronged.																								This was spelt out on Friday by a bench that hauled up the police for not following the guidelines framed by the high court six years ago about licence seizure for alleged violation of traffic rules.																								The seizure list mentions the items that have been confiscated by the traffic policeman and is counter-signed by two witnesses. 																								Usually, a compound slip is issued, on which the driver has to sign, admitting to having violated traffic laws and agreeing to pay a fine. 																								It is only on the basis of the seizure list that the court can be moved by the offender.																								Justice Pinaki Ghosh directed the city police commissioner, the deputy commissioner of traffic and all officers in charge of traffic guards to issue the seizure list, if the driver of the vehicle in question demanded it.																								The judge said the drivers must have the opportunity to seek justice in court if they had a grievance against the traffic police.																								The court order followed a petition by advocate Dipankar Dutta, alleging that a traffic sergeant had refused to give him the seizure list while confiscating his licence. 																								Dutta informed the court that after a similar incident in 1998, he had approached a division bench of the same court, which had directed the police to issue a seizure list to drivers who asked for it.																								The court had also directed the force to brief the traffic wing about this procedure. 																								But the traffic police is still seizing licences simply by issuing a compound slip, the lawyer alleged.																								The high court directive stressed that: Whenever a traffic policeman books a driver, he must ask whether he is willing to hand over his licence against a compound slip If the driver asks for a seizure list, that must be issued before the licence is seized.The city police chief must arrange for a training programme to make traffic police aware about the procedure.

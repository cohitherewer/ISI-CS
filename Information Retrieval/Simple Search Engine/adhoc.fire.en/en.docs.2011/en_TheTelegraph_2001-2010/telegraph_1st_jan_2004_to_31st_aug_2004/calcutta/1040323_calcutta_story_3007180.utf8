 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Talent scout toast to past
The first evening of Swarn Nritya Pratibha. Pictures by Pabitra DasThe institute is over 50 years old, but the focus of the golden jubilee celebrations of Sangeet Natak Akademi is on youth. Be it music, dance, theatre or other forms of performing arts, the aim of the Delhi-based organisation is to find young talent and provide opportunities. And after taking various events around the country, the classical dance festival is now in Calcutta.				 				 																															Swarn Nritya Pratibha will showcase over 20 individual artistes and groups from different parts of India. Although the primary objective is to highlight the specific dance forms and upcoming talents in the eastern region, there will also be several other performers from the south.				 				 																															Its dedicated to the dancers of the new generation, says Jayant Kastuar, secretary, Sangeet Natak Akademi. We want to identify new talents from each zone. But, while 70 to 75 per cent of the young artistes are from Calcutta, and one from Midnapore, there are a few from other states as well, to add flavour to the festival. We had earlier organised such programmes after the Yuva Utsav 				 				 																															was launched in 1985, the international year of the youth, but we hope to make this an annual affair now.				 				 																															Alongside Calcuttas best will be youngsters from Assam, Orissa, Manipur and Bihar. The performances for the five-day festival, from March 21 to 25, include Bharatnatyam, Odissi, Mohiniattam, kathak, kuchipudi, Manipuri and chhau. It is being supported by Padatik and Anamika Kala Sangam in the city.				 				 																															Several of the participants, mostly in their 20s  the age limit is 30  are already accomplished and established, and on their way to national and international recognition, with shows and workshops around the country and abroad under their belts. And they are the best, with the Akademi having approached renowned teachers and institutions to recommend their students for the festival.				 				 																															Art doesnt have any frontiers, explains Sonal Mansingh, chairman of the Akademi. There is a lot to garner from tradition, but there is constant newness, through experimentation and innovation. The sky is the limit.				 				 																															With that in mind, several other events are being planned. Continuing in Santiniketan at the moment is a theatre workshop, with 10 youngsters from Calcutta and 16 from the districts, as well as several events in other states, including a young theatre directors festival in Tripura. More theme-based programmes and research scholarships, too, are in the works.				 				 																															The dance festival was inaugurated on Sunday by Mansingh, which was followed by the screening of an audio-visual presentation from the Akademis archives. The performances will be held every evening from 6.30 pm, at Rabindra Sadan.				 				 																
	 Play time				 				 																															Ten people, each with something to hide and something to fear, are invited to a lonely mansion on an island by a host who then fails to appear. There, they are cut off from everything but each other and the inescapable shadows of their own past. One by one, the guests share their dark secrets. And one by one, they die... 				 				 																															Reflection presented And Then There Were None, by crime fiction queen Agatha Christie, directed by Vivek Bothra, at Gyan Manch on March 20 and 21. Although only the second venture of the director after Harold Pinters Betrayal, it was a mature production. The audience appreciated the manner in which the murders were executed on stage, while the background music added to the sinister mood. 				 				 																															Both veterans and novices shared the stage. Several college students participated in the production, with Laura L. Mishra and Sravasti Datta from Loreto College portraying the female protagonists, and Vishaal Sethia, a radio jockey, and Deborshi Barat from NUJS playing the central male characters. Dilip Dave, a veteran actor in Hindi productions, was also appreciated in the role of General Mackenzie. 				 				 																															Although the director had shifted from the original script of the play and changed the ending, he made it a success. His next project, in April, will hopefully be another suspense-filled thriller. 				 				 																															 Suchi Arya,1st year, English (hons),

	Fun feastJU campus was full of fun last week, as the annual fest, Sanskriti, packed in plenty of action from March 16 to 20. Presented by the engineering and technology students union, the event had several colleges battling it out.				 				 																															It was a colourful collage of excitement and entertainment, the traditional and the modern. The first day first show opened with a theatre contest, followed by dance drama and a performance by a Bangla band.				 				 																															The second day called in the crowds with a cyber quiz and the ever-popular antakshari (Gaans amp; Roses), and ended with Bangla rock band Fossil and singer Indranil Sen getting the audience on its feet. March 18 began with Raag and Josh, the eastern group and solo music contest. Next up was a quiz competition, after which Anjan Dutta and Bangla baul band Aikyatan took the stage.				 				 																															On Friday, it was a trip down memory lane during Reunion Night, with Rhythm and Blues, the western group and solo categories, and Ghungrooz, the choreography contest. Wrapping up the evening was Latin band Orient Express.				 				 																															The final day featured Bizzy Bees, a business quiz. The grand finale included performances by bands Cactus and Krosswindz, the latter being joined by a former founder-member, Bony. There were some unique sounds, with a fusion of rock and baul music.Asif Alam,

	 Road map				 				 																															A seminar on Geographical Information System (GIS) was organised recently at Lady Brabourne College. The thought of remote sensing and GIS paints a complicated picture in the minds of most, but the seminar provided an innovative way of looking at geography, with the word split into three parts  Geo, Graph and Y.				 				 																															Although GIS is not really included in the main curriculum of universities, the aim was to acquaint students from all disciplines with the practical applications of the subject. Modern audio-visual equipment was used to illustrate how the process of mapping is carried out, with reference to a globe, or rather, an oblate spheroid.				 				 																															Though the seminar highlighted several technical details of the mapping process, the aim was to get us to look at a new subject in a novel way. The seminar was all the more important because a post-graduate M.Sc course in geography has been introduced in the college this year. These students are looking at a variety of career options, and applied geography is an addition to the list. Ranjana Das,

	 Threes company				 				 																															The festival of solo collaborators that kicked off in Calcutta last week is third theatre at its most innovative, with three individuals from three different groups performing in a site-specific setting, using texts from literature in three countries.				 				 																															The first was Values Americans Live By, from the text by Robert Kohls and performed by Aaron Kahn from Chicago, associated with The Laboratory of Enthusiastic Collaboration (LEC) Vermont and Montreal. 				 				 																															The second was Breast Giver, based on a short story by Mahasveta Devi and translated by Gayatri Chakraborty Spivak, performed by Parnab Mukherjee of Best of Kolkata Campus.				 				 																															The Third was Kaspar Shredded amp; Dipped, by German Peter Handke. The stage rendition was courtesy Janardhan Ghosh, part of OGLAM (Organisation to give life a meaning), Bally.				 				 																															There are no established sets or props, with the ambience being created as part of the one-hour-40-minute play. The lights and backstage work is a combined effort by the three actors. The theme is the politics of the urban word, the politics of the tribal word and the politics of the origin of words.				 				 																															The trio will tour with the festival for the next five months, with 25 shows in Mumbai, Delhi and Pondicherry.

 Models Tapur and Tupur showcase outfits from designer Shantanu Goenkas bridal collection. Pictures by Rashbehari DasHe is yet to get a membership from FDCI (Fashion Design Council of India), the governing body of LIFW, but she walked the ramp with elan at the gala. She, however, loves to pose in his clothes along with her twin, while he is only too glad to be able to get the high fliers to shoot for him. Designer Shantanu Goenka is the lucky guy here and models Tapur and Tupur the ladies in demand. 																								Unveiling his summer bridal collection at his studio off Tangra on Wednesday, Shantanu hoped to attract business with light shades and contemporary cuts even though he hasnt been able to get too adventurous.																								He has steered clear of reds and featured a lot of oranges, turquoise, corals and lime instead. The cholis are shorter with deeper necklines and the lehngas more streamlined  fitted around the waist with volume limited to the hemline. Dupattas are mostly in nets and georgettes for a transparent yet layered look. There is a sprinkling of crystals, stones and kundans along with a lot of thread work, but the designer refrained from heavy ornamentation. I had to keep the collection light to go with the season, he stressed. 																								Labelled Shantanu Goenka Couture Trousseau line, the collection also features some cocktail ensembles like saris, trouser and shirt jacket sets for brides-in-waiting. The saris are mostly in light fabrics but the jackets have been fashioned out of thicker crepes and are nicely padded so one can do without a lining. 																								The contemporary touch overshadowed the traditional lines. The outfits are quite traditional yet very theatrical and go more with a stage show theme, gushed Tapur, while posing in funky headgear designed to go with the ensembles. The Mumbai-based models also rated the garments high on the wearablity factor.Bauble babble City women have woken up to the importance of understanding diamonds, not just flashing them. Recently, the Time  Talent Club held a talk on the subject and on Wednesday, Ladies Study Group followed suit.																								The talk titled Solitaire was taken by Samrat Zaveri, managing director, TBZ-Nirmal Zaveri and Krish Khiraiya of the Gemmological Institute of America. The first advice from Krish was that many are not careful when weighing diamonds. Even air can influence the weight of the stone, he revealed.																								Diamonds come in four settings: Channel, Invisible, Prong and Bezel. It is easy to come across round, oval, pear and heart-shaped diamonds, while rose-cut diamonds, known as single-cut diamonds, also have an interesting shape to them, but are no longer in vogue and are difficult to find.																								Lauding DeBeers for creating a transparency and confidence regarding diamonds, Krish stressed that the quality of a diamond is critical to its value. While certifying diamond jewellery, buyers must check that each certificate has a picture of the gem and information on the 4Cs  carat, colour, clarity and cut  based on surface fluorescence.																								The experts shared tips on diamond care as well. The stones should be kept away from bleaching powder, perfume and cosmetics. They should be cleaned by dipping them in boiling water for 15 mins and dried on a towel with a hair dryer. Members of the Ladies Study Group admire jewellery at The ParkMommy dear Mothers Day came early this year, with two special moms being honoured by their sons on Wednesday. Mamata Shankar and Churni Ganguly were the first recipients of the special range of jewellery launched by Ishis.																								Churnis child Ujaan and Mamatas son Ratul presented their mothers with diamond rings etched with the word mom on the side at the Forum outlet.																								For the Mumbai-based jewellery chain, the Mothers Day promotion is designed to tap an untouched segment. You have special products for Valentines Day, weddings and even birthdays, but no one really thinks of giving something special on Mothers Day, explains marketing manager Manoj Subramanian.Sarson sagaIf you are counting calories, this one is not for you. But if you are looking for a good, hearty meal, the Eden Pavilion, the 24-hour coffee shop at ITC Sonar Bangla, is the destination to head for. The Baisakhi hangover continues here with a 10-day Punjabi food fest starting on Thursday.																								Even as you dig into your Makke di Roti dripping with white butter, chef Sweety Singh, a genial sardarji flown in from ITC Delhi for the festival, stresses that the fare is light and homely. I sometimes use desi ghee in my preparations but the emphasis is on a lot of tomatoes and dahi to go with the season, says the chef. Dhaba Shahi Paneer cooked in tomato puree with a little salt and chilly powder and Aloo Mutton cooked in dahi are proof of this claim but as one proceeds to polish off the delectable spread, it is hard to believe the weighing scale will back him up in the morning.																								The buffet spread (Rs 600 plus taxes for lunch or dinner) throws in variations from the standard menu that includes tall glasses of sweet or salted lassi, Makke di Roti, a variety of stuffed paranthas, Sarson da Saag, Pindi Choley, Dhaba Shahi Paneer, Amritsari Machhi Fry, Murg Tariwala, keema, Chicken Chawal, Matar Pulao and more to be capped with kheer or kulfi.  Delicacies from the Punjabi buffet spread at ITC Sonar BanglaThe chef has had to improvise a little owing to geographical constraints. In Sarson da Saag for example, we have had to mix palak as bathua that is normally mixed with the preparation is not available in Calcutta, explains Sweety. Nostalgia is palpable as he laments not being able to offer the authentic flavours of Punjab owing to difference in the water! Many dont realise but the water of a place affects cooking in a big way. The water here is very different from that of Punjab which is extremely healthy, emphasises Sweety. One look at his girth and you know what he means!																								The thoughtful chef, however, has brought authentic Punjabi pickles from home, which go perfectly with a standard Punjabi meal. Dele ka Achaar, Shalgam Gobi ka Khatta Mitha Achaar and stuffed Mirchi Achaar are a must try with Makke di Roti and Sarson da Saag.Sangita S. Guha Roy and Soma Banerjee

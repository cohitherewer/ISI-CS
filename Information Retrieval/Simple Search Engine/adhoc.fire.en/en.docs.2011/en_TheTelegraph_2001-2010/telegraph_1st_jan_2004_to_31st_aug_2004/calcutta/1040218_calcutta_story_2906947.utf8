The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Japan assurance not to freeze funds
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Reiichiro Takahashi, minister for economic affairs from the embassy of Japan, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday to discuss several development projects with funds from Japan, including construction of the ongoing flyovers and the proposed Metro Railway project the government has long been looking forward to. 																								After the meeting, Bhattacharjee said several other states were competing for the East-West Metro project, so it would not be smooth sailing for Bengal to bag the funds. About 250 metres of the 24-km Metro route from Salt Lake to Howrahs Ramrajatala lies under the Hooghly; the rest is elevated and on the surface. Estimated to cost about Rs 4,000 crore, 64 per cent of the East-West Metro is to be financed by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and 30 per cent shared equally by the state and the central governments. The remaining six per cent must be raised by commercial use of the land to be developed for the project.																								Asked if the project prospects appeared brighter after the talks with Takahashi, Bhattacharjee said: I cannot say anything now. We did not have any feasibility study to discuss with them today, and moreover, we are competing with other states for the project.																								Minister Takahashi said: No specific project was discussed, though we spoke about infrastructure  like bridges, public transport, the Metro, and so on. He added that Japan wanted better utilisation of the overseas development assistance to Bengal. 																								People in Japan feel the taxpayers money must be used properly, Takahashi said. Already, we have cut down on the assistance offered for development projects overseas by 40 per cent on account of a slump. Under such circumstances, we stressed that the money offered by Japan must be utilised properly, and that there must be more cooperation from the government.																								Takahashi held out the assurance that the flow of funds to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government for the ongoing flyover projects would not be stopped even if the project continued beyond the May 29 deadline. The question of freezing the funds does not arise, but we want better utilisation of the funds being provided by JBIC, he added. 																								The JBIC had put out a package loan of Rs 340 crore for the construction of four flyovers  at Gariahat, AJC Bose Road, Cossipore and Park Street. Construction of the Park Street and Cossipore flyovers are running well behind schedule, as per the original contract. The project started on November 1, 1999, and the scheduled date of financial closure is May 29, 2004.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Poverty uplift project debut in January
 JAYANTA BASU																								The long wait will end soon. The Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor (CUSP) is finally rolling out in late-January.																								State municipal affairs and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya told Metro that an inauguration date has all but been finalised for the biggest-ever project for the poor population within the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. 																								The ministerial-level nod from the Centre has come through for the project, funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), government of UK, the minister added.																								The flag-off was set for last year, but was stayed when the central government refused to consider the entire project amount (102.1 million) as grant. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had to use his good offices in Delhi to obtain the special permission, sources said.																								The Rs 712-crore, eight-year project (originally scheduled for 20032011) proposes to cover nearly 2.5 million poor people in 40 municipalities and municipal corporations, stretching from Kalyani and Bansberia in the north to Baruipur and Pujali in the south. It covers all municipalities within greater Calcutta, except Calcutta Municipal Corporation, where a similar project has been undertaken independently.																								The model, developed over the past year and a half with strategy inputs from our end, will be unique to Third World cities, observed Bhattacharya. Municipalities are not going to receive any untied fund for the project. The funding  conditional and performance dependent  will be regularly monitored.																								The project will help the municipalities become far more capable of handling problems related to basic urban services, like safe drinking water, proper sanitation or solid waste management better, said project director Subrata Biswas. 																								Every municipality within greater Calcutta will have to prepare its own business plan within three years of project commencement, he added. Biswas also highlighted a fund for innovative schemes as a unique feature of the project.

 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Rendezvous with Tagore
 Some of Rabindranath Tagores immortal compositions were influenced by Western songs and various kinds of Hindustani music, both folk and classical. The songs, written in Tagores youth, reflect his early association with melodies from lands far and wide.Though deeply inspired by the tunes and melodies of the various masters, the songs bear the true essence of Tagore, both in style and substance. Koyel Artists Group of Golf Green celebrates these eternal favourites in an evening of songs and dances, Bhanga Gaaner Ranga Dhulay, where eminent singers like Arun Bhaduri, Haimanti Shukla, Srikanta Acharya, Rezwana Chowdhury, Reema Mitra and Sudakshina Chatterjee along with Koyels own members render these popular songs accompanied by dance performances by Alokananda Ray and members of the Nabankur dance troupe. Tributes will also be paid to V Balsara and Dwijen Mukhopadhyay, two musical doyens of the yesteryear, who greatly contributed to our understanding and interpretation of Tagores music over the generations.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

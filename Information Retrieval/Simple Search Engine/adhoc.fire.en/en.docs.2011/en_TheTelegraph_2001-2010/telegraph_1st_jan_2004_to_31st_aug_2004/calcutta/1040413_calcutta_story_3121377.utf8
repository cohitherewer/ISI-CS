Style ShopNafisa Ali. Picture below by Rashbehari DasArt and charity came together yet again as an exhibition-cum-sale Lakm Parampara 2004 at the Ice Skating Rink. Organised by the Rotary Club of Calcutta Chowringhee and inaugurated by Nafisa Ali on Monday, the ninth chapter of the annual exhibition features over 60 stalls of hand-crafted articles.On till April 15, the exhibition is showcasing a wide range of lifestyle products including ladies wear, shoes, bags, junk jewellery, jewellery boxes, lampshades, paintings, acrylic and wood products, lamp shades, paper bags and envelopes and a host of other knick-knacks. The exhibits are created largely out of homes and small studios. The exhibition serves as a platform for women operating small businesses out of their homes to showcase their talent, said Sadhna Agarwal, member rotary club.The proceeds will go to charity. Rotary International (a partner of the government of India in the polio eradication programme), Newlight, an NGO involved in education and rehabilitation of sex workers children in Kalighat, Parivaar, a home for street children and Prerak, a cancer support group will be some of the beneficiaries. This apart, the funds will also be channelised to sponsor paediatric heart surgery for needy children. Not surprisingly, actor-cum-activist-cum-Lok Sabha candidate Nafisa Ali was all support and praise for the endeavour. I want everybody to buy from Parampara. Not just because the stuff is so good, but because its put up for a charitable cause, she insisted. Some of the star buyers on the inaugural day were fashion designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh and danseuse Priti Patel, who were incidentally also judging the best stalls along with Nafisa. I am a jaded shopper, but I was tempted to do quite a bit of shopping today. Its amazing what women can come up with, enthused Kiran walking away with some silk paper and probably some ideas which she could use at the forthcoming Lakm India Fashion show. Priti also booked a number of items and was quite taken in with the good work these women are doing to revive some of our dying village crafts. SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Funds hunt for truck terminal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Having failed to complete the much-hyped Kona truck terminal in five years, the government is scouting for private entrepreneurs to take over the project.																								We are looking for a suitable partner to complete the project. The selection and formalities are expected to be completed soon, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Monday.																								The CMDA had taken up the project in 1999 on a 71-acre plot along the Kona Expressway. It was to be the first truck terminal in the state, aimed at blocking the entry of large goods vehicles into the city.																								The Rs 50-crore terminal was to have all amenities for parking vehicles and unloading goods. The project envisaged a godown, resthouse, hotels and entertainment centres, apart from basic facilities like a bank, petrol pump, post office and telephone booths.																								But, five years and Rs 15 crore later, the terminal is lying half-finished. The entire area has been over-run by weeds and shrubs and provides criminals with a haven.																								A few km away, the Dhulagarh truck terminal is a different story. Built jointly by the Traffic Infrastructure Development Corporation and a private firm, it was inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in June.																								The Dhulagarh success story has resulted in the chief minister prodding his urban development minister to opt for a private partner and hand over the Kona project.																								It would be prudent to let a private partner implement the project and the fewer government officers involved, the better, Bhattacharjee told minister Bhattacharya.																								We had invited applications from parties interested in buying land to construct facilities at the Kona terminal. But the response has been poor. The rate of Rs 2.5 lakh per cottah may have been a deterrent, said CMDA officials.																								Many parties wanted to buy built-up space. But since we have to invest several crores to complete the project, we felt it would be wiser to rope in a private partner, the officials explained.																								The CMDA is unwilling to invest further in the Kona project. If entrepreneurs can implement the project jointly with us, we can then invest in other development projects, the officials explained.																								According to the plan, the private party will complete the project, while the CMDAs share will be the land and the amount already invested.

 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 The horror of it
																								The CIMA Summer Show has the works of many important artists but the most significant of these is a large body of works by Shakila, the collage artist who has given her medium the kind of versatility that one usually associates with canvas painting. These works by Shakila are significant for here is an almost illiterate Muslim woman from a remote village yet she is keenly alive to some burning issues involving women in Indian society in all their goriness. Here women are being brutalised, raped, humiliated and tortured and she captures the horror of each scene with the precision of a surgeon wielding a scalpel. She is bold enough to depict rape scenes graphically. This enhances the horror of the act. The courage required is of course extraordinary, but what is even more surprising is the manner in which she has depicted these scenes by tearing scraps of paper and pasting them. She creates the impression of using subtle shades, the brightest of reds and sometimes very precise lines to create image. Shakila is truly remarkable.

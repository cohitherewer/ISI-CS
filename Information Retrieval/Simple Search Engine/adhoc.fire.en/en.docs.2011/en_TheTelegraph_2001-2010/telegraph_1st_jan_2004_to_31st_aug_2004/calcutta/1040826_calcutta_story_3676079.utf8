The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Swoop on unit of fake medicines
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a joint raid, officers of the state drug control directorate and the enforcement branch (EB) unearthed a spurious drug-manufacturing unit in north Calcutta on Wednesday. 																								Two persons of the unit were arrested for manufacturing drugs without a licence and proper authorisation.																								R.K. Adhikary, deputy commissioner (EB), said the drug control directorate was tipped off about the illegal activities at the unit, located on an extended stretch of Rani Harshamukhi Road, in Chitpur police station area.																								A display board outside the single-storey building read M/S Eastern Remedies. Officers caught two persons, Ramen Mukherjee and Sunil Maity, manufacturing fake drugs of a popular brand. 																								We seized thousands of bottles of fake drugs, worth Rs 1.5 lakh, said Adhikary.																								A drug control directorate official said the arrested duo was pasting labels of popular medicine brands on the bottles when the police moved in. They told us during interrogation that they would sell the drugs to medical shops. 																								One of the drugs being faked was Rimapyrine, which is a paediatric drug. Manufacturing the drug without any authorisation is, undoubtedly, dangerous, said the drug control directorate official.																								According to police, M/S Eastern Remedies was closed down two years ago after its owner passed away. The company had not renewed its drug-manufacturing licence since then. So, manufacturing drugs in the unit is illegal, said an EB official.																								Mukherjee and Maity used to sell the spurious drugs in 50 ml and 100 ml bottles. We found hundreds of sealed bottles stored in a room in the building. A sample of the contents will be sent for chemical examination, he added.																								Police booked the duo under the Drug and Cosmetics Control Act. According to drug control directorate officials, a search is on to trace other such units in the city. 																								Information about manufacture of spurious drugs and baby food is trickling in and our officers are working on it. Before sharing the information with the EB and conducting raids, we always cross-check every piece of information, a drug control official said.																								Adhikary said his department was always ready to assist the drug control officers. 																								We just need an official complaint before swinging into action. We cant start a suo motu case. Being a specialised wing, drug control is the authority that can lodge such complaints, he added.

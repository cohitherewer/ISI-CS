The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Picture by Aranya Sen 																								The crowd from St Xaviers may be the main target of Caf Coffee Days newest branch on Hungerford Street, but the rapidly spreading brand is plugging every supply gap it can find. This sixth centre will be followed by the opening of four more cafs by year end, doubling the Bangalore-based companys presence in the city.																								Two more centres  at Ballygunge Circular Road and City Centre, Salt Lake  will be up and running by June, reveals Arnab Pandey, regional head, eastern India, Caf Coffee Day, after the new store was inaugurated by actor Indrani Halder on Tuesday afternoon.																								That is besides the entry of Daily Bread, another brand launched by the parent company Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Co Ltd, by year-end. Already operational in Bangalore, the outlet will stock over 100 varieties of bread and savouries, explains Pandey, promising price points as affordable as the Caf Coffee Day, with a pound of English Bread coming for around Rs 16. The treats will be baked in front of the customers, who can touch, feel and then choose what they want.																								The price-product brew of the national chain has clicked well in Calcutta. While average daily sales at five centres hovering around the Rs 80,000-90,000 mark may not compare with a city like Mumbai, where the most popular outlet alone averages Rs 50,000 a day, for the Calcutta market, they are more than happy with the response. Each branch is an individual profit centre, he adds.																								As happy as are the young loyalists who ensure very few chairs at CCD (as they call it) go empty. The average age of our clientele is between 15 and 35 years, but the bulk is under 25 years, says the manager.																								An aggressive marketing strategy has seen them tie up with a host of events  right from school plays to films like Yuva and Khakee. Locally, Halder shot at the New Alipore shop a couple of days ago and scenes at the caf can also be spotted in Ravi Ojhas latest film Abar Ashbo Phire.																								A more inclusive customer profile is what the coffee major hopes to achieve. So far, most clients have been from the Marwari and Jain communities, Pandey observes. But now, we see more middle-class Bengalis walking in, too.																								Part of CCDs success may come from the response to local needs. With business picking up at New Alipore post-dinner, being a residential area, the outlet stays open till midnight. Also, it serves biryani at lunch.																								Similarly, the new store will open at 7 am to catch the commerce students at Xaviers, serving up breakfast, including omlettes, sausages, aloo parathas, sandwiches and hash browns.																								Expansion plans stretch far beyond Bengal. A number of new outlets are planned throughout the east, as well. 																								But the bigger picture is an international one. The companys global headquarters is in Cyprus, adds Pandey. Egypt, Lebanon, Dubai and Morocco are the places Caf Coffee Day hopes to penetrate first, avoiding the areas US coffee-retail major Starbucks is likely to enter in the near future.

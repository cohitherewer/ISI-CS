 Pix by Rashbehari Das (Top) Viren J. Shah,  Somnath Chatterjee and others admire the paintings at  the inauguration of the exhibition at the Victoria Memorial  and a sequence from the dragon dance at the same event A better venue one couldnt have  asked for. But for once, the magnificent facade of the Victoria  Memorial, specially illuminated for the affair, remains  in the background, for hogging the spotlight at the heritage  site are 50 canvasses, each more riveting than the other   all part of the ongoing exhibition of contemporary oil  paintings from China. Organised by the Victoria Memorial,  the National Gallery of Modern Art, Delhi and the China  International Exhibition Agency in association with CalCalling,  the showing is a step forward in cementing cross-cultural  artistic ties and has come like a breath of fresh air to  art-lovers in the city, rarely exposed to exhibitions from  abroad. Inaugurated by the governor, Viren  J. Shah, the first day saw a slew of big guns from the fields  of politics, art and culture rubbing shoulders and admiring  the canvasses on display. While chairman of the West Bengal  Industrial Development Corporation, Somnath Chatterjee was  the chief guest and Mao Siwei, political counsellor, Embassy  of China in India, Md. Salim, minister, government of West  Bengal, Mrinal Sen, Paritosh Sen and Ramananda Bandopadhay  the special guests, Dr P. C. Chunder, chairman, Heritage  Commission, West Bengal and eminent artist Bijan Chowdhury  were the honoured invitees. Of course, Chowdhury wasnt  the only artiste at hand as Wasim Kapoor and Sanu Lahiri  also graced the occasion with their presence. The battery  of introductions, addresses and speeches over, it was time  to turn to the more interesting tasks at hand  enjoying  the exciting dragon dance and soaking in the talent on display. Breath-taking landscapes and scenery,  haunting portraits of Chinese women and warriors and a line-up  of erotically-beautiful nudes, the paintings reflect the  rich customs and traditions of one of the worlds oldest  civilisations and concentrate on both realism and abstraction.  The brushstrokes range from the bold and the vibrant to  the subtle and suggestive  easily capturing the Chinese  artists varied and vigorous approach to the medium. The exhibition will continue till  February 10 from 10 am to 5 pm throughout the week except  on Mondays. Chef Niru Lama with  specialities from the Chinese New Year menu at Starstruck Sparkle on An anniversary is always cause  for celebration and when its the Diamond Jubilee of a jewellery  house that has only got bigger and better with time, the  festivities, quite naturally, are very special indeed. So,  it was only to expected that having just turned 60, M.P.  Jewellers chose to mark the occasion with a host of new  offerings, schemes and promotions including an exquisite  new collection shown off by a bevy of lovely models at a  programme at Middleton Chambers recently. From the showroom which bagged  the Platinum Guilds Best Designer Award as well as the  Best Showroom for the Diamond Season prize from DTC last  year, its new True Blue collection more than lives up to  its reputation. Set in dazzling stones in vibrant hues,  this new line has been targeted especially at the trendy  urbanite on the lookout for designs that are both striking  and unusual. The launch of the True Blue line comes hand-in-hand  with the Diamond Jubilee Day promo, which, as the name suggests  involves a special promotion that aims to woo customers  with a variety of attractive prizes. Also on the cards is  the soon-to-be-launched Jubilee Club, a high-value loyalty  programme, the first-ever from a mainstream jeweller that  promises to revolutionise jewellery-retailing in the city. And thats not all M.P. Jewellers  has in store. In keeping with the celebratory spirit, the  brand has also announced the launch of a new showroom in  Kankurgachi in the near future that will boast of, among  other things, state-of-the art dcor, friendly interaction  consoles and a world-class shopping experience. Models at the launch  of M.P. Jewellers True Blue collection  On the Orient Express Even as the Chinese are having  the time of their lives, feasting and merry-making to ring  in their New Year, the celebrations seem to have caught  on in other communities as well. That much is evident from  the crowds that are thronging Starstruck, the multi-cuisine  restaurant at Forum, which is ringing in the Year of the  Monkey with a hearty Gong Xi Fa Cai (Happy New Year) and  a lip-smacking new menu guaranteed to score major brownie  points with all those self-confessed foodies out there. ine-up is as delectable as it  is extensive, culled especially for the occasion by the  chefs at Starstruck, whove put together a menu that lists  any number of exotic delights. From a soupy start with the  Corn Wonton and Noodle or Jade Chicken Wonton soup, its  on to the appetisers where the Roast Pork dunked in a spicy  Szechwan sauce, the crispy-fried Fish Pepper Salt, the dimsum  basket and the in-house specialities Veg Tulip and Crispy  Rice with Waterchestnut and Corn encompass everything thats  good about Chinese cuisine. Appetisers over, its time to  start monkeying around with the main course and here, the  chefs surpass all expectations with some never-before delights.  Try the Stir-Fried American Corn with Chinese Greens, the  Sawsdee Prawns redolent with the aroma of Thai basil, the  Shaolin Chicken smothered in a black bean sauce or stick  with such tried-and-tasted favourites as Five Treasure Vegetables,  Hunan Chicken and more. Be prepared to experiment a bit,  though, for even the noodles and rice section steers towards  the exotic, what with such items as Woodear Fried Rice with  fungi mushrooms and spring onions and Hu Fan Noodles (flat  noodles tossed in a black bean paste with vegetables) vying  for attention. Prices at Starstruck start at  Rs 75 for a soup, while a main course dish hovers between  Rs 140 and Rs 325. To catch the festival on its last day  today, call: 3090 1030/1664.

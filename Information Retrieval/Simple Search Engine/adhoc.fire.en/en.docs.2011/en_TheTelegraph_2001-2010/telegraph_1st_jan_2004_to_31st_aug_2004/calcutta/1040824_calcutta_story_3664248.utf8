SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY SINKS INTO THE OLD-WORLD MAGIC OF DESIGNER SHARBARI DATTAS SOUTH CALCUTTA BUNGALOW She is completely enamoured by the appeal of the ancient and one look at the interiors of designer Sharbari Dattas plush bungalow at Broad Street will confirm that. Her tasteful residence boasts a collection of antique furniture and artefacts that could put a curio shop to shame.I have always been fascinated by antiques, especially furniture. In fact, my entire family shares this passion. And I have inherited some brilliant pieces of antique furniture and showpieces from my father as well as my father-in-law, says the mens wear designer.It is an old obsession, admits Sharbari. In the days just after I got married, I used to go to a friends house in Alipore. On the way, I would pass an antique furniture shop. I looked longingly at the furniture and dreamt that I would possess a few such pieces, some day, she smiles. The dream was converted into reality very gradually over the past 35 years, picking up pieces of nostalgia that caught her eye.I have always been very experimental while doing up my home. I have done one thing at a time. My son Amalin helped me with this. We never planned any particular look or followed any guidelines, we just did whatever we thought would look artistic. And gradually the whole house developed a character, adds Sharbari.The antique effect of the house is enhanced by murals and frescoes depicting mythological figures on the walls of every room. This is particularly prominent in what is now the kids room, but once was Sharbaris bedroom. There is a huge mural of Radha-Krishna on one wall; a fresco portraying fairy tale characters on another, and yet another fresco of the Ajanta caves in its present ruined state on another wall.Our family used to deal with murals and frescoes. So, I experimented a lot with these in my house. The karigars worked according to my specifications. In fact, Amalin is trying to revive the business and plans to start dealing in murals commercially once again, she reveals.Statuettes, masks and other antique artefacts complete the look.Do and dontMany people have a passion for antiques, but not everyone can display them properly. One should always consider the space before deciding on buying an old piece of furniture. Most people live in small apartments these days and elaborate looking furniture is often a misfit in small rooms.Another important aspect to be considered is the ambience of the house. An old regal carved wooden bed wouldnt look nice next to a modern wrought iron dresser. The whole theme has to be altered if you want to flaunt antique furniture in your house and this can be often done quite easily. For instance, you cant keep an antique cabinet next to a window with a very modern-looking grill. But if you cover the window with an old-fashioned bamboo blind the look will change.Next comes buying the stuff. Not everyone can make out a fake antique from the real thing, so experience and exposure may help. But often there is no option but to go by appearances. Even so, it is always advisable to enquire about the history and origin of a piece before purchase. This is a good way to discover interesting stories as well.Old furniture looks more fashionable if it is used in every day life, enhancing its beauty by making it relevant. On the other hand, too much furniture kept as showpieces will make the room look like a museum.While antique furniture often needs restoration before use, it is best not to polish them so it looks new. Retaining the imperfections will preserve the olden-day charm.Lastly, one has to nourish antiques. They require a lot of maintenance and it is best done manually. To clean and polish them at regular intervals is essential.GlimpsesFrom top This is the room where her grandchildren play. The bed here is an antique and was procured by her son Amalin and his wife Kanaklata from a junkyard. A bit of enquiry revealed that it originally belonged to a Muslim family dwelling in a slum. Three of the walls in this room have murals and frescoes. The mural of Radha-Krishna depicted in traditional Bengali style has been painted by the designer herself.  The bed in Sharbaris room was picked up by her from an antique shop in Alipore. I fell in love with the bed when I saw the headboard. At that time it was too expensive for me and I mulled over it for two months. Finally, I managed to bargain with the shop-owner so that I could pay in installments, she recalls. She was informed that it originally belonged to the palace of Natore in Bangladesh.Recently, film-maker Rituparno Ghosh was visiting the designer and he expressed interest in using the bed in one of his forthcoming films. In the picture we catch actor Jeet striking a pose on the antique, holding a hookah which is almost 200 years old. Jeet is dressed in a dhoti and saffron kurta designed by Sharbari as part of her collection for Bridal Asia 2004, where she will put up the inaugural show on September 22.  The drawing room houses an antique wooden sofa-set (the one on which Sharbari is sitting) with a mural panel in the background. The other side of the room has a one-piece marble seating area fixed to the floor.  The dining table chairs are all very old and the walls beside the table have been done up with wood carvings to match the chairs.Pictures by Pabitra Das

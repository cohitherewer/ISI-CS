 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Patient wins battle with fatal disease
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After three weeks in a ventilator, a 54-year-old patient, suffering from a rare disease and with little chance of survival, rose from her deathbed and stunned the medical fraternity of the city.																								Stricken with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a lung disease that causes multi-organ failure and even death, Kalpana Banerjee beat all the odds and survived.																								Banerjee was first down with pneumonia for several weeks and admitted to a nursing home for treatment. But, with no change in her condition, doctors evaluated her case further and found that the diabetic and hypertensive patient was sinking gradually. It was than that they decided to tell the family.																								Banerjees family then shifted her to BM Birla Heart Research Centre, where she was immediately wheeled into the intensive coronary care unit.																								At first, we did not give her any chance at all. Apart from her lungs, the liver and kidneys were also damaged. She was in a very bad state and unconscious, said Tarun Praharaj, cardiologist and director of the hospitals cardiac catherization laboratory.																								A dangerous disease, ARDS first affects the lungs, due to various ailments, including septicaemia, trauma, burn injuries, malaria and exposure to toxic gases and fumes. 																								Once we detected ARDS, we knew that the patient had a slim chance of survival, especially as patients from this disease have only a 20-30 per cent chance of survival in any hospital around the world, Praharaj added.																								Apart from an artificial breathing machine, the patient was also facing a renal shutdown and liver failure. 																								Specialists, like pulmonologist R.K. Das, infection control specialist A Chakraborty and anaesthesiologist S. Ganguly, along with several other doctors and a 24-hour nursing staff monitored Banerjees condition and put her on intensive therapy and medication.																								After 15 days, Banerjee finally opened her eyes and could not recall what had happened to her. I have no idea what has happened to me or that so many days have elapsed. But now Im told that I have made it, was all she could gasp, recuperating in her hospital bed.																								Although very rare, ARDS occurs after a primary disease like pneumonia or even trauma and leads to disease of the lungs. It quickly spreads to the other organs and a patient often dies before a medical team can do anything about it. 																								For nearly three weeks, the team battled to save her. It was an uphill task all the time. Thankfully, she responded to medication, Praharaj signed off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Held for Rs 3-cr fraud on neighbours
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A conman has been arrested at Khaldharpara, in the Dasnagar police station area of Howrah, for allegedly cheating 1,200 people of Rs 3 crore. 																								Shyamaprasad Hazra, who is also a quack, had persuaded these people, mostly from the working class, to invest large sums of money in his non-existent fund, pledging to pay a huge one-time interest after a specified period of time. 																								According to police, Hazras fund, besides being nameless, was not registered with the government, either. When one of Hazras victims, Rama Sain, was asked why she had invested her hard-earned money in a fund that was not registered, she replied: We never thought that he will cheat us. He was a well-behaved man, who helped the poor financially in times of need. 																								Sain added that in 1998, she had paid Hazra Rs 1 lakh, on an assurance from him that she would be paid three per cent a month as interest, and in a year, she would get a total interest of 36 per cent.																								People deposited anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15 lakh, but Hazra never maintained any record on how he spent the money. His policy was to accept a lump sum from local people with a promise that the money would be refunded after a year or two. He ran this racket for the past 10 years, said police. 																								Things were in favour of Hazra and he managed to attract more deposits from local people. Trouble started when he stopped paying interest some time ago. When the investors demanded interest, he fobbed them off, saying CBI officers had seized his property and they would have to wait for three months more, complained a victim. 																								The man said Hazra displayed a notice in his house to the effect that the CBI had started a case against him, and till June 29, he would be unable to spare anything. 																								But the notice failed to fool local people. If the CBI has taken action against Hazra, how can he move about freely? asked Manoranjan Chatterjee, an investor. Investors became suspicious and a complaint was lodged with the police station, on the basis of which, he was arrested. 																								Inquiries revealed that Hazra was better known as a doctor in the neighbourhood, and he used to prescribe medicines to local people. He has admitted to the police that he was a quack, said police. He would thereby win peoples trust. 																								According to police, Hazra was earlier involved in such cases. He did the same in Metiabruz, where he duped people of a few lakhs. Police could not arrest him for want of evidence. 																								Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police, Howrah, said: We arrested the cheat and a case has also been filed against him. We wonder if he is linked with a larger gang.

 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Fire-fighters at work: Training the people																								The state fire department has joined hands with the city developers fraternity to roll out a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance community participation in fire-fighting and fire-safety awareness.																								Fire Week (starting April 14), to commemorate the devastating blaze during World War II in Bombay, will feature an exhibition and the release of a book addressing fire-fighting techniques and fire-safety measures. 																								Plans are also afoot to prepare a four-part educational television documentary with an active initiative from state fire minister Pratim Chatterjee.																								The exhibition will display all kinds of fire-fighting equipment and techniques, including modern combat systems installed in highrises the world over, smoke detectors, water curtains, hydrants, sprinkler systems and other contraptions to battle the blaze. Our aim is to sensitise the people on the need for community participation in fighting and preventing fires, says D.P. Biswas, deputy director, fire services.																								The fire department is also keen to produce a four-episode telefilm, which will show the causes and results of fires and ways to prevent and fight such fires, particularly in housing estates and high-risk buildings. The film, subject to government clearance, will be sponsored by Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India)-Bengal, supported by some individual builders. Besides live footage of famous fires around the world, the episodes will depict cadet training programmes at the Fire Fighting Institute started by the fire department at Behala, the only one of its kind in the country. 																								The film will also offer advice on fire-prevention methods from experts and portray reactions and views of prominent city-based architects and builders, as well as highrise residents and mall shoppers.																								Whenever theres a fire, more often than not the developer is made the scapegoat, even without a proper probe. This is not fair, since the residents should also be aware of their responsibilities and the need for good maintenance of the expensively installed fire-fighting gadgets, observes Pradip Kumar Chopra, honorary secretary, Credai-Bengal. Chopra feels with the plethora of highrises coming up in the city and the fire department not properly equipped to fight tall blazes from the outside, theres all the more reason for built-in prevention measures and to raise awareness levels.																								To mark Fire Week, the PS Group will release 100,000 copies of a booklet, How to prevent and fight fires in housing complexes. Published in English, Hindi and Bengali, and distributed free by the developing firm and the fire department, it aims to create awareness towards fire hazards among residents of housing complexes and the public in general, including shoppers in modern malls.

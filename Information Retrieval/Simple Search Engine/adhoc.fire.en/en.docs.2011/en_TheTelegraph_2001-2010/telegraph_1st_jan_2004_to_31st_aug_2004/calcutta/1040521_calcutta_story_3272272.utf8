 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Match photo with voter
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In the next elections, the count of false voters will see a drastic fall. Booth officials will not only be armed with a voters list, but also the photographs of individual voters. 																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said on Thursday that voters may have to be photographed afresh for the exercise. A pilot project is underway in a Salt Lake booth. 																								About 87 per cent of the electorate has voters identity cards. But only 17 per cent of the photographs have been digitised. We plan to retrieve the rest and digitise them. But if these cannot be retrieved, fresh photographs will have to be taken by digital camera. We will prepare a new list that will carry photographs of individual voters, Banerjee explained. It will enable officials to match the photo with the voter.

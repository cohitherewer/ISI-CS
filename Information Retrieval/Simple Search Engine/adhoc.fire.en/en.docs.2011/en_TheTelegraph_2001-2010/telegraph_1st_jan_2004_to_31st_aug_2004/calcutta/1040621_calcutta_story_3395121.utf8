 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Come July, ply-by-night litter service 
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Finally, Calcuttas civic authorities have woken up to the fact that in no civilised city is garbage cleared by day. So, from next month, the conservancy department has decided to clean the city at night. 																								The timings are yet to be finalised, but clean-up is tentatively scheduled between 10 pm and 6 am.																								According to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, in all the big cities around the world, conservancy and road-cleaning operations are carried out at night, when the roads are emptier, theres less traffic, and shops, establishments and bazaars are closed.																								We receive telephone calls and letters almost daily from citizens to discontinue clearing of vats during peak hours, the mayor disclosed.																								Motorists and bus passengers complain frequently about the trash that dropped off the stinking conservancy lorries. We have discussed the proposal with conservancy officers and they said night-sweeping was possible. Necessary circulars will be issued after the municipal commissioner returns, said mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb on Sunday.																								The city generates 2,700 tonnes of garbage a day and after collecting them from 600 vats spread across the city, they are dumped at Dhapa, on the eastern fringe of the city.																								Clearing the garbage is a huge dawn-to-dusk task for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, involving a collective effort of 15,000 civic and contractual staff and a fleet of 260 lorries daily, said chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar. 																								At present, roads are swept and garbage is cleared from vats from 6 am till the Dhapa dumping ground closes at 5 pm. 																								What about the door-to-door collection of garbage?																								Households will be asked to leave their litter on their front doorsteps in polythene packets in the evening, and conservancy workers will collect them, said mayor-in-council Deb. An emergency team, he said, will be kept on the ready for day service in the areas left out.																								In Bangalore and Hyderabad, too, night-sweeping has been introduced by the civic authorities to avoid problems by day, pointed out assistant director (conservancy) Swapan Mahapatra, who is now in Hyderabad. 																								Night service will make it possible to remove more garbage, as it will take almost half the time for a lorry to reach Dhapa and return, in the absence of traffic signals and vehicular traffic.

 															- Englishman shoots heritage				 	 The Raj Bhavan ballroom by Christopher Taylor 																								When Christopher Taylor photographs the grand ballroom of the Raj Bhavan, it turns into an image of time congealed, painted with all the myriad shades between black and white. The awe-inspiring columns look like they were moulded out of ivory and polished till they gleamed with the subdued glow of old marble. The chandelier becomes a dangler made of icicles. The floor turns into a lake frozen over, with mysteries lurking in its depths. The doors of the deepest sable quietly recede into the background, adding depth and volume to the masses of masonry.																								The 45-year-old photographer from the English resort town of Skegness, now settled in France, was in town till Monday evening to give finishing touches to his project on the colonial buildings of Calcutta. In his photographs, they appear without any human beings around or any trace of wear and tear inevitable in this anarchic city.																								Calcuttas colonial heritage is a rather unusual theme for this quiet man with intense eyes, better known for his simple (Taylors description) black-and-white photographs of Iceland, Chinese steles and insects performing little gestures. In his large but grubby room at the YMCA, on Chowringhee, that he seems to be very attached to, Taylor says he was not driven by nostalgia. It was more of a way to try and understand the building  a representation of a way of thinking, a demonstration of power. He is also intrigued by the way the British, through neo-classical architecture, tried to present themselves as the bearers of the Greek and Roman legacy.																								Notwithstanding the consummate artistry of his shots, Taylor had taken up photography by chance as a way of supplementing his pocket money. He was 16 then and he was one of the many schoolchildren hired by a company to take photos of holiday-makers that his subjects could buy if they wanted to. Later, when he studied zoology, he began to take a serious interest in photography. It is only in the last five-six years that photography has been his sole occupation.																								Before that, he had worked with computers in London and when he moved to France, he was employed with wine producers. He had, however, started exhibiting earlier. Taylor says he does no commercial work and depends on print sales or the occasional grant.																								He had begun with a simple camera. Now, he uses sheet film, a 20-year-old second-hand Rolliflex and also a larger studio camera, labelled Field camera, that gives him control over perspective. He often uses a tripod because the exposure could take a couple of minutes, depending on available light.																								He has visited India four times but he started working on his current series last year. Calcutta had stuck in his memory because of its British connection. Taylor wanted to avoid the exotic and wished to return to the colonial period, for it has affected British culture a lot. Its present aggressiveness could, perhaps, be traced to its past. Moreover, after all those years in France, I tend to see England like an outsider, he declares in English that has a French slant.																								Taylor has taken photographs of several Calcutta landmarks, such as Writers Buildings (corridors included), Eastern and South-Eastern Railway HQ, the GPO, Statesman House, Balmer Lawrie building, Treasury Building, Andrew Yule, St Pauls Cathedral and St Johns, St Josephs college and La Martiniere. More than the faade, Taylor is interested in going inside, deeper into the labyrinth. He would shoot during weekends when there would not be a soul around. Now he is in Mumbai on a similar project. 						 SOUMITRA DAS

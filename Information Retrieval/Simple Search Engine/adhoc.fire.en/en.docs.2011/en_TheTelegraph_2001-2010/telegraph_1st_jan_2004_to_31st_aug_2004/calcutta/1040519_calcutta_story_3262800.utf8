The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Storm shifts course, rain hopes fade
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The cyclonic storm that had formed over the Bay of Bengal on Monday moved on Tuesday towards the Myanmarese coast, taking with it hopes of some rain on a sweltering Calcutta.																								Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore said on Tuesday afternoon that the cyclone lay 400 km south of Calcutta. It is expected to reach the Myanmarese coast by Wednesday or Thursday, they added.																								So, in the next two days, there is very little chance of any cyclone-induced rain. The maximum temperature is expected to range between 36 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius, said Tapan Kumar Basu, director in charge of the weather section.																								The cyclonic storm over the Bay was forecast to cross the north Orissa-Bengal coast, between Paradip and Calcutta, by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, bringing high-velocity winds and a heavy downpour.																								On Monday night, it had remained stationary about 400 km south-east of Balasore. The cyclone was expected to intensify and move in a north-westerly direction. But gradually, it shifted direction, an official said.																								However, the Met office has not withdrawn the warning issued to fishermen in the high seas along the Bengal coast. The warning stays in place till Wednesday morning. 																								Officials expect the monsoon to arrive in Calcutta and its adjoining areas on time, by June 8.

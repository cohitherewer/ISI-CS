 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Dream town, gang haven
 																											- Showcases Rajarhat, Saltlec allow crime a free run A STAFF REPORTER																								Saltlec and Rajarhat New Town, the new showpieces of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, are tainted by crime. 																								Several gangs operating in these areas should be giving the chief minister sleepless nights. For, they have become havens for a gamut of crimes such as murder, extortion and flesh trade. And this, with protection from the ruling party. The government is now on a clean-up drive.																								The man who heads this crime kingdom, covering Rajarhat, Salt Lake and Lake Town, is one-armed Haatkata Dilip. He was behind the killings at a musical soiree at Nayapatty, in the added area of Bidhannagar in June. 																								We are conducting raids to arrest Dilip, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.																								Dilip Banerjee, alias Tapai, alias Haatkata Dilip, had a meteoric rise in the world of crime. Police files reveal that one-armed Dilip was originally a resident of Basak Bagan, in Lake Town. Tapai and his brother Bapai were good students and basically mild-natured.																								Things went wrong after their father, Jatan Banerjee, drove out their mother and shacked up with another woman, a senior district police officer said. Dilip took to alcohol and was gradually sucked into the world of crime. 																								Dilip and his friend Nana Roy, a resident of Green Park, became the henchmen of Pinaki Mitra, a criminal operating in the area. 																								On August 13, 1996, Dilip lost his right arm while he and his friend Badal were making crude bombs.																								The same year, he was arrested in Ajmer Sharif, in Rajasthan, in connection with a dacoity and was imprisoned in Tihar jail. Later, Calcutta Police took him in custody and he was released in 1998. 																								After he returned, Dilip fell out with Pinaki and formed his own gang with criminals from across the city. Gopal Tiwari of Burrabazar, Ram Singh of Patipukur, Apu and Duli of Sodepur, Kalu of Tollygunge and Raju banded up with him.																								Dilip started extorting promoters and hotels along VIP Road and also began operations inside Salt Lakes Sector V and Rajarhat through his accomplices, Saheb Mondal, Hasa and others. 																								On July 29, he was arrested by Lake Town police in Salt Lake while his gang was getting together to commit a dacoity.																								In 1998, he was arrested on four occasions by Lake Town police and once by Bidhannagar (North) police. The following year, too, he was arrested by Barasat and Rajarhat police on charges of committing murder. 																								In 2000, he was arrested in a shady hotel on VIP Road. He was accompanied by a woman and he had with him a pistol of Italian make. 																								He was arrested again in 2004 and was released before the civic body elections. On the night of the musical soiree at Nayapatty, Dilip and his accomplices had drinks at Hotel Merlin Park and later, allegedly went on a shooting spree, in which three persons were killed.

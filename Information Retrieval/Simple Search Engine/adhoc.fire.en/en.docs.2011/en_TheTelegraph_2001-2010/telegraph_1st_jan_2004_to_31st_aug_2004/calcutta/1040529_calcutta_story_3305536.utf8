 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Cops gun sparks mob fury
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out in front of the American Center following an altercation between SFI activists and the police on Friday afternoon. The situation worsened when a traffic sergeant whipped out his service revolver to control the demonstrators. 																								The activists blocked Jawaharlal Nehru Road for more than half-an-hour, to protest police quot;high-handedness quot;.																								The incident took place when SFI supporters gathered before the American Center around 4.30 pm to stage a demonstration against the torture of Iraqi nationals by the US army. 																								A scuffle ensued when the demonstrators attempted to break the police barricade. Police resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the agitators, who retaliated with brickbats, according to an official of Shakespeare Sarani police station.																								Wireless division traffic sergeant Somenath Mukherjee lost his cool when his uniform was soiled by an egg chucked by the SFI supporters. He whipped out his revolver and took aim at an agitator standing a few feet away.																								On seeing the sergeant brandishing his revolver, the students turned violent. They smashed through the barricade and squatted on the road, throwing vehicular traffic totally out of gear on the busy thoroughfare, the official added.																								The situation was brought under control after senior police officers arrived on the spot and assured the agitators that they would look into the circumstances that prompted the sergeant to flash his revolver.

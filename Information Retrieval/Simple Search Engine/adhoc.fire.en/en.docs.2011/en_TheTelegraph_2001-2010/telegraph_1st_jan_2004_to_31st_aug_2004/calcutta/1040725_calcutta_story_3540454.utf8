Party Hopping Alesia Raut does a Bhangra jig at the Punjabi nite at Cloud 9 and (right) model Sanjukta flaunts a Krishna Mehta outfit at the High Street Fashion at Tantra. Pictures by Rashbehari Das  The bar top at Tantra transformed into a high street of fashion on Friday night as the first episode of The Parks new fashion series kicked off with designer Krishna Mehta from Mumbai.Last years runaway hit Midnight Fashion series was reborn as High Street Fashion and, this time, the show started a good two hours before midnight, giving weekend partying quite an early start.The crowd started trickling in 8.30 pm onwards and by the time the models hit the ramp, the night-club was full up with regular party-hoppers as well as some serious fashion connoisseurs, who had gathered to catch a glimpse of the club wear collection.National models Vidisha Pavate, Jesse Randhawa and their local counterparts Sanjukta, Shreshtha, Joy and Amrita paraded on the bar in a riot of colours unleashed by Krishna, with some smartly cut tunics, skirts and trousers. The show lasted for 30 minutes only, but while it did, it kept the crowd enthralled. After the interlude, it was time for regular Friday night fun on the dance floor.To be held on a Friday of every month for the next six months, the event will feature the works of designers who are into the club wear and party wear scene. The shows will be followed by an exhibition of the clothes at the hotel. The catwalk is meant to be fun for the guests, while the exhibition is to be a more serious designer-buyer meet. While Midnight Fashion showcased the works of celebrated designers like Manoviraj Khosla, Satya Paul and Monapali, this year one might expect to see the creations of Manish Arora, Aki Narula and Malini Ramani among others.Balle balle bash Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was at Cloud 9 on Friday night, smiling and greeting everyone at the entrance. If not in the flesh, he was there in cardboard.The resto bar was celebrating Punjabi night, and a life-size cut-out of Mr PM, hands folded in greeting, was set up at the entrance. The stunt ensured that everyone at the balle balle night came in with a huge smile or a stream of giggles.Once inside, dhaba-style interiors continued the theme. Sugarcane juice and charpoys provided rest for weary dancers, waiters were dressed in colourful silk lungis and kurtas, with slap-on beards and turbans.But the biggest treat of the evening was soni kudi Alesia Raut, model and item-girl, taking over the floor with guests and dancing to the tune of the video in which she stars, Meri beri ke ber, and other remixes.I just love to dance and would love to become like Helen, though reaching her heights will not be easy, confided the babe, who effortlessly sent all the men in the house into a tizzy.Dressed in a black outfit, the baby-faced Russian-Indian glam doll tried to work her charm over the temporary dhaba from the DJ console. Wake up Calcutta, let me see your hands up in the air, she screamed over the microphone. The comfortably numb Calcutta crowd may not have obliged, but they sure liked what they saw. Philippino crooners at the Red and Hot night at Polo ClubCupid strikes at red hot do  Red and Hot night at Polo Club at The HHI had some hot guests dropping in on Friday night. Leading the list was the cast of the film Hothat Neerar Jonyo, amongst whom was the citys most talked about couple of the weekend  soon-to-be-wed Bikram Ghosh and Jaya Seal. Stopping by at around 9.30 pm, they soon headed off for yet another party. Actor Arindam Sil, director Subrata Sen and the producers also went along. Cupid was firmly by the lovers side, with the tabla player and actress sticking to each other for most of their half-hour stay.Starry starry niteIt takes three to tango. If ever there was any doubt about the numbers needed to have a blast, it was buried under catcalls and claps when Koneenica Banerjee, Rupa Ganguly and June hit the floor at Moksh late on Friday. The girls-just-wanna-have-fun brigade chose the 2nd Bangla Telefilm Festival party hosted by Rollicks Shanti Agarwal to dance up a storm, as the music ranged from raunchy (Kaanta Laga) to retro. Others getting into the swing of things: Shankar, Sabyasachi Chakraborty and wife, Anjan Dutt, Debolina and Anindita Sarbadhicary. Party Pooper The space crunch at city discos is leading to a different kind of crunch under party-hopper feet. The number of tumblers that take a tumble every jam-packed weekend is on the up. Apart from the digit-loss phobia, making a little more toe room for night animals also makes long-run biz sense. New crystal, after all, aint cheap.

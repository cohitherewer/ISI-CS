 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Damaged roof hits classes at Presidency
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A portion of a century-old building in Presidency College  the institution availing of maximum maintenance grant from the state government  was sealed after chunks of concrete fell off its roof in January.																								The 93-year-old Baker Building houses the colleges physics department, including two lecture theatres and a library-cum-seminar hall.																								We had to seal the two lecture theatres  one on the ground floor and the other on the first floor of Baker Building  and a seminar-cum-library recently when chunks of concrete started falling off the roof. We decided to stop using the rooms for the safety of the students, said Presidency College principal Amitava Chatterjee.																								A team of officials from the public works department (PWD), entrusted with the upkeep of the building, visited the college campus after the incident, Chatterjee said. In its report, the PWD has suggested immediate renovation of Baker Building and the laboratories housed in Derozio Building.																								Cost of the entire renovation project has been pegged at over Rs 2 crore. The college will approach the government to get the funds sanctioned, the principal added.																								Students alleged that the sudden closure of the classrooms, especially the library, was taking a toll on regular classes. 																								Teachers of the physics department, too, are worried over the disruption in normal schedule and feel the space crunch might aggravate further in a few months when the first year classes start.																								But repair work at one of the lecture theatres is already complete. We will resume classes there soon, Chatterjee said.																								Presidency teachers have, however, complained of negligence on the part of the authorities in maintaining a routine check on the buildings. 																								Our college gets the highest amount of funds from the government. It is surprising to see roofs coming down in such an institution. It shows the authorities are not doing justice to the funds they get, said a teacher.																								Presidency College receives a government grant of over Rs 60 lakh every year for maintenance of the campus, sources in the government said. Of the more than 340 colleges across the state getting financial aid from the government, Presidency draws the highest amount. Flights cancelled: Air  Sahara cancelled four flights from Calcutta on Saturday.  An airline spokesperson said flights on the Calcutta-Delhi  via Gorakhpur and Lucknow, Calcutta-Guwahati, Calcutta-Delhi  and Calcutta-Bhubaneswar routes were suspended for technical  reasons.

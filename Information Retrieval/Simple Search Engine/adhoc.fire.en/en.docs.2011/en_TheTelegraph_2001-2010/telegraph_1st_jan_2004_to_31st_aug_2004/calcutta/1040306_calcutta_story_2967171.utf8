The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 City Lights
				 Duo on Birbhum Holi highSuman Ranganathan(top) and Perizaad Zorabiyan: Double bill Perizaad Zorabian and Suman Ranganathan will be adding to the throng of Tollywood and Bollywood stars and starlets crowding Birbhum. The two faces from Bollywood are joining forces for a script from Bengal, registered in Mumbai and looking for an international release.				 																																																											Devaki is the working title of the film scripted by Renu Roy and produced by K.D. Singh. Shooting started on Friday night, with the two stars arriving on Holi morning, to head straight for the Bengal-Jharkhand border.				 																																																											Suman plays the title role of Devaki, in the film in Hindi and English being directed by Bappaditya Bandopadhyay. 				 																																																											Perizaad is Nandini, an urban woman frustrated with her life. She goes to the village, where she meets Devaki, a tribal girl, who is being forced to marry a 70-year-old man. While Nandini tries to stop it, when she comes back to the city, she experiences a bit of the same thing herself.				 																																																											The film traces the parallels in both their lives, and how both women are treated as commodities, explains Keshav Roy, who has collaborated with Toubro Media Ltd on the project.				 																																																											Perizaad is clearly excited about the earthy character she is to play. This is the most serious role I have ever attempted, says the actress who is gearing up for 20 days shooting in the village. I have always played a very metro kind of girl.				 																																																											She was sweet-talked into the role by Keshav. I have never been told a film could not be made unless I agreed to take up the part, laughs the lively star of films like Joggers Park and Mumbai Matinee.				 																																																											 But a read through the very real script, which shows life as is was enough to convince her that Nandini was worth a chance.				 																																																											The subtle story line has strains of a commercial film as well, with a soundtrack  being composed by Bikram Ghosh  including a couple of item numbers. A guest appearance by one of the big three names is also something, Keshav promises, worth watching out for.				 																																																											Local talent will also find screen space in the Rs 2-crore production. Poonam Singh (last seen in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer), Renu Roy, Ashok Singh and George Baker (playing Perizaads father) will feature in the film scheduled for completion mid-May.				 																																																											Simultaneous releases in Mumbai, Calcutta, the US and UK are being planned, in association with a Mumbai distributor. Though not standard festival fare, Keshav is eyeing a place in the Indian Panorama.				 																																																											The village could be any Indian village, and the locale was selected because of its virgin, untouched beauty. There are also schedules lined up at Haldia, Calcutta and Mumbai. Chameli and Mondo Meyer Upakhyan are the most recent examples of feature films about women in prostitution. Are film-makers doing justice to their subject, or are they merely looking through a romanticised lens? 				 																																																											That was one question amongst many raised at Nandan III on Wednesday, at a forum organised to commemorate International Sex Workers Day. The subject of the discussion, arranged by the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, was media and its representation of sex workers. The various definitions of media and its use in spreading the word on tolerance, and building awareness about prevention of HIV/AIDS were at the core of the two-hour interaction.				 																																																											There has been some good representation by the media, and some bad, felt Sonali Mukherjee, deputy director of the state board. Films like Buddhadeb Dasguptas Mondo Meyer Upakhyan were controversial in their portrayal, she said, adding that the way out may be to let the girls speak for themselves.				 																																																											The news media should play a more active role in breaking stereotypes, instead of playing the blame game. HIV/AIDS, Mukherjee said, was still perceived as a disease spread by women in prostitution. But it is everyones problem and calls for a more sustained campaign.				 																																																											Film-maker Ashok Vishwanathan agreed that there had been no mature depiction of the problems and perspectives of women in prostitution, citing Chameli as an example. There are real questions that need to be asked: Do sex workers need to be given a licence? Is their work as important as other work?				 																																																											International Womens Day is on March 8, and the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society is joining hands with Thoughtshop Foundation for another session of That Takes Ovaries. To be emceed by Sohini Sengupta Halder, women are invited to share their real life tales against prejudice, also at Nandan III, 4.15 pm. Rituparna Sengupta in Mondo Meyer Upakhyan: Medium with a message This Sunday evening, like every month-end the last two years, Srijans forum, Music from Distant Shores, presented the life and music of one of the greatest song-writing duos of America, Steely Dan. The Srijan rooftop was packed with the talented and, despite the spectre of exams, the creative young. Like Bertie DSilva, Mel Samuel, the Braganza family from the old guard. Like Taj, Siddharth, Utsav from the young. 				 																																																											Skinny Alley was so unbelievable that singling out any one musician would be unfair. The lead guitar by Amyt Dutta and the bass by Gyan Singh were superb and made us drown in crescendos of the chords that Steely Dan had perfected  gliding effortlessly through all their complexities. Jayashrees vocals were so wholesome that one could see the music build up in her eyes. And Jeffrey Menezes keyboards were also wonderfully supportive.				 																																																											But it was drummer Jeffery Rikh whose beat and singing seemed to bring alive Steely Dan on the rooftop. Gathering tears in Reeling. Watching the sun go brown in King of the World. Remaining tied to the mast in Home at Last. Theres no escape from the Rajas of Erase in Godwhacker. Song after song, from their first album, to its 2003 release. And the little they might have lacked by way of horns and of orchestral arrangements was more than made up for by sheer force of emotion. Also helped, no doubt, by the generosity of Congo Square, Calcuttas leading promoters of jazz, due to which Srijan could hire a fitting sound system.				 																																																											Surjit Singhs researched presentation on Dans history was informative and precise, interwoven with live excerpts from radio interviews, keeping all amused with interesting trivia. Like a garbage can lid being used as the percussion instrument in Josie. Or the words they stab it with their steely knives in the Eagles song Hotel California being included as a compliment to the band.				 																																																											 Basant Rungta Spielbergs movies have downloaded the entire family of dinosaurs in our viewing arena. If Dino has become a favourite on Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel came up with When Dinosaurs Roamed. The popularity of the mini-series has now prompted the channel to launch the animation special Dinosaur Planet. 				 																																																											In each one-hour episode, the viewers will follow the adventures of a dinosaur character in the prehistoric world, struggling for survival during the end of the Cretaceous period (85 to 65 million years ago), explained paleontologist Scott Sampson, who flew down to India for the launch of the series earlier this week. 				 																																																											Narrated by actor Christian Slater, the show will blend cinematic story-telling with the latest paleontological evidence. Watch out for a weekly ringside view of the drama in the lives of the amazing creatures on Wednesdays at 10 pm on Discovery.

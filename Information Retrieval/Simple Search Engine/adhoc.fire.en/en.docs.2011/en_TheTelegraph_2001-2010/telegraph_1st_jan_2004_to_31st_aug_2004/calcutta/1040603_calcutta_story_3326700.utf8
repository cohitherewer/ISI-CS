  Green drive: A rally by school students against the use of plastic items at Botanical Gardens in Shibpur. A Telegraph picture  Nowadays, most parents send their kids below five years of age to pre-schools so that they inculcate school-going habits. These kids need more care and affection than students of any other age.  Sarika Sultana, a four-year-old student of a school on Karaya Road, was reportedly beaten up by her teacher for her failure to answer a question addressed to her in Urdu (School a three-day trauma, May 1). Can the allegations of a child of her age against her teacher on the very first day of joining school be treated as entirely false? Whatever be the medium of instruction in the school, how can a teacher expect a girl aged four, whose mother-tongue is Bengali, to answer a question in Hindi or Urdu from the very beginning? If the teachers are not conversant with Bengali, why are such students admitted there in the first place?  Punishing children at a young age gives them a wrong impression about their centre of learning. This drills in them a fear psychosis that takes deep root in their consciousness. We want to spread education in our country, and reduce the number of school drop-outs, which is the biggest impediment to the achievement of this goal. But the treatment meted out to students by some teachers leaves a lot to be desired. Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
Behala. It was really disappointing that the condition of Botanical Garden, which has a rare collection of trees, is deteriorating (Revival module for ailing Botanical Garden, May 4). The garden is one of its kind in the country. People at the helm of affairs should not be passive spectators to the downward trend. An entry fee will keep out the undesirable visitors to the garden. Rabindra Nath Kar, 
Sankar Ghosh Lane.Given the increasing rate of crime against women like rape, molestation and eve-teasing, it is apt that those who strangle the few brave voices of protest be dealt with in the severest possible manner (Molest protester-killers get life term, May 1). Prahlad Agarwala, 
Majdia, Nadia. Kudos for highlighting the revival of endoscopy services in the ENT department of SSKM Hospital. This facility could be of great help in treating complicated cases. The article Gadget boon at hospital wing, May 3, focused on unutilised equipment as well. It is appreciable that the hospital superintendent is putting the cardio-thoracic surgery departments gadgets to use in the ENT department. The authorities of other hospitals should take a leaf out of his book. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum. Women are increasingly refusing offers to take up teaching assignments beyond city limits, which is leaving a large number of posts vacant (She SLETs better, lets job go, May 4). Nothing can be done unless men do well enough to get the job offers from district colleges. Why are men performing miserably in humanities? Sunil Banerjee, 
VIP Road. Apropos the report Values and vernacular, in a class package, May 5, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture at Gol Park is doing a really good job. The institute has also been teaching a one-year advance (special) course apart from the Bengali junior and senior courses. I appeal to the principal to arrange two classes a week for the advance course so that it can be completed in six months. Md Ayub, 
Bright Street. It is shocking how cabbies have the guts to destroy a no parking board (Taxi stand din sullies library ambience, May 1). It is time to discipline the taximen and the errant police officers in league with them. S. Banerjee, 
VIP Road. The solution to the problem cited in Schools in counsellor crisis, May 3, may lie in training telecounsellors to deal with problems students most often encounter, while referring the more serious cases to professionals. It is not sensible that a professional therapist should have to explain to students and parents things like how weakening concentration goes hand in hand with approaching exams and how to respond to this experience. Brendan MacCarthaigh, 
SERVE.

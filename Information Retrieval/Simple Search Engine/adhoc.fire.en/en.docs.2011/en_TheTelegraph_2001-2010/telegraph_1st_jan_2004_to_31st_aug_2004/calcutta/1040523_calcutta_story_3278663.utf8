	Source: Same as iPod																								It doesnt get better or cooler or handier. Apples iPod defines what a digital music player should be. And to put it bluntly, if you dont have one  or at least dont have your eyes on one  youre simply not in the zone.																								Unlike a personal CD player (such as discman), where you have to lug around your favourite CDs along with the player, all you need to carry is the iPod  the music is within.																								Lighter than two CDs, able to hold up to 10,000 songs (thats four weeks of music played continuously) or thousands of digital photos, works as a personal voice recorder, syncs as smoothly with Macintosh as with Windows. What else can you possibly want from your pocketbook player?																								A smaller, lighter and cuter version of course! So, not content with the original iPod, Apples design team launched the mini iPod in January this year.																								But that comes later. The original iPod first. The key to everything Apple is the simplicity in design, be it in case of software like iTunes and the Mac operating system itself, or hardware like the Apple desktop and laptop computers (the range of iMacs and Powerbooks).																								The iPod is no exception. The Touch Wheel makes scrolling through large music collections quick and easy, and the all-touch interface enhances durability and sensitivity. LCD (liquid crystal display) screen and buttons with backlight boost visibility, particularly in low-light conditions.																								The player  in 15, 30 and 45 gigabyte (GB) capacities  supports music in popular formats like MP3 (up to 320 kbps), WAV (non-compressed wave audio files, the way music is stored on audio CDs) and Apples own advanced audio coding (AAC) compression format. Graphic equalisers help you switch the settings to Rock, Latin, Pop or anything else, depending on what youre listening to.																								Download your favourite tunes from the increasingly popular legal download services, or rip and store your own CDs. Sadly, legal music download services like Apples iTunes or the new, legal avatar of Napster dont extend their services beyond the US, yet. But you can try www.allofmp3.com  a Russian site with a huge collection of high-quality MP3s across genres and ages for a price, or www.mp3.com  free, but with mostly little known, unsigned bands.																								Syncing the iPod with the PC is childs play through high-speed data-transfer systems like FireWire and USB 2.0. An entire album can be loaded onto the iPod in five seconds.																								Each time you plug the iPod to your PC, the iTunes software checks for additions in the playlist and updates the iPod accordingly.All ears																								Its the best thing to have happened to music, gushes Supriya Chatterjee, an iPod fan in Salt Lake. I have the choice of listening to any type of music that I have downloaded at the touch of a button, or, in this case, at the touch of a touchpad.																								The carry-your-music-wherever-you-go concept floored Supriya. Unlike the walkman and the discman where you have to physically remove and replace a CD or cassette to continue listening, the iPod provides uninterrupted music.																								But she has minor complaints, too. The 15 GB model that I own is prone to scratches and if youre not careful, the Touch Wheel can move faster than your fingers!																								Who better to know the virtues of travelling light and travelling right than todays cricketers? Left-arm spinner Murali Karthik is an iPod freak. Its simply fantastic, he feels. His iPod is a must-feature in his kit, whether its cricket at home or abroad. I use Bang amp; Olufsen headphones with the player, which only add to the magic, says Karthik, allowing this correspondent to plug on.																								If youre someone who looks for add-ons in everything, iPod has them too. Theres a sleep timer and alarm clock (choose Mozart or Madonna to wake up to), contacts, calendar, to-do lists and even games like Music Quiz, Solitaire, Brick and Parachute. A note reader lets you download text-based information  from nightlife guides to news articles  and read it on screen.Mini magic																								Finally, on to the latest addition to the iPod family, the iPod mini. Everything you love about the iPod just got tinier is the catch-line. And its true. Unlike its single-colour big brother, this one comes in five fruity colours  silver, gold, blue, pink and green. iPod mini features an anodised aluminium case that resists stains and scratches. The case weighs almost nothing, but protects the player in your pocket, purse or backpack.																								It holds less than the iPod (1,000 songs only!), but lasts eight hours on a single four-hour battery charge and provides over 25 minutes of skip protection, just like the bigger version.																								The Click Wheel, with buttons underneath, replaces the Touch Wheel here, providing enhanced durability and sensitivity. The Click Wheel makes the best use of the miniscule space and lets you scroll single-handedly through all 1,000 songs. 																								Both FireWire and USB 2.0 cables, for transferring music, are bundled with the iPod mini.																								So, plug on and smile.						SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Saddam in survival battle Doctors waive fee for boy 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Saddam lies in his hospital bed. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Where will our Saddam Hussein go?																								He was born in 1992, in the times of the Gulf war, and was named Saddam Hussein. Today, he is engaged in a grim battle of survival.																								Calcuttas Saddam, only 12 years old, met with a near fatal accident when he found himself maimed by a tazia during this years Muharram, at Watgunge, on March 2. 																								Now recuperating in a hospital bed, the Class V student of a local school recounted the horrible moment: It was early morning as I accompanied my friends to a pond where the tazias were being taken for a ritual. I dont know how a sharp edge of one of the tazias pierced my abdomen.																								Immediately after the accident, the family moved him to a private hospital and admitted him under paediatric surgeon Ashoke Kumar Basu. We can barely make ends meet with our paltry earnings. But when the bills rose to Rs 18,000 in a day, we decided to move Saddam out of the hospital, recalled his uncle Zafar Imam.																								Imam then took him to another nursing home, where the authorities asked for a hefty fee for an expensive operation to be carried out immediately.																								We pleaded that we didnt have the money to pay. We requested them to consider our case, but no one would even listen to us. So, we had to move him out, recalled Zafar, who struggles to make ends meet.																								Saddams condition was deteriorating rapidly and Zafar tried in vain to get some help from other quarters.																								The family than decided to turn to surgeon Ashoke Basu. He had been very kind and so, we decided to seek his help again, said Zafar.																								On March 5, three days after the accident, Saddam landed up at Park Clinic, where the authorities decided to carry out the operation for free.																								He was again admitted under Ashoke Basu, who examined him and found his condition to be serious. His liver, spleen and pancreas had suffered serious damage.																								We rushed him to the operating table and first sucked out a lot of blood and fluid. We then carried out extensive repairs work to save his life, said Basu.																								Saddam was shifted to a bed in the Park childrens ward, which has been his home since. 																								The entire team that worked to save Saddam has waived the fees. He is now better, and will be released in a weeks time. But he still needs medical attention for a few more months, added Subir Chatterjee, paediatric surgeon and founder trustee of the hospital.																								The hospital has also waived the bills, amounting to Rs 48,000. But Saddams struggles will not end. He needs Rs 20,000 a week to help him recuperate once he is out of the hospital. 																								We dont how to manage that, said uncle Zafar.

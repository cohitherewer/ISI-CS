The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Donkey lifeline for a Howrah hamlet
 															- BEASTS OF BURDEN SOLE VEHICLES FOR TRANSPORT OF MEN amp; MATERIALS BHAJAN GANGULY MOVERS amp; SHAKERS: Sheikh Abdul Aziz with one of his pack of transporters. A Telegraph picture 																								While most metros live life in the fast lane, a few kilometres from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees seat of power, life continues to move  literally  at a donkeys pace.																								Welcome to the dusty bylanes of Bhagabatipur, in Sankrail, on the outskirts of Howrah. Here, as in the Middle Ages, donkeys are still the only mode of commuting, or of transporting goods. 																								Narrow and muddy kutcha roads, sandwiched between corridors of mud houses, paddy fields and country folk riding donkeys  it almost calls for a willing suspension of disbelief that such a place exists so close to Calcutta. Ai Kalu, tara-tari kar, chal chal (Come on Kalu, move fast),  the words are enough to take first-timers to the village by surprise. 																								Reality strikes only when one chances upon Sheikh Abdul Aziz, with his herd of five donkeys and a horse in tow. 																								Each donkey can carry between 22 and 30 bricks and two gunny bags of sand at a time. Except for iron rods, they can carry anything, said 82-year-old Aziz. He is originally from Uttar Pradesh, but was born and brought up in Howrah after his father, a porter by profession, came to Howrah in search of work during the Raj. He brought with him a few donkeys.																								I was told that he came here when the Howrah bridge was under construction, said Aziz, stroking his white beard. Since then, Aziz and his family have continued providing this unique transport service in Mahishgoat, Bhagabatipur and Kajipara, in Sankrail, with their donkey battalion  Bachcha, Rancho, Rabi, Geri, Kalu and Lalu. On any given day, the animals earn Aziz anywhere between Rs 300 and 350. 																								They are intelligent. Once the destination is shown to them, they can reach the spot without any one leading them, Aziz adds proudly.																								Local resident Prafulla Hudati recalls how the people of the locality were against Aziz staying in Bhagabatipur when he arrived with his beasts of burden a few years ago. I supported Aziz and said the animals could help the residents to commute, Hudati said. In fact, Hudati is so enamoured of the donkey service that he provides the animals with free accommodation on a plot that he owns.

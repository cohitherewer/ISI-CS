The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Mega mart in new garb
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Whiteway Laidlaw, Hall amp; Anderson, Army amp; Navy Stores and of course, Spencers... 																								Calcutta, which pioneered the departmental store format in the country and once boasted the largest among such outlets in Asia, will be very much at the heart of a retail push-plan of RPG Enterprises, which has moved to raise the Spencers brand from the dead.																								Re-christening its Giant brand as Spencers Hypermarket, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka on Wednesday promised to change the citys food-shopping habits through consistent quality and aggressive pricing. 																								Goenka referred to the strong brand equity and recall, particularly in the 25-35 age group of Spencers as the principal reason for the name change.																								The brand will be used by the Great Wholesale Club Ltd, and Calcutta is likely to have its maiden Spencers Hypermarket in the second quarter of 2005-06, a 50,000-sq-ft anchor in Mani Square, on the Bypass. 																								The citys second Spencers in South City will be the biggest in the chain, spread across 85,000 sq ft. The first of the 15 outlets tied up till now, will roll out in Visakhapatnam on September 17, while nine more are under negotiation.																								This would have significant strategic value in the long-term plans of RPG Retail. It is really exciting that the Grand Old Lady comes back in style into the Indian retail environment, said Raghu Pillai, president and chief executive, retail sector, RPG Enterprises. 																								The expansion of RPG Retail will be in line with the 100-year-old legacy of Spencers, which at one point had stores from Rawalpindi to Calcutta.																								The RPG stable is keen to set up a Spencers in Rajarhat as well. Were looking at four, maybe five, outlets in Calcutta, and theres a possibility that we might go it alone in Rajarhat and will approach the housing minister for land, said Goenka, a touch concerned about the delay in the Mani Square project. 																								Close on the heels of the hypermarket experience, the group plans to bring into town its Rs 350-crore-turnover supermarket chain FoodWorld. We feel Calcutta can absorb 35 to 40 FoodWorld outlets and we would like to start in 2006-07, Goenka said.																								From TVs to tomatoes, the Spencers hypermarket chain promises to cater to the entire basket of everyday needs of middle-income households, with a sharp pricing formula.

	Feng Shui 
	Pinky Kapoor Classrooms are best located in the east as the rising solar energy here is conducive to a childs mental growthThe quality of education received during the formative years of a childs life depends largely on the environment in which he receives his initial tutoring. The school should be in a good location that has positive chi. It should be away from the negative energies of a hospital, graveyard or police station. The school should not be hit by a poison arrow such as a straight road, lamp-post or even the sharp edge of a neighbouring building. This is because when children walk into the school, these harmful objects hit them from behind. A tall tree right in front of the gate shouldnt obstruct the chi flowing towards the school. There should be a playground or open space at the front where the energy can collect and then flow into the school. 																								Since a school is an educational institution, extra care should be taken to ensure that the north-east sector, which is connected with education, is intact. If this particular area is missing, students will feel uncomfortable and even the best of teachers will not be able to impart their knowledge to the students. The plot of land on which the school is built, should also be regular in shape. If not, then the shape should be made regular by erecting a three to four feet-high wall all around or by planting hedges and shrubs within the property. 																								If it is a very narrow plot where the ratio is more than 1:2, a sense of balance should be created by demarcating it the aforementioned way or by constructing two individual buildings within the plot. But it shouldnt resemble a long railway compartment, where the energy travelling is negative and fast, like a bullet. The building should be constructed in the south-west of the property as this area has a lot of stability.																								It is always advisable to have the garden or open playground in the north-east of the plot with metal swings and slides placed in the west or the north-west. This area should not be blocked by any kind of heavy construction as it is connected with the mind and education. Any blockage here will create pressure on the management and students. 																								The building should also be regular in shape. In fact, each and every room, be it the classrooms or the principals office, should be either square or rectangular with a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio. Even the corridors should not exceed this ratio, as children might tend to run too fast along with the swift-moving energy and fall. The assembly hall should be in the north-east and an image of Saraswati could be kept here. A three to four-foot podium is recommended for the teacher to help maintain discipline. The same area is excellent for holding prize distributions. 																								The floor above this area is best for a library while the classrooms are best located in the east as the rising solar energy here is conducive to a childs mental growth. The area should be well ventilated and overhead beams should be covered with a false ceiling to prevent downward pressure on the children. The blackboard should be in the east so that children can face this direction while being taught. The classroom should be painted in white, cream or pastel shades of blue and green. Soft boards displaying the childrens art work should be placed on the western wall as this direction is known as the lake of creativity. All the rooms should have an entrance from the north-east and the teacher shouldnt sit in line with the door, otherwise she will be hit by the incoming energy. 																								The principals office should be in the south-west sector as this enhances stability and longevity. Having a staff-room in the north-west is highly recommended. This sector will help keep the staff active and moving between their classes on time. Setting up an enquiry table in the south-east would be a good idea whereas admissions should take place in the northern sector of the building. Fees should be collected in the south-east sector and the days collection should be placed in a safe installed in the south-east corner opening towards the north. The canteen should be in the south. A swimming pool in the east or north is considered ideal but it should never be located at the rear, as this would be symbolic of drowning the school. 																								Tip of the week: 																								A large aquarium with gold fish in multiples of nine when kept in the east, north or south-east of the lobby area helps keep the children happy and enthusiastic about their studies.

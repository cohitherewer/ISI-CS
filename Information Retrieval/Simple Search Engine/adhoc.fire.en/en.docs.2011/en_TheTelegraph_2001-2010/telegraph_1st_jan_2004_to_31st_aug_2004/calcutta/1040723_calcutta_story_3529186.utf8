 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Address shift for flyover settlers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A vote costs Rs 2 lakh. What else can explain the Left Front governments delaying the Bondel Gate flyover for eight years? It refused to upset a votebank of 750, allowing the project to run up a cost escalation of Rs 15 crore.																								Now, under the aegis of local CPM legislator Rabin Deb, the state government has decided to rehabilitate the 150 tenant families who refused to budge at the upcoming Nonadanga housing project, under the Centres Valmiki Abas Yojana scheme.																								Work on the Rs 21-crore Bondel Gate flyover began in 1995. But because of frequent suspension of work due to agitations by the encroachers, the flyover is still far from complete and the project cost has soared to Rs 36 crore.																								Construction on the eastern flank of the rail tracks was completed about five years ago. But we have been facing hurdles in carrying out construction on the western flank, said public works department (PWD) minister Amar Choudhury. The railway authorities are now working to bridge the gap over the tracks.																								According to a senior PWD engineer, 58 families at 60, Bondel Road had been shifted to construct the approach road to the flyover. The main objective of the project, he explained, was to provide a third corridor to the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, after the Park Circus and Gariahat connectors.																								Construction of the road connecting the flyover with Rifle Range Road has been suspended because of encroachments. The PWD has already paid compensation to the owners of the structures but their tenants are now demanding rehabilitation.																								The landlords have received compensation but where will the tenants go? Altogether 150 tenant families live in those structures, said local MLA Deb. According to him, eight decks are to be cast on the western end of the gate to connect the flyover with Rifle Range Road, but only three of them have been cast.																								Casting the rest requires eviction of the tenants. I have taken up a scheme to rehabilitate them in flats at Nonadanga. Flats will be made available to them for Rs 30,000, Deb said. Since the Nonadanga project is not ready yet, the families will be given temporary shelter elsewhere. 																								Picnic Garden Road and GS Bose Road will be widened by the CMDA after the flyover is commissioned next year.

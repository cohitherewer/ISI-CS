 A STAFF REPORTERGREEN VIEWJune 2002: Petition filed by activist Subhas Dutta, alleging government failure in maintaining the beauty of the Maidan. The army was made party to the caseJuly 2002: The army files affidavit claiming control of the Maidan and holding government responsible for failure in its upkeepAugust 2002: State opposes army claim and argues that there is no need to take Fort William permission for holding rallies and fairsOctober 2002: Army tries to establish claim by furnishing a document of pre-Independence. Rejected by stateJuly 2003: Court raps state for failure to maintain the Maidan; asks it to take steps in collaboration with the armyAfter moving Calcutta High Court last month, seeking absolute administrative control over the Maidan, the army on Tuesday gave a demonstration of what it means by caring for the citys lungs.A decision to clean up a stretch of the Maidan, bordering Manohar Das Tarag, right up to Mayo Road, before the monsoon was finalised on Tuesday during discussions between Maj-Gen Z.U. Shah, GOC, Bengal area, and top officials of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government. 																								The armys proposal to clean up this stretch had been discussed several times before, but there had been no real action till Tuesday. The army last month had filed a petition in Calcutta High Court, seeking to be empowered to grant permission to political parties to hold rallies or organisations to hold events on the Maidan, including the Brigade Parade Grounds.																								The army had argued that it be allowed absolute control over the Maidan, also seeking modification of an earlier order that authorised the state government and its departments to look after affairs of the Maidan.																								The order had been passed in December in response to a petition filed by environment activist Subhas Dutta, demanding preservation of the Maidan.																								On Tuesday, it was decided in the office of chief secretary Asok Gupta that the state forest and transport departments, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would come together to implement the beautification project of the Manohar Das Tarag stretch. The army will coordinate the operation.																								The area looks like a slum these days. The matter was discussed earlier, too, but somehow, things did not work out. Of course, the question of money is there, but what is important is that the work is now expected to begin before the monsoon, Maj-Gen Shah said after the meeting. There will be some landscaping, and some planting of trees, he added.																								While the parks and gardens wing of the forest department will oversee planting of trees, the HRBC will take up cleaning, fencing and lighting, as well.																								GOC Shah on Tuesday reiterated the need to keep the Maidan free from criminal elements. The more patrolling there is, the better. Calcutta Police keeps a vigil in this zone, and we do discuss matters with them from time to time, he added.

 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Poison end to thwarted love
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 23-year-old man and his 25-year-old girlfriend ended their lives by consuming poison on Sunday evening at Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city. The girls father was against the match. 																								Rajesh Sarkar and Rinku Mondal grew up together in the same neighbourhood and attended the same school. They fell in love with each other and decided to tie the knot when they came of age. 																								A year ago, when Rajesh landed a clerical job in a private firm, he approached Rinkus parents. But Rinkus businessman father denied consent as Rajeshs family was not well off. 																								Rinkus father, Ratikanta, a well-known businessman in the locality, opposed the marriage as Rajesh did not have a promising career. He was also not quite happy about the fact that Rajesh was younger to his daughter. So, he looked around for a suitable boy, said circle inspector of Baruipur Sanjit Bhattacharya. 																								However, Rajesh and Rinku met every day and planned how they could get her parents consent. Rinku, however, was not aware of Ratikantas intentions till Sunday morning, when he invited his friend, a local businessman, to his house to get Rinku married to his son. 																								Yesterday, the marriage was finalised. As soon as she came to know of it, Rinku dashed off to Rajeshs house and told him about the development. She returned home and locked herself in her room. In the afternoon, her mother found Rinkus room locked from inside. As she peeped through the window, she found Rinku lying unconscious on the floor, Bhattacharya said on Monday.																								Rinku was rushed to Baruipur State General Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. When Rajesh came to know that Rinku was dead, he, too, took sleeping pills. His family members found him dead in his room in the evening, Bhattacharya added. 																								The residents of Nuridana and Haral were shocked to hear of the twin suicides. Rajeshs uncle, Brajen, was in a state of shock and could hardly speak. We were well aware of their friendship and hoped that they would be happily married, he lamented.

 Spare the rod: Teachers should be careful in dealing with children. (Below) The punished child at home The report Salute, conscientious constable really puts the Calcutta Polices traffic department to shame. When so many trained traffic personnel are being paid to manage the traffic, a young man in rags has to rescue an important crossing, like the AJC Bose Road-Elliot Road junction, from chaos. Working in full control, as a self-appointed traffic guard, the youth manned the traffic for a good two hours from around 11.30 am.  We salute the young man who regulated the traffic for a couple of hours with impeccable skill and wonderful aplomb and who was courageous enough to keep a police officers jeep waiting till its turn came with the rest of the vehicles, to allow Elliot Road-bound vehicles coming from Sealdah to pass first.  One has also to praise his sense of responsibility, as he stood his ground till a constable turned up, and then disappeared quickly from the spot, as a well-trained traffic official does after handing over duty to the next person in charge.  But the most pertinent question remains to be answered by the head of the traffic department why was the important crossing left unmanned for two long hours? And how many crossings are thus left unattended in the city? And why? Do the police expect such good samaritans to report for duty whenever the men paid for the job take a break? Is the accident graph on city roads not alarming enough for the men in white to pull up their socks? Sunil Banerjee, 
VIP Road. Apropos the report Cane fear keeps kid home (Feb. 20), it is sad and shocking to learn that a six-year-old girl was mercilessly caned by her teacher. Given that corporal punishment is not uncommon, the state education department and heads of all institutions should look into the matter and put an end to the sordid phenomenon. Prahlad Agarwala. 
Majdia, Nadia. No language is enough to condemn this punishment. This is taking the adage spare the rod and spoil the child to its cruelest extreme. Anil Kumar Sen, 
Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. The innocent and traumatised face of Ishani Bhattacharya shocked us into disbelief at the ferocity of an angry teacher, that too a woman. Does she behave in a similar fashion with her own kids at home or does she have none? Santosh Chakravarty, 
Unique Park. Whether it is a railway reservation counter, cricket match, cinema hall or even a hospital, touts are there to dupe us (Escape offer from tout trap, Feb. 25). It is wonderful that Dishari, a voluntary organisation, has come forward to provide support in hospitals. B. N. Bose, 
Dum Dum. Many people are approaching total deafness, but are not aware of it, as they manage by reading the lips of the speaker (Shut out sound to save the ears, Feb. 23). There are many eye treatment clinics in Calcutta but no dedicated ear treatment clinic. We would like to know about a cost-effective treatment to prevent such loss of hearing to a moderate degree. S. Mitra, 
Address not given. Apropos the report Cops have no time to keep kids off crime (Feb. 23), it is a matter of concern that juvenile crime has increased in recent times. It is well-known that children play a key role in facilitating crime. If counselling is provided to them in the shaping years, they can be rescued from a life of crime. The police would do well to find time to help these kids. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty Road. Apropos Merit list dumped but felicitations stay (Feb. 24), if the Board of Secondary Education and the HS Council continue to felicitate candidates securing high marks, it will frustrate the basic idea of shifting to the grade system and doing away with the merit list. Students getting high grades may be felicitated in their schools. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town. It is another instance of the sheer negligence of a bus driver (Child in bus, mother run over, Feb. 26). Chandan Ray, 
Sarsuna. Sandhya De was inadvertently referred to as Sandhya Roy in the Calcuttan of the Week column on March 18.

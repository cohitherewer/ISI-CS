The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Efficiency levels a mutiny on the 100-crore bounty
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Despite coming from a group that has made a habit of submitting deputations, this managed to stand out. It was against the two top officials in administration at Medical College and Hospital (MCH). Their crime: staying beyond their usual working hours every night for extra work.																								Believe it or not, working for long hours at the place that would be another All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) still invites deputations.																								It is the absence of work culture that is now the main worry for health department bosses, as they prepare to take MCH to AIIMS standards with the help of the Centres Rs 100-crore bounty. This single deputation  comprising thinly-veiled references to the MCH superintendent and his deputy  exposes the enormity of the task at hand, they say.																								To find out how much work was being done by the employees who raised the overtime queries, Metro visited the MCH on Monday. Predictably, those who raised a ruckus against their bosses long working hours were seen working overtime to shoo away patients from the emergency ward because it was a holiday (Monday was Id).																								Malati Naskar was one such victim. Brought there with a cardiac condition from Usthi, in South 24-Parganas, she was told to come back the next day. She will not die, a general-duty attendant brushed her off.																								No visitors slip was available that afternoon, forcing the securityman to let in everyone who demanded entry. I cannot stop them, as there is no means of checking the bona fides of visitors, he explained, before putting in his two bits on the hospital: Erokom bhabe cholle Medical uthe jabe (There wont be any MCH if things go on like this).																								Officials refused to blame only the Group D staff for the lack of work culture. An administrative official has a son studying in the neighbouring Hindu School. He goes home  in a hospital vehicle which he is not entitled to use  every afternoon with his son, said an official.																								The chain effect trickles straight down. An overwhelming majority of clerks, supposed to be at work by 9 am, come in an hour later. They are supposed to stay till 5 pm; very few do. What about doctors? Senior physicians are rarely found at the outpatients departments at 9 am, an official admitted.																								Its this work-culture problem that has forced the government to hive off many things  from the diet to the clean-up job to security  to private agencies. The government spends about a crore every year on this outsourcing, said a Writers Buildings source.																								This talk of upgrade without a dramatic rise in efficiency is day-dreaming, said director of medical education Chittaranjan Maity. But we have to do this and the sooner every employee understands this, the better.

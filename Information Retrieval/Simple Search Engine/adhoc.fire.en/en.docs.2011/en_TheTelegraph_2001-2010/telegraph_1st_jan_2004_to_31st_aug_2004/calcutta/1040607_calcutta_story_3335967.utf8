The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Born to paint
																								Some are born great and some achieve greatness as they journey through life. Art at its best is a happy marriage between the two. An artist may be an artist by sheer dint of an inborn talent; yet again an artist may be born out of extraordinary circumstances in life. He has the acute ability to see what the naked eye misses; he can feel what the ordinary heart skips. Priyanka Gupta is basically a self-taught artist who has delicately paved the way to lend an individuality to her passion for the art of painting. Young in years, she has a strong visual perception of the structural aspects of abstract imagery and is gifted enough to see her way through the interpenetrating tangle of shapes directly visible. Through her paintings she has stepped into her journey towards virtual reality, composed of non-representational but visually persuasive bits and pieces of imagery.																								Event: Paintings by Priyanka Gupta																								When: Till June 8; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

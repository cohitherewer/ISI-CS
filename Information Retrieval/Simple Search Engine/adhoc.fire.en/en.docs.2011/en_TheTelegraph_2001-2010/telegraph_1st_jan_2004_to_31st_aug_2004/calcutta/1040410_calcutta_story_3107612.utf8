 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Facets of vote
																								As the Lok Sabha elections lurk round the corner, candidates reappear after a five-year hiatus with begging bowls in hand for votes. But what about the common people? Disgusted by the present state of democracy in the country, agitated about the lack of choices or simply a lack of interest in the farce that is election, we all try to distance ourselves from this tamasha. Yet elections come and go like routine exercises and we all participate in the process. But has anyone ever wondered, Vote, to whom dost thou belong? The present multimedia show encapsulates the psyche of the people and politics through theatre, video, animation, painting, installations, music, caricature and graffiti. Witty, vicious and irreverent, the show stirs up the political conscience of the masses or finally puts it to rest.																								Event: Multimedia exhibition																								When: Till April 17; 2 pm - 7 pm																								Where: CIMA Gallery

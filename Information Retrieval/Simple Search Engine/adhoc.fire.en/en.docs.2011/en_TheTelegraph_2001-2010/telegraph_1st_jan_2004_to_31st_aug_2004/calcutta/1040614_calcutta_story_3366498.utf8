SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND HIMIKA CHAUDHURI The risotto festival at The Hub. Picture by Rashbehari Das  The Eden Pavilion Verandah at ITC Sonar Bangla is being put to some good use. Transformed into a kiddies buffet and play zone on Sunday afternoons, the lounge area is perfect to pack the brat brigade away while the adults have there own share of fun at the coffee shop across the hallway. A magician and a tattoo artist are keeping the kids happily entertained with Pokemon staring down huge from posters threatening to catch em all!. We felt this was a better utilisation of the space, which overlooks the picturesque lawns. It has so far been used by people who come to dine at The Eden Pavilion to just hang around for a quiet chat sometimes, says Rajat Sud, manager of the coffee shop.The kids of course couldnt have had it better with the staff hovering around them and catering to their whims and fancies, even if their parents have to fork out a neat Rs 400 for the fun and frolic. For tots as tiny as three years of age, however, the fare of popcorn, candy floss, mini hot dogs, burgers, smilie cookies, hedgehog truffles, shakes and mocktails comes free. Two-and-a-half-year-old Nimish was one such lucky darling, seen thoroughly engrossed in trying to aim balls in a wheel with a tiny hand sporting a Pokemon tattoo.He had little time to spare for questions, but according to his mother, he had been relishing the juicy burgers at the snack counter even though hes very fussy about food at home. Weve tried to incorporate some fun food that is interactive as well as tasty, says pastry chef Harpawan Singh. While most kids are naturally attracted to the popcorn and candy floss counters, Singh has made an effort to make the rest of the stuff as attractive as possible, with cookies sporting smilies, chocolate truffles shaped like hedgehogs with almond flakes and colourful syrups for the kids to order their own kind of shakes and mocktails.Coming up next, some Potter magic, part of the changing theme plan at the venue. The broomsticks might also come in handy to squash some houseflies that seem to be as attracted by the candy treats as the kids themselves.Rice treats The Calcutta food enthusiast apparently hasnt been as well exposed to the risotto as he has been to other Italian specialities, mainly pasta.Thats the reason why chef Alex Bignotti at The Hub, the Italian speciality restaurant at the Taj Bengal, has decided to treat the city to dishes about which it might have only read about in recipe books. A 10-day risotto festival, which has taken off from June 11, is what Alex and his team have come up with. Risotto is consumed in the northern part of Italy and is cooked from a special variety of rice called arborio, explained the chef. The coarse rice is being imported from Italy for the purpose. The special menu lists twenty types of risottos with an equal number of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Cooked with large quantities of cheese, the risotto can be eaten without a side dish or curry to complement it. Its a meal in itself, stressed the chef. For those with a big appetite, the appetiser  or antipasti  could well be the ideal way to start the meal. There are two appetisers on the special menu, one vegetarian and the other non-vegetarian. Prawns and tomato risotto cake with parsley sauce makes for an interesting appetiser. The vegetarian lot can dig into some fresh rice salad with pickled vegetables. The six special veggie varieties in the main course draw their different tastes from either fresh herbs or goat cheese, walnuts and sometimes even wild mushrooms. Cheesy and filling, the prices for each portion ranges between Rs 315 to Rs 375. The meat eaters can choose from a wide range of options like seafood, lobster tail, lamb shank, corn-fed chicken and duck ragout. Of these, the most interesting is possibly the risotto with black ink and cuttlefish, which, as the name suggests, is charcoal black in colour.We use the ink from the cuttlefish to colour the dish and its a very popular risotto internationally, added Alex. The non-vegetarian portions are priced between Rs 330 to Rs 425. Whether you like your risotto black or white, now you know where you can find it.

Picture by Rashbehari DasLiterary feastThe effort was to take a walk down memory lane and delve into the deep sea of literature from around the world. The result was an evening that Calcuttas whos who will remember for a while as time well spent. The lawns of the Tollygunge Club came alive on Saturday evening with a great session of poetry, intriguing short stories of betrayal in love, and songs from the time of Begum Akhtar to more contemporary western numbers.Titled Once Upon a Time, this show presented by Spandan and Patton was a winner. An array of stars and personalities from various fields queued up to put up performances  from the mundane to the unbelievable.Lee Alison Sibleys spoof on changing moral values with a hint on how jargon is being used to fool the common man was a show-stealer. Woven around the Grimm Brothers fairytale Rumpelstiltskin, the improvised story was set in modern-day Bengal complete with mentions of Tollywood and a left-front government.Renowned writer Bani Basu who read a self-penned short story, Satabdi Express, left quite a few women in the audience with moist eyes. Theatre and television personality Anushua Mazumder stunned with her story reading session of Guy De Maupassants, A Wifes Confession. Changing the tone of her voice for the various characters she brought the story to life with elan.Television actress Sudipa Basu opened the show, reading a historical piece relating to the birth of Vidhur, accompanied by a Rabindrasangeet rendition from Pramitha Mullick.Drummer boy Bikram Ghosh, as he was referred to by moderator Rita Bhimani that evening, recited taals to draw similarities between literature and music. Picking an event from daily life, he put each aspect of it to music.Danseuse Alokananda Roy, Pramitha Mullick, executive Barun Das and Renu Roy of Spandan all read out works of various renowned writers, with the likes of Roald Dahl and Jhumpa Lahiri making an appearance on the list. Suchandana Ghosh, Gopa Ghosh and Ditipriya Lahiri rendered vocal performances. Kudos go to Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, who conceptualised and executed the show, choosing every piece that was read, sung and recited. Sanjay Budhia of Patton and US Consul General George Sibley were among the guests present for the evening. Designers Mona and Pali, actors Chandrayee, Debolina and Parambrata also dropped by to be a part of the fun. Lee Alison Sibley at the Tolly Club reading. Picture by Rashbehari Das  Mass magicThe first ever Seagrams Magical Nights held in the city almost a year ago became the most talked about event on the social circuit. It was the right place to be seen, the right thing to do. From the Oberoi Ballroom, where it took off, the bash has taken a more mass turn. On Saturday night, the event shifted to Winning Streak, the sports bar at the HHI. The 20-somethings dropped by in happy hoards to check the latest in fashion. But Calcutta being the later starter that it is on Saturday nights, it wasnt before midnight that the action began. The designers were, however, not the cause for the rather huge draw as the bigger name, Priyadarshini Rao, whos work is showcased by the boutique Little India, didnt make it to the event, and the local talent, designer Pritam Panda didnt quite ring a bell in the first go.But it was the weekend, and as usual, the party people were in a mood to have some fun, so clothes or no clothes, it finally didnt matter much. The dance-floor doubled up as the ramp for Calcuttas models. Pritams linen and satin collection in muted shades of olive, pink and peach was interesting. Raos collection in natural fabric like jute and khadi had smart cuts and nice falls. The show was interspersed with games for the guests. Men were asked to belly dance and their women partners asked to judge them. The women had an easier task: they just had to dance like Madhuri Dixit amidst the 200-strong crowd. Madhuri may have done it, but our Calcutta chicks decided to pass up the dare and let the men be the winners of the evening. Shots of vodka did the rounds as prizes for the game, setting the activity meter ticking. Thus women were seen being lifted in the air by their partners and twirled around as if in the middle of a twister, sending the crowd on the dance floor almost running for their lives. Some men were spotted actually down on the floor, catching their breath after an over-dose of dancing.A fun Saturday, which kept the crowd busy and rolled into the wee hours of the morning.

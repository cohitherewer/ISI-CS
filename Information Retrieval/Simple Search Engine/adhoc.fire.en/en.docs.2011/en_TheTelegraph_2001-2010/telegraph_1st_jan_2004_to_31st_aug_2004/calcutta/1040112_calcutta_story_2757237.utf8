The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 12, 2004  Calcutta Column
 
	Elgin Road has changed a lot with the Forum mall, Gokul  Mega shop, Big Bizz and a string of stores, beside coffee  shops like Caffeine. Sadly, the smaller stores are losing  out on business. I do not see customers at shops at Vaibhav,  on Lee Road, any more.  
	Shiv Shankar Almal, Calcutta.  
	The stretch between Behala Chowrasta and Taratala is in  deplorable shape, with animal carcasses, overflowing garbage  bins and litter tossed by residents on Diamond Harbour Road.  The open makeshift urinals and the polluting paint factory  adjacent to Chowrasta are causes for alarm.  
	Chandan Ray, Sarsuna.

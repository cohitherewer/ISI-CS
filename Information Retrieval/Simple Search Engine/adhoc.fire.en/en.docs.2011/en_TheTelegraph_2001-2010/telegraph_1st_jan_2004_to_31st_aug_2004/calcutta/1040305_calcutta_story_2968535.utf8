 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Pilfer rap snaps eatery power line
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Power supply to a popular Park Street eatery was snapped by the CESC early on Thursday on charges of pilferage, though the restaurant management vehemently denied the power utilitys allegations.																								Almost at the crack of dawn, a special surveillance team from CESC, accompanied by armed policemen, broke into the premises of Moulin Rouge, snapped some wires and sealed the main power supply board. The accusation was that the restaurant was running on power illegally drawn from underground cables laid by the CESC.																								Manager Asit Baran Acharjee dismissed the allegations. We have just paid Rs 50,000 in electricity bills to the CESC. So the question of pilferage does not arise, he said. 																								CESC officials, however, maintained that the surveillance team went to the restaurant acting on a tip-off and that the charges were genuine.																								We found electricity had been illegally tapped from the service cut-out from where power is supplied through underground cables. We immediately disconnected the supply and lodged an FIR with the local police station, said Santanu Chatterjee, CESC executive director.																								Recalling the incident, eyewitnesses said a van pulled up in front of the eatery a little after 5 am and started breaking the locks. Once inside, they snapped some wires and said the restaurant will remain without power from now on, said a pavement hawker, who sells books and magazines nearby.																								Moulin Rouge owner Charles Mantosh termed the CESC move extremely highhanded. He said: Following our refusal to pay the exorbitant security deposit the power utility demanded, there was a city civil court injunction on snapping the connection. But their personnel broke into our premises and disconnected the service in gross violation of the court order. This is trespassing as well as a mockery of the judiciary. quot;																								On Thursday evening, the restaurant wore a deserted look, with only a handful of faithfuls at the tables. Yes, business has been dim today. We are running on a generator, which cant bear the load of the air-conditioning. But we are confident things will improve soon and our regular clientele will be back, said the manager. Mantosh confirmed the management has already moved court for reconnection of the power supply.																								CESC officials said there was a tendency among a section of air-conditioned restaurants and nursing homes to tap power illegally with the advent of summer.

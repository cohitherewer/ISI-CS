The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Staff immunity cuts quality
 Sabyasachi Dutta				 	 Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward no.10, Bidhannagar Municipality, met readers of The Telegraph in his ward office last week. Participants included N.C. Dutta, Samir Dasgupta, J.M. Ganguly, Subimal Sen, Tejendranath Ghosh, N.K. Roy, Manimoy Saha, B. Biswas, B.K. Pal, Amal Sengupta and Swadesh Duttagupta				 																																																																																																																																																																		

N.C.Dutta: The roads in CE block are in poor shape.																																																			Most of Salt Lakes roads are maintained either by the PWD or the CMDA. Though the municipality keeps prompting the agencies about the need to repair roads, lack of coordination leads to work remaining pending and harassment of citizens. I had suggested at board meetings that a core committee be formed to coordinate the work. But no heed was paid and now, residents of every block in Salt Lake are paying the price.																																																									

Subimal Sen: Patchwork repair of roads needs to be supervised. The repairs are inevitably slipshod and ineffective.																																																			I agree. I would request the residents to please call on me if they notice any flaws so we can book the errant contractor.																																																									

N.K. Roy: CE market needs a proper sewerage system. Most of the drain covers are missing. 																																																			As I told you earlier, the root cause is the lack of coordination between the CMDA, PWD and the urban development department. Our municipality does not have the required number of employees. Most of the engineers and other staff are with the municipality on deputation. So, they are not obliged to us and nor can we tick them off for defective work. This immunity is slowing down the pace of work and affecting quality.																																																									

Samir Dasgupta: Many residents are not complying with the lease condition of keeping three feet of space vacant around their houses. Some plant trees that damage the boundary wall in the days ahead.																																																			This condition is included in the Bengal Municipal Act and we have to abide by it. If a complaint is filed, we conduct a spot check to ensure that the plantation does not violate the Act. I have noticed that these saplings damage the water pipelines, too. But personally, I feel that such problems can be tackled by talking to the house-owner.																																																									

J.M. Ganguly: We maintain one of Salt Lakes green verges by raising funds from residents. But the costs are shooting up.																																																			We had held a meeting on the maintenance of these green verges. But no action plan could be arrived at. So, as of now, either those green belts will have to be maintained by you or left to rot as officially, we cannot take on the responsibility of maintaining them.																																																									

J.M. Ganguly/Tejendranath Ghosh: The garbage dump behind the Arunachal building is eating up the green verge.																																																			This is a peculiar problem. We had planned to erect a wall on the spot to separate the vat from the green verge. Funds were sanctioned and work started last November. But suddenly, a resident of the area drove away our masons. We informed the municipality and our workers were sent back. Chairman Dilip Gupta took a personal interest in the case and sent the municipal engineer to supervise the construction of the wall. Again, our workers were driven away. I later came to know that the resident in question is a coordination committee member. 																																																											However, I myself accompanied our workers and erected half the wall, only to be summoned by the police. Apparently, the CMDA had lodged a complaint with them against me for forcibly raising a wall on land belonging to the urban development department. So, work was stopped. Later, I sought a copy of the letter of land transfer to the municipality by the department concerned. The chairman said he was sifting through the records. That was four months ago. 																																																											However, I promise you that by February 20, the garbage will be removed from the spot. In this connection, I would like to point out that the garden behind Netajis statue, beside Banabitan, too, did not have any legal transfer papers but the garden came up without any objection.																																																									

Manimoy Saha: We hear the municipality will allow construction of attics in residential houses. Do we need to sanction a plan for this?																																																			Frankly, I am not aware of such a decision and the matter has yet to come up in the board meeting. So, for now, such construction will be considered illegal. Theres also a lot of confusion over the issuance of trade licences.

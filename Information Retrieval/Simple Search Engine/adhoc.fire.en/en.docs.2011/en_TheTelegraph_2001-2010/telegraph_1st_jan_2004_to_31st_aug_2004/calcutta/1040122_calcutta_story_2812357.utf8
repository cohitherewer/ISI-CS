  Attention! A salute to the uniform I was deeply perturbed by the report Girls kin frame youth (Dec. 16) on the framing of an innocent boy by a girls family in a kidnapping case. She left home after a family tiff and was traced after a week in a village in the company of a female acquaintance. In the meantime, her family lodged a specific complaint with the Entally police station, against a boy from the locality. Our gender-sensitive laws forced the police to put him in a lock-up with hardened criminals for a week. Even though there was not a shred of evidence against him. And even after the girl returned home, he has been released on bail, and the case has not been summarily dismissed!  Most citizens have not seen the inside of a police lock-up, let alone spent time in there. They do not know the devastating moral and emotional trauma that an innocent is put through in our police and judicial custodies. The orchestrated feminist-fascist-moralist campaign on gender sensitivity has engendered a host of draconian, illogical and inhuman laws against all tenets of civil rights. Sometime back, Renuka Choudhary, MP, had claimed that stalling the Womens Reservation Bill (in Parliament) was akin to rape. Can this boys nightmare be compared to rape, too? And the girls family summarily arrested for the offence? If a specific allegation has the sanctity to automatically lead to an arrest, shouldnt accountability be enforced in case of its misuse?  However, since it is not politically correct to be a male, whatever torments innocents like this hapless boy have to go through seem to be of no concern to civil society. Until the next persons turn comes, who may be you, me or our innocent children.  Sandeep Mukherjee,
 Jodhpur Park.  Apropos Pointless, pricey police protocol (Dec. 23), such ceremonials are surely a waste of money. There was a disturbing factor in the article. According to a constable, there is not even the slightest acknowledgement to the salute offered to seniors. A salute is the respect shown to the uniform and not to the person wearing it. Therefore, it is the duty of the person in uniform to acknowledge the respect. If senior officers have become bored with returning the salute, they can at least nod in acknowledgement. Even our aged Presidents have to stand in a saluting position for hours during marchpast on Republic Day. Etiquette suggests returning a namaskar. Otherwise, it not only demoralises the juniors but also creates disrespect.  Govind Das Dujari,
 Diamond Harbour Road.  The decision-makers never travel by public transport or have to cross the road (Toe traffic line or pay a fine, Dec. 22). Pedestrians can perceive the dangers associated with it. But they do it because they have no other options. A jack-of-all-trades minister comments on everything except traffic, civic authorities cannot make the footpaths encroachment-free, buses stop in the middle of the road, cars exceed zebra crossings  everyone goes on with impunity, forcing the pedestrian to be a jaywalker. Still, the authorities think the onus of enforcing traffic discipline rests with the pedestrians.  Chameli Pal, 
 Budge Budge Trunk Road. The report Calcutta at the crossroads:  cops round the corner to collar and caution jaywalkers  (Dec 23) with photos featuring the police fining errant  pedestrians was interesting. At last some kind of discipline  has come to West Bengal.  T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge.  The report Baby boy left to die in Tiljala litter bin (Dec. 26) filled me with sadness. Such incidents go unrecorded because our senses do not revolt against such callousness.  Anil Kumar Sen, 
 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.  The report Shut-out teacher strides back (Dec. 25) made for a pleasant read. Teachers have long been fighting for their rights but seldom has the government paid heed to their protests. Purabi Mukherjee must be thanking her stars.  Kunal Ray,
 Santragachhi.  It is amusing to note that CU at long last is considering the feasibility of allowing autonomy to premier institutions (CU softens on autonomy, Dec. 22). If autonomy is allowed, the standard of education as well as administration in these colleges is bound to improve. As the UGC is insisting on granting autonomy to these colleges, the government is in a dilemma. After all, people at the helm of affairs are more interested in retaining their political hold.  Rabindra Nath Kar, 
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.

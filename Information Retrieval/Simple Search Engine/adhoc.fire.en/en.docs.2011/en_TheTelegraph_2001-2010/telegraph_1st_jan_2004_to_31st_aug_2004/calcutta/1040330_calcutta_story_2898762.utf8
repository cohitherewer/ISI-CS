Grade, set, go: Spoiling for the marks fightActivities in progress at Kidz Konclave, the new Montessori in townAverages boon, brilliants bane In Time to Talk, we asked our readers Should the marks system in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary be replaced with grades? Most agree that while both systems have their pluses and minuses, the fight for marks should be nipped in the bud sooner rather than later. More opinions to follow next week.				 				 																															lImplementing the grade system is not a bad idea. Be it in Madhyamik or HS exams, the marks system often unnecessarily boosts the ego of a pupil whose aggregate is one or two marks higher than another. The grade system measure ones capability and intelligence.Linda Lopa Ashok,
K.V.O.F, Dum DumThe huge hullabaloo over the marks achieved in Madhyamik and HS exams and the undue importance given to them is a matter of amusement for the central and Delhi-board students. The students and their parents smugness or despair  depending on the all-important aggregate  is exaggerated. Grades should replace this cumbersome and fallible system of marking, to bring these students and their gloating guardians in touch with reality, and make them think beyond numbers, and hopefully help them construct their lives around more productive issues.Adwaita Das,
English (Hons), JUThis question cannot be answered with an absolute yes or no. If the grade system is introduced, mediocre students will benefit the most. But it will reduce the tension of students before the board exams, and the conflict between them and their parents. If students are not successful, it sometimes leads to tragedy, like suicide. Getting rid of the ranking system will also reduce the increasingly unhealthy competition among students. However, the grading system doesnt recognise brilliance. Hence, the mediocre gains, but the genius loses. Also, the range of the grading system, if not clearly defined, poses a problem during admission to colleges.Rimli Datta,
Salt LakeIts high time for the Madhyamik and HS boards to ponder the issue of shifting from marks to grades. The introduction of grades will not only put the students of this board on a par with other boards, it will also reduce errors in results, which have increased by leaps and bounds recently, throwing students careers in the doldrums. It will be welcome.Rohit Kumar Singh,
Hooghly Mohsin CollegeIn states where there arent too many reputed colleges to study in, the marks system helps during admission after the board exams. Grades can only indicate the average of the pupils results, whereas marks can evaluate the student better. Marks help in differentiating between the strong and the weak among students, whereas grades are vague.Tanmoy Ghosh, 
IInd-yr, English (Hons), Asutosh CollegeA grading system for HS will not be efficient. It will kill the motivation of students to score over 80 per cent, as there will be no recognition for excelling. On the other hand, it will be good for students who are weak in studies, as studying for the last two months before the boards will be enough to get average grades. Good students will suffer, as there will be no difference between them and mediocre students.Saurabh Dhanuka, 
Class XI, Birla High SchoolThe idea is absurd. The replacement of marks with grades will trigger an incomprehensible confusion, where the difference between students calibre and hard work may get discounted. The passion of being second to none will lose its significance. College admissions will become more problematic.Avinash Gupta,

	 Question mark 				 				 																															The Birla Industrial and Technological Museum had organised an intra-college science quiz at Lady Brabourne College recently. The participants included students from the first year, with one representing each department. Six five-member teams made it to the event, after the colleges Debating and Quiz Club chose the participants with the help of the teachers.				 				 																															The applause was equally enthusiastic for every obscure fact rattled off correctly by one or a slide accurately recognised by another, since the teams represented not a particular department but were composed of one student from every department.				 				 																															The questions were divided into theme-based segments, and the quiz gathered momentum with subsequent slides and sound-bites. The variety was fascinating  from a teddy-bear nursery rhyme to Armstrongs voice on the moon in the audio segment, and exotic breeds of butterflies to tiny animals in the visual round.				 				 																															The contest provided a suspense-filled climax, as the winning team grazed past the runners-up by a small margin. But the team that won deserved it for a consistent performance. Hats off to Angana Deb, an ace quizzer, who kept up the pace as she guided her team to victory. Ranjana Das,

	 Rockathon				 				 																															Another round of fun and frolic was on the cards last week, as the Netaji Subhash Engineering College presented its annual fest, Mesmerizer 2004, at Nazrul Mancha. Day One began with the solo singing competition, in the eastern and western categories, where remixes held their own against the originals.				 				 																															The new Bangla band Nucleus then entertained the eager crowd with Bengali songs as well as popular English tunes like Its My Life, Summer of 69 and more. Next up were Cactus and Krosswindz, belting out their hits as the audience got on to the dance floor.				 				 																															The final day kicked off with the pentathlon, where the host college emerged victorious. This was followed by a choreography show put up by the hosts. Finally, it was the turn of Euphoria, Palash Sens Mumbai band, to rock the hall, ending a successful two-day event. Asif Alam,
1st year, Asutosh CollegeActivities in progress at Kidz Konclave, the new Montessori in townSpring in the step				 				 																															It was time for young talent to shine in the spotlight once again, as the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC), Salt Lake, organised another contest to spot the bright stars of tomorrow. As part of EZCCs weeklong Vasant Utsav was a regional contest for youngsters in folk and classical music and dance, from March 23 to 26.				 				 																															Sixty performers from eight states in the eastern region, including West Bengal, Sikkim, Manipur, Bihar and Orissa, took the stage in the evenings at the Bharatiyam Cultural Complex in the four categories, with spring as the theme.				 				 																															Twenty youngsters  five each day  were selected as the winners and awarded Rs 10,000, a medal and a certificate by Governor Viren J. Shah at the award ceremony on March 27, where Aloka Kanungo and Kalavati Devi and their troupes performed.				 				 																															Also a part of the Utsav was an artists camp, a poets meet and an exhibition of paintings, terracotta items and sculpture, presented by Orissas Balasore Art amp; Crafts College.				 				 																															Simultaneously, a talent search programme had also been organised on March 24, for the K.L. Saigal Centenary celebrations, involving singers in their 20s and 30s, where Debmalya Chatterjee emerged victorious, winning Rs 5,000 and the chance to perform in Delhi.				 				 																
	 All about autism				 				 																															Distinguishing between toothpaste and toothbrush can often be a tough task for autistic children. And with the lack of understanding of the condition in India, help is as rare as is a ready diagnosis from doctors. It was to address the growing pains of autistic youngsters that the Autism Society West Bengal, comprising parents, had organised a unique workshop recently.				 				 																															The five-day workshop, an advanced training programme on verbal behaviour, was conducted by Steve Ward and Teresa Grimes, behavioural professionals from the US. They took the 50-odd participants, including parents, young professionals working in the field of mental health and therapists, through the problems of an autistic child. The focus was on communication, socialisation and unusual behaviour, and how these children should be handled at home and in school.				 				 																															The first-of-its-kind workshop held in the city was attended by participants from around the country, including Bangalore, Goa, Delhi and Mumbai. At the end, while agreeing that much more needed to be done, everyone felt that attitudes were changing with an increase in awareness.				 				 																
	 Band battle				 				 																															For all you aspiring bands out there, its time to get into the act, with the launch of Campus Icons, a country-wide inter-college music competition, organised by Hero Honda and Pepsi. The regional events will begin from August, with two winning colleges selected from each zone. The event will be held across 15 cities, over a six-month period.				 				 																															The regional finals will be held in Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai from September to October. The participants will be the first two winning colleges from each of the regional events. The finals will be held later in the year. The winner will get the opportunity to perform alongside an international artiste.

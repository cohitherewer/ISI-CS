 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Plaudits for industrial waste checks
 JAYANTA BASU 																								The state Pollution Control Board (PCB) has got a pat on its back for a job well begun from the high-power central committee on hazardous waste management. 																								The 15-member team, set up by the Supreme Court, was in town last week to take stock of the preparedness in managing hazardous waste in West Bengal and other eastern states. 																								The members met us, besides holding separate meetings with state government representatives from Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand and the Andaman amp; Nicobar islands, said Shyamal Sarkar, state PCB member secretary. 																								According to Dipak Chakrabarty, chief scientist of the board, the members of the committee, who spent two days in the city and went through the project reports, approved of the preparedness in the state. 																								The committee will send its formal comments later, but it was evident during the interface that the members were satisfied with our efforts, said Chakrabarty, adding that the state PCB will try to carry on its projects in a time-barred manner. 																								Led by G. Thyagarajan, the team  including chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board V. Rajagopalan and senior officials from the ministry of environment and forests, scientists and social activists  visited the Calcutta Leather Complex at Karaidanga, on the eastern fringes of the city. They also stopped by at a secondary lead-smelting unit in Picnic Garden. 																								The state PCB officials gave a detailed account of the boards performance before the high-power committee, which has been entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the status of hazardous waste management throughout the country. 																								Playing tough with the truants, the West Bengal board had downed the shutters of 33 industrial units  mostly small units working in the sectors of oil reprocessing, zinc galvanising, electroplating and secondary lead smelting  over the past two to three months. 																								According to the board officials, the units were closed as they failed to comply with the apex court directives regarding hazardous waste management. 																								We have prepared an inventory of hazardous waste-generating units in state, as per the court directive, and of the 505 such units in the state, 403 have valid authorisation. The rest are in various stages of compliance and are under strict surveillance, said Sarkar.																								According to board officials, the committee members sought the status report of the upcoming common storage, treatment and disposal facility for hazardous wastes in Haldia. 																								The facility, billed as the first of its kind in the state, is being developed jointly by the Haldia Development Authority and a private operator. The environment impact assessment of the project is over and it has already got all the necessary clearances. 																								We informed the team that the facility will be partly operational by February 2005, said an official.

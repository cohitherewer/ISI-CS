	A recent photography exhibition, co-organised with Rabindra Bharati University at the Academy of Fine Arts, was disappointing. Not that the exhibits were sub-standard, but because a bunch of over-enthusiastic men and women, deployed perhaps for security, outnumbered the visitors. I found it difficult to enjoy the photographs on display with someone breathing down my neck or staring at me. Maintaining security is fine, but there must be better ways of keeping vigil. I urge the organisers to consider my plea.

	Branch names of some of the nationalised banks in the city are misleading. Recently, my brother had difficulty locating the Kankurgachhi branch of Syndicate Bank, which turned out to be in Ultadanga. Similarly, the Bagmari branch of SBI and Maniktala branch of UCO Bank are both in Kankurgachhi. It would be convenient if the branches are named after the roads they are located on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 10, 2004 Nod to vote, nay to power career
Want to be part of the political process? Of course. Want to join politics? Of course not. Performing a citizens responsibility is fine, but joining politics is not an option for GeneratioNext. An opinion poll by Consumer Connect for Metro among 202 Calcuttans, in the age group of 18 to 24, shows where they stand on poll day Suchetana Bhattacharjee, daughter of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, told Metro a few months ago that politics was not her cup of tea.Only some people can make it in politics, added the 23-year-old, who had dabbled in student politics while at Presidency College, studying political science. Suchetana, instead, has followed the call of the wild, with an anxious but proud father backing her conservationist cause all the way.The opinion poll conducted among a representative slice of young Calcutta reveals a Suchetana-like steer-clear policy from politics, but a firm faith in the democratic process.Over 95 per cent of respondents  an equal number of boys and girls, including students, employed and unemployed youth  say they will queue up at the booths on Monday to exercise their franchise.I will definitely go and cast my vote. I think voting is very important, as it gives us the most significant opportunity to express our views on the way we want the country to be run, says Prithviraj Chakraborty, a young businessman, who lives in Salt Lake and is a first-time voter.That casting their vote is a big deal is reflected in the fact that 51 per cent with names on the electoral rolls say they got enlisted by their own effort. Political parties and government machinery, taken together, fail to match personal enterprise.Know your factsAwareness of local politics is (somewhat surprisingly) high, with over 87 per cent correctly naming the major candidates in their constituencies.Proving that bigger the stage, greater the interest among the young, the survey reveals 82 per cent being sure of the parliamentary constituency, while a mere 53 per cent knows the Assembly segment accurately.We should know whats happening around us and the lines the parties are taking. I try my best to keep track of their claims and developments, says Mayank Kejriwal, back from Michigan after completing his studies. But would Mayank, a debutant voter, consider joining politics? Never. Its a dirty world, with a lot of illegal and immoral activity required to reach the top.			The P wordThats what the survey numbers shout out loud  84 per cent quizzed during peak pre-poll activity around town say a firm no to politics.Corruption, lack of understanding of issues and too much tension are cited as the main reasons for the growing gap between GenX and political activity.But then again, ideology, not the penchant for power, is the main driver for the minuscule 16 per cent  22 per cent male and 11 per cent female  saying yes to politics.How many parents today would actually encourage their children to pursue politics? Not many it would seem  if our chief minister allows his daughter to do her own thing, for almost all other parents, politics seems taboo.I would never want Koel to join politics and would never have supported it if she had decided to do so, declares actor Ranjit Mullick.Primarily because one has to say yes to whatever the party dictates, even if you dont like it, which I think is impossible. Besides, I dont think politics now is a very respectable option, he explains.Koel is clearly her fathers daughter. While displaying the enthusiasm of a first-time voter the Metro survey reflects (Of course I will vote, as I think its my responsibility as a citizen, she stresses on poll eve), she crinkles her pretty nose at the thought of being in politics.That has never ever been an option for me. I dont understand anything about politics at all, and I dont understand the games political leaders play. Sometimes they are friends, sometimes foes, says the rising Tollywood star.The age factorThe rising sons  and daughters  in the political arena dont seem to have had much of an impact on our respondents.Towering above the crowd of fresh faces  from the house of the Gandhis, Pilots, Scindias, Dikshits, Chautalas, Yadavs and Singhs  is a 79-year-old.If Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee emerges as the Face of Poll 2004 with 52 per cent, the mother-daughter duo of Sonia-Priyanka is a mere blip, tied at nine per cent. L.K. Advani, however, slips behind the Hemas and Govindas on the visibility scale.Beyond politicsIf politics is a no-no, is serving the nation a thing of the past? There are other ways to serve the country, declares the youth. If only five per cent would choose to tread the political path, for the majority, achieving excellence in whatever one is doing, working with an NGO and starting a social organisation are the chores of choice.If all of us do our work well, it moves the country forward. After all, everybody has a role to play in the development of the country, says Anamika Gupta of Bhawanipur college.So, the mantra of the young and bright: just do your own thing, and do it right.

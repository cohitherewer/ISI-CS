 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 School for scandal?
																								Imagine the comic consequences that may arise when a man and a woman, who are all but strangers, pretend to be a married couple. This is the stuff that Sameekshans latest production, Manmoyee Girls School, is made of. The play revolves around Manas and Niharika, two young people, looking for employment as teachers in a school. However, the conditions for employment are that only married couples will be taken. So when fate brings them together, the two, both desperate to get jobs, decide to pretend that they are married to each other, and succeed in getting jobs. Humorous circumstances inevitably follow as they are compelled to live as husband and wife for the sake of saving their jobs. A comedy that is certain to tickle the funny bone of even the sternest of individuals, the play also deals with the problem of unemployment that is prevalent in our society.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Manmoyee Girls School, produced by Sameekshan																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

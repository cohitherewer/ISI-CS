 SHANKAR MUKHERJEEGraphic: Sanjoy Santra																								Sky bus, high-speed tram, light rail transit (LRT), magnetic levitation train (MagLev), rapid urban flexible (RUF)																								In a month, hopefully, Calcuttans will come to know which of these modern modes of mass transport will come to rescue them from traffic snarls and vehicular pollution.																								The state government on Wednesday floated a global tender, inviting offers to build a high-speed rapid transit system that will run through the central business district and link various parts of the city. 																								Bids are expected from firms based in Canada, Japan, the Czech Republic, Singapore, Denmark and even from our very own Konkan Railway.																								The Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) floated the tender on behalf of the transport department. The project will be implemented on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. 																								The agency that will execute the project will provide the required funds and technology. The governments role will be restricted to procuring land and providing administrative support. 																								According to TIDC officials, the governments first option will be to introduce the light rail transit (LRT). 																								Given the condition of city roads, systems such as LRT, Maglev and high-speed trams are feasible. The three modes of transport are more or less the same, though the technologies differ, said TIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee. 																								Moreover, we have to think about the returns. A public transport system can be viable only if the middle class can afford the fare, he added.																								Chief traffic and transportation engineer B.K. Sadhu said some proposals had already been submitted. A final decision will be taken after we get the responses to the global tender. As the project will be on a BOT basis, we need not worry about funds.																								Rattled by the increasing traffic congestion in the city and consequent criticism from various quarters, particularly industrialists, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had recently asked transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to take a personal initiative for introducing a high-speed modern mode of transport, replacing the slow-moving trams and decades-old buses.																								Trams and old buses are misfits in this age. We have to make arrangements that will help commuters reach their destinations in the quickest possible time. The slow-moving and dated vehicles will be withdrawn once the modern mode of transport is introduced, the chief minister had said publicly.																								According to chief secretary Asok Gupta, there is hardly any scope to increase the citys roadspace. The only way to cope with the increasing vehicular rush and ease traffic congestion is to introduce a modern mode of transport, he pointed out.																								It is not possible to operate a modern, high-speed mode of transport in the city since the roads are almost always cramped with vehicles. Hence, we have to think about a system that will run on tracks above the road. We have received several offers from foreign firms, and will make up our mind after we sift through the replies to the global tender, Gupta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Cellphone trail to traders killers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A cellphone proved to be the sleuths best friend in cracking the grisly Maniktala murder case.																								In a pre-dawn swoop on Monday, six persons were arrested from different parts of Howrah and Calcutta in connection with the February abduction and killing of 25-year-old trader Sambhu Kumar Choudhury.																								The sleuths carrying out the raid identified one of the arrested persons as the kingpin, while the other had apparently been hired to carry out the strike. A hunt is on for two others believed to be involved in the murder.																								Police, however, have not yet ascertained the murder motive. Some sort of personal grudge seems to have triggered the incident, said Pradip Sanyal, deputy commissioner of police (Reserve Force), also in charge of the detective department.																								On February 5, Sambhu, a trader dealing in milk powder and spices, was shot in the head and left to die less than 150 metres from Maniktala police station, where three armed men had taken him at gunpoint.																								Around 11.10 pm, Sambhu stepped out of his Rabindra Sarani store and was headed for his Santro when three men surrounded him and forced him into the backseat.																								While one got into the front seat and held a razor to the throat of Sambhus driver Ujjwal Haldar, the two others sat on either side of the businessman in the backseat.																								The trio forced Ujjwal to drive down Chittaranjan Avenue, through Bagbazar, Shyambazar and RG Kar Road, before coming to a stop on Canal West Road, where they shot Sambhu, snatched Rs 2,600, a gold chain, a ring and a cellphone, before leaving the murder site.																								Fortunately, the killers kept the cellphone switched on for the next few days. They then changed the SIM card and started using the same handset with a fresh number, said a sleuth. They did not realise that each cellphone has an individual code number, which we managed to trace to Raigachhi, in Howrah.																								As soon as the sleuths got an exact fix on the phone, a raid was conducted and one suspect picked up. The arrested person was one of the hired killers in the Santro. He revealed the names of two other criminals, who were also rounded up from Howrah. They then led us to a hideout in central Calcutta, said the sleuth.

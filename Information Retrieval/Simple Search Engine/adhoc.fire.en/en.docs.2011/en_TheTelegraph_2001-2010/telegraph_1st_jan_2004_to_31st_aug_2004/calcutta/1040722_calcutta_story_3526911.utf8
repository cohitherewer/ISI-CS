																																																		Lalmohan Roy, alias Lalu, who was arrested in connection with a murder case, was at large in the city for four days. Presidency jail authorities came to know that an inmate was missing only on Tuesday when policemen in front of the Sealdah court identified Lalu and re-arrested him. Upset with the jail authorities, Calcutta Police officials said on Wednesday that they would complain to inspector-general of police (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty, about negligence on the part of jail authorities. A report has already been submitted to the police commissioner, said Ranveer Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, central division. Lalu was arrested on March 31 in a hideout by a team from Ultadanga police station. After spending 14 days in police custody, he was remanded in jail custody. Sleuths later linked him with a snatching. He was produced again in court in connection with the case and was granted bail. The moment the magistrate issued the order, Lalu walked out of the court room and melted into the crowd. Even after being bailed out, Lalu should have been taken straight to Presidency jail as he was an under-trial in the murder case and already in jail custody, said an official of detective department.

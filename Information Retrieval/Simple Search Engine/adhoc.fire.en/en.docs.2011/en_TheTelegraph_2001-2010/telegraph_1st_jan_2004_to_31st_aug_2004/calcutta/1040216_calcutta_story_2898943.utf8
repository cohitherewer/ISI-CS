		 LITTER LOT: A garbage dump that is overflowing  on to the main road in Salt Lake, behind the residence  of former chief minister Jyoti Basu. Pictures by Kishor  Roy ChowdhuryN.C. Dutta: The garbage vats must be cleaned properly. They are forever overflowing.																																																													The central collection system that clears the garbage on the main road creates the problem. In this arrangement, several vans deputed by the municipality collect garbage from each block of the township by rotation. As the vans are few, the trips made by them are not sufficient to clear all the vats. So, garbage keeps piling up. The problem can be solved only if the number of vans is increased or they make more garbage-collection trips. There is enough money in the coffer to arrange for more dumpers but nobody is taking the initiative. Several dumpers are lying idle in the CMDA godown that can be put back on the road after minor repairs.

 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Sojan Badiyar Ghat
																								Nandikars production is based on Jasimuddins verse epic, Sojan Badiyar Ghat. Jasimuddins folk tales are based on strife, war, love and death that tear apart the two communities, Hindus and Muslims. Sojon, a Muslim youth, falls in love with his childhood friend, Duli, a Hindu girl. Their affair sparks off tension between the two communities, and the duo elope. But in no time, Sojon is tracked down and imprisoned. Duli is married off to a Hindu zamindar. But as fate has pre-ordained, their paths cross once again and they meet, but this time to give up their lives together for love. This simple and eternal tale of love is intricately woven with the larger reality of communal hatred and the petty political manipulations that go along with it. It is this aspect of the play that makes it meaningful and contemporary. The form of the play is painted on a diverse and ethnic canvas. Folk music and different rural activities, including laathi khela, have been extensively used in this production. The play is directed by Goutam Halder.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

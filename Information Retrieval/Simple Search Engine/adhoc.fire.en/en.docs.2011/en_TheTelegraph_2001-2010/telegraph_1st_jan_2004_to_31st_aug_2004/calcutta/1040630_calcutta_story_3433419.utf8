Despite pressure from the bus operators lobby, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government on Tuesday left the minimum fares for buses and minibuses unchanged, while revising the fare structure. 																								While the minimum slab remains the same for city buses, fares will go up by 50 paise for every subsequent stage. The new fare structure will be effective from July 5.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the revision was much against his wishes but sought to justify it by saying that diesel prices had gone up twice since the last fare revision. 																								Diesel prices have risen by Rs 3.13 following the two hikes over the past year. Fifty per cent of the administrative costs for transporters, which are linked to fuel prices, also go up with every increase in oil price, the minister pointed out.																								Taxi and autorickshaw fares will remain the same for a while. 																								Observing that he could not meet all the bus operators demands, Chakraborty said minimum fares were not changed in keeping with the recommendations of the one-man committeeof former Calcutta State Transport Corporation chairman A.S. Lamba. 																								The committee was formed last year to devise a formula for revising fares in the event of a hike in oil prices.																								Tram fares, too, have been revised, the minister added. While the minimum fare will remain the same, there will be a hike of 50 paise for the next stage.																								Minister Chakraborty was quick to add that if oil prices fell in six months time, as he foresaw that they would, fares would be pared down.																								Asked to comment on the Trinamul Congress threat of launching a movement opposing the fare hike, the minister said: Let them start a movement. They have the right to do so. Had their alliance partner NDA remained in power, diesel prices would have risen by Rs 5.

 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Student, anchor in suicide quartet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Class VIII student and the female anchor of a television show were among the four people who committed suicide in and around the city on Friday.																								Preliminary investigation suggests that three of the victims were suffering from depression, while the student, Shantanu Maity, killed himself because his parents had scolded him.																								Shantanu hanged himself at his Pottery Road residence, in Entally, around 2 pm while his mother was out shopping. He was not doing well in school. He had failed last year, too, said Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).																								On Thursday night, Maity was rebuked by his parents for watching TV instead of finishing his homework. On Friday morning, he was scolded again for getting up late, said an officer of Entally police station.																								Shantanus mother returned from the market to find him hanging from the ceiling. He was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead.																								In Jadavpurs Central Road, TV anchor Poonam Choudhury, 22, hanged herself at home. When Poonam did not wake up till 10 am on Friday, her family broke open the bedroom door, which was bolted from inside. They had knocked earlier, but there had been no response, said Sumanjit Roy, deputy superintendent of police (town), South 24-Parganas.																								Poonams body was hanging from the fan. Preliminary probe revealed Poonam was having some problems with a male friend. The body was sent for post-mortem.																								Early on Friday, a 32-year-old housewife committed suicide in the Ballygunge military camp. Jyoti Singh, wife of commanding officer Pramod Kumar Singh, threw herself down a vacant elevator chute from the 10th floor, said deputy commissioner Mukherjee. She succumbed to her injuries in Command Hospital.																								In the fourth suicide, that occurred around 1.30 pm, Prabhu Shankar Ray, a middle-aged clerk of the directorate-general of commercial intelligence and statistics department, leapt off the roof-top of his office on Council House Street. Ray had four daughters. His wife is paralysed. He was suffering from acute depression, which may have led to his suicide, police said.

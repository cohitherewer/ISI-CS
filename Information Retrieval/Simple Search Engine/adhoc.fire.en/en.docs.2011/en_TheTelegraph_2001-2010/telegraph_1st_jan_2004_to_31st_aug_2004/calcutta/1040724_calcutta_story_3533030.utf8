The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Pre-Puja haul of land tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Friday announced that land tax from those living in the city and 38 municipal areas under the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) area will be collected before the Pujas.																								The decision to collect such taxes was taken by the government and the collection process has started in the added areas of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)  wards 101 to 141.																								State land and land reforms minister Abdur Razzak Mollah on Friday said in the Assembly that the collection procedure could be started in the added areas  which fall under South 24 Parganas district, for infrastructure for land tax collection already exists there.																								We have already collected Rs 2 crore from this area since October 19, when the system was introduced, Mollah said later. 																								The rate for the commercial area in Calcutta is Rs 200 per decimel annually and Rs 45 per decimel for residential area (100 decimel = one acre). The rate is Rs 200 per decimel for buildings that are over five storeys. While schools and colleges will not be included, the government will collect land tax from those using vacant lands, parks and waterbodies for commercial purposes. 																								In the 38 municipal areas under the CMDA brought under the tax net  other than Calcutta, Howrah and Salt Lake  the rate is Rs 175 per decimel annually for commercial areas and Rs 35 per decimel for residential areas.																								Thereby, the government can earn revenue of Rs 40 crore annually  Rs 25 crore from wards 1 to 100, and Rs 15 crore from wards 101 to 141 of the CMC. According to the Calcutta Land Revenue Act, 1850, tax of three annahs used to be charged per cottah, Mollah said. But the rates have been changed and it can be a source of huge revenue for the government, Mollah added.

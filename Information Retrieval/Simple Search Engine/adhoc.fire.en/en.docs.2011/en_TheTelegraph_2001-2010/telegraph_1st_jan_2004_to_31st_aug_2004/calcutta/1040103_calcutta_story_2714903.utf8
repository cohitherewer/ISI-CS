 TAPAS GHOSH				 	 A rally against Justice Amitava Lala: Rights of passage																								What will come of Justice Amitava Lalas order restricting rallies on city roads during weekdays from 8 am to 8 pm? The future looks bleak, with the court yet to hear the matter after the vacation bench (during the Pujas) of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar referred it to the regular bench for a final hearing.																								More than two months have gone by, but the matter is yet to appear before the regular bench. When the high court reopened after the Pujas, the matter came up in the daily cause list, only to be discreetly pushed out after a few days.																								According to high court sources, advocate-general Balai Roy, representing the state government, had pleaded before the division bench that the matter be heard by the regular bench. Meanwhile, he committed that the government would undertake an initiative to reach an all-party consensus on clamping curbs on rallies clogging city roads.																								Most of the high court staff are members of the coordination committee run by the ruling CPM and the state government is cashing in on the advantage. The staff have been aiding the government by keeping the matter out of the list, so that it does not come up for hearing, a high court source said.																								Government pleader Rabilal Maitra smiled smugly on Friday, saying: The case will never see the light of day again. Justice Lala passed a judgment on September 30, restricting rallies on city roads from eight-to-eight after he was stranded in bumper-to-bumper traffic jam due to a rally, and failed to reach the court in time.																								The matter is to be heard by the division bench presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur. On a previous occasion (in 2001), the chief justice, while passing an order on a similar issue, had observed that the government should take necessary steps to restrict rallies on city roads during working days. The state government fears if the matter comes up for hearing, the chief justice may create pressure, seeking implementation of the order.																								The state government doesnt have a ready defence, which could change the course of the procedure, as they failed to reach an all-party consensus on the issue. However, Writers Buildings can still afford to sit pretty, since there is no one to pursue the matter on behalf of Justice Lala. The judge has no authority to stand by his order, passed suo motu.

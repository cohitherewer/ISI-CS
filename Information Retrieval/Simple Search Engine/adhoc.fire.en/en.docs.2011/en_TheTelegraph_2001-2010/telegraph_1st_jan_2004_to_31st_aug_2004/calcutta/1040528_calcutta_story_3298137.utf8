 DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY																								Diamond Harbour Road has turned into a death trap. In the past 10 months, at least six persons have lost their lives here in accidents. Thanks to work on the Taratala flyover, the road has shrunk to one-third its 140-ft width. Add to that the mushrooming of autorickshaw and taxi stands, with political patronage, on either side of the road.																								A trip down the road is a nightmare. The local Trinamul Congress has threatened to hit the streets if the problem is not solved even after writing to the chief minister about it.																								The public works department (PWD) started work on the four-lane flyover in August 2003, and made a commitment to complete the project in 18 months. But it is doubtful if the deadline can be met, for work is progressing at a snails pace. 																								Originally, the deadline was December 2004, but even December 2005 looks doubtful. I met the PWD minister at Writers Buildings and he told me the pace was slow for want of funds, said Partha Chatterjee, Trinamul MLA.																								Every day, more than 5,000 vehicles use Diamond Harbour Road, that links Sagar Island with the city. Now, it takes more than half an hour to cover less than half a km from Behala tram depot to the Taratala crossing. 																								Earlier, there were two autorickshaw stands  one at Behala and another near Thakurpukur. Now, at least 20 such stands have sprouted. There was one taxi stand at Behala. Now, there are at least a dozen. 																								The new stands are controlled by Citu. I have told the chief minister about the problem but he refuses to react, local MLA Chatterjee said. 																								At one time, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had marked a stretch for parking cars opposite its Behala office. Initially, 50 cars were allowed to park. But now,at least 500 cars are parked there, and local youth, mainly of the CPM, run the racket. They collect money without issuing receipts. At the end of the day, they deposit a portion of it to the CMC and take away the rest, said Shakti Mondal, general secretary of Trinamul. He alleged the local police are in cahoots with these youths. 																								The situation will take a turn for the worse during monsoon, because the roads are full of potholes and there is no pavement. So, people are forced to walk on the carriageway, he said. Local CPM leader Nirmal Mukherjee, also leader of the opposition in the CMC, rubbished the charges.

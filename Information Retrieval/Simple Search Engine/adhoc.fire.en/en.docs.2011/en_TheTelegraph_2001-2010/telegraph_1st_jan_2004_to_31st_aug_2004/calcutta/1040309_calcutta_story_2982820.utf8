A still from Mona Lisa Smile, that was screened at INOX recently												Smiling away																					The eve of the International Womens Day saw a select gathering of Calcuttas power girls bond together over a hot cuppa and a movie. They also discussed wide-ranging issues, primary among which was the subject of legal awareness among women. The special screening of the Columbia Tristar movie, Mona Lisa Smile, scheduled for a March 12 release in Calcutta, saw an all-women audience, comprising social workers and such celebrities as June Maliah, Rita Bhimani and Anindita Sarbadhikari. While the movie focussed on how womens empowerment is directly related to changing their mindset and attitude, the event highlighted that legal awareness might be one way of achieving this. 																					Mona Lisa Smile is a movie based in the 1950s, which starts off in the prestigious womens Wellesley College, where the free-spirited, novice art history professor Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) comes to teach. Despite its academic reputation, Wellesley College has an environment where success is measured by how well the students marry. Encouraging these women to strive for a more enlightened future, Watson challenges the administration and inspires her students to look beyond the image of what is, and consider the possibilities of what could be. 																					The event was organised by INOX in association with Columbia Tristar Films, and Womens Coordinating Council (WCC)  an NGO which works with women and children, and extends free legal advice to them. The event was inaugurated by Justice Indira Banerjee, serving judge of Calcutta High Court, who also delivered a talk on the laws and rights of women.  City models at the International Womens Day celebrations at The Tollygunge Club and (below) danseuse Alokananda Roy at the same event												For a cause																					To celebrate International Womens Day, West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society in association with Terre des Hommes Suisse Geneve presented Dharitri  Mother Earth, a dance drama-cum-fashion show, choreographed to poetry and music at The Tollygunge Club. The show, which featured Alokananda Roy and leading models from the city, highlighted the violence, discrimination and bias that women have had to face in society through the ages.																					The first poem used in the show, Ganga, by Mallika Sengupta, is a severe indictment of men for their role in beginning and continuing with the practice of Sati, while the next one, Sita, questions the treatment meted out by Ram, and by implication the ruling class, to his wife. Next up was Subho Dasguptas That Girl which set the social injustices suffered by women against the backdrop of the glorification of womanhood in art. The final poem, From Eve... An Ode to the Gods by Kavita Sinha, celebrated Eve as the original woman. All the poems were accompanied by pulsating music and were brought alive on stage by dance performances. This was followed by a scintillating fashion show.																					The basic aim of the show was to initiate dialogue on womens issues and focus attention on their causes. The primary objective of the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society is to control and prevent the HIV epidemic from escalating in the state. It undertakes programmes to empower women for the development of society as well as to check the number of HIV cases in the state. Terre des Hommes, on the other hand, is a charitable organisation based in Geneva whose mission is to support its partner organisations in Southern countries in addressing the developmental needs of communities, especially those of women and children. It supports developmental initiatives among vulnerable and under-privileged people in order to help them address local issues. Empowerment of women and ensuring that the essential needs of women and children are met, are central to the activities supported by Terre des Hommes in Southern countries. A Japanese dance performance at Kala Mandir 												Far-eastern odyssey																					The Biwakei Dance Companys recent performance of contemporary Japanese dance at G.D. Birla Sabhaghar, unlike anything that Calcuttans have seen for some time, left the invitees spell-bound. The performance, organised by the consulate-general of Japan in Calcutta, was highly experimental in nature, and the images conjured and feelings evoked were powerful enough to leave a lasting impression on the minds of the audience. Songs, music, chants and random sounds created a magnetic aural backdrop to the performance, led by Setsuko Yamada. The name of the Biwakei Dance Company is derived by adding kei, which means system or basis, to the Japanese name of the loquat fruit, which is elliptical in shape and has the colour of the sun. Biwa is said to combine the face of the angel with the face of the devil. The hard core of the fruit is toxic, yet its leaves are known for their healing properties. As in the name, so in the dance. The improvised pieces performed by a troop of four dancers, discovered moments of creation, regeneration and transformation and explored their beauty and horror. The Biwakei company was formed in 1989 under the leadership of Setsuko Yamada. She went on to establish her own unique style of dance that tries to evoke delicate forms and fertile images and is consistently given the highest acclaim all over the world. Yamada is currently the director of the Biwakei studio, which has been performing the continuing dance series, Inventions of Dance, since 1998.																																														Laughing stock																					 Happy Club, the club dedicated to spreading good cheer among its members by organising fun events had organised a Hasya Kavi Sammelan on the eve of Holi to add some light-hearted humour and laughter to the festival of colour. The evening featured a host of renowned poets flown in from all over the country, who specialise in Holi songs, poems and themes and excel at making people laugh away all their grief, anger and stress.																					The Sammelan, held at Vidya Mandir, saw Calcuttas corporate biggies, including the Budhias, the Bajajs, the Kanorias and the Hadas among others, let their hair down and indulge in a no-holds-barred evening filled with entertainment and laughter. The list of poets who kept the crowd in splits with their witty humour took in names such as Jani Bairagi and Monica Hathila from Madhya Pradesh, Dr. Vishnu Saksena of Aligarh, Budhhi Prakash Dadhichi of Ajmer, Lajpat Rai Vikat of Dhanbad and Jay Kumar Rusba from Calcutta.Sushil Poddar, chairman, Happy Group of Companies, explained the concept of the event, This evenings programme has been designed keeping in mind the need for relaxation in every human being.

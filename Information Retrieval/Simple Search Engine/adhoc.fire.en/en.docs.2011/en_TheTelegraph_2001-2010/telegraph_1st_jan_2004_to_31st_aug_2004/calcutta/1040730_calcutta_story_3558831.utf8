 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Palta duo cements 24x7 plan
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has announced plans to provide Calcuttans with filtered water, 24x7, by December 2005, when two additional water treatment plants at Palta turn operational. 																								On Thursday, Governor Viren J. Shah commissioned Paltas third, 20-million-gallon treatment plant, along with a new pumping station.																								My dream is to ensure ready filtered water from the tap 24 hours a day in Calcutta by 2006, Mukherjee said.																								Round-the-clock supply will be possible once the two 20-million-gallon plants go on line, provided there is no major leak in the underground supply line or wastage. We must also ensure more storage capacity at Tallah, observed former Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) chief engineer (water supply) Ranabir Chowdhury, now the water supply consultant to the Howrah Municipal Corporation.																								Chowdhury, also on the state governments arsenic removal project panel, pointed out that World Bank-appointed consultant Stup-Weston, in its preliminary feasibility report, had stressed on 24-hour water supply.																								Chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury said the CMC now supplies filtered water 10 hours a day  spread over four slots of high and medium pressure alternately. Low-pressure intermediary delivery slots could easily bridge the remaining 14 hours, he said. 																								The 100-million-gallon augmentation project at the Palta waterworks, the mainstay of Calcuttas potable water supply, was conceived by the former Left Front civic board in April 1997. 																								However, the inability to harness funds led to a three-year delay in the first 20-million-gallon treatment plant with a grant from the government.																								After Thursdays commissioning, the Trinamul Congress civic board can claim credit for augmenting water supply without taking recourse to market borrowings or assistance from the state government. 																								Governor Shah reminded the civic authorities of the growing threat of arsenic contamination of underground water and their role in ensuring uninterrupted supply of water to the city.																								Mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chattejee said the booster stations at Kalighat, Bansdroni, Bagmari and Ranikuthi would be commissioned by September.

 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 The game that mirrors life
Eye on Calcutta Barry O'Brien				 	 Future Hope inmates and trainers with the Calcutta Cup trophies which the team won at the CC amp;FC grounds. Picture by Amit Datta																								They play rugby, go to college, want to make it big only to help others. They dare to look future in the eye and are raring to go, towards hope and more																								At the cc amp;fc last Sunday, boys from 14 city schools were doing what William Webb Ellis did long, long ago in a school far, far away  1823, Rugby School in England, to be precise.																								Ellis was frowned upon for showing a fine disregard for the rules of football by taking the ball in his arms and running with it. But the commemorative stone at Rugby School goes on to give the naughty little fellow some credit too: Thus originating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.																								The game has come a long way since and is catching on big time in India. So, the 100-plus Calcutta boys who did what Ellis did, were certainly not frowned upon as they played the game the only way it should be played  like gentlemen! 																								Lets meet some of these gentlemen who are sending out so many positive signals in the city  enough to tell us that the future is one full of hope; and the future is theirs. They are the gentlemen who are winning rugby trophies as consistently and easily as they are winning peoples hearts. They are the gentlemen of Future Hope.																								Having watched them win their third consecutive Calcutta Cup with such grace and polish, I decided it was time to get to know them and the people behind them, better. Now, that wasnt going to be easy, because neither they nor those who guide them, like talking about the wonderful things they are doing; they prefer doing them.																								For those who love this sport, the game mirrors life. When someone brings you down, youve got to get to your feet right away; when a teammates in trouble youve got to support him all the way; when youre in a spot of bother, hell back you up every time. Its teamwork that will take you far  just as it will in life!																								This is the spirit of rugby; this is the spirit with which Future Hope India, a trust, was set up more than a decade ago; this is the spirit at Future Hope School and in their homes in south Calcutta. No wonder, Future Hope was honoured by the International Rugby Board with the prestigious Spirit of Rugby award a couple of years ago.																								This spirit  of never giving up and working as a team  is deeply ingrained in each one of them, starting with their captain Tim Grandage. For whats happening on the field, the father figure of Future Hope gives credit to the coaches and university students like James, Michael and John, apostles of rugby, who pay their own way to spend time in Calcutta coaching the lads.																								Off it, Tim bows to the silent pillars of support who have built Future Hope. Tim doesnt want to mention names, because the supporters want to be silent ones. The journalist in me probes deeper and Tim bares his soul, so full of gratitude to T.C. Dutt, former chief secretary of West Bengal, to A. D. Khan, one of the states most respected bureaucrats, to Mumtaz Ahmed, a big hearted teaman, to Sunil Singh Roy, a caring businessman, to Bhaichung Bhutia and Leander Paes, to police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty, to the many schools in the city that have been so supportive, to the selfless service of the current team comprising the headmistress of the school Iti Rakshit, all-rounder Shirley Sheikh, the house parents, teachers and hundreds of volunteers over the years, from India and abroad.																								How did this very Cal-centric project of hope, built by honest, respectable, apolitical and secular Calcuttans take off? Tim promptly hands the credit to P.A. Anthony and his wife Gracy. Anthony, a colleague of Tims in HSBC, had just retired and wanted to do something meaningful. Tim was looking for a home for a couple of kids who had become friends of his. The Anthonys built another room on their terrace, from where one could clearly see a ray of hope for the future. With Dr Jamunesh Chatterjee, caring for every child that his banker friend brought to him for treatment and arranging for the medicines, it was sunshine all the way, not just a ray.																								There was no looking back. In Tims two-bedroom Calcutta flat there were soon 28 little champions  fighters who would grab every opportunity that came their way and create their own as they went along. Erica, a trained nurse from Holland, who was here to climb the Himalayas, joined him as a co-worker. Twelve years on, they are husband and wife, parenting the happy Future Hope family.																								It is a family that only provides the opportunity; it is up to each member of the family to grab that opportunity and move on. Anwar Ali did! 																								After a stint at Oberoi Bangalore, he is now working on an American cruise line. His passion is world cuisine. He wants to see the world, come back to Calcutta and set up his own niche restaurant. Dheeraj did! After getting into Central St Martins College of Art and Design, London University, he is moving on to higher studies and a career in architecture. Tapas did! He is studying international hospitality tourist management in South Bank University in London.																								Sukra and Kabir did! They are doing well in academics in Reading School in Berkshire, west of London, and shining on the sports field. Kabir, in fact, was Indias under-19 rugby captain when the team went to Sri Lanka and Hong Kong. Bablu, a class XI student of St James, too plays for the Indian team. He wants to graduate and finally set up his own outlet in one of the new shopping malls in the city. Lakhi, a class XII student of Apeejay School, wants to head for the tea gardens to work as a manager and promote rugby in the hills. Raju, Mahesh and Bikash are doing well at St Lawrences School. Raju is keen on aeronautical engineering while Mahesh sees himself as a corporate executive, and Bikash, one of the citys leading marathon runners, is planning a career on the high seas. Karim, a brilliant 11-year old scrum-half, is inspired by Bhaichung and wants to make it big as a footballer.																								Augustine and five of his friends have already totted up working hours at ITC Sonar Bangla, Taj and the Oberoi hotels. About half-a-dozen Future Hopers hop a tram early every morning to attend the B.Com classes in St Xaviers College. Sheikh Saidul, who incidentally has a higher score on the Beep Fitness Test than Mohd Kaif, the fittest Indian cricketer, wants to earn enough in the hotel industry to do some serious social service.																								In fact, every one of them is hungry to excel  on the field and in life  and then go on, in some way, to touch other peoples lives.																								With about 120 boys, and now, many equally positive-thinking young girls, the Future Hope family is setting the wonderful example of looking at the bright side of every challenge in life  because theres a winner in each one of us. Believe me, having spent a few hours with them this week, Im doing just that: looking for the winner in me!

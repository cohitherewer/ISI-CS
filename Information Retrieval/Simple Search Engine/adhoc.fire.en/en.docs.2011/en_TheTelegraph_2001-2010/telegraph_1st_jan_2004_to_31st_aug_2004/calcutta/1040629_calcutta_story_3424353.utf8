 															- Tours on the rise, so travel agents shed ticket babu avatar A STAFF REPORTER																								Imagine walking up to the travel desk in office and making holiday plans and bookings, from weekend getaways in Darjeeling and the Sunderbans, to summer or winter vacations in Thailand or Australia. Everythings arranged  tickets, stay, sightseeing, car hire																								It was the increasing demand from corporate clients that prompted Globe Forex and Travels Limited to launch its leisure travel subsidiary, Holiday Destinations Pvt Ltd, last week. As a corporate client-based company, we mainly did ticketing. But then, requests for other services poured in, like hotel tariffs and information regarding conferences and events, explained Sanjoy Sett, director, Globe Forex.																								The result is Holiday Destinations, along with the website holidaysonly4u.com, which will be updated with the latest offerings every week. The concept is to provide corporates everything under one roof, so they dont have to go shopping anywhere else for their travel needs.																								The subsidiary, although wholly owned by Globe Forex, will function independently, dealing with every aspect of travel, except air and train fares  people can either do it themselves, or we can do it through Globe Forex. Car hire, sightseeing, airport pick-ups, packages, hotel reservations and conferences in India and abroad and cruises are all part of the service.																								Leisure travel has grown by up to 20 per cent in the last year, in eastern India alone. Travel agents cant afford to remain ticket babus any more. There is a huge potential market out there, and we are just tapping in to that client base, said Sett. Domestic travel, too has grown a lot, and places like Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand have become very popular.																								Hence, the special stay offers at no less than four-star hotels  Rs 4,277 for four nights and five days in Thailand, Rs 3,900 for three nights and four days in Singapore, Rs 5,980 for three nights and four days in Sri Lanka. And there are domestic destinations as well, like Vizag and Goa.																								The highlight is that the prices are per person, and even an individual is eligible to take the holidays, apart from families and big groups. The offers are open to everyone, including non-corporate clients. For a start, Holiday Destinations has tied up with Intercontinental - The Grand Group, as the general sales agents of the hotel chains seven locations in the country. 																								Connectivity has increased and people are going places. So things are bound to change. We have more plans once this gets off the ground, added Sett.

 																											- Thalassaemia test kits differ, so do reports amp; diagnoses SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA																								Haematologists are in a fix. Pathological reports about the iron content in the blood of thalassaemia patients, tested in laboratories across the city, differ from one another. The problem is compounded by the absence of a standard guideline from the World Health Organisation (WHO) or the government health department. 																								According to the WHO guideline of 1996, treatment should start once the chelation (scraping off the deposition of iron) of blood reaches 1,000 nanograms (ng). Leading pharmaceutical firms have put the level at chelation between 1,000 ng and 2,000 ng. But neither the international body nor the companies have specified the system or procedure that can be used as a standard for taking the count, said a city haematologist.																								According to the reports available with Metro, the problem is due to the divergent techniques used to analyse the iron level in the blood (serum ferritin). 																								For example, a report of the Assembly of God Church Hospital says the safe limit of iron is 325 ng/ml, whereas Kothari Medical Centre sets the limit at 90ng/ml. At Thalassaemia Foundation, a premier hub for treating the disease, the safe limit has been set at 250ng/ml, while at Suraksha the limit is 159 ng/ml, explained a haematologist.																								The fraternity concludes that the difference in results is due to the varied testing kits used by the different centres. The reports reveal that while Assembly of God Church Hospital uses electro-fluoroscence immuno assay method, Kothari prefers the RIA technique. The Thalassaemia Foundation uses Qualigen kits by Glaxo with a Biorad 550 reader, while Suraksha tests blood with a chemi-illuminescence system and an Imulite kit. 																								The problem lies with these divergent testing methods. Due to the difference in standards, one laboratory may find the iron content within safe limits, while another laboratory may find it highly unsafe and call for an immediate transfusion said a leading haematologist treating thalassaemic patients.																								As a result, the doctors are perplexed over whether the patient needs to be given blood or not, as one report shows he needs a transfusion while the other of the same sample negates the decision. another haematologist added.																								C.R. Maiti, director of medical education, said: At present, I do not have the guideline that mentions the standard of the ferritin level.

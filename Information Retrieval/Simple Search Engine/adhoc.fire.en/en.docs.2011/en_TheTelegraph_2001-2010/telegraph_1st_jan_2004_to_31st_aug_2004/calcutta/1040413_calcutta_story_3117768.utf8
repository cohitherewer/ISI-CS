 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 A celebration of fertility
																								Bidding adieu to the season of spring does fill our hearts with sadness, but it also heralds the onset of summer with its gentle, warm and windy days, imploring Mother Nature to once again create, generate and renew the cycle of life. In celebration of the season of life and re-birth, Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) hosts Vasundhara a celebration of fertility with a four-day festival of folk dances from all over the country, including Bihu (Assam), Santhali (Bengal), Sambalpuri (Orissa), Bhangra (Punjab), Garba (Gujarat) and Kaikottakali (Kerala), to name a few. Built on the theme of fertility and its associations with birth, life and youth, each dance of the ensemble has been aesthetically choreographed along with suitable narrations, as a lyrical invocation to the warm season.																								Event: A festival of folk dances																								When: April 13 - 16; 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, Salt Lake

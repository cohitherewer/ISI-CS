 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 The saga of a salt puppet
																								Though we live in a progressive, modern society that apparently treats men and women as equals, we hear incidents of atrocities being committed on women everyday. To be staged as a form of protest against such crimes, Little Thespians Hindi play, Namak ki Gudiya, makes an effort to show how and question why women continue to sacrifice their happiness at the altar of the self-seeking, hypocritical attitudes of men. The play tells us the tragic story of Nargis Bano, a young, innocent girl married to Shamsuddin, who has no qualms about cheating his devoted, trustful wife. But that is not all. When he discovers that his wife has come to know of his infidelity, he divorces her and even has her pregnancy terminated, as an instrument of repression and as a malevolent expression of his absolute power over her. What is particularly poignant and ironic about this play is that Shamsuddins mother and sister, themselves women, are equally responsible for Nargis Banos plight.																								Event: Play in Hindi, Namak Ki Gudiya, produced by Little Thespian																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, Salt Lake

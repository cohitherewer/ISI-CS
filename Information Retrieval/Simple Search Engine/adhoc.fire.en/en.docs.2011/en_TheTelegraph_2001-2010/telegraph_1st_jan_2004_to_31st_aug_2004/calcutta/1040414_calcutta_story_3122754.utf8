		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 Saktikali Basu								Director-in-charge, Indian Museum																																							The basic objectives of museums would be lost if all exhibits are kept under lock and key for fear of theft. After all, heritage artefacts are the peoples property and are meant for visitors. They educate citizens about their cultural history. Moreover, tourists come from afar to take a look at them. So the authorities of sites housing heritage artefacts should take proper security measures rather than restrict public access. For instance, Lord Buddhas remains, stored in our care, draw a huge number of visitors from the Far East. We have kept them in a bullet-proof glass covering.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Adrenaline rush in road race rage
 The seven MTV Roadies chill out at The Astor Hotel prior to their forthcoming speed trip to be captured on the reality show. Picture by Rashbehari DasGet, set, go is what the MTV Hero Honda Roadies (2) are going to do on August 21. Kicking off their expedition from Victoria Memorial, the roadies will zip through a 35-day journey that will take them right on to the Wagah border traversing more than 2,000 km. 																								The second set of roadies comprise seven young guns (four boys and three girls), chosen from a pool of 10,000 aspirants. 																								Firm determination and tenacity separated the grain from the chaff during gruelling auditions.																								The hunt brought together a group of super seven that includes Calcutta boy Varun Agarwal, a B.Com student, who has a passion for girls and bikes. Riding pillion is courage personified Vinod Ranawat from Mumbai who lost a leg at the age of six but is raring to step hard on the accelerator, an artificial leg notwithstanding. Shaleen Bhanot hails from the same city, making his way into the team simply because of his unbeatable go-getter attitude. Ayushman Khurrana completes the lad list. The die-hard Aamir Khan fan hailing from Chandigarh is a jack of all trades with varied interests like theatre and cricket. A passion for travelling is sure to see him through this new-found interest.																								The lass list includes Candy Brar from Chandigarh, winner of the Miss India North contest in 1999. She is among the ones to watch out for. I am here to win, warns this dare devil. Following suit is aspiring lawyer Neha Bhatia, all set to hit the road and hog on all the adventure possible. Twenty-three-year-old Aarthi Seth is the incurable romantic in the gang. She loves to play hockey and has a thing for romantic movies. 																								The reality show will capture the trails and travails of this diverse group as they hit the rough road leading to a whole lot of fun followed by the pot luck of Rs 5 lakh and a Hero Honda bike for the lucky winner.

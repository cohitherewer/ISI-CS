 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Silent spurt in cracking bones
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Osteoporosis affects one of three women in the city and now ranks fourth among non-infectious diseases  after heart ailments, cancer and diabetes. 																								Every year, it causes over 1.5 million fractures in the city and the rest of the country. Most are caused by very poor intake of calcium and vitamin-D.																								For those who are keen on statistics, these are scary, indeed. Doctors from the city and the rest of the country sat down on Tuesday for a brainstorming session at a clinic to discuss ways to deal with the problem, which has been increasing by leaps and bounds mostly due to the ignorance of the people.																								Osteoporosis is a progressive, systematic skeletal disease that causes deterioration of bone tissue, ultimately causing the bones to become fragile and finally fracture. 																								The disease, if left untreated, can progress silently, causing bones inside the body to break, without anybody having a inkling of what is going on.																								According to a World Health Organisation report, osteoporosis is now a global problem, requiring urgent attention.																								Since genetic factors are one of the primary reasons behind the rise in cases of osteoporosis, people must take necessary precautions. As high as 75 per cent of the patients actually inherit the disease, said D.N. Laud, orthopaedic surgeon from Mumbai, during an interactive session organised by the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre on Tuesday.																								Around 300 million people in the country are now afflicted with osteoporosis and the figure is likely to increase by another 50 per cent in the next 10 years. 																								Every year, of 1.5 million fractures in India, 300,000 are fractures of the hip, while a staggering seven lakh are fractures of the vertebrae. 																								The disease is not just about calcium deficiency, but a combination of the loss of organic matter in the bone, which gives elasticity, and the inorganic matter, that gives strength, guest speaker Laud told the meet.																								Considerable prevention can be achieved by adequate diet, regular exercise, walking for 35-40 minutes, physical therapy (like massage) and medication, according to Laud.

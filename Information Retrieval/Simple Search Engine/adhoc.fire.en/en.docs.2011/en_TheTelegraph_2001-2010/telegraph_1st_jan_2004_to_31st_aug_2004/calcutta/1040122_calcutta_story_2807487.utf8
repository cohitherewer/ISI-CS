 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Cancer patients queuing up for radiotherapy in state-run hospitals run the risk of receiving a wrong dose or inadequate radiation. An acute shortage of medical physicists is forcing hospitals to cut short drastically the pre-radiation planning before a patient is laid on the table.																								The crisis of physicists has forced the authorities of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) to stop work on the brachytherapy machine, the latest in cancer-radiation treatment, which allows contact of the machine on the human body for better results. So, patients are turning to other government hospitals plagued with the same problem.																								Flouting the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) norm of allotting only 400 new patients a year to a solitary physicist, hospitals in Calcutta that have radiotherapy facilities are taking in more than thrice the number.																								As a result, the physicist, who doubles as the radiological safety officer, is forced to devote 15 to 30 minutes per patient. The state-of-the-art, 3-D treatment planning system, currently in use in medical colleges, demands three hours of preparation. 																								A medical physicist-cum-radiological safety officer plays the most crucial role in planning the radiation therapy for patients. Before the process gets underway, it is the physicist who has to ensure the safety of the patient, the correct dose and also his own personal safety, which is always a big risk.																								For instance, the oldest radiotherapy unit in Asia, at Medical College and Hospital, has only two physicists and in the past 12 months, they have carried out the planning for 1,600 patients each, 1,200 more than the BARC norms. We have asked the government to send us physicists, or else the situation might spin out of control, says Subir Gangopadhyay, Medical College radiotherapy head.																								Apart from the Medical College duo, CNCI has two physicists, while RG Kar, SSKM and NRS Medical College and Hospital have one each. We need more physicists. Work on the brachytherapy machine had to be stopped as the BARC norms are very strict and we must have an extra physicist to get things moving, Tapas Majhi, CNCI head of radiotherapy, told Metro on Wednesday. 																								Faced with the acute crisis, the government has shot off a letter to the Salt Lake-based Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) to re-start a diploma course in radiological physics, which it wound up a few years ago. At the moment, only BARC runs a training course that puts out 20 new physicists every year.																								Health secretary Asim Barman wrote to SINP that due to acute shortage of medical physicists-cum-radiological safety officers, we are finding it extremely difficult to run cancer treatment centres. The number of cancer cases stands at 50,000, and is rising every year.

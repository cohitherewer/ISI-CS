 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Polish-and-split gold thieves
 																											- Housewives coaxed to part with jewellery by gang still at large A STAFF REPORTER																								A gang has decamped with jewellery after gently convincing housewives to let it polish their gold in the Golabari and Howrah police station areas. 																								At least a dozen families have fallen victim to the wiles of this gang, that has left the police baffled and bewildered. 																								Officers admit that they have never come across a gang that works with such precision. Two or three members of the gang approach a prospective victims house and claim that they are goldsmiths, who have opened a new set-up in Howrah to provide home service, against a nominal fee of Rs 10. 																								At least a dozen families in Golabari and Howrah have lodged complaints with the police. 																								Two men came to my house and coaxed me into allowing them to clean my gold ornaments. They first asked for some warm water and a little turmeric powder, which they mixed with a liquid chemical, said complainant Rekha Sarkar. 																								They then put the ornaments in the pot and asked me to fetch a glass of water. When I returned, they were missing, Sarkar added.																								Nilima Karmakar of Golabari has also had a similar experience. The men usually drop by in the afternoon, when our husbands are away. They tell us our jewellery will glitter if washed with the imported chemical. 																								Said Rita Das, another victim: They put the turmeric powder in the hot water and then poured the transparent liquid into it to stir up a mixture. They claimed it was the best thing for treating gold ornaments. 																								Complained Sreemati Das, another victim: Even before I could raise an alarm, they had fled. I rushed out of the house, but they were nowhere to be seen. The ornaments were all gone. They had left only the jar of chemical behind. 																								In the past month, the areas where the gang struck are Rosemary Lane, Watkins Lane, Jeliapara, Nandybagan (in the Golabari police station area) and Rameshwar Malia Lane, in the Howrah police station area. 																								The culprits are still at large. They are difficult to trace, though we are trying our best to do so, said a police officer. 																								Going by what the victims said, the thieves have till now stolen gold ornaments worth a few lakhs. Their approach was so gentle that we could not believe that they could do such a thing, said Namita Mallick, another victim.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Chaos behind creation
Face of Fashion - Sabyasachi Mukherjee First the grind: Dye patches are what we usually avoid, said Sabyasachi, dyeing a sari for the Fashion Week collection on the terrace of his studio last week. But that is the look I want. Then the glitter: Below, one of his ensembles. Pictures by Pabitra Das Ace designer Sabyasachi, whose collection hits the Delhi ramp on Saturday, writes about the mad rush in the run up to Lakm India Fashion Week, having bitten off way more than he could possibly chew																								This year I almost made up my mind that I was going to pull out of Fashion Week. My schedule was complete madness, and I just did not have the time for the introspection needed to come up with a collection I would be happy with.																								I was working on the costumes for Black (Sanjay Leela Bhansalis upcoming film). Then I got a call for Malaysia Fashion Week to represent India. I accepted, as it wasnt clashing with Fashion Week here. But then Lakm India was rescheduled because of the elections! By that time there was no way I could back out of either.																								There are always bridal orders and boutiques. I also had to create a line for the Style File Lifestyle show in Mumbai. When some of the continuity clothes for the movie got burnt in the fire on the sets, I ended up doing a lot of last minute clothes shopping. There were just too many things going on that had no relation to the other.																								But the fun of doing Fashion Week is that you get to choose what you wish to do. There is no limit to creativity. You can imagine your buyer. When you design for an actual client you have a lot of other considerations. Here, you get to choose your market. I look at it as a huge sabbatical from work.																								It is also a very humbling experience. It is a great leveller. I thought I would be a coward to back out. The event provides an equal platform for everyone; it is truly the survival of the fittest out there. You discover so much about yourself by comparing your work and seeing where you are lacking.																								Any kind of competition brings out either the best  or the worst  in you. So I decided to balance it all. 																								By the end of it, my schedule looked like this: After fittings in Delhi, I reached Malaysia on April 25. The show was on April 27. I flew into Delhi on April 28 night. My show is on May 1. Then, I leave again on May 7 with the collection for America Fashion Week, at Miami Beach, for a show on May 14.																								I had to let something go. The film had taken its toll on me. The most important shoots for Black are happening now, but I realised there was no way I could make it, so I sent the clothes off, and they will manage the rest.																								Fashion designers and costume designers are completely different breeds. Fashion designers strive for perfection. Costume designers strive to meet deadlines. There is just no way you cant deliver. You end up feeling bad because you are letting down an entire crew, and you dont want to be responsible for holding up a days shoot, with production costs running as high as they do.																								On the travel front, visas turned out to be the most difficult thing, with the tonnes of paperwork involved. I would get time to design by 11 clock at night, though my assistants made my life a lot easier. I have such an excellent team.																								But the whole experience turned out to be back-breaking, almost like joining the military! I realised that I should never bite off more than I should chew.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Medical tourist scouts
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After planning to link Calcutta airport to various destinations in Southeast Asia, the Union commerce ministry has decided to boost medical tourism in Bengal.																								At the Centres behest, the Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation (FIEO) is on a mission to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to showcase medical facilities in Calcutta as well as rest of the country. The FIEO had already undertaken a feasibility tour of the three South-east Asian nations in May. 																								The tour was an eye-opener. We held detailed discussions with the governments and hospitals. We realised that medical tourism in states like Bengal was a huge possibility, said Ashok Kumar, FIEO deputy director, from Delhi.																								The government has asked the FIEO for a follow-up tour to Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore with a medical team. The result: 20 representatives from top private hospitals will lure medical tourists to India. 																								We grabbed the FIEO offer as soon it came, because Calcutta has the potential to become a healthcare hub for patients from Southeast Asia, said Sajal Dutta, president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI). 																								Dutta, managing director of Ruby General Hospital, along with Major Amit De of BM Birla Heart Research Centre, are members of the team that will fly to Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. 																								We will try to explain to them that the up-and-down air fare and the cost of treatment, taken together, is much cheaper in Calcutta than in their countries, Dutta added.																								Apart from the Calcutta hospitals, representatives from healthcare majors such as Jaslok, Apollo Gleneagles, Breach Candy and Escorts are in the team. 																								We are convinced that the high cost of medical treatment in the three Southeast Asian countries will be reason enough for them to come to India. Our hospitals are all top-quality and we can provide value-added service to them, T.R. Venkatraman, FIEO adviser, told Metro from Chennai.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Ordeals end in battle of survival
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Im glad the judge has sentenced my husbands killers to life imprisonment. I hope they die in prison while serving their term.																								A single, silent tear trickled down Soma Sens impassive face as she uttered these words. 																								Hastily drying her eyes, Bapi Sens widow spoke little, sitting beside her brother-in-law Anup, the trauma of the yearlong trial, and the tragedy before it, sitting heavy on her tired shoulders.																								We are happy with the judges decision. We are also aware that there may be still a long way to go before this is finally over, said Anup, Bapis elder brother, speaking for the family.																								The ordeal has clearly taken a physical toll on Bapis elderly mother, Menoka. I am satisfied with the decision taken by the judge, she said, a frown creasing her troubled brow. She had not been feeling well after she heard the verdict and soon retreated to her room.																								The family is still not at peace, preparing, now, for the worst.																								Initially, I had thought the culprits would go scot-free. After this verdict, it will not surprise us if their lawyers try to tarnish Bapis image as they prepare to move to a higher judicial authority. But that is their job. In the end, the truth must prevail, sighed Anup.																								The judicial system has worked very well in this case, with such proceedings tending to take a lot more time. On several occasions, defence counsel had tried to stall for time, but the judge warned that such tricks would go against them in the long run, he added.																								The first battle won, the Sen family is getting ready to get on with the rest of their lives.																								Life is a constant struggle, but it must go on. Our father was an honest police officer and brought us up on sound principles, reminisced Anup. 																								That is the reason why Bapi chose to intervene when an unknown lady was being harassed, even though he was off duty at the time. That is also the reason why we will continue the fight, in his memory, so that the judgment stands, no matter how far the matter goes, he said.

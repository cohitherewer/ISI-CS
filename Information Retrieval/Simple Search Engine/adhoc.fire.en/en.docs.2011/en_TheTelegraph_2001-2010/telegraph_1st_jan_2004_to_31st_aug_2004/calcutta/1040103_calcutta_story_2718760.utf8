 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Bengal sticks to JEE domicile bar revoke
 																											- Talks on seat quota for national candidates in engineering colleges A STAFF REPORTER																								Shifting gears in its drive to draw students from beyond the borders to engineering institutions in Bengal, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government said on Friday it would stand by its decision to conduct joint entrance examinations (JEE) for applicants from other states.																								The government recently threw open its engineering institutes for students from all states by scrapping the domicile criterion for those appearing in the state-conducted JEE 2004.																								The question of reimposing the domicile restrictions does not arise. Students from anywhere in the country will be able to sit for the JEE this year, as was announced by the government earlier, said Jawhar Sircar, principal secretary, higher education department.																								There was confusion among students following reports that Delhi had sent a circular to the Bengal government stating that all states were free to draw outstation students, but only through the All-India Engineering Entrance Examinations (AIEEE). The national-level exam, conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), was introduced two years ago.																								We are not disobeying the Central order, as nowhere does the circular mention that we must reintroduce the domicile criterion, said Sircar.																								According to the domicile restrictions, in place till last year, it was mandatory either for JEE candidates themselves or their parents to have resided in Bengal for 10 years at a stretch.																								Sudipto Mukhopadhay, additional secretary, state joint entrance board, confirmed that the distribution of JEE forms for students of other states has already started. This years JEE will be held on April 24 and 25. The AIEEE will be conducted on May 9.																								Last year, around 49,000 students had appeared for JEE and the number is expected to rise significantly with the domicile restriction being lifted in 2004.																								The government, however, is also preparing the ground to reserve 15 to 25 per cent of the total 12,000-plus seats in all its 49 engineering institutions, including Jadavpur University and Shibpur Bengal Engineering College, for students coming through the AIEEE.																								A committee has been set up by the government to examine the matter of accepting students coming through the AIEEE. Several meetings have been held already and we will be in a position to finalise the exact percentage of seats to be reserved for the AIEEE candidates soon, said higher education department principal secretary Sircar.																								Sources in the education department said over the years, the government was becoming increasingly concerned over the large number of meritorious students from Calcutta leaving for cities like Bangalore and Pune to pursue higher studies in engineering.																								Confronted with this brain drain, the government chose to lift the domicile curb on JEE as the obvious tool to challenge some of the destinations where trainloads of students from Calcutta were trundling off to.																								Sources in the higher education department, however, said the decision to throw open a sizeable number of engineering seats for students coming through AIEEE was prompted by the missive from the Centre.																								The letter indicates that Delhi might impose certain restrictions on the state governments decision to allow students from other states to appear for the JEE if it refuses to accept a two-year-old proposal of the CBSE to reserve a certain section of engineering seats for AIEEE candidates.

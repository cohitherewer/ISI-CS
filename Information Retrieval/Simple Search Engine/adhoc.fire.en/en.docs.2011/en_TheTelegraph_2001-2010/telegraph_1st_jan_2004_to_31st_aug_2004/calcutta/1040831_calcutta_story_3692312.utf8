 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Couple media-savvy, works slick 
 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 Chintan and Hema Upadhyay before the formers work Designer Babies currently being exhibited at CIMA Gallery. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Chintan Upadhyay is originally from the Vagad area of Rajasthan, close to its borders with Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. His father being an abstract artist and he having access to the karkhanas of miniature artists from a young age, Chintan had been exposed to both traditional and contemporary art. 																								But Chintan had also noticed the pressure under which his father worked and had decided to become either an architect or a businessman, but never an artist (his family had mostly been farmers). 																								When he did become an artist himself, he often went to science for inspiration. His project for CIMA Gallery, where his works are being exhibited along with his wife Hemas, is on genetic engineering.																								Hemas maiden name was Hirnani. An articulate young woman, she says she comes from a Sindhi business family that had migrated to Baroda from Karachi during the Partition. 																								Unlike Chintan, I had an Anglicised background and a democratic upbringing, she said, before the CIMA show. So she was free to take up any career of her choice, and like Chintan, she studied art at Maharaja Sayajirao University in her hometown. 																								After marriage, both moved to Mumbai, and their work has been greatly influenced by this city where dreams are manufactured and destroyed.																								Chintans main concern is media and consumerism, while he was talking about the city of Bombay. He tries to address the various controversial issues arising out of his concerns that are shared by people all over the world. 																								His earlier exposure to the Jaipur ateliers has, however, left no mark on his work, except in a very superficial way on his images that are far from new in cyberspace. He thinks of a time when three different time frames coexisted. In his Designer Babies, the Rajasthani miniatures come as a body suit giving a specific identity to the figures. The moment you remove the body suit the question of identity arises  whose babies are these? Thereby, he tries to create a debate on the technology of genetic engineering.																								Upadhyays other area of inquiry purportedly being media-created gloss that hides the flaws in the main product, all his babies have deformities that are revealed on close scrutiny. His work, too, has a slickness and high finish that appears skin-deep. He defends this look, saying: If I lose this slickness the whole comment on media will collapse.																								Like her husband, Hema, too, is taken up with issues that have virtually become international buzzwords  in her case, migration and displacement. These are not newly-minted ideas. She claims her concern stems from the fact that her family was forced to leave its hometown Karachi. 																								In her work she examines the idea of losing ones identity in the faceless crowds of Mumbai, where the couple came to live from Baroda. She plants tiny photographs of herself in her works. They signify the fact that she  primarily a shy human being  is opening up as a person.																								Hemas pictorial language and scale are quite different from her husbands. At the CIMA show, she often uses grids through which her self slips in and out like an elusive being. In one work, she sits Puck-like on the tendrils of a creeper. 																								The couple has collaborated on Objects of Desire and Made in China. Both projects, as the titles suggest, take on consumerism and the failure of technology. 																								Very savvy they are.

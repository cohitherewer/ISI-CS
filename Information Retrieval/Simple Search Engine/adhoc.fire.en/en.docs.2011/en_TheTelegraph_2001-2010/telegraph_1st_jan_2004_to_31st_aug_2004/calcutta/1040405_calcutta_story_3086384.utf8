The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Ward shining, four-year feat
Shyamadas Roy				 	 Shyamadas Roy, Trinamul Congress councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ward no. 126, met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Benu Roychowdhury, Sekhar Motilal, Pulak Maity, Sunil Roychowdhury, Shibu Mukherjee, Anup Bhattacharjee, and Nilotpal Mukherjee				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Anup Bhattacharjee: More streetlights are needed. The old ones require maintenance.																																																			Members of the opposition party always clamour for more streetlights because in their tenure of 15 years, they couldnt do a thing. In the past four years, the local area development (LAD) fund of our member of Parliament (MP) has helped us light up all our major roads. 																																																											I often hear these leaders claim that the projects had been taken up by them in their tenure. But it has been only in our tenure that vapour lamps have reached even the backward areas of our ward. A few pockets need more lights and we are trying to instal them shortly. 																																																											We have only one maintenance contractor of the CMC for the ward. We are trying to commission a local man for the job. We are also in talks with the CMDA.																																																									

Pulak Maity: What are the new projects in the ward that have been funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)?																																																			I, too, heard that the ADB is to fund various projects, but when the aid will actually come is still unknown. 																																																									

Pulak Maity: In some places, the drains and roads are not paved properly.																																																			We just completed construction of a major part of the areas sewerage. Seventy per cent of the drains and roads have been rectified in these four years. Some areas we have been forced to neglect, because enough funds have not been allotted.																																																									

Sekhar Motilal: There are schools in the ward that need development and renovation.																																																			Yes, there are 10 government primary schools, two CMC-sponsored primary schools and four secondary and higher secondary schools in the ward. I have mobilised MP Krishna Boses LAD funds for the development of all these schools. 																																																											We are also trying to upgrade some schools and libraries. The age-old building of the South Calcutta Free Primary School will get an overhaul. Since the roof is still under construction, we have appealed to the Election Commission to allow us to utilise the MLAs LAD funds before the monsoon sets in. About Rs 15 lakh has been spent on these schools.																																																									

Shibu Mukherjee: Domestic waste is not cleared properly and mosquitoes thrive.																																																			Actually, all these activities depend on the borough committee. If the borough members are not cooperative, then these problems prevail. For the past year, the borough committee has not called any meeting to discuss the local problems. 																																																											About the mosquito menace, I am told the workers lack a sprayer for insecticides. Apart from all this, there is a shortage of hands.																																																									

Benu Roychowdhury: We dont get clean drinking water. At times, there are insects in it.																																																			I have heard that upper Behala suffers from an identical problem. I will ask our engineers how that can happen. As for water scarcity, 14 tubewells are defunct but the other 68 are working. We have repaired about 13 of them recently. 																																																									

Sunil Roychowdhury: Autorickshaws are becoming a problem. They are plying through each and every lane and bylane and the number of accidents is on rise.																																																			Autorickshaws are a cause of discomfort but you will admit that this ward is sprawling. There are settlements that are far away from the main roads. Only autos can make the transit shorter for residents and visitors at a low cost. A rickshaw will charge a minimum of Rs 7 but an auto only Rs 3.50. And the problem of accidents can be checked if the drivers and residents remain a little alert while on the roads.																																																									

Anup Bhattacharjee: Underground waterpipes often crack, flooding the metalled roads.																																																			The underground pipes crack easily as they are made of cement dust and do not have the load-bearing capacity. We plan to replace them with iron pipes once we gather funds.

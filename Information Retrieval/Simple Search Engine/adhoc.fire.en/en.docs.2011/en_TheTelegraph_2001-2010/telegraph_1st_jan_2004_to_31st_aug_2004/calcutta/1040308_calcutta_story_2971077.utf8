The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 The bold and the beautiful
In commemoration of International Womens Day, Thoughtshop Foundation and West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society present That Takes Ovaries, an open mike story sharing session where women will narrate real-life acts of bravery and courage. With Mira Kakkar as anchorperson and theatre personality Sohini Sengupta Haldar as the MC, the session will encourage women to share their own bold, gutsy, daring experiences with others, and in the process motivate, inspire and empower other women as well. Ranging from the playful to the political, from heroic acts of courage to impassioned struggles to gain human rights, the session promises to be remarkable as it gives ordinary women the opportunity to share with us their acts of extraordinary courage. Covering incidents that have taken place in these womens lives, no matter how big or small, That Takes Ovaries is a celebration of women who may not have made it to headlines or history books, but have proved that they are in no way less than men in terms of strength, power or fearlessness.

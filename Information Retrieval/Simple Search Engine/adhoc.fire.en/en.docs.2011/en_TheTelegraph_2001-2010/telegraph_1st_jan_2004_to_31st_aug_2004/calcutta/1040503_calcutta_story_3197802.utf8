 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND MITA MUKHERJEE																								Psychological problems among children are on the rise, and who can feel it better than authorities of state-run schools? 																								The authorities of these schools find it difficult to cope with the pressure because of an acute shortage of psychologists and counselling centres in state-run medical colleges and hospitals. They are desperately seeking help, but health officials throw up their hands in despair. 																								Admitting that there are not many psychologists in the medical college hospitals, C.R. Maity, director of medical education, said the government was considering appointing more counsellors. The only place to take children in need of counselling is the lone adolescent guidance centre at the Medical College and Hospital (MCH). The clinic is overcrowded and school authorities are not impressed. 																								Problems like depression, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, school-phobia and attitude problems have been increasing by leaps and bounds among schoolchildren, but the government-aided schools, that can only refer these children to government hospitals, very sadly either do not have enough facilities or psychologists, said Ashok Maity, general secretary of the West Bengal Headmasters Association.																								According to statistics available, the 1,000-odd government-run schools in the city and fringe areas have reported at least 20 cases on an average this year, compared to four or five cases reported two years ago. 																								Psychological problems among children are definitely increasing these days. The problems are manifold and require professional handling. This disturbing trend must be addressed, first by parents and then by counsellors, echoed Prabhat Chatterjee, principal of Hare School. Recently, the school recommended several batches of problem children to the adolescent guidance clinic at the MCH for help.																								However, the clinic, the only such unit in a government-run hospital, does not have adequate arrangements to address the problem and has asked the paediatrics department of the hospital to take charge. A visiting psychologist does come to the hospital. But, the schools feel, one centre is not enough. While private schools are better off and have their own counsellors and in-house facilities, government-run schools do not have any choice but to seek help from government hospitals that face a scarcity of professionals.																								SSKM Hospital and NRS Medical College and Hospital have one psychologist each, while the other hospitals do not have any or their number is far too low. The Mental Health Act, 1987, specifies that there should be at least one psychiatrist for every 10 patients in an indoor ward of a city medical college, but there are only two or three psychiatrists, on an average, which is inadequate. So, most schools are doing the counselling themselves to solve the problems.

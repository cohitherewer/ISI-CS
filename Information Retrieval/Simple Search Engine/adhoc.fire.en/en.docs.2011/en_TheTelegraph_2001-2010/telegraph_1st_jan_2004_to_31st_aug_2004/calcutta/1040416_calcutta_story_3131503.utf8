The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 City gives Delhi a run for Dior life

Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Elgin Road and South Ex neck-at-neck in snapping up the biggest French style statement around? While a smarting Delhi smart set may pull out its smelling salts at this unthinkable thought, Calcutta is busy spraying on its latest designer perfume.																								Christian Dior is turning up the Fahrenheit, and Calcutta has proved willing and able to take the heat. The year-old Shoppers Stop counter is the countrys highest-selling single Dior outlet, alongside the South Extension branch in Delhi. Fragrances have been flying off the shelves at the nicest counter in India, with cosmetics and beauty products doing well, too.																								We were very surprised at how successful we have been here, confesses Anthony Rodriguez, general manager, India, Euro Traditions, the exclusive marketing agent for Dior fragrances in India. Though Mumbai and Delhi have more branches, diluting sales of the individual outlets, Calcuttas performance has made it a key region. A second counter  only for perfumes, though  will feature at the upcoming City Centre Shoppers Stop as well.																								While brands Jadore and Poison are her picks, Fahrenheit and Higher Energy are his. The trend is pretty much the same for the whole country, explains Rodriguez, though globally, Poison, an older, heavier perfume, is not doing as well. 																								But in south India, there is a significant demand for Poison amongst men, too, he smiles. While the 100 ml bottles may be more expensive at around Rs 4,000  the value-conscious Calcuttan prefers them to the 50 ml version, which packs in less value for money.																								The Calcutta buzz was loud enough to bring Sourena Kowsar, area manager, Christian Dior, based in Dubai, to the city to check things out on Thursday. This is the nicest counter, with the international silver look, that we have in the country, explains Kowsar. We have been doing pretty well in India, and we hope to continue in this way. 																								Without competition from its closest French perfumeries, like Chanel and Lancome, the India experience has been happy. We keep hearing that they will come, but they dont. And I hope they dont, he laughs.																								More makeover sessions, like one conducted by the Mumbai-based Fiona Carolina at the city counter on Thursday afternoon, are what the company plans to increase brand visibility. In Bangalore, Dior is opening a personalised treatment room. If we get the right kind of space, well open one in Calcutta, too, reveals Rodriguez.

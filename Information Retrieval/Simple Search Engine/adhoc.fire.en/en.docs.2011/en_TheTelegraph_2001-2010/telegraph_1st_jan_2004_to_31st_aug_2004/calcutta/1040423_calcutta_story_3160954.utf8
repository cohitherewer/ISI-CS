Murder: 3The shadow of the gun lengthened over the citys trader hub on Thursday afternoon, with yet another storm-and-snatch operation.Five armed men invaded a third-floor office of a hundi businessman at Manohardas Katra, in the Burrabazar police station area, and looted Rs 14 lakh.According to police, one of the office employees, Pawan Bajaj, was injured when the miscreants hit him on the head with the butt of a revolver. Bajaj was taken to Marwari Relief Society Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.																								There were three men working in the office when five goons, with revolvers and pipe-guns, stormed in. While one stood guard at the door, two gagged the staff members with sticking plaster and tied them up. The remaining two picked up the money from the open cash-box, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh.																								According to Bajajs colleagues, the entire operation did not last more than five minutes. 																								Right from the time they entered the office, they knew exactly what they wanted. They did not hesitate for a second and each worked with clockwork precision. It was only when Bajaj tried to resist that two of them pinned him down and hit him on the head, they told police.																								Police said the modus operandi was similar to a heist at a store on Bentinck Street. The employees of that store, too, had first been gagged with sticking plaster before being trussed up. It seems the same gang struck on Thursday, said police.																								Sleuths of the anti-dacoity wing of the detective department reached the spot within half-an-hour and with the help of the dog squad, tried to trace the escape route, but failed.																								The robbers had left the used roll of sticking tape behind. The dog picked up the smell but lost the trail on the crowded street, said an officer. 																								The gang grabbed Rs 14 lakh but missed a bundle of notes  adding up to Rs 7.60 lakh  concealed under the mattress. This was later discovered by sleuths. Fingerprint experts have been called in to help identify the criminals, an officer added.																								Its just a matter of days before we arrest the culprits. We rounded up some robbers recently, while a few of their associates remain at large. It could be their handiwork. Preliminary investigations suggest that this gang has a few new faces, asserted an officer of the anti-dacoity wing.

Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: We have recently moved into a flat in a high-rise where the eastern room has large windows that look over gardens. I would like to do the interiors of this room according to Feng Shui principles. What colours, furniture and accessories will enhance the energy of this area?																								Devyani, Calcutta																								A: The room in the east should be suggestive of tree energy that is represented by tall wooden cabinets, large wooden framed rectangular mirrors, wooden sculptures, furniture, flooring and panelling. Fresh healthy green plants with striped curtains, green rugs or carpets and pictures or paintings of flowers and nature inspire growth. They also establish a connection between heaven and earth.																								Q: My daughter, who is a student of Class VI (born on 11.4.93), is unable to concentrate on her studies. Her study room is located in the north-east of our apartment and the walls are painted blue. Could you please suggest some ways to do up her room in a way that will help her study better? 																								Name withheld																								A: The pillars of destiny according to her date of birth reveal that she is a strong water person. Therefore, her surroundings need to be balanced with wood and fire elements. Green and red are compatible shades for her, rather than blues. The colour green in particular represents intellect and will help her in creative and intellectual pursuits. 																								According to her kua number, north-east is favourable for the development of her personality. And it helps that her study is located in the direction, but she should sit facing the north-east while studying.Q: My husband is a business co-ordinator. While he works hard, he never gets his due. We live in a four-room apartment on the second floor. The entrance of the house faces north and is painted dark brown.We have placed an aquarium with five goldfish beside the door. A dark corridor leads to the living room facing east. Can you please suggest any changes that need to be made to bring in better financial luck? Indrani																								A: North is connected with business and your main door is correctly placed to invite business opportunities and a generous flow of money into the house. A copper or a silver strip placed underneath a marble threshold, just before the main door will help contain the vital chi. Hang a metal wind chime with six or seven hollow rods just above the door from inside. Increase the number of fish from five to nine as this number is considered to be magical and it attracts luck.																								Dark and gloomy places will suffocate the cosmic energy and prevent it from circulating and nourishing the occupants of the home. It is always better to enter into a warmly lit and a welcoming space that is not cramped up. Install a mirror on the side-wall with an overhead light. Van Goghs Sunflowers may be out of reach, but paintings of flowers are believed to inspire growth, according to Feng Shui (Reuters)Q: My house is situated on an east-west plot, which is 100 ft, by 30 ft. In the north there are houses of the same height and construction is yet to start on a plot which lies south. In the east is a 24 ft-by-30 ft closed space for gardening. The kitchen is right in the middle of the house. We want to shift the master bedroom to the southwest and my daughters study opposite to this. The puja room will be on the northeast and there is a small verandah opposite this. Please advise on how we could improve the arrangement.																								B. K. Mandal																								A: Construct a tall thick wall towards the south, as there is no construction existing at present. This wall should continue towards west to provide support. The eastern and northern walls should be short and less thick. 																								While the rest is fine, the kitchen definitely needs to be shifted to the eastern or southeastern side of the house. It should never be built in the central part of the house as the drainage system of the kitchen drains away the valuable energy which otherwise would have radiated in all the directions.																								Q: I live in a duplex with a staircase running through the middle of the house. I would like to build an independent second floor on top of this duplex. I want to know the best position and direction for building a new external staircase for my house.																								Meedeep																								A: A staircase running through the middle of the house is strictly against Feng Shui principles. This is the tai chi or brahmasthan where the energy from different directions merges and radiate out at the same time. Blocking this powerful energy with a staircase in the middle is inadvisable. This is also like the heart of the house and too much pressure here, according to Feng Shui, can cause heart problems to its residents. 																								The staircase is best constructed in the west, southwest or south. It should never be constructed in the northeast. One should always rise from the east to the west or the north to the south direction. Also avoid having a spiral staircase or the ones that have gaps between each step as this signifies leakage of wealth.

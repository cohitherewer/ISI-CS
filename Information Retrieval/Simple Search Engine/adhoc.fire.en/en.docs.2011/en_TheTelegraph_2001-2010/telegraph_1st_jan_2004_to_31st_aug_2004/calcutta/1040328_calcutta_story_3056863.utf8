 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Cop locks in, starves parents for property
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A sub-inspector in the ranks of Calcutta Polices Reserve Force was arrested on Saturday for keeping his parents confined in a dingy room since Wednesday without food. He was picked up following a complaint lodged by his elderly father, Ashok Chakraborty, a retired engineer, with the Lake police station.																								Subrata Chakraborty tortured his parents mentally and physically with the intention of getting them to hand over the family property. We have arrested him on specific charges, said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).																								The elderly couple resides in a three-storeyed building at South End Park with their son and daughter-in-law. Their only daughter lives with her husband in another locality of south Calcutta. 																								For the past two years, the two were subjected to Chakrabortys abuses and threats, which gradually increased. 																								For the past three months, the harsh words were accompanied by kicks and blows, as the son mounted pressure on his parents to sign off the property deed in his name. 																								The torture reached a peak on Wednesday when Chakraborty locked up both his parents in a dingy room with a single window on the second floor of the building without food or water. 																								The aged duo suffered thus for three days, before they managed to slip a note to the domestic help, instructing her to inform their daughter about their predicament and appeal to her to come and rescue them from the hands of their son.																								The nightmare ended on Friday, when Chakrabortys sister, Mala Majumdar, rushed to the Lake police station and informed Chakrabortys colleagues about his action. 																								A team of police officers accompanied her to the Chakraborty residence and rescued the elderly couple from confinement. Chakraborty, caught unawares by the rescue act, was home at that time and was arrested immediately. 																								We found the couple lying on the floor of the room. They were too weak to even get up and go out. We took them to a nearby health clinic, where they were put on saline. Doctors said their condition could have turned critical had they remained in captivity for another day, an officer of the Lake police station said.																								Pradip Sanyal, deputy commissioner of police (reserve force) suspended Chakraborty as soon as he was informed about the incident. A departmental inquiry has been initiated against the sub-inspector and the law will take its own course, he said.

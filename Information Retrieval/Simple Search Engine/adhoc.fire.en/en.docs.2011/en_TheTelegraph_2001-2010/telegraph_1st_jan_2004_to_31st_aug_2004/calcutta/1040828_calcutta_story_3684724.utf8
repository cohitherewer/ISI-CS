 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Wards for SC, women
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Of the 141 civic seats in the city, 52 have been reserved for women and Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates. Three wards (3, 9 and 25) have been reserved for women SC candidates. The state election commission will soon release the revised list of constituencies. 																								The Trinamul Congress is happy, as the wards of mayor Subrata Mukherjee, deputy mayor Meena Devi Purohit and the 10 members of the mayor-in-council have emerged unscathed. The party has started preparations for the 2005 elections to the civic body, projecting Mukherjee as mayor.																								A spokesman for the election commission said 8.47 per cent of the seats have been reserved for SC candidates.																								Councillors affected by the exercise include Salil Chatterjee, Provakar Mondal, Dilip Banerjee (all CPM); Smita Bakshi, Rajkishor Gupta and Subrata Halder (Trinamul); and Mahendra Pratap (BJP).																								At least 32 of the 47 wards reserved for women are now being represented by women.																								In preparing the list, the election commission has followed the 3-6-9 formula, instead of the 2-5-8 followed till the 2000 civic elections. 																								Every third ward, from 3 to 140, has been reserved for women. However, the gap is four in the case of five wards that have been reserved for SC candidates. 																								Similarly, an interval of five has been made between wards 23 and 28, since two wards in between (25 and 27) are reserved for SC candidates.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Five fail to write the exam
 A STAFF REPORTER																								They came with pens, but were not given papers.																								Five examinees of Sanatan Dharmiya Girls School could not appear for their Madhyamik this year because they did not have admit cards. They had to return home because of the negligence of the school authorities.																								The guardians, who waited till Friday morning for the admit cards to reach, ran out of patience and agitated in front of the school. Sensing trouble, teachers and the schools authorities fled.																								The guardians of the five examinees said each time they pointed out the non-arrival of the cards, the school authorities assured them everything would work out right.																								Even on Thursday, they told us the cards would reach on Friday. An hour before the examination, when we asked them again, they blamed the board, alleged Amrita Sau, one of the five.																								The police said 31 students of the school were sent up for Madhyamik, but only 26 received admit cards. Since the school is not a recognised one, the names were sent to the board through another school in Kankinara, said H.P. Singh, deputy commissioner (headquarters).																								Police started a probe on a complaint from the guardians. We came to know that each student was charged Rs 2,200 as examination fee, said an official of Cossipore police station.																								On Friday, from 9 am, the guardians and examinees assembled in front of the school. We asked them repeatedly about the cards. But they kept us in the dark, saying they were trying to contact the board. Around 10 am, they told us the cards had not reached because of the boards negligence, said examinee Sunita Patwari.																								Basanti Kumari, another student, feels the school has played dirty with her future. I dont believe there is any negligence on the part of the board. The school must have done something wrong, she cried.																								The police arrived to find the doors of the schools office and teachers room bolted and the school authorities absconding.																								West Bengal Board of Secondary Education president Dibyendu Hota said the five girls did not get admit cards because their applications had not been sent to the board by the school concerned. We did not receive their applications, Hota said.

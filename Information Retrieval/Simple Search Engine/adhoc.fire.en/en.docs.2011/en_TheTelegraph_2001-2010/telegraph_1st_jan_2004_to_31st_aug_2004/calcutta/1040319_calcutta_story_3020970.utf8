 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ritam Pal: Friends in the force. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Cops can walk the extra mile to help others. This is what 10-year-old Ritam Pal is going to tell his friends back in school.																								Ritam, the only son in a businessmans family, who had to spend four hours in a city police station after he went missing, learnt a lesson that almost contradicts popular wisdom  men in uniform are friends, not objects of fear.																								It was around 4 pm when Ritam, along with his mother, left his Shakespeare Sarani residence to attend his fitness classes on AJC Bose Road, as usual. But the day had unusual drama in store for the boy, who somehow got separated from his mother on the crowded thoroughfare.																								Ritam  perhaps searching for the road that would reach him home  started going round in circles. After over an hour, he finally landed up in Chatu Babu Lane, in the Entally police station area, a fair distance from home.																								But Ritam did not panic. When he spotted a policeman in uniform, he promptly went up to him and said: Ami hariye gechhi, amake bari pounchhe din (I am lost, please take me home).																								The policeman brought the boy to Entally police station. He was quite calm and answered all our queries quite smartly, said Shantanu Majumdar, designated juvenile welfare officer at the police station.																								For the four hours that Ritam was at the thana, Majumdar kept the boy company. He was given biscuits, sweets and snacks. He was talking to us freely. I asked him what he wanted to be after completing his studies. He promptly replied that he wanted to be a police officer, said A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge, Entally police station.																								I never thought I should not go to police. I thought the policemen were my only friends who could help me to return home, Ritam said.																								After collecting Ritams telephone number, Majumdar called up his residence. His mother answered the phone and the moment I asked her whether it was Ritams residence, she started crying. She repeatedly asked me what had happened to her son and if he was safe, said Majumdar. She calmed down only after I assured her that Ritam was sitting with me and having some snacks.																								Ritams parents, Naba Kumar Pal and Ruma, reached the police station around 9 pm.																								I thought someone must have kidnapped my son. I was waiting at home for a phone call. When the officer uttered Ritams name, I thought it must be the voice of one of the kidnappers, Ruma recalled. I must thank the police officers. The incident has also changed my opinion about policemen.																								Before leaving the thana, Ritam did not forget to thank his guardians.																								I will tell my friends about you. And they will also understand what policemen are really like, he told the officers before leaving Entally police station.

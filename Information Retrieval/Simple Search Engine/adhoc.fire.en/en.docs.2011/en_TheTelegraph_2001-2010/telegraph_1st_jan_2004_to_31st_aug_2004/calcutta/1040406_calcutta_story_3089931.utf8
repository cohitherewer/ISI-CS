 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Trucks skid to clog rush-hour VIP Road
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rush-hour traffic along VIP Road ground to a standstill on Monday morning after two trucks, loaded with stone chips and bricks, overturned after skidding on the rain-soaked Calcutta-bound flank. 																								The police said the trucks overturned between 6 am and 8 am on the muddy slush that spilled on to the roads from the rain-fed mounds of earth dredged from the Keshtopur canal and piled on the side of the road leading to the city.																								A truck, carrying stone chips, overturned near the Bangur Avenue and VIP Road crossing at around 6 am, while the second accident took place near Lake Town-Sribhumi at around 8.15 am. 																								The drivers of both vehicles were seriously injured and have been hospitalised.																								In the first accident, the truck, full of stone chips, was speeding away when it skidded and overturned near the Bangur Avenue crossing. The road was slippery due to the rain. Conditions were made worse by the muddy slush accumulated on the roadside due to dredging of Keshtopur canal, an official of Lake Town police station said. 																								The other truck, carrying bricks, overturned in a similar manner near Sribhumi. It broke the iron railing on the divider of the road, the official said. The trucks were pulled up with the help of cranes at around 10.30 am. 																								The twin accidents caused a severe traffic jam on the road. As the two vehicles covered almost the entire width of the road, other vehicles had to manoeuvre their way through a constricted passage. 																								Long queues of vehicles stretched out on the road towards the city, extending till Dum Dum Park. 																								The main congestion was created at the VIP Road-Lake Town crossing and Sribhumi, police officials said later.																								The Higher Secondary examinees were the worst affected. Many of them, in a bid to reach the examination centres on time, were seen walking hurriedly along the road with their guardians.																								I have to reach my examination centre at Salt Lake. I hope I will make it, said Sumana Roychowdhury, one of the examinees. The authorities should have taken quicker action, keeping in mind that examinations are on, said Sushanta Banerjee, the guardian of another student. 																								Many passengers who reached Calcutta airport in the morning also faced trouble making it to the city.																								Police pinned the delay in clearing the road on the cranes that had to be brought in through a route diversion.

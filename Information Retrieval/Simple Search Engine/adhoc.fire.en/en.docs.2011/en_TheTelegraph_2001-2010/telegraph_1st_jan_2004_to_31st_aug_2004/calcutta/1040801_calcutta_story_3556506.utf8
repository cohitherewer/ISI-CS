 Sunday, August 01, 2004 Conjecture c amp; b craze
AdLibRaising a toast to the cricket consumer, sceptics be damnedSHILOO CHATTOPADHYAYIndia had scored 271. Sri Lanka was chasing well. Half my mind was on the TV set, the other half was straining to hear what Dr Knowall was saying. We were having dinner in a restaurant.Dr I.M. Knowall, a professor of marketing, must have noticed my divided attention. You are interested in cricket? he asked. I knew this was a preface to a more profound discourse. He realised that I was keener to see whether Zaheer conceding 23 in an over had ended Indias chances.Dr Knowall is a true marketing man. He understands the needs of his target audience. So he combined cricket with marketing in his topic. He was an even better advertising man  he knew his competition was Gavaskar and Slater. So nothing short of a dramatic onslaught would drag my attention away. So he opened his new innings with a lofted drive over the cover boundary: The craze for cricket in India will halve in the next three years.I had to turn towards him to see whether he was serious. Here we were in a fancy restaurant watching cricket on a big screen. By then, the majority of diners were loudly cheering every dot ball. And here was someone who felt that all this would stop in the next few years. His argument was very simple. A sport derives its patronage from fierce parochialism. Parochialism in turn thrives on great rivalries. A we vs them feeling is the fodder for stoking the feeling of parochialism. A Manchester United supporter exists because there is his London counterpart who believes that Arsenal is the best football team on this planet.Dr Knowall was convinced that the real backbone for the cricket mania in this country was our rivalry with Pakistan. Every other match against every other country was at best a dress rehearsal. Last April has changed all that. India won the series in Pakistan but lost its USP. The Pakistani supporters openly appreciated a Sehwag six. An Inzamam square cut was visibly applauded in the drawing rooms of Mumbai. The sting had disappeared.All this has already taken its toll. Last Sunday, Pakistan beat us comprehensively. Yet, there were no protests, not a single player got blamed. Instead, Irfans new Toss ka Boss ad got appreciated. The future of Indian cricket, Dr Knowall said, was bleak, at least on the commercial front.By then I had stopped listening. We were in the 48th over. Jayasuriya caught and bowled Sehwag, 130. The eating-house had stopped its service. Then came the last ball. A boundary was all that Sri Lanka needed. Zaheer started his run-up. We stopped breathing. The ball dodged past the bat. The roar was deafening. I turned to see what Dr Knowall had to say. He was near the exit. Over the din, he shouted his parting comments: Thanks for the dinner. You see, we kept Pakistan out of the tournament.Being a social science, marketing is a discipline of hypotheses not theories that can be scientifically proved. Dr Knowalls would always try to pass off their conjectures, however analytical, as theories. Consumers, fortunately, will live happily ever after.Long live marketing  Amen.

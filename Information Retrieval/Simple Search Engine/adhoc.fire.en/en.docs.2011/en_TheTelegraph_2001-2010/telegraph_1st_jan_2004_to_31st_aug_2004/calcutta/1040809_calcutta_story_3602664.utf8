The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 09, 2004 on amp; offScreen on amp; off

	 The winsome threesome has set the cash registers ringing, after all. Teen Ekke Teen has mopped up huge revenues  more than its first launch and definitely more than the producers had expected  after its re-launch at Nandan in June. Barely six months after the first screening at INOX, Mohua and Aruna in January, Teen Ekke Teen was back on public demand. The tale of three gutsy girls  starring (from left) Sreelekha Mitra, Nelanjana Bhowmick and Koneenica Banerjee  ran for five full weeks at Nandan. And all five weekends have been house full. We have received a positive response from all age-groups, says Arjun Gourisaria of Black Magic, the films producers. Teen Ekke Teen could have held on for a week or two more but Nandan had prior bookings for an Uttam Kumar film festival, Gourisaria added. 
	The re-release success is really great because this is the kind of film I believe in and directors like Moloy Bhattacharya must get a thumbs up. My only regret is that the film would probably have fared better in the first release if we had the right chain of halls, feels Nelanjana. Sharon Stone: Action babe
	Calcutta cant just have enough of Sharon Stone. And why should it? The Casino star is just about everywhere, on the big screen as the Catwoman bad girl Laurel Hedare and now on the small screen as one of the Action Babes on HBO. But off screen too she is raising quite a storm as she gets ready to reprise her role of Catherine Trammell in the much-anticipated sequel to Basic Instinct.
	 The sexy star has already revealed that she is preparing to bare all for the follow-up film 10 years later  but without uncrossing her long legs  and feels that Basic Instinct 2 will be hotter than the original. In fact, the script will answer all those questions left untouched in the first part. Thats not all. Stone is also planning to direct a film, with the proposed script already underway. 
	While you have to wait for a while for BI2 (minus Michael Douglas) to take shape, you can feast on a younger, all-action, all-covered Stone next Monday, at home. Firing up the Action Babes series is The Quick And The Dead, where Stone is avenging Ellen training her guns on Oscar-winning veteran Gene Hackman, who plays Herod, the undisputed ruler of the lawless town of Redemption. Directed by Sam Raimi, the man behind Spider-Man 2, the film also boasts a marvellous cameo by Leonardo DiCaprio. Catch it on HBO on August 16 at 9 pm. The Action Babes HBO package kicks off on the night of August 9 with Uma Thurman in The Avengers.
	 Even before mascots Phevos and Athena match steps with the participants in the ceremonial march-past, Olympics 2004 will march into our homes, via the beam box. 
	STAR News will zoom in on the biggest sporting extravaganza in the world, in which about 10,000 athletes representing 202 countries, including 70-odd participants from India, will take part. The countdown will start on August 10, three days before the show starts rolling at Panathinion Stadium in Athens. 
	The half-hour special, christened Ek Champion Ho Apna, will feature an array of experts from every sporting discipline. A reporter is also flying to Athens to catch the action on and off the field. We will focus on Indias preparations and hopes, our past performances and also expose the facilities available to our athletes, says Keertan Adyanthaya of STAR News from Mumbai. 
	The show will be aired at 8.30 am, 7.30 pm and 11.30 pm daily. The morning show will look at the previous days events complete with the athletes reactions and the days schedule. The 7.30 pm special will provide viewers with the latest updates along with the developments in the late evening events. The late night special will present a complete wrap-up of the entire days action.
	 A special segment in the show, called Ye Mera India, will focus on the Indian contingents performance for the day. STAR News will also have additional segments like Olympics Breaking News, Olympics Trivia and Medals Tally which will go on air at regular intervals through the day. While our sportspeople will be targeting medals, viewers will stay in the hunt for prizes that the channel promises for hitting the bulls eye in an Olympic-related contest.  Amitabh Bachchan: Telly top
	Its happening faster than you can utter the full title of flop films these days (case in point: Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon). The transition time from the big to the small screen has now come down to as little as two months. The latest to shrink with the TV time gap is the Big B, no less. 
	Milan Luthrias film Deewaar: Lets Bring Our Heroes Home, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Kay Kay, Amrita Rao and a whole host of others may have run into a box-office wall, in India and overseas, but it should be Zees trump card this Independence Day.
	 As rivals roll out the usual fare of Borders and Refugees, Zee has acquired the television rights for Deewaar. Given the hour  I-Day  and the man  Amitabh  Zee is pinning huge hopes on this one, having earlier rewritten a few TRP records with the television premiere of the box-office washout Main Madhuri DixitThe prisoners of the war film, which released in June, was made on a Rs 25-crore budget, but barely managed to garner half its production costs at the turnstiles, goes the trade buzz. If Deewaar now achieves high viewership on the telly, it could well spark a trend of big screen pain being small screen gain.
	 And a message to Bachchan the quiz master: your jackpot, sir, could have shifted base from the hall to the home. Lock and stock?

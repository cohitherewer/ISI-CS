The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Palta twin on Bypass
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Theres good news on the waterfront. If all goes well, several areas of Calcutta, especially its eastern fringes, could look forward to an unending supply of filtered surface water.																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government and the civic authorities met on Thursday and discussed the setting up of a large, full-fledged water treatment plant off the Bypass.																								After a meeting with Asim Barman, secretary, public health engineering (PHE), mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the first off-river waterworks for the city would be put up at an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore.																								The third waterworks, after Palta and Garden Reach, will be a joint venture. Once it becomes operational, our dependence on the depleting groundwater reserves will become a thing of the past, mayor Mukherjee told Metro.																								The proposed waterworks will be built opposite the ITC Sonar Bangla hotel, about 12 km from the Hooghly. The river is the only source of surface water for the treatment plants in the 1,425 sq km of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA).																								The highlights of the project are:  Estimated cost: Rs 150 crore Location: Opposite ITC Sonar Bangla hotel, off the Bypass Lifting station: CMCs Mullickghat pumping station, in the Burrabazar area Funding: HIDCO Nodal agency: PHE Collaborator: CMC Sharing of filtered water between the PHE and the CMC: 50:50 Gestation period: 18 months from the date of flagging off the construction work.																								PHE minister Gautam Deb made it clear that this would be a cost-effective and feasible manner of ensuring uninterrupted supply of filtered surface water to the New Calcutta Township at Rajarhat.																								The CMCs contribution will be the land at Dhapa and a regular supply of 100 million gallons of unfiltered water daily to the proposed treatment plant from its Mullickghat pumping station near Burrabazar.																								The proposed East Calcutta waterworks will boost the citys supply from the existing 264 million gallons by at least 60 million gallons a day.																								The 150-year-old Palta waterworks alone supplies 200 million gallons. 																								The immediate areas to benefit will be Salt Lake, Rajarhat, Lake Town and other growth centres along the Bypass.																								By 2021, the Rajarhat New Township area is projected to require about 33 million gallons of potable water a day. The immediate requirement for the township is estimated at 12 million gallons daily.

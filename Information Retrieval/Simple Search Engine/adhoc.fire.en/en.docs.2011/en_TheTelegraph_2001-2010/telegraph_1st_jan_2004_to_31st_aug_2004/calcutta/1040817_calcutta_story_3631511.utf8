																								Promoting social consciousness in an entertaining way has been the mission of Natasena ever since its inception. In consonance with this principle, the group presents Dhar Mundur Kissa, a fantastic satire, stylised in the form of an opera. In the play, an important topical issue has been dealt with in a way as to satirically convey the hollow sham that exists in our society in the name of justice and morality. Based on Leo Tolstoys Too Dear, it humorously depicts the handling of a grave crisis in the kingdom of Sriharshanagari. The king has ordered the decapitation of Bhandul, who has been charged with murder. However, there is no competent person in the land to carry out the kings orders, and it is becoming increasingly expensive for the state to bear for the upkeep of the convict in prison. Various ways and means of disposing with Bhandul are sought to be devised by the king and his band of wise courtiers, but in vain. Finally, the prisoner himself volunteers to help them out of the crisis, providing a solution that makes an absolute mockery of the laws of the land.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Dhar Mundur Kissa, produced by Natasena																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Self bullet blows off constable head
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Constable Shahjahan Gazi arrived at Burtola on a routine raid around 3 pm on Wednesday. By 3.20 pm, the 50-year-old, attached to the airport police station, lay dead in front of Burtola police station, with a bullet from his service rifle having pierced his chin and passed through his head.																								Police later said Gazi had committed suicide by putting his chin on the nozzle of the rifle and pulling the trigger.																								There was initially some confusion, admitted Barun Mallik, deputy commissioner of police (north), over whether the rifle had misfired.																								But after examining the rifle thoroughly and speaking to Gazis colleagues who witnessed the incident, we concluded that it was case of suicide. Now we are trying to find out what led him to kill himself, added Mallik.																								On Wednesday afternoon, a posse of policemen from airport police station arrived at Burtola thana, led by additional officer-in-charge Ranjit Kumar Sarkar. The team was to conduct a raid in connection with a firearm recovery from a north Calcutta college campus a few weeks ago.																								Sarkar stepped into Burtola police station to work out the formalities, while the rest of his men waited outside.																								According to constable Paresh Ghosh, Gazi stood silently some distance away from the rest, with his rifle butt on the ground and the nozzle in his grip, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department).																								When a shot rang out, Sarkar rushed out of the police station, along with some local officers.																								Gazi was lying on the pavement with his head partially blown off. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead, said Mallik.																								Ghosh later said: Gazi was silent and stood alone in another corner of the footpath, away from the rest of us, but we never imagined he would commit suicide.																								According to police, Gazi, a resident of Hasnabad, in North 24-Parganas, had joined the police station two years ago. There was nothing wrong in his behaviour. His suicide is a mystery, said an officer of airport police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 One for the road
 VJs Cyrus and Anusha get into the groove at the MTV Roadies bash at Tantra; (below) Actress Rimii and singer Mika at the same do																								 This one was for the road, and quite literally so. The second edition of MTV Roadies, the reality adventure show where seven young go-getters will undertake an arduous journey from Calcutta to the Wagah border, was flagged off from the city on Saturday morning. And what better way to kick-off the expedition than to treat the young guns to a party to remember?																								Friday night at Tantra had all the trappings of a mega bash  VJs Cyrus Sahukar, Anusha and Rannvijay playing the perfect hosts, actress Rimii Sen added a dash of the glam factor and swinging Sardar Mika ruled the sound waves.																								Somehow, the combination failed to strike the right chord with Calcuttas party people who were busy grooving by themselves, almost oblivious to the MTV mania. Clearly, the MTV gang couldnt cast the same spell on them that DJ Aqeel had done a couple of weeks ago.																								Anushas requests for joining the Roadies in their moment of success and catcalls for not doing so were not enough to get the Tantra gang going. So, even as she shouted Calcutta seems to have forgotten how to party. Why do I have a group of boring people standing in front of me? the night troopers had their dose of fun on their own terms. 																								The crowd finally joined in only after Mika took the floor, belting out his hit numbers Dunalli and Nachle. The revellers lapped up the music, matching steps till the morning. 																								But all that hardly mattered to the Roadies who were on their trip. Oblivious to the fact that they were to live the toughest 35 days of their life from the next morning, the three girls and four guys danced the first half of the night away. We want to enjoy the present moments to the fullest because none of us know whats in store tomorrow, was the spirit. They, however, were under the strict vigilance of their seniors and were whisked away before midnight so that they could catch some sleep before D-Day.																								Crib point from the Tantra crowd: Rimii Sens blink-and-you-miss-her appearance, even briefer than her white top that is sure to create a Dhoom when the film releases on Friday.All that jazz Louiz Banks in performance at the Someplace Else birthday celebrations.																								 He might be boasting titles like godfather of jazz and jingle king and the record for playing a whopping 7,000 tunes over the past decade, but Damber Bahadur Budhapriti, better known as Louiz Banks, always finds the time to return to his favourite nightclub  Someplace Else. 																								The ace jazz pianist has played all over the globe, alongside jazz greats like Yolande Bavan and Charlie Byrd, but his first love remains performing in Calcutta, the city where he nurtured aspirations of making it big in the world of melody. And so, here he was lending his presence to the 10th anniversary celebrations of SPE on Friday night.																								And a true-blue Banks performance it was, with hardcore jazz lovers jamming the pub and the dance floor. The prolific keyboard player held everybody in a trance as he took to the synthesiser and belted out some original compositions like Hard to forgive, Earthwind, Rush hour and Disreal, apart from his usual hits. With him were friends and co-performers from last years SPE birthday bash city band Skinny Alley who set the stage on fire as they have been doing for so long.ZEESHAN JAWEDBlast with billiards amp; babes 				 	 Model Shrestha with Michael Ferriera																								All play and no partying can also make Jack a dull boy. Thats why on Wednesday evening, after a whole week of fighting it out on the snooker and billiard tables, young players, all hopefuls for The Asian Billiards Championship 2004 in India amp; IBSF World Snooker Championship 2004 in the Netherlands, hit the dance floor at a private do. 
	Hosted by Anil Bhutoria at his plush Salt Lake hotel, Stadel, the fun session saw former Asian and world champions, besides the new crop of players, taking to the festivities of the evening. 
	Billiard biggie Michael Ferriera and other members of IBSF, among them Ashok Shandilya, Subhash Agarwal, Devendra Joshi, Dhruv Shitwala, Pankaj Advani, Alok Kumar, Yasin Merchant, Manan Chandra, Rafath Habib, B. V. S. Murthy, B. Bhaskar and coach Manoj Kothari being the heavy-weights having a blast.
	The tough trial rounds had obviously left the players wanting to unwind. Also, the announcement of the final list of names to represent the country at the international platforms threw up a reason for celebration. The end-result was that Heka, the Egyptian bar at Stadel, boomed till midnight. 
	A three-ft long cake, an impression of a billiards board complete with the cues and colourful balls, added to the sporting feel of the event. In fact, the rather painstakingly crafted cake by executive chef Narayan Chatterjee was the centre of attention among the former and fledgling champions, until, of course, models Sanjukta, Amrita and Srestha dropped by to add the babe factor to the billiards bash. 
	Prizes for the winners of the trial runs and an impressive introduction by big man Ferriera later, it was time to hit the dance floor. The worries of a championship to be won could wait.HIMIKA CHAUDHURI Party PooperStop that, we say to all those celebrities passing through Calcutta and professing their love for mishti doi and the warmth of the people here (even if theyve just spent their first hour in town). But this MTV VJ went one step further and tried to shout her love for the city out loud in a crowded disco on Friday night in Bengali. Far from being impressed, the party people hooted her out because of her Halo Kolkhata, kemun ahchhen... We were fine till you turned up with your tongue twisters, baby! Pictures by Rashbehari Das

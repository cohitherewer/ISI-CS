 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 Patchwork play in east-west combine Models Sreshtha and Joy in Gauri Bajoria creationsShe may be all of 23 years of age, but Gauri Bajoria has already carved a niche for herself in Calcuttas couture culture. After working on western outfits for over a year, this London School of Fashion graduate has now launched an Indian line, A Patchwork of Expression. I have been working with one particular style for a while now and I felt I needed to broaden my horizon and try something new, said Gauri, showcasing her collection in the plush Red Kitchen and Lounge in Alipore. The collection, mostly in cotton, stretch cotton and raw silk has typical Indian embellishments but essentially western silhouettes. I didnt want my clothes to look like out-and-out traditional Indian outfits either, added Gauri. She has used a lot of block prints, wooden beads, and antique-looking metal pieces to style her clothes. But the common chord between all her ensembles still remains the patchwork she uses to style her clothes. I have been using plain fabrics and giving them smart cuts, but this time I decided to work with textures instead. Layers of raw silk patches stylise the outfits in this collection, explained Gauri. Short kurtis with a patchwork front, and lehnga-choli sets with a long patchwork coat doing double duty in the absence of a dupatta are some of the pop picks at her Alipore studio. Fragrance fair Piu Sarkar and Indrani Sen indulge in fragrant fun at LandmarkIf you thought Landmark was already stuffed to the brim, check out their perfume section launched on Sunday for a whiff of fresh air. The same cant be said about the citys celebrity count though with singer Indrani Sen and actress Piu Sarkar dropping by to do the ribbon repeat. The copy book quotes were well in place too. I am delighted to be here on this occasion. Though I am not a perfume aficionado, I like any sweet fragrance, gushed Indrani. Good fragrance is inspirational. It helps enhance creativity. I am an avid perfume lover and I am pleased to see the rare collection of perfumes here, Piu was quick to second as well.ey, One Man Show, Adidas, Calvin Klein, Christian Dior are some of the brands the store boasts of at the moment.Crab crawl A crab catch from KenilworthMonsoons and ilish go hand in hand. Add some yummy prawns and this is not a meal you are going to forget in a hurry. Sanjha Chulha, the garden restaurant at The Kenilworth, is celebrating the arrival of the monsoons by hosting a food festival with a fishy flavour. One can start off with tuna salad, crisp shrimp, fish with tamarind and curd or opt for some soup slurps with Tom Yom Koong, Prawn Bisque, Crab Consomme and more. Move on to Char Grilled Tiger Prawn With Lemon Garlic Twist, Crumb Fried Topse, Lasooni Pomfret, Shrimp Ball Manchurian before digging into the main course of Masala Grilled Sole, Lobster Thermidor, Fish Florentine and the inimitable Smoked Hilsa. If that seems like a long list, go by chef Niraj Sinhas favourites. I have devised all the recipes with great care but I rate Lasooni Pomfret and Mahi Amritsari (Bekti with a Punjabi flavour achieved by the use of ajwain, gram flour and red chilli powder) as the most lip-smacking of them all. Tom Yom Koong soup and Jerk Sea Food Salad (spicy Chinese salad) are personal favourites as well, said Sinha.Sip n puffIts time to go sip, sip, sip at the Polo Club at HHI, the venue for a cigar and Cognac promotion with goodies especially brought in from France. If you are not a Cognac connoisseur, you ought to know the highly fermented drink is a mature version of brandy. The promotion is especially attractive in terms of prices. Rs 600 for a 60 ml peg is the lure here apart from some authentic Cognac, usually not available at city bars. Theres some puff pleasure on offer as well. Premium cigars like Panter Blue, Panter Dessert (with coffee flavour), Balmoral Corona and Balmoral Panatela (combining a woody aroma with a taste of coffee) are available at a discounted price of Rs 400 for a pack of five. But to combine the best of two worlds, try cigars laced with Cognac. Dance drama Mallika Sarabhai strikes a pose at a P.C. Chandra store. What happens when a danseuse, actress and activist like Mallika Sarabhai decides to do a modelling act for the benefit of shutterbugs? Mayhem magnified to get the best of her emotive eyes and magic mudras. The danseuse is in town to perform at Swabhumi on Tuesday, in collaboration with British-Pakistani writer Samia Malik, who shares a common interest with her in the area of human rights. lika dropped by to check out some gilded glare at the P.C. Chandra outlet at Ultadanga on Monday evening to shake off those jitters. I am not a fancy jewellery freak at all, she said while trying out a chunky neckpiece to dazzling effect. I would rather run after a country woman to get her to lend me her rustic jewels, laughed Mallika. She suddenly remembered to get the I love Calcutta bit right. The intellectual wealth of the city fascinates me, Mallika smiled. She went to reveal more about her Calcutta connection. She is an avid Rabindrasangeet fan, for one. The culture is rooted in me as my mother was a student of Rabindarnath Tagore and considered him her ultimate guru, smiled Mallika. Himika Chaudhuri, Zeeshan Jawed

Saadat Hasan Manto is of the league of great writers who receive their accolades in death. Art has seen the birth of many an artist who created his art with as much love as his more famous peers, but left its appreciation to posterity. Recognition came particularly late to Manto. It was after 20 long years, posthumously, that Mantos short stories started out on a journey of translation and dramatisation in several Indian languages. Rangakarmee proposes to offer viewers a comprehensive view of the rich humanist creativity that Manto represented, in the form of three collages. The first collage has for its subject matter two stories  Kali Shalwar and Hatak  that are realistic portrayals of life in the lower rungs of society where humanity resurfaces through the strangest expressions. The second collage centres around Mantos stories of the Partition. These are accounts of a man at pains to come to terms with his psychological exile born out of the physical partition of India. The third and final collage focuses on Manto the man and writer. It is only befitting that a tribute to the writer be named after him  Badnam Manto.																								Event: Play in Hindi, Badnam Manto																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

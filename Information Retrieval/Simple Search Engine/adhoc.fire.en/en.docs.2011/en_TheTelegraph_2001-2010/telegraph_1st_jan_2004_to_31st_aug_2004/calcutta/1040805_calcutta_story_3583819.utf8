 Thursday, August 05, 2004 Bengali buffet bash breeds Continental craze 
 Nondon Bagchi makes a point to the chef at 6 Ballygunge PlaceMore from the cradle of old Calcutta, with Continental overtones, has crept into the menu at 6, Ballygunge Place. The restaurant, less than a year old, specialises in Calcutta cuisine, and has been serving a balanced mix of Bengali cooking and a kind of Continental food that has evolved in the city, during British rule and through the years that have followed.																								The mainly Bengali clientele at the south Calcutta restaurant, safely ensconced in a residential neighbourhood, has been leaning significantly towards the western food on offer. So, when a new menu was being planned, that was the area of emphasis.																								On Wednesday, some of the new dishes were rolled out for a tasting with foodie-musician Nondon Bagchi. Nondon seemed happy with what he had sampled. This is good, full-bodied cooking without being overpowered with ghee and masala, he said.																								Some exploration has gone into the new selection, the most notable of which is the bread made from rice flour, in the similar manner as the usual wheat flour variety. This bread can be found in the districts of Bengal, explains CEO Subhankar Dhar. It went well with the Lal Murgi (fowl in spicy red gravy) it was served with.While straightforward Continental favourites like Chicken Roast have been added, other dishes fuse western and ethnic styles. Like the newly-inducted Chitol Peti Roast and Rui Maachher Roast.Raj ricochet Popular dishes from Oh! CalcuttaThere was more of the British-Bengali cuisine theme at Oh! Calcutta. The restaurant at Forum is revisiting the days of the Raj, dishing out recipes that were a hit with British sahibs as well as those that were cooked in the kitchens of Bengali babus in the pre-Independence era.																								This British Raj festival is a prelude to the Independence Day British buffet that the restaurant is planning. The new menu, which will run till August 14, has some nostalgic dishes lined up. Try the Railway Mutton Curry (served in the BNR Railway coaches in the 1930s), or the Dak Bungalow Chicken, a dish that used to be cooked in rest houses for British officers on tour. To cater to Continental tastes, dishes like Chicken Stroganoff or Chicken Tetrazini have also been included. 																								Try the Baluchi Macchi Kebab for starters and the Devilled Shrimp. For the main course, the options range from the Pathan Chicken Pilaf, a recipe that was almost lost to the present-day foodie and has been revived by chef Abraham D. Cruz for the festival.Round off the colonial treat with the Khansamas Lemon Pudding. Wine and dine Madame Daniele Raulet Reynaud at the wine tasting session at ITC Sonar BanglaThe five wine regions of France were the topic of discussion at an extended wine tasting session at Dumpukht, the Indian speciality restaurant at ITC Sonar Bangla on Wednesday.																								Madame Daniele Raulet Reynaud, a specialist in European cheese and French wine, spoke about the history of various wines and how each wine scores differently over the other. She also shed some light on the kinds of food that should be served with various kinds of wine. 																								Less spicy, slightly sweet food was recommended with red wine, spicy chicken or fish and salty food is what goes well with white, suggested Daniele.																								The idea is to marry Indian food with French wine, said Ranvir Bhandari, general manager of the hotel. As the session rolled on, kabiraji cutlet was served with Champagne, while Murg Rezala found a mate in Chablis.																								The spicy chicken should go very well with the smooth Champagne, added Daniele, explaining that the concept of serving only fish with white wine and meat with red wine is now almost defunct.																								The session was the first of its kind to be hosted by ITC and organised by the French embassy in the city. Plans are on for more lifestyle talks. A select group of guests will also be invited to sample the harmony of French wine and Indian food. Madhumita Bhattacharyya, Himika Chaudhuri

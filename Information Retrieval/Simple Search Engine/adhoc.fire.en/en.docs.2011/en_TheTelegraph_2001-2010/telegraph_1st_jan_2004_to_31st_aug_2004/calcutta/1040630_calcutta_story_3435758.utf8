The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Few holes in the safety net
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Are women in Calcutta less safe than in other cities? More letters will be published next week Tease target: A woman and aloneDiptimoy Ghosh,
																		Salt Lake City 																																																														Although our policy-makers and leaders make lofty claims about womens safety in Calcutta, media reports indicate otherwise. Women themselves are the best judges. The earlier the administration takes off its rose-tinted glasses, the better. 									

Reuben Aron,
																		Wellesley Square																																																														In spite of stray incidents of eve-teasing, molestation, rape or harassment, Calcutta is still a safer place for women, thanks mainly to the helpful local residents. The authorities would still do well to introduce regular patrolling near markets, cinema halls, schools and colleges. Traps should be laid near schools and colleges to catch eve-teasers and women should be trained to defend themselves.									

Bhupen Bose,
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														Other cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore, with the exception of Delhi, are safer for women than Calcutta is. A large number of ruffians, snatchers, thieves, robbers, extortionists, drug addicts and pickpockets are running amuck in Calcutta, thus ruining the earlier sense of security among people here. Hoodlums haunt the neighbourhoods of girls schools. And because of them, women are forced to stay away from various parks and public gardens. The administration needs to take action against these goons. 									

Vinay Poddar,
																		Howrah 																																																														Safety of women in Calcutta is a two-way affair. During the day, women are definitely safer here, than in other major cities of India. But as the sun goes down, so does the protective cover, because women in Bangalore and Mumbai can venture alone on the streets with relatively more ease than their Calcuttan counterparts. 									

Madhabi D. Ghosh,
																		Salt Lake City 																																																														Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees tall claim that our city is an oasis of peace seems to be totally out of sync with the reality. A few days ago, Purnima Advani, chairperson, National Womens Commission vented her grievances on this issue. I feel threats to the security of women are increased by the present westernised trends of dressing, the current crop of Hindi movies, and sometimes even the body language of women themselves. 									

Dishari Gupta,
																		Kalyani																																																														Women are definitely safer in Calcutta than in other cities. However, in many cases, girls are responsible for the trouble they find themselves in. If they wear skimpy clothes and indulge in wild ways, they can be blamed for inciting men. But Calcutta is still a haven because women here are more orthodox and less flamboyant in their lifestyle. 									

Sananda Sen, 
																		New Alipore																																																														Perpetrators of crime against women have the fear of the law in Calcutta. This fear of never-ending trials and subsequent punishment go a long way in curbing their actions. In other cities, offenders belong to the moneyed-class and more often than not, have strong political connections. This nexus with those in power shelters them even after they commit the most heinous of crimes. 									

Rajarshi Ghosh,
																		Surya Nagar 																																																														Women are not safe anywhere in India. But compared to other cities, I think women are safer in Calcutta, though the recent report of the womens commission says otherwise. We must remember that many cases of crime against women go unreported. However, in Calcutta, women can travel safely late into the night. Even if they face problems sometimes, the frequency is less than in other cities.									

Indranil Sanyal,
																		DhakuriaNo, women in Calcutta are not safe any more. Yet, compared to other metros, they find it comfortable to travel alone. In spite of many reported cases, the scenario is better in our city. However, that should be no reason for complacency. Santosh Chakroborty, 
Unique ParkBy and large, women in Calcutta are safer than in other cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Bantala and similar incidents of violence were merely stray incidents. If women do not take too much to wild lifestyles, they have nothing to worry about in our city. Apart from the socio-cultural milieu, a womans discretion has an important part to play in ensuring her safety. Tanmoy Das Lala,
																		Salt Lake																																																														Calcutta is safer than other metropolitan cities in India. But the citys safety cover is gradually slipping. Girls here should start carrying weapons for self-defence. This should be made compulsory in our city.Sandhya Banerjee,
Salt LakeWith Calcutta becoming more cosmopolitan, the differences in financial conditions of citizens are becoming starker. Youngsters are becoming brash and our city is less safe in all respects. Womens safety in Calcutta is no more than in other cities. 									

Suchismita Chakraborty, 
																		Jadavpur																																																														In Calcutta, more respect is given to women than in any other city. Moreover, women here are more concerned about their security.P. Pramanik,
Santoshpur AvenueA comparison with other cities is meaningless. If one is unsafe, it is no consolation if the situation is worse elsewhere. 									

Sounak Chakraborty, 
																		Baranagar																																																														Incidents of eve-teasing, rape, murder and torture of women are increasing in Calcutta of late. If such activities increase further, the earlier reputation of our city will be destroyed and it will become comparable with other cities notorious for crimes against women.

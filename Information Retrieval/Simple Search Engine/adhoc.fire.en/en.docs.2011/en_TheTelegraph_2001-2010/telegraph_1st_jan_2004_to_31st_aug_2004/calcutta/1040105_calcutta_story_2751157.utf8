 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Moni Bhaumik with some of the recipients of his educational foundations awards. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Most of their fathers are farmers, and the young boys have to help out in the fields. Some, until recently, had no electricity in their homes, in far-flung districts of West Bengal. They had only a determination to succeed, spurred on by parents, relatives and teachers who believed in them. All 16 youngsters, including a girl, have one thing in common  a dream and the ambition to make it a reality, overcoming many odds.																								It was the third instalment of the Moni Bhaumik Educational Foundation Award Ceremony on Sunday, bringing the total number of recipients to 45. The scholarship covers the entire cost of education for the students who have refused to accept poverty as an obstacle to their quest for excellence. 																								Like Sudipta Kumar Bera, from Purba Midnapore. He has to help out his father on the fields, but it was his mother who was his inspiration. He lost her to snakebite some years ago, but her memory was enough to push him close to 90 per cent in the Higher Secondary (HS) exams. Now, the young man is a student of physics in Presidency College. I dont know much English and fitting in with everyone is quite difficult, but I am happy that I have achieved this, and I want to do more, Sudipta asserts.																								Each youngster has a similar story of struggle to tell, but with smiles on their faces. Just the fact that they have come this far is testament to their tenacity. Avijit Debnath, from Burdwan, secured 920 in HS, and got a berth at NRS Medical College, after passing the Joint Entrance Examination with flying colours. He wanted to be a doctor, since there isnt one in his village, but wasnt sure he could make it because his father is a farmer.																								Prospective engineers (mechanical, civil, electronics or electrical), doctors, scientists and researchers in chemistry and physics, from prestigious institutions like Jadavpur University, Calcutta University, Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur, Ramakrishna Mission, Visva-Bharati, in Santiniketan, and top medical colleges in town  each one has had a core group of people backing them.																								More often than not, they were mothers and teachers. While mothers made sure they went to school, the teachers were always there for them. Bijan Basak from Nadia thanks his teachers and mother for their untiring efforts to help him achieve 928 in his HS and gain admission to Medical College.																								To close the English gap, the Moni Bhaumik foundation, in association with Scottish Church College, will hold free classes in the language from February 1. Also in the works is a free library, a reading room, an auditorium and a computer centre.

Now that job opportunities in the government sector are becoming progressively scarce, students look for courses that will prepare them for a suitable job in the private sector, or will allow them to be self-employed. A number of institutes that offer degree and diploma courses say they have received a larger number of applications in many of their new job-oriented courses. 																								With job opportunities in government offices decreasing, we need to study vocational courses, instead of opting for the conventional ones, as these will arm us to face the competition in seeking jobs in the private and service sectors, said Subhendu Das, an aspirant at George Telegraph. 																								The institutes say an interesting trend this year is that a bulk of the applicants constitutes high scorers in the HS and equivalent exams. 																								We had to adopt a very stringent screening procedure for the applications this time, not just because there are more applicants. The number of high scorers, too, has soared, said Manoj Joshi, a George Telegraph official.																								Government officers say a quick study had found that more job opportunities were emerging in the service sector. So, the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) was asked to introduce a bouquet of new courses.																								We introduced a number of new professional courses for HS pass-outs this year. The response has been extremely good, Samir Bandyopadhyay, WBUT registrar, said. 																								Biplab Chakraborty, an official of the Zed Academy group, said the institute had received four to five applications per seat for their three-year degree course on Internet services and software systems till last year. 																								The number of applications per seat has shot up to nine this time for this course, introduced four years ago.																								Officials of the Indian Council for School Certificate Examinations said there was a greater demand for seats in two of their new courses in sales and marketing and hospitality management. 																								At Netaji Subhas Open University, there are more aspirants in the short-term certificate courses this year for subjects like aqua culture, automobile repairing and electrical repairing.

 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Where medium is the muse
Vichitras first exhibition in mixed media promises to offer art lovers and connoisseurs an entirely new perspective on the way they have always perceived art. Highly experimental and innovative in both choice of themes and their presentation, this exhibition, besides being the first exhibition on video art in the city, explores and challenges the restrictions of a work of art within its parent frame, border or canvas. Discarding the traditional differences between the central focus of an image and its periphery, frames form a recurring motif in the works on show, where the boundaries imposed by the frames are constantly re-worked and re-imagined. An exceptional feature of this exhibition is that it forges a natural bond between painting and photography, blurring their identity as two distinct and different media. Extending beyond the realm of still visuals to that of moving images, Vichitras novel experiments with film in this exhibition succeeds in forming an alliance with painting and photography.

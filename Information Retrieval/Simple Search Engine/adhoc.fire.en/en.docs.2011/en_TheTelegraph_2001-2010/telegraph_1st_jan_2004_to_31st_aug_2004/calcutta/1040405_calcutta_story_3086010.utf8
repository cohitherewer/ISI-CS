The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, April 05, 2004 Life - Music ZoneBulking up for filmi fight 
 Yudi at The Park hotel on Sunday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 The man formerly known as Yudi is going back to his real name, Yudhishtir. But that is not all he is leaving behind. The Channel [V] VJ is handing over the mike and is putting on his boxing gloves to jump into the Bollywood ring.																								After starting out on stage, Yudi  whose last name (Urs) will still be left out of the credits  took the small-screen route to fame before making his film debut with Chakravyuh.																								 And he seems to be taking on the new challenge punch for punch. His character, Karan, is a boxer, and the Mumbai-based boy from Bangalore has been doing some serious bulking up and training for the past few months to get into shape before shooting starts on April 15. Its about boxing and betting, explains Yudi, in the city this weekend.																								Ad film-maker Kitu Ghosh is directing the mainstream movie with the right sensibility. Music by Bengali composer duo Bapi-Tutu is already in the bag. They cracked the sound, and I have heard a lot of music, he enthuses.His passion for the film was a loss for city film-maker Bappaditya Ghosh, making Devaki, starring Perizaad Zorabian. I saw the script, and it was really good, but I wanted to concentrate on this film first, explains the budding actor, who turned down another Bollywood project as well, and hopes to concentrate on one film at a time. Muted melody 																								 The first flush of passion has ebbed and the muted shades are unfolding. The chocolate-boy romantic trudging down a meandering road crooning Tanha dil, tanha safar has mellowed with the seasons.																								Touching down in Calcutta for the last leg of a whirlwind eight-city promotional tour across the country, Shaan is elated, but restrained, about the response his third private album Aksar has generated among the crowds.																								Calcutta was the obvious choice to wrap up our tour, just as every big tournament ends in Eden Gardens, smiles the man who picked up the bat for a friendly cricket match on Sunday morning at the Eastern Command Stadium.																								Though riding high on foot-tapping tracks  Its the time to disco and Bindaas  Shaan would still love to compose and sing songs that are soothing and soulful. The tracks in Aksar are set on a low-scale on my mothers request. She says she is tired of listening to high-pitched music, he adds. A lot of songs have been penned on falling in love, but what happens later when you feel stuck in the relationship? The lyrics in this album dwell on this stage of life. Infusing hip-hop, groove and Arabic tunes, Aksar is a collaborative project with pop band Blue, Mel C and Moroccan singer Samira Said.																								Its difficult for private albums to get the sort of mileage films do with TV promos. So, the best way of reaching out to the masses is holding concerts, says the singer who lends his voice to ad jingles, TV serial theme songs and big-screen heroes, besides making a mark as a popular TV anchor.																								The Bengali lad, who started his melody trip with elder sister Sagarika and hit bullseye with Tanha Dil, seems firmly set on his way to success. Most filmi promos on TV, including Hum Tum and Shaadi Ka Laddoo, have a couple of tracks by Shaan.Next up is his first Bengali album with sister Sagarika featuring their fathers compositions. Targeting a Puja release, recording for the album is slated for June-July.Her song																								 There was standing room only at the Tollygunge Club, as the crowds turned up to pay tribute to The Ladies of Calcutta. The women took the lead for the evening anchored by Usha Uthup. Others  singers or not  joined in with a few notes on stage. Lee Alison Sibley, Tanushree Shankar, June Maliah, Indrani Sen, Piu Sarkar, Mona and Pali, Priti Patel and Shamlu Dudeja were amongst those keeping the audience in foot-tapping mood.																								The high points were two songs, Ladies of Calcutta and a study in male bashing declaring that woman is smarter than the man in every way. Rabindrasangeet and Bengali film songs set the tone for the first part of the performance. Usha did her bit to up the tempo with I will survive. She was joined on stage for a duet by Lee which, they proclaimed, both had waited years to do, with the other celebrities joining in for group songs.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA AND RESHMI SENGUPTA

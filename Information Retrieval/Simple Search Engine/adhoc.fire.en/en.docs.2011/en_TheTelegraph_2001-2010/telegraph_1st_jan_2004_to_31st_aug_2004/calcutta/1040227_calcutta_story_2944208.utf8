	There seems to be a racket involved in managing car parking zones near prominent cinema halls and shopping malls. The so-called volunteers do not wear any badges, but collect parking fees even late at night. The parking tickets also do not bear the stamp of the issuing authority. There is no option but to follow what they say. If a car-owner demands to know their identity, the men abuse and threaten him with dire consequences. The matter should be dealt with firmly.

	Trenches, four feet in depth, have been dug up on a portion of the pavement along APC Roy Road at Maniktala. This is part of the road-widening and tram track-relaying work. Visitors to Leprosy Mission Hospital find it very difficult to negotiate the stretch. There is also the danger of pedestrians, especially schoolchildren, tripping into the pits after dark. Will the authorities concerned please fence off the area under construction? 
	 Maitreyee Dawn, Maniktala.

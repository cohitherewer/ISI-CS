The Film 
	(INOX 12.15 pm, 9.50 pm amp; Globe 4 shows) The most successful  and slammed  film of recent times is a graphic depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The epic scale of the Mel Gibson production, the technology and the torture and Jim Caviezel as Christ make it a must watch  but not for the squeamish. The Show 				 																																	(ITC Sonar Bangla, Monday, 6.30 pm) The city plays host to the mega NIFT fashion nite, showcasing the best design collections in fashion and knitwear from the graduating batches in seven centres across the country. Special awards for the best among the best  something that Sabyasachi Mukherjee had bagged not so long ago  lend a competitive edge to the fun and festivities. The Book				 																																	(Dinesh Raheja, Jitendra Kothari) From Raja Harishchandra to Koi Mil Gaya, the giant book takes readers on a chronological odyssey mirroring the incredible story of Hindi films. From the silent era to the glitzkrieg of post-millennial mega ventures, from Sita Devi to Ash, from Jairaj to Shah Rukh, the tome skims through it all.

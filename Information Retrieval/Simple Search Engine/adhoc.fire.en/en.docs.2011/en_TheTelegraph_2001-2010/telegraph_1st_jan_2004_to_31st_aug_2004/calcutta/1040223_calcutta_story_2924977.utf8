 Millennium Park: Waterfront wonderAmrita Mukherjee: Millennium Park has turned out to be an excellent project. Are there plans to develop more such parks?																																																													Millennium Park itself will be extended. The Calcutta Port Trust and central shipping ministry have already given us the okay to proceed. Among the other beautification projects, we have started developing Grand Foreshore Road, in Howrah, and retrieving part of the riverbank along the Hooghly in Dakshineswar. Once these projects are ready, we will consider other programmes according to our budget. 																																																													 I would like to mention here that we are also restoring some buildings that have been tagged heritage. The quality of our work has impressed the government enough for it to pass on more and more restoration projects to our agency. In fact, it is becoming one of our core concerns to restore old buildings and we are seriously thinking about taking it on as part of our activity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 Tanushree ShankarDancerWe are lucky that dance at least has accompanying music which subdues the ringtone. Imagine the effect in a theatre, if a cellphone rings in a moment of silence. The whole impact is lost. But penalty is not the answer. It is not possible to locate the erring person in the darkness of the auditorium. Even if he is found out, what does one do if he says it was a medical emergency? Inculcating the habit should be our aim. As a teacher, I believe in the power of patience and persuasion. Before every show, we ask people to switch off their cell phones. The other day, a phone rang while my mother-in-law was addressing the gathering at the Science City auditorium. After another announcement, there was no more interruption. Earlier, people would stroll in late for our performances. But we started on time even if the hall was empty. Now there is no problem. So we have to keep harping on the message  through announcements, through notices outside halls, and through the ushers.

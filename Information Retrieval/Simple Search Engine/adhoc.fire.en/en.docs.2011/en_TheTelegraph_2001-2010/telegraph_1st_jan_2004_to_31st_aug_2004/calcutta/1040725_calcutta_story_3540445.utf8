The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 25, 2004 Key in to keep in touch
- Wire power to make friends and more TechTalkIts instant, allows anonymous usage, is a fun way of keeping in touch with friends and relatives across the world, making new ones  many have known to start as friends and ended up as family! And its a craze thats just getting bigger.Youd think that with more people having less time for things, the fine art of idle chatting would die a natural death. But chatting has only gone from strength to strength with just the mode becoming different. From the street corners and coffee shops it has moved to Internet instant messengers and Short Messaging Service (SMS) over mobile phones.Around 90 per cent of those who come to cyber cafes come for chatting, says Rajiv Poddar, MD of Happy e-Zone chain of cyber cafes. The messengers come in handy and the more popular chat rooms are of Yahoo!, MSN and Rediff, he adds. Attests Arpita Basu, a 24-year-old student and a regular chat room user: Most people fib about themselves, but then so do I. It doesnt matter, because its just a fun way of killing time. She adds that her parents would have a problem if those people came to meet her at home. She does have one good chat friend, though, and hopes the person isnt lying  a common chat hazard, when anonymity rules. Young execs, too, with their always-on Internet connections, rely on messengers and chat rooms to catch up with friends. Says Urmi Bhanja, who works with an ad agency and feels chat rooms are for kids: My friends and I use instant messengers and when Im in office, I use it all the time to talk to them, wherever they are in the world.MessengersThe most preferred way of keeping in touch with friends using the Internet. Thanks to Hotmail and Yahoo! email accounts (everyone has one), MSN and Yahoo! messengers are the most popular ones. ICQ and AOL also have their fan following. They are all free to use. Using a messenger is easy. Simply download the software from the respective sites and instal them in a few quick steps. Once you sign in and add the user IDs of your friends to your buddy-list, whenever they are online, you will get to know and can exchange messages with them. Newer versions of the messengers allow exchange of files, voice and video chat and even let you listen to the radio. Unlike chat rooms, messengers let you restrict participation to only those you want and even include the option of blocking the unwanteds in case they manage to make it to the list somehow.Chat sitesThe subject can be anything from latest Hollywood releases to whether the US handled Iraq the way it should have. The participants can be spread over continents. And screen names can be as wild as salsabgood or rageagainsthumanity. Welcome to the world of Internet chat. Log in to the innumerable chatrooms and strike up conversations with complete strangers. Take a peek into the minds of people from around the world, but dont be too surprised if later you find out the hot guy who sounded like gods gift to womankind is actually a girl. These things, say veterans, happen all the time in chat rooms. Revealing your name isnt necessary; a screen name is what you live by in this world. There are chat rooms for every conceivable subject. Try the Google directory (www.google.com/dirhp) for a comprehensive list of chat sites.Dedicated dating sites on the Net are aplenty. Most match your profile and alert you about the possible hookups.Mobile chattingCellular service providers are slowly realising the power of chat. And what better way to harness that than through SMS. Both Hutch and Airtel offer SMS chat options. The services try to provide the subscriber with an Internet chat room experience, with chat screens displayed on the handset. The newest offerings are voice-based chat and dating services. AirTels CheckMate lets customers dial a number from their phones, say check mate and record their profile. If the profile matches the existing ones in the database, the customer receives an SMS on the profiles available. They can then leave a personalised message or reply to a profile of choice. Rival Hutchs voice-based dating service follows a similar model. Hutch also has Push 2 Talk which allows a user with a GPRS set to have walkie-talkie like conversation at the push of a button with anyone within the country on the same network without paying long-distance call charges.... and elsewhere in the worldThe week that was saw the best getting better and cheaper. Apples iPod digital music player  the number one seller in its league by miles  was revamped to add better functionality and prices were slashed by 25 per cent.The fourth-generation iPod models cost $399 for 40 gigabytes of storage and $299 for 20 gigabytes. The previous models cost $499 and $399. The 40-gigabyte model can hold 10,000 songs.To navigate menus and control song playback, the new models use the click-wheel like the mini versions of iPod, and do away with buttons. Battery will last longer too, going up to 12 hours from eight on a single charge. But gleaming white continues to remain the only colour option.The price cuts and improvements come as Sony, Rio and others plan to introduce digital music devices in coming months. Demand for the iPod, which rose three-fold to 860,000 units in Apples third quarter, helped boost sales by 30 per cent from last year.iPod minis are yet to hit these shores legally, so it may yet be sometime till you lay your hands on the new iPod. Feast your eyes till then.FOR QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS, WRITE TO: techtalkabpmail.com

 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Tailored packages for aged and ailing
 SUBHRO SAHA																								Need a triple-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with nobody to do the running around at home for funds or facilities? Or even an appointment with an ENT specialist without knowing who is the nearest reliable one?																								Help, particularly for the aged and the alone, is at hand from one quarter. UD Healthcare promises tailor-made packages as part of a total medical solutions initiative. 																								A lot of people in the city, including elderly parents of young people settled abroad, need various forms of support to access reliable healthcare services concomitant to their spending power. Our aim is to offer customised solutions to medical needs common to this geographical region, explains Abalokita Chakraborty, who along with general and laparoscopic surgeon Sanjoy Kumar Seal, formed UD Healthcare about a month ago.																								Chakraborty, a former research scholar in cancer immunology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, US, feels there is a genuine need in the city for facilitator agencies to connect the distressed with the doctors. With 25 doctors on its panel and 250 others supporting the effort from the outside, UD Healthcare has kicked off with structured services in heart and general surgery, gynaecology and obstetrics, orthopaedics and trauma care, with free consultation.																								We are also planning dedicated clinics for diabetes, nephrology, hypertension, allergies and contagious conditions, adds Seal, who is attached to a number of leading city hospitals. 																								Once a patient calls the UD helpdesk at B51, Survey Park, (24166037/3595) or on e-mail (udh.koludhealthcare.com), he/she is first offered counselling by an appropriate consultant.																								We then compile the patients medical history for the databank and work out an estimate for treatment, depending on what the patient can afford, says Chakraborty, currently manager, business development amp; corporate relations, Woodlands Hospital and Medical Research Centre.																								With cost-control for the patient a major consideration, UD Healthcare is tying up with a number of pathology labs for discounts on diagnostics. We are also approaching schools to run awareness programmes for children on thalassaemia, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other conditions that need qualified critical inputs for management, says Seal. District outreach programmes are also in line.

 Thursday, August 19, 2004 Fida over Shahid
Screen On amp; OffBollywood may swear by repeating a successful formula over and over again but try telling that to chocolate boy hero Shahid Kapur. The day Ishq Vishk released, it became past for me. Both director Ken Ghosh and me were very particular that we do not repeat ourselves in Fida and make something really different. Thats why we have been able to grow together creatively.But dont the promos have a different tale to tell  with him dancing away to glory in valleys, discos and where not? There is, of course, a romantic angle to the film but finally it is a thriller, protests Shahid. It is a lot more dramatic than Ishq Vishk and definitely more challenging for me as an actor. I have had to display a wide gamut of emotions.Like his director and other Fida co-stars, Shahid bites his tongue when asked about the hue of his character. I wouldnt say it is grey because it will reveal the plot but there are multiple facets to the character. In fact, I do not want to limit myself to a particular image. I am just a couple of films old and am currently discovering myself as an actor.Shahid doesnt deny that the acting bug bit him early, thanks to his actor parents. I was exposed to a lot of films. The decision was definitely mine but they both had a big hand in my leaning towards the medium. And he just cant stop praising the National Award-winning performance of his father (Pankaj Kapoor) in Maqbool. It is an absolute honour to see him perform. Last weekend, we all came to know of the National Award and nothing could have made me more proud as a son.The young star, in a refreshing departure from just friends refrain, is quite candid about his Kareena connection. I know there is a lot of expectations amongst the audiences to see Kareena and me together on the big screen. But I dont think anything that is personal can help a film work at the box-office. On the sets, it has been really easy for me because I know her so well and we also share a great screen chemistry.Even if the audiences dont go fida over Fida, Shahid has a lot to look forward to. Theres Dil Maange More with Soha, Milenge Milenge with Kareena again, Life Ho To Aisi with Amrita Rao, a Feroze Nadiadwala production and John Mathans next. Im trying to do all kinds of roles. I have a problem though  at 23, I cant play a doc or a cop, he laughs.Finally, the big question  who gets Kareena at the end of Fida? I can tell you that but the whole team will just come and murder me, is the disarming answer.PRATIM D. GUPTA

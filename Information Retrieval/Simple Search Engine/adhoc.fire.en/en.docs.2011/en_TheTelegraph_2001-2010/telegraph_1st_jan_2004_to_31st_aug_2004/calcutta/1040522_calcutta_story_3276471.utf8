The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Salary attach for tutor pay
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The Rs 21.75 saga stretches on, with Calcutta High Court now threatening to attach the salary of the chairman, North 24-Parganas district primary school council, for not carrying out its earlier directive.																								Justice K.J. Sengupta, in his order on Friday, asked the chairman to send all relevant documents relating to the Rs 21.75 salary of Pranab Kumar Sengupta, a teacher with Basak Bagan Primary School, at Patipukur, to the directorate of school education within seven days.																								The court also asked the director of school education to disburse the salary of the teacher within seven days of receiving the documents from the council.																								The court finally directed the school education directorate to attach the salary of the councils chairman if the entire process was not completed within 14 days.																								Sengupta joined the school in 1973 and, since then, was drawing a monthly salary of Rs 21.75. In 1978, the state government declared Basak Bagan a government-aided school and took up the responsibility of paying the teachers.																								The education department, however, refused to pay Senguptas salary as his appointment had not been approved by the district primary school council.																								The schoolteacher then moved Calcutta High Court and Justice P.K. Mukherjee passed an order directing the education department to clear Senguptas appointment and pay him his salary according to the existing scale, along with his dues.																								The education department was ready to carry out the order of the court, but its subordinate, the primary school council, moved a petition before a higher bench to challenge the order. The division bench upheld the order of the trial bench.																								The plight of the schoolteacher was highlighted first in The Telegraph and petitioner Sengupta has made several appeals to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								As the primary school council refused to obey the orders of the court, the petitioners counsel Saibalendu Bhowmick filed a contempt petition against the council, as well as the directorate of school education.																								Appearing in court, director of school education affirmed that he was ready to disburse Senguptas salary, but the primary school council was not sending him the relevant documents, despite repeated requests.																								Irked by the attitude of the primary school council chairman, the court asked the education directorate to attach his salary if he failed to carry out the order of the court in time.

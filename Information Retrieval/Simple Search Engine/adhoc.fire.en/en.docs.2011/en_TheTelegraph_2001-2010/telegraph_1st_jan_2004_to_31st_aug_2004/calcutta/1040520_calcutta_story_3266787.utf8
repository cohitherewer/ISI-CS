The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Cher. You will be occupied with social work. A lot of travel is likely. Your efforts will be rewarded. You lay great store by friendship. You have a flair for words but big success lies in dealing with equipment for sport/hobbies. Your colours are white, cream, violet and purple.  Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Team Bengal to Turkey
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Bengali language faculty at an Ankara university, Turkish translations of Tagore in bookstores of Istanbul or, perhaps, an exhibition match with Galatasaray or Besiktas at Salt Lake stadium. 																								The agenda for dialogue is expected to be as motley as could be when a 20-member delegation of Bengal Initiative (BI) leaves on a bridge-building mission to Turkey on April 30.																								During the 10-day trip, the mission members, including industry captains, professionals, artists, educationists, doctors, sportspersons and lawyers, are expected to meet their counterparts in Istanbul and Ankara. 																								Thus, from P.K. Banerjee to Pabitra Sarkar, Shuvaprasanna to Saibal Gupta, K.D. Paul to Abhijit Sen, all noted names in their respective callings, will strive to showcase the core strengths of Bengal. For the first time in 40 years, such a combined delegation from the city, representing so many fields, will visit a foreign country to wrap-sell Bengal, says Bengal Initiative chairman Amiya Gooptu. 																								The team, as a whole, will meet ministers, mayors, the Foreign Economic Board and Turkish business conglomerates, with the sharp focus on education, health, business and sports.																								While a proposal to introduce Bengali lessons at a Turkish university will be mooted, the possibility to get works of Tagore translated into Turkish, in conjunction with Visva-Bharati, will also be explored. The BI delegation will weigh marketing options for art and films quintessentially Bengal as well.																								A strong pitch for medical tourism in Bengal will be made before the Turkish health ministry, with a structured cost-benefit ratio to project Calcutta as an able and affordable healthcare hub, capable of servicing international patients. 																								We must make it clear we are representing a market which is among the fastest growing, stresses Gooptu.																								The industry leaders hope to leverage Bengals strengths in tea, leather goods, gems and jewellery, with special emphasis on Mani Kanchan, electronic balancing equipment and also fashion, in which Turkey is one of Europes emerging markets.																								Meetings will be held at all levels, including with womens groups and trade unions.																								In sports, the team is not looking beyond the soccer pitch. We know Turkey shares the same passion for soccer as Calcutta. With PK calling the shots, we will speak to their football federation and find out if its possible to get some of their top coaches to train our coaches here, or a top club to play a few matches under a cultural exchange programme, the BI chairman says.																								Apart from Istanbul and Ankara, the team will also visit the ancient city of Izmir and the industrial hub of Bursa, before returning on May 9, a day before the state goes to the hustings.

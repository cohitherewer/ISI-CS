 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A private software facility in Salt Lake: Skilled manpower																								Bridging the gap between classroom curriculum and boardroom requirement, the West Bengal government is now working on a new strategy to sell the states core strength -- human resources -- to potential investors in the information technology (IT) sector. 																								Availability of skilled manpower at cheaper rates is our biggest strength and we are trying to market it using a platform, said IT minister Manab Mukherjee. 																								According to the plan, drawn up by the West Bengal government, the states IT department  in association with the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)  will provide a platform to facilitate exchanges between representatives from the IT industry and academia. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the workshop, scheduled on August 27, for which the government is also inviting the Union IT minister, Dayanidhi Maran. 																								Since industry is the end-user of the human resources, it should have more say regarding the curriculum and the process of delivery in colleges and universities. Besides, the academia should also be aware of the needs in the industry to churn out readily employable professionals. So, our entire initiative is to facilitate the flow of information and use the opportunity to market the talent pool of the state, explained Mukherjee. 																								The government has already started sending invitations to the chief executive officers of corporations and the vice chancellors of universities and confirmations of participation in the programme  billed as the first such initiative by a state government  have started trickling in. 																								Besides the premier institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology, Jadavpur University, Indian Institute of Management and the Indian Statistical Institute, we are also inviting representatives from all the private engineering colleges in the state. The industry will also be properly represented, said the IT minister. 																								Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom, will make a presentation on the manpower issues facing the industry and a CII representative will share the apex bodys views on the demand and supply situation of skilled personnel in the IT industry. 																								The event, according to Mukherjee, will help better branding of the state and the benefits will go to the engineering colleges and the institutes. The placement scenario in the institutes was good this year in comparison to previous years. Once the curriculum at these institutes is aligned to the needs of the corporates, the students chances of bagging big-ticket jobs will further go up, signed off Mukherjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 30, 2004 Catch them young... 
... and watch them grab. The small screen is making tiny tots the big consumers of tomorrow Shiloo ChattopadhyayadLibThis is one of the many new highrises that have come up on EM Bypass near Garia. I was visiting a friend. The first thing that I noticed was the crowd in the lift. It was different from the one that you meet inside a peak-hour Garia minibus. Young Calcuttans were taking the elevator to their homes in the sky.As I walked into Abhijit and Mahuas home, it seemed a natural extension of the ambience in the lift. The furniture was ethnic and chic. Home-embroidered cushion covers blended effortlessly with the pastel shades of the upholstery. The 29-inch TV set loomed large in the vicinity.Our conversation was unastonishing. Pleasantries were followed by a discussion on home loans and EMI, common acquaintances, summer heat in Calcutta vs Delhi, et al. At this juncture, their barely two-year-old son entered the drawing room. I had seen him earlier in the nursing home crib  hardly a place to get acquainted.So my efforts to get to know him started. Like most children of that age, his interest in a grown-up like me was minimal. He was all too consumed in his tricycle. That certainly would be the most accurate description of the personal transport of Ayush, a bubbly kid with megawatts of energy.I tried to inch closer to him by talking to him about his tricycle. Ayush has not yet been introduced to dictionaries and thesauruses. He did not understand what I meant by tricycle. All he knew was that I was showing interest in his prized possession. He said, Amar motorbike.It is then that I started noticing the difference. Yes, there were three wheels and it had to be pedalled to make it move. The similarity with a tricycle ended there. It had fenders and mudguards painted in bright red and yellow. Like the real thing it had a number-plate and a spare tyre. The steering resembled Kinetic Honda more than a tricycle.I was impressed. So I praised his  this time I did not make a mistake  motorbike. For the first time he smiled at me. And then said  Tumi boro hole amake boro motorbike kine diyo (when you grow up please buy me a full size motorbike). It was possibly his attempt at paraphrasing a parental promise. Yet, the tinge of disappointment was unmistakable. He really wanted the big thing.The million-dollar question is how on earth does a two-year-old acquire the desire to own a full size motorbike. Even logically, wanting to own a Maruti like his father would be more fathomable. Talking to Abhijit and Mahua provided some clues  the sound cues of a motorbike, watching a friends son ride a conventional tricycle, neighbour taking him for a ride on his Kawasaki, etc.Possibly the real answer was given by Ayush himself. He drove his motorbike towards the TV, got off and made a noise that was pregnant with a thousand words: Hush.Today, David Ogilvy would have said, consumer is not a moron, he is your kid. A two-year-old at that!

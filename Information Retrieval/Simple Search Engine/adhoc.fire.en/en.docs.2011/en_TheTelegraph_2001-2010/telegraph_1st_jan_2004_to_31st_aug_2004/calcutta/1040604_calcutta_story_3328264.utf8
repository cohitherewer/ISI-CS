 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Safety course for schoolbus drivers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Given the frequent mishaps involving schoolbuses and the illegal plying of vehicles as schoolbuses, an orientation-cum-training camp for the operators, drivers and their helps will be organised by the Public Vehicles Department (PVD), in association with the Contract Carriage Owners Association, at Ballygunge Government School on June 5.																								PVD director H. Mohan said on Thursday the move was aimed at providing the operators, drivers and their helps with basic knowledge on how to ply vehicles safely. Drivers and helps of schoolbuses must realise that they are not plying any ordinary bus, but carrying children. Hence, the extra care, Mohan said.																								According to the plan, the camp will last about five hours and then a test will be conducted at the same venue. Successful candidates will win awards. 																								Motor Driving Owners Association spokesman Bimal Guha said those who do well will win the Kalyan Bhadra Memorial Award.																								Transport department officials said the government decision to organise such an orientation camp comes in the wake of a steady rise in schoolbus accidents and allegations of illegal plying of vehicles. 																								At least 15 accidents have occurred in the past six months. Two students were killed and 16 others injured.																								We have framed a set of rules for operating schoolbuses in the city and have already informed all concerned about it. A schoolbus will have a certain fixed design, colour, seating arrangements and must have additional safety measures. We will not allow any vehicle to ply as a schoolbus just because of a sign on it. Apart from obtaining a permit from the PVD, an approval from the school authorities concerned is mandatory, the PVD director said. 																								PVD officials said most of the buses plying as schoolbuses are doing so illegally, and operators have neither a licence or permit nor authorisation from schools.																								Nearly 1,800 buses ply daily in the city to ferry students to different schools. Secretary of the Contract Carriage Owners Association Himadri Ganguly said about 1,000 drivers and helps working in different schoolbuses will participate in the orientation camp.Post for Subhas: In another development, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday was unanimously elected for the first time as president of the Bengal Taxi Association, the largest forum of taxi operators in the city. The post fell vacant after the death of Kalyan Bhadra.																								Chakrabortys name was proposed by association secretary Bimal Guha, which was accepted by all members. Minister Chakraborty, as Citu leader, looks after the transport workers union.

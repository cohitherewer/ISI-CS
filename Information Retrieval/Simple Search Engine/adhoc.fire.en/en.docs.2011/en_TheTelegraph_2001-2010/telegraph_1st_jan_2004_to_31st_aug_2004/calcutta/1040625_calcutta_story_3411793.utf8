The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 25, 2004  Calcutta Column

	In most metros, autorickshaw drivers wear uniforms with identification numbers. But in Calcutta, the drivers have no dress code, nor can you be sure whether they have learnt driving at all, or are licence-holders. Moreover, autos are often overloaded and driven through narrow alleys at high speed. Most drivers do not stick to their sanctioned routes and traffic jams are caused due to this. A rule should be introduced, making it compulsory for auto drivers to wear uniforms with identification numbers on them.

	There is no direct bus service from Nagerbazar to Salt Lake. Many people travel from Nagerbazar and its surrounding areas to Salt Lake for work. Presently, DN8 is the only bus available on the route. But its service is very irregular. Inconvenienced commuters are forced to change buses at Ultadanga. If a few more buses are introduced on this route, we would be grateful.

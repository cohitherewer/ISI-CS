Picture by Pabitra DasSwami Chhintai  yes, you read it right  is the film Sharad Kapoor and Rituparna Sengupta (seen at the films launch party in Tangerine on Thursday night) have teamed up for. Producers of the India-Bangladesh project are confident their story on husband stealing or snatching, or whatever, shot at exotic locales in Mumbai, Pune and Haldia, will set the cash registers ringing on both sides of the Bengal border.

Contemporary choreography from Germany, where solo performers are presented in subtle interactions with video projections. A literary evening at a public place where German and British wordsmiths could match their pens with local writers, weaving in live feedback from passers-by.				 																																																											Max Mueller Bhavan Calcutta is in reach-out mode and theres a sense of energy emanating from its Pramathesh Barua Sarani premises, with its new director Martin Waelde the unmistakable catalyst. Through our projects and programmes, we want to destroy the wrong images of Calcutta going out to the West, stresses the director.				 																																																											On a broader canvas, Waeldes agenda is to intensify the European-Indian cultural dialogue, addressing contemporary and urgent issues in an interdisciplinary context and reaching out not only to our existing friends, but to newer audiences. Before assuming charge in Calcutta, the new director had engaged a social scientist to define more precisely where we stand, who are our audience, what we miss, who come to us and who dont. What Waelde really had in mind was to create points of attraction and space for a younger audience too.				 																																																											I certainly dont want MMB to become an exclusive and elitist bastion for south Calcuttans only. Hence the thought to take events and programmes to the nooks and crannies of the city, to the people who make Calcutta so passionate and emotive. In keeping with that credo, Waeldes personal favourite project is the Rimini-Protokoll, a theatre-performance-production planned in the city in 2004-05.				 																																																											In its connection, the Stefan Kaegi-Daniel Wetzel duo recently made a presentation of its concepts and works and interacted with artistes and activists from various disciplines as well as the man in the street to develop ideas for an Indo-German co-production. Its unpredictable, risky and not readymade theatre, using the natural qualities of the common Calcuttan, something we at the Max Mueller Bhavan are striving towards.				 																																																											The director is also excited about the renovated auditorium and the new-concept library of the institute. While the erstwhile MMB library is being converted into a German Resource Centre, its entire stock of books has been relocated to the Seagull Bookstore in association with the Seagull Foundation for the Arts. In accordance with a national policy, while MMB New Delhi will become a much stronger central information centre, the network of resource centres in Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai will supplement it.				 																																																											We will constantly update the collection at our Seagull library with relevant books to ensure it doesnt remain static. I want to stress we dont lose what we offered until now and we are offering something new in terms of our online services, access to DW TV, link-up with Delhi and a whole new bouquet of support systems for professionals, stresses Waelde.				 																																																											MMB, in collaboration with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), is organising a very significant international conference  Does culture make a difference? Progress and Development in India and its implications for international cooperation from April 22 to 24. The conclave is part of a series of conferences on Notions of progress in different cultures also encompassing La Paz, Alexandria, Windhoek, St Petersburg and Berlin. Subhro Saha				 																																									 Ballater Geddes Project, Scotland, and School of Art amp; Craft, Calcutta, are coming together to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Sir Patrick Geddes. Sir Geddes was a pioneer of town and environmental planning, and also a friend of Rabindranath Tagore. 				 																																																											As part of the celebrations, a workshop on boat making, boat painting and drawing would be conducted by Scottish sculptor and painter Kenny Munro from April 4 to 11 at the school on Asgar Mistri Lane. The workshop, entitled River and Leaves, is based on Geddes motto, by leaves we live.				 																																																											After the workshop, on April 14, the 18-ft long painted wooden boat would be taken to Scotland and set afloat on river Dee at Ballater. Works of the students of the art school would also be exhibited in Scotland.				 																																																											Apart from the workshop, the celebrations would also include a discussion on Geddes and Tagore on April 11, with participants including Prof. Sibnarayan Roy, Prof. Amlan Dutta, Prof. Uma Dasgupta, Samik Bandyopadhyay and Kenny Munro. Swami Chhintai  yes, you read it right  is the film Sharad Kapoor and Rituparna Sengupta (seen at the films launch party in Tangerine on Thursday night) have teamed up for. Producers of the India-Bangladesh project are confident their story on husband stealing or snatching, or whatever, shot at exotic locales in Mumbai, Pune and Haldia, will set the cash registers ringing on both sides of the Bengal border. Picture by Pabitra Das 				 																																																											Having kicked off with 40 per cent occupancy at the matinee show on Friday, the going looks good for a Telugu weekend  block bookings for 20 to 30 are already pouring in.				 																																																											Although this is the first non-Bengali regional film to be screened in the city by INOX, the experiment has worked well in other multiplexes around the country.				 																																																											The Pune INOX saw regional films like the Tamil Anbe Shivam and Marathi Anahat do reasonably well. In fact, Subrata Sens Nil Nirjane, starring mother-daughter duo Moon Moon and Raima Sen, was a hit, with 60 per cent occupancy.				 																																																											For Malleswari, tickets have been priced at Rs 50 on weekdays and Rs 70 on weekends. To add to the mood, the INOX food counter, Refuel, is offering a special south Indian spread of idli and coffee.				 																																																											The aim of this entire exercise is to reach out and tap the cosmopolitan nature of Calcuttas population, that loves watching regional language films on the big screen, but cannot, since no theatre shows them, says an INOX spokesperson.				 																																									 The tradition of authors taking to song-writing is long gone, or so goes the complaint. Towards reviving that, an album of songs written by Bengali author Samaresh Majumdar was released on Sa Re Ga Ma on Friday. The eight songs on Gaan Bela have been sung by singers Srikanta Acharya and Lopamudra Mitra. 				 																																																											The compositions, according to Majumdar, were born out of his fond memories of the Bengali songs of the 50s and 60s. But the role of a lyricist is something that he could never see himself playing. Ive never even written poems, something that is closer to songs, he admitted. It was the encouragement of Soumitra Chatterjee  a musician and friend of Majumdar, who is also the music composer for the album  that gave formal shape to the songs. Participation from Acharya and Mitra helped propel the project forward.				 																																																											But Majumdar is very clear about his future flirtations with song-writing: If the songs are played in my neighbours house, which is the popularity index for me, then only will I think about continuing.And then 				 																																																											Theres an evening with Sankha Ghosh lined up at the Srijan rooftop this Sunday. Author and admirer Chinmoy Guha will welcome the poet who will read some of his works. It starts at 6 pm, but entry with invitation cards only.

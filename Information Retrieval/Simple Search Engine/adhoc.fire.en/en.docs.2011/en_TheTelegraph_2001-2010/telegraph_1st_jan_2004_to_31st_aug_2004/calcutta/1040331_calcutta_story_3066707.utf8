The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Rain relief in the air
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Early morning rain, followed by an overcast sky throughout Tuesday, provided some relief to Calcuttans sweating it out under the heat and humidity of the past few days.																								The weather office said the sky was likely to remain cloudy on Wednesday, with chances of rain or thundershower.																								Director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore, K.K. Chakraborty, said a trough of low pressure had formed, extending from Sikkim to Telengana and covering south Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh.																								There is also a wind pattern that is bringing in a lot of moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The combined effect has led to the rain and formation of clouds. A cloudy sky and some rainfall is forecast on Wednesday, too, added Chakraborty.																								At Alipore, 2.8 mm of rain was recorded early on Tuesday.																								As a result of the rain and the cloud cover, the maximum temperature slipped to 30.7 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal.																								The minimum temperature was a degree below normal, at 22.1 degrees.																								The word from the weather office was that the windspeed picked up on Monday night and touched 30 kph to 35 kph.																								This, along with the rain, helped bring down the temperature. We received reports from coastal areas like Digha that the windspeed there on Monday night was as high as 44 kph. In Midnapore town, the windspeed was even higher, said an official																								High-speed winds were also reported from parts of Hooghly district.																								Throughout last week, a severe sun beat down on the city and the maximum temperature hovered between 37 degrees and 36 degrees Celsius.																								This year, we have had fewer Norwesters up till now. We now hope that the situation will improve in April and the city will see more thunderstorms in the evenings and nights to bring the mercury down, an official at the Alipore weather office said on Tuesday.																								Weather officials explained that there has been very little rain and thunder because the wind pattern has not allowed much incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal.

 Thursday, May 20, 2004 Civic coffer bleeds in build boom
				 	 WHITE ELEPHANT: The housing estate on DL Khan Road that the civic body started building with great fanfare, then stopped work on, and now doesnt know what to do with. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Theres a boom in construction of private residential and commercial highrises, but Calcuttas civic authorities, also into real estate, have failed to cash in. They have invested at least Rs 100 crore in two decades in a few dozen unfinished projects.																								I admit weve wasted a great deal of money on these projects, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Tuesday. But the responsibility lies with my predecessors, who did not invest judiciously.																								Key to the disastrous Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) foray into real estate are about 32 residential and commercial projects, which the CPM-led civic board conceived and started building over the past 20 years, but never completed.																								CPM functionaries like Nirmal Mukherjee, Salil Chatterjee and Amal Mitra said their board could not complete the projects for want of funds. They pointed out that since the state government had helped and allowed the Trinamul board harness over Rs 200 crore of extra revenue, the present board was duty-bound to complete the projects.																								These 32 projects are not assets, but liabilities, said mayor Mukherjee. All of them were conceived with a political motive and drawn up against the interests of the civic body.																								In almost all the projects, the land value had not been accounted for while calculating the sale price, said a civic accounts officer. 																								He pointed out that for reasons best known to the former civic board, the cost calculation and sale price of the spaces proposed to be generated by these projects were not determined by the accounts department, but by engineers of the project and development wing. 																								All the projects are in prime location but there is no scramble of prospective buyers. Even our advertisements, inserted in the newspapers, failed to evoke any response, said the mayor. 																								All the structures are 10 to 12 years old. Why will people buy them at the current market rate? asked officer on special duty to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh.																								A senior engineer in the CMC projects amp; development wing said: It is a riddle to me why the former board decided to build residential flats atop a fish market at Bansdroni or Gariahat. 																								The CMC ought to have appointed real estate consultants or brokers in time to recover the money invested in the projects, he added.Ten of the unfinished 32

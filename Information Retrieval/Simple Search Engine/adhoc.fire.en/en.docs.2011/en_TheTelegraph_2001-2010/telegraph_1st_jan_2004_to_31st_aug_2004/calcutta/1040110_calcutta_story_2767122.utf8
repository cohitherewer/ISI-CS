The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 A tradition of tolerance Sympathy, nostalgia and pickles
 															- Favourable play about city by Calcutta-born Jewish author AMIT ROY IN LONDON				 	 Silas: The only place to live in																								A play that will premiere in London on February 4, before going on a nationwide tour of Britain, will present a favourable portrait of Calcutta as a city with a long tradition of religious tolerance.																								Called Calcutta Kosher, it has been written by a 44-year-old Jewish woman called Shelley Silas, who was born in Calcutta but left the city at the age of two with her parents to emigrate to Britain.																								Silas, who says she still feels very much connected to Calcutta, wants her play to encourage people to visit the West Bengal capital. I want people to go to Calcutta, she told The Telegraph. People who have not been there have the impression its a grim, grey place, but I know its very creative.																								Sills said both her parents, who also live in Britain, were born in Calcutta. Part of the inspiration for the play comes from Silas own family. In Calcutta Kosher, Mozelle, the mother who has never left her beloved Calcutta, welcomes home her daughters, Esther and Silvie, who have returned briefly from London and Los Angeles, respectively. In the dialogue, the playwright manages to slip in the kind of propaganda which only a playwright can do.																								Calcutta, Mozelle tells Esther at one point, is the only place to live in India, you know.																								To which Ester says: What about Bombay?																								Mozelle responds: Mumbai? Too bloody noisy.																								At another juncture, the mother rejects the suggestion from Esther that she should, like her, consider moving abroad. I am not going anywhere, Calcutta is where I belong, where I want to die, declares Mozelle. When my father came here from Baghdad, he vowed to die here and so will I.																								Audiences will be treated to these and similar bits of pro-Calcutta propaganda in London, Huddersfield, Nottingham, Bradford, Cambridge, Hounslow in west London, Leicester and Manchester. The cast for Calcutta Kosher includes Jamilla Massey, a veteran actress in the UK, and Shelley King, who was also born in Calcutta and received good reviews for her role as Kitty in Andrew Lloyd Webbers Bombay Dreams.																								Silas remembers a trip to Calcutta 18 years ago, when she went back with her parents. One reason why she feels so sympathetic to the land of her birth and to Calcutta, in particular, is because the Jews have never been persecuted in India.																								They were just allowed to get on with their business, she said. Once, there were 20,000 to 30,000 Jews in Calcutta but today, I believe there are 30 to 40 families left. Two of the citys synagogues still exist. The Jews in Calcutta had a British way of life.																								Although the story in Calcutta Kosher is largely fictional, there is a pickle factory in the play. My grandfather was part-owner of a pickle factory in Calcutta, explained Silas																								An earlier draft of Calcutta Kosher was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2000. There are hopes that the play can be brought to the city where it is set. 																								Silas herself is planning to return to Calcutta very soon.

 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Tug-of-war over tribute to Mahatma
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out at the base of the Mahatma Gandhi statue on Mayo Road, where a ceremony was held on Friday to commemorate his death anniversary.																								A scuffle erupted when Congress supporters assembled on the spot wanted to garland the statue at 11.20 am (when the Mahatmas death certificate had been issued), but police stopped them as Governor Viren J. Shah was to do so ceremonially.																								The Congressmen, led by Pradip Bhattacharya, Krishna Debnath and Badal Bhattacharya, reached the statue at around 11 am. They wanted to garland the statue and place a wreath at its feet. But police would have none of it. 																								We couldnt allow that. The Governor has been the first to garland the statue for the past 25 years, said an officer.																								The supporters would not listen and started walking towards the statue. When warned off by the police, they turned violent, tearing the uniform of Ashoke Sarkar, additional officer-in-charge of Maidan police station. 																								They beat him up, before police managed to disperse the mob. They did not have police permission to hold the meeting, said Asish Sengupta, officer-in-charge, Maidan thana.																								When Governor Shah arrived, the crowd was still worked up. He spoke to the Congress leaders, suggesting that they garland the statue together. But the supporters started running towards the statue and another scuffle followed.																								Shah waited for the crowd to settle down, paid his respects and left.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Alert over unsafe toys
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 																								For the first time ever, the Toy Association of India (TAI) has expressed concern over unsafe toys sold in the market, months after the Bengal government opened the hi-tech toy park in Salt Lake. 																								Next month, the biggest-ever toy fair will be held at Netaji Indoor Stadium, which TAI believes will be the perfect platform to boost the existing Rs 75-crore toy market in Calcutta. 																								At the fair, parents will be counselled on safety standards of toys.																								We are very concerned at the way unsafe toys are being sold on pavements and stores in Calcutta. We have, therefore, taken it upon ourselves to inform parents about the potential hazard of opting for cheap products, said Lob Gupta, CEO of Fun Toys and national coordinator for the toy fair. 																								The safe-toy crusade by TAI comes at a time when city-based doctors have raised an alarm over increasing cases of small children choking on bits and pieces of toy parts, swallowing dangerous chemicals or chewing on recycled plastics  all harmful for them. 																								There has been a dramatic rise in cases of toy parts getting stuck in food-pipes, lungs and throat. Some cases have proved fatal. We are deeply concerned and hope that toy manufacturers will keep the safety aspect of children in mind, said pulmonary physician Partha Sarathi Bhattacharya.																								The city chapter of the Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS), an international agency working on safety standards of toys worldwide, says most toys sold in the Calcutta market either have faulty and unsafe designs, or use materials that pose serious health hazards, said CUTS spokesperson Soumi Home Roy. 																								She warned: Several toys we picked up had sub-standard plastic or polyvinyl chloride plastics, which contain harmful chemicals like lead and cadmium. The lead used in some toys causes irreversible damage to the nervous system and decreases intelligence level in children.

 Prelude jams on stage at Swabhumi. (above) Sudipta keeps the audience clued in. Pictures by Rashbehari DasWho would have thought soccer could be sung?That was the question that was asked on Saturday, before the finals of Soccer Rocker 2004 kicked off.				 				 																															Four enthusiastic college bands proved that the rhythm of the English Premiere League went far beyond fancy footwork on the field, on Saturday evening at Swabhumi.				 				 																															The finals saw four bands fight it out with their original compositions on English Premiere League football. Organised by ESPN-Star Sports and supported by teen magazine Unish Kuri, the Urban Court was packed with participants and their fans, cheering on the musical action, surrounded by glossy posters of all their favourite teams  The Favourites (Manchester United), The Bulldozers (Liverpool), The Challengers (Arsenal)				 				 																															The fun had hit the road with small shows at schools and colleges in the city and its suburbs last month, where students were quizzed on soccer and were treated to performances by Lakkhichhara. Interested groups sent in recordings of their songs by February 7 and on February 21 the eight semi-finalists had a sing off at Swabhumi.				 				 																															Finally, Prelude, Mon, Patheo and Baundule made it to the finals on Saturday. They were to sing the same song that had brought them to the finals, but some had chosen to make minor modifications for the rounds to be judged by Pratik Choudhury and band members of Krosswindz Vikram and Chandrani, Pinky and Siddharth from Cactus, and Swapan and Chirodeep of Span.				 				 																															Prelude took the stage first with a hard rock take on the Premiere League. They performed well, sporting Liverpool T-shirts, though the angst-ridden head-banging may have been a little excessive for the occasion. As the next contenders set up, one of the hosts for the evening, Pranam (the other being actress Sudipta Chakraborty) quizzed the audience on the Premiership.				 				 																															Next, Patheo took the stage. This peppy team was strong on vocals. They were followed by Baundule. The final act of the evening was Mon. They had the most fun with their upbeat song, with well-penned lyrics that did justice to the theme of the evening.				 				 																															The final results reflected this. Mon was named winner, with Bhaichung Bhutia, greeted by thundering applause from the crowd, handing over the first prize. Patheo and Prelude were first and second runners-up respectively.				 				 																
	 Looking ahead				 				 																															Young Indians, the recently launched youth chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry, held an interactive session between young city professionals from various fields and students from Apeejay School at the Apeejay Anand Library recently. What are the things we can change about the country? was the first question. The students started shooting off a huge wish-list  peace with our neighbours, education, infrastructure development, improvements to the political and judicial system Then came the question of what makes us feel proud of India. Culture, Indian intellect, the education system and IT were high on the list. But India does not have anything that different from any other country, said Ansul Jain from Young Indians. That triggered off an impassioned discussion. As it turned out, the comment was meant to get us to speak out. His gamble paid off  when we were united against something, our love for the country was heightened.				 				 																															The discussion made clear that though we may not excel in some fields, we are good strugglers, bringing us that much closer to achieving vision 2020 (President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is chief mentor for the Young Indians initiative). Sangeet Shirodkar,

	 Village vignettes				 				 																															The third year B.Com students of JD Birla Institute were given a warm farewell by their juniors on February 28 on the college campus. This years theme was Rajasthan, depicted through the decorations, food and shows. The whole college campus was transformed into a tribal village. The girls in ethnicwear looked like perfect village women managing their stalls on a variety of themes like tarot-reading and mehendi.

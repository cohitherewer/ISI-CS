The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 This week, CalTels re-celling Excel
 															- Radio capacity hitch overcome, pre-paid mobile service ready for rollout SANJAY MANDAL 																								Excel, Calcutta Telephones pre-paid mobile telephone service, is ready to be re-launched later this week.																								We plan to roll out Excel shortly, after installation of the new Ericsson switch. The exact date has not been fixed, but it should be this week, S.K. Bhaduri, general manager, sales and customer services, told Metro.																								A handful of Excel cards were distributed earlier, when C-Dot switches were installed. In October last year, CalTel launched the post-paid mobile telephone services, CellOne. But Excel could not be launched in a big way then because of a radio capacity problem, Bhaduri explained. 																								Officials said the pre-paid Sim cards will be distributed through two channels. One: the 17 customer service centres across the city of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The other will be through a distributor network. From May 11, the Sim cards will be distributed to these customer service centres and dealers.																								We are allowing public call office booth-owners to sell recharge coupons but they will not be given the Sim cards, general manager Bhaduri elaborated. CalTel will continue the distribution of Excel as per demand. There will be no discontinuation of service, he added. 																								Initially, the authorities were planning to launch 8,000 Excel cards, sources said. They anticipate a rush for the cards. So, in order to curb malpractices like hoarding, they have decided to enter the fray silently, without any ad campaigns, a senior CalTel official said, on condition of anonymity.																								According to sources, the CalTel authorities were under pressure of a stiff target set by the corporate headquarters. A target of two lakh-plus CellOne connections has been set for CalTel for 2004-05, an official said. Against such a target, CalTel, to date, has been able to provide only 26,000 connections, he said.																								However, Bhaduri denied the report. We have our own targets and preparations are being made to meet that. We are augmenting our radio capacity systems, the general manager said. CellOnes switch capacity is around a lakh now. The target is to raise it to 1.76 lakh by December, he added.																								The CellOne service was commissioned in Calcutta on October 30, 2003, after a host of hiccups. The debut date was deferred several times, but officials went ahead and announced an annual target of 100,000 connections. 																								CellOne met with a good initial response and the BSNL call centres were flooded with inquiries every day. Sources said the CalTel authorities are, however, saddled with a shortage of towers and insufficient radio connectivity. All the promises have failed, causing frustration among a large number of customers, claimed T.S. Srinivasan, secretary, Telephone Services Society. After waiting endlessly, several customers are now approaching private operators, he added.

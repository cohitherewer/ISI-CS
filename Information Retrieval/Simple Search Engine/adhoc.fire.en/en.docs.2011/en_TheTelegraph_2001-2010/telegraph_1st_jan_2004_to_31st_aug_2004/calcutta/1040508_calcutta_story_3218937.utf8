 SAMARPAN DUTTA AND DEBASISH CHATTERJEE 																								You want your child to make a career in the sciences, but he shies away from all things mathematical. Help is a stones throw away, in the form of an institute.																								International Mental Arithmetic Academy, based in Chennai, helps children develop mathematical skills and improve their level of concentration through easy and accessible methods. Its due to debut in the city shortly.																								Mental arithmetic is a form of calculation that is done entirely in the mind, without any physical or electronic gadgets. We have adopted a method from the Chinese and use the Zhusuan, or abacus, as the primary tool to teach children easy methods of solving mathematical problems, explained Gunjan Tibrawalla, directress of Innocent Smiles, at Gurusaday Road, south Calcutta. 																								Scientific and linguistic studies have revealed that mental abilities in children develop till age 12 and the degree of mental development, achieved by a child during this period, has a great impact on his future. That is why the programme has been designed for children in the four-to-12 age-group. At this age, learning should be fun, and the abacus is a learning tool that provides a simple but interesting way of solving mathematical problems, Tibrawalla added.																								The institute offers a 34-month course to assist children get over their fear of numerical representations and then help them improve mathematical skills. Our primary aim is to get the child to feel at home with numbers and recognise them, vis-a-vis mathematical problems. To begin with, we will teach them the use of the tool. Then, they will be taught to solve simple problems and proceed to more complex ones, she explained. 																								Mental arithmetic has benefits other than developing mathematical skills. It helps develop analytical and logical thinking and increases the power of concentration, claims the academy.																								A group of experts on mental arithmetic were in the city to hold a workshop on May 6, at which dignitaries from Chennai  the Indian head office  briefed them on the use of the abacus and its effect on the human brain. About 100 participants attended, including several representing the leading schools in the city.

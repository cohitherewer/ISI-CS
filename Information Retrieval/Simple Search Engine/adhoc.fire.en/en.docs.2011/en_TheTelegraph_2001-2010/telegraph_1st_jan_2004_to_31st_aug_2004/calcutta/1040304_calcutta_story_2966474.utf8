  for better or worse: Students compare their marksheets  The use of a puff of gas (an equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen, commonly known as Entonox) as an anaesthetic to mitigate labour pain has been in use in medicine for more than 35 years by doctors around the world (Now, agony gone in a puff, Feb. 4). It is ironic that only now have healers in Calcutta brought this ancient medical technology to patients here. It demonstrates the laggard pace at which the Bengal medicos intend to catch up with modern medicine.  M.B. Kristoffersen, a Danish physician, first reported the use of Entonox as a useful anaesthetic reagent back in 1968 in a Norwegian medical journal. Entonox (also known as Eutonal in some countries) has been used since then by doctors worldwide for various pain-killing purposes. Entonox has been in medical literature for many years and has been used in ambulance service (British Medical Journal in 1970, vol. 2, page 41), bronchoscopy (British Journal of Anesthesia in 1974, vol. 46, page 970), dental surgery (British Journal of Anesthesiology in 1975, vol. 47, page 1229), obstetrics including labour (Anaesthesia in 1979, vol. 33, page 545), orthopaedic surgery (Journal of Orthopedic Trauma in 1990, vol. 4, page 35) and several other clinical conditions where deep sedation may not be essential.  The practice of medicine is rapidly changing with advances in biomedical technology. In the era of the Internet, there is hardly any reason for doctors in West Bengal not to keep abreast with the developments. After all, a little effort on the part of a doctor to keep abreast of recent progress may easily turn out to be a question of life or death for the patients. Dr. Kunal Saha,
Ohio, USA. Apropos the report HS drops marks tally (Feb. 2), ranking a student on the basis of the marks that he/she has secured does not reflect the examinees merit. ICSE and CBSE have already done away with the ranking system. So the Higher Secondary Councils switch was long overdue. Piyal Mukherjee,
Lake Town. The councils decision is utterly ridiculous. The Justice Ranjugopal Mukherjee committee argues that the main purpose of not publishing the merit lists is to reduce the stress that students suffer in the rat race of scoring higher marks. But I think students will lose interest in studies as there will be no scope for healthy competition. Will it not be funny if athletes are not declared winners and runners-up? Moumita Roy, 
Bally, Hooghly. Mismanagement, neglect, waste and disinterest have been the bane of Bengal (Crores for idle crores, Feb. 3). More than the projects that have not been sanctioned, it is the sanctioned projects that have not taken-off or been completed that have got the state into the mess it is in. People here expect second-rate services. That is why they get them. Sunil Garodia,
Sushil Sen Road. Apropos the report After sunset, its status horribilis (Feb 4), it is sad to learn about the deplorable state of Calcutta Medical College, once our most reputed medical institution. It is now in the clutches of organised rackets that are the stumbling blocks in the path of its development. Sunil Banerjee,
VIP Road. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants to rid the city of trams (Mayor favours speed, minister in no hurry, Feb. 1). But it is wrong to blame trams for being slow. Trams get stranded because buses block their way. Anil Kumar Sen,
Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. It is funny to learn that the officer-in-charge of the telephone cell at Lalbazar issued a directive to his clerical subordinates to address him as sir (To sir, a call of defiance, Feb. 3). Given that the reputation of lawmen is not always squeaky clean, it is a disrespect to the Bengali language to call them babus which has an honourable connotation. Prahlad Agarwala,
Majdia, Nadia. With the rich and famous booking five-star addresses for social occasions, hotels have found a new clientele (Five-stars shine bright on wedding night, Feb. 3). This is common in other metros but is a new trend in Calcutta. T.R. Anand,
Budge Budge. It seems nothing can bring about an improvement in hospital administration regarding dereliction of duty. (Trouble in RG Kar in patient death wake, Feb. 2) A.K. Sen,
Address not given.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Out of sight, but the mails all right
 															- Street legal address with a braveheart brigade of eight blind couriers SUNANDO SARKAR																								A four-ft-by-six-ft room that shares a wooden mezzanine with law clerks chambers on Calcuttas street legal, Kiron Shankar Roy Road, is an unlikely setting for a heart-warming tale of out-of-the-ordinary courage.																								On any given day, when business is good for the small courier firm working out of this space, you will find a batch going out with bags stuffed with packets and parcels for addresses all over the city and returning after a hard days work. Nothing extraordinary, you would say. But take a closer look and you will see that many among the seek-and-find carriers cannot see.																								Eight blind men and women are now on this courier firms rolls, defying their handicap and conventional logic by doing everything their normal colleagues do.																								Ajay Sau is a member of the braveheart brigade. On Wednesday, when Metro caught up with him, he had just returned to the Indo-Express Courier office after reaching mail to a Sovabazar address and was waiting to head for the GPO. He has been here almost every day  up the dimly-lit wooden stairs and down the corridor, where people with no vision impairment would falter  for the past year. I cannot think of life without work, says the former Lighthouse for the Blind student.																								But Sau was not always this comfortable at work. When he started out, recounted office manager Seema Mandal, he worked for barely three days before running away to his Bihar home. But he returned as suddenly a few days later and has stuck on since, Mandal added. Saus usual beat is south Calcutta, though he insists he can go anywhere. And the experience, usually, is far from unhappy. Only last week, I was having problems crossing the busy road near Dhakuria. A woman turned up and helped me cross the road and then left me near a Jodhpur Park address after introducing me to some people in the neighbourhood, said Sau.																								The first among the blind couriers was Alok Sarkar. He was with a home run by Voice of World, recounted Mandal. One day in 1997, Gargi Gupta from the organisation walked into our Hare Street office to inquire about some mail. She asked me if we could employ some of the blind, who were educated but unemployed. Mandal explained how that meeting changed the way Indo-Express Courier worked.																								A green light from proprietor Sandip Parekh later, Sarkar landed the job. His first assignment  delivering a packet from the Hare Street office to a nearby Bankshal Street address in seven minutes flat  convinced the courier company that there was no stopping Sarkar. Since then, seven others  Manoranjan Mandal, Samir Mandal, Dolly Datta, Sarbani Banerjee, Gopal Manna, Rathin Sengupta and Sau have worked for the firm, tracking down the most obscure of addresses. They work just as well as our other employees, said Parekh. But we pay them double, plus a special monthly allowance, added Mandal. For, they do much more than just deliver mail; they smash myths and make a statement every time they step out.

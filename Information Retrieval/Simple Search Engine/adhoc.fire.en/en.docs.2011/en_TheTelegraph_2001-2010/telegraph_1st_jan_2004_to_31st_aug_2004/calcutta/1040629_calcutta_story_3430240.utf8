																																																		Water supply in the city will not resume before 10 am on Tuesday. This announcement by the civic authorities on Monday evening means that the dry spell in the city will continue. According to an earlier announcement, water supply was to have resumed at 7 am on Monday. Municipal commissioner Debasis Som has opened a control room in his office from Monday evening to monitor the progress of the work which required the waterworks at Palta and Garden Reach to be shut down from 9.30 am on Monday. The control room will remain active for two weeks. Work at Behala on Monday was hampered owing to a lack of pipes of the required dimension with the Central Municipal Water and Sanitation Authority. Even after resumption of water supply on Tuesday, the city will continue to get less water from Palta for two weeks till the three newly-commissioned 20-million gallon water treatment plants resume operation.																																																		A division bench on Monday observed that the high court was not the forum to decide the status of a housewife. The bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutta, also set aside the order of Justice Barin Ghosh who had observed that mothers-in-law had the right to drive out their daughters-in-law from their house. Justice Ghosh had made this observation on the basis of a petition by national-award winning Bengali film actress, Dipali Basu, who alleged that her husband had allowed a maid servant to stay in her Salt Lake residence only because he was having an affair with her. But while contesting the case, Dipalis husband told the court that the woman concerned was not a maid servant but his daughter-in-law. When Dipali was in Chennai his son had married her. The division bench did not comment on the issue and set aside the order of the trial judge. He asked both parties to settle the issue before a magistrate.

The courses include motorcycle and cycle repairing, book-binding, hair-cutting and doll-making to help prisoners join the mainstream after their release. The programme will be organised and funded by the Ramakrishna Mission Janashiksha Mandir. Classes will be held twice or thrice a week.

Bengali novels have been translated into great films, Akhtar said, adding he would love to write dialogues for a film based on one of Sunil Gangopadhyays novels. Of course, only if he lets me, he added quickly. After a half-hour chat with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, old friend Akhtar said he had come to congratulate the chief minister on the Left Fronts victory in the Lok Sabha polls. Quizzed on his interest in politics, the poet remarked: Politics is all around us. It touches our lives, how can we be aloof from it?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The stretch in front of Azad Hind Dhaba is clogged by cars parked on a portion of Ballygunge Circular Road. Recently, I had asked a sergeant if parking was allowed on the stretch. The officer, however, could not come up with an answer. Its difficult to drive down during rush hour. 
	Alok Todi, AJC Bose Road. 
	State buses on routes S-26, S-28, S-30 and C-9 (Calcutta Tramways Corporation) have long been withdrawn from the Bakultala and Sarsuna areas. Now, commuters have to change at least two vehicles to reach Kankurgachhi or Ultadanga. 
	Chandan Ray, Sarsuna.

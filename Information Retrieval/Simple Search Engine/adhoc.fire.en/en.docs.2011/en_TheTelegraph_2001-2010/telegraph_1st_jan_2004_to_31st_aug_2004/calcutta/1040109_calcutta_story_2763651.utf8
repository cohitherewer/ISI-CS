 Friday, January 09, 2004  Stench of burnt-out business
 The minister blames traders for flouting  safety norms, but on the blaze-ravaged streets of Burrabazar,  theres panic, despair and restiveness, finds Devadeep  Purohit 73, JL Bajaj Street,  in the heart of Burrabazar, up in flames. Traders have  yet to tot up their losses. Picture by Pabitra Das  It was business as usual on JL  Bajaj Street on a weekday evening. Except for a few dejected  faces amidst a heap of burnt Benarasis and an inescapable  pungent smell. They bore the now-familiar signs of yet another  blaze, in the heart of the citys business district, that  had broken out the previous night. A middle-aged man was staring  at the burnt saris  carefully piled up in a corner to allow  smooth flow of pedestrians on the 10-ft-wide street  while  sipping tea from an earthen cup in the January cold. Lost  in a reverie of scorched dreams, it was left to a loud ring  tone to bring him back to the busiest of Burrabazar streets,  behind the gurdwara on MG Road. We have lost everything. Yes,  we have insurance, but  Subroto Mazumdar choked into his  karlo duniya mutthi mein mobile. But for now, the  lone thing in his grasp seems to be a deep despair. Life in tinderbox zone in the  citys trade hub walks the razors edge between hope and  hopelessness, diamonds and devastation. Dilapidated buildings  ablaze, goods worth lakhs going up in flames, traders left  clutching at consolations, families left groping in the  dark  the scenes have become common in Burrabazar. The panic in shops and homes of  the area after three major fires (see box) is palpable.  Take Laxmi Textile Corporation, on the third floor of 73  JL Bajaj Street, gutted in a fire that broke out around  9 pm on Monday night. While eight other shops in the building  escaped the flames, Ma Manasa Sarees, on the second floor,  and the Punjab National Bank branch on the ground floor  suffered both fire and water damages. Mazumdar, one of the owners of  Laxmi Textile, surrounded by his friends and relatives,  was making an attempt to assess the extent of his loss.  I dont know how the building caught fire, but it ruined  us. We want to resume business as soon as possible, but  we dont know when we can, mumbled the resident of Howrah. Over the past year, Burrabazar  has witnessed a number of fires, including the major ones  at Satyanarayan Park and the Ludhiana Building, both bang  in the middle of densely-populated residential areas. While  traders at the underground Satyanarayan Park are back in  business, Ludhiana Building, once the capital of woollen  trade in eastern India, is a forbidding shadow of its past. But what makes this Burrabazar  belt such a peril point? Ask state fire services minister  Pratim Chatterjee and he spews flames: Flouting safety  norms is rampant in Burrabazar. Besides, the buildings are  in poor shape and the traders dont even disclose that they  are dealing in combustible materials. More surprisingly,  they set up shops and godowns in residential buildings,  which remain unreported. At 73, JL Bajaj Street, there  was no residential section. But 4, Ramjidas Jethia Lane,  off MG Road, where a fire broke out on Tuesday morning,  was the address of around 20 families, who had to be whisked  away to nearby buildings. Known as the nucleus of the thriving  bidi industry in eastern India, the street has over  150 shops and godowns dealing in bidi leaves and  tobacco. And all this just a hosepipe blast  away from 171A, M.G. Road  the most visible symbol of a  business address gone bust because of a blaze. According to minister Chatterjee,  the source of fire that broke out on 4, Ramjidas Jethia  Lane on Tuesday morning was a warehouse, owned by Nilkantha  Brothers, loaded with bidi leaves and tobacco. We  are hiring an agency that will divide the city into zones  and check the possible fire hazards in commercial and residential  complexes. We will be strict with violators and penalise  them, he promised. But that is later. For now, theres  nothing but the stench of burnt-out business. This is the  centre of bidi trade and manufacturers from various  places come here to procure raw materials. With the entire  stock going up in flames, the loss will be enormous And  it will take some time for the market to normalise. Till  then, all of us will have to bear the losses, said Ramesh  Sakaria, a trader in bidi leaves with a shop next  to Nilkantha Brothers. With investigating agencies drawing  a blank on what caused the Ludhiana Building fire, conspiracy  theories are spreading like wildfire in Burrabazar. And,  in the absence of any visible corrective measures from the  authorities, residents in the locality are understandably  restive. Most of these buildings are old  and the rents are low and thats why the owners have no  interest in spending on maintenance. Besides, there is always  the lure of building a new market complex and reaping profits  which can explain the spurt in the fires, said a nameless  trader, voicing a common fear and pointing to Ludhiana Building,  where no repair work has started even a year after the blaze. The twin fires were nothing but  accidental, stressed Sakaria, who is also a member of the  Federation of Bidi Leaves and Tobacco Merchants. But the  need for preventive measures to check similar incidents  in the future is an immediate need, he added. Hiring the agency is a step towards  that. We cant conduct checks due to shortage of manpower,  but with the help of the agency, we will be able to single  out the possible sources of fire and act before the incident  takes place, stressed fire minister Chatterjee. Assessment of buildings will not  be enough to ensure the safety of residents, pointed out  Anand Joshi. From creating underground water reservoirs  for fire-fighting (promised after every blaze) to raising  awareness on combustible material; evicting unauthorised  hawkers from the pavements to regular scrutiny of electrical  wires spiralling out of the buildings  the wish list drawn  up by residents like Joshi is long but logical. Non-availability of water, narrow  lanes and clogged footpaths make fire-fighting difficult  here. Its a miracle that lives havent been lost in recent  months, but a human tragedy is just waiting to happen, unless  this is treated as a real emergency, was the warning from  victims.

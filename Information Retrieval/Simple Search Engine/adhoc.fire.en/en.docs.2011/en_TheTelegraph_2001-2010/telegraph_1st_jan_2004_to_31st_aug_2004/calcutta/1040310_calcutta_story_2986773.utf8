	Feng Shui 
	Pinky KapoorQ : My child is studying in a boarding school and I want him to do well in his final exams. Can I do something in the house that will help him in his studies there or is Feng Shui only effective if it is done in his immediate environment? Please advise. 																								Anita Saksena, Jharkhand																								A: Even when children live away and study in boarding schools, the Feng Shui of their rooms at home plays an important role in determining the quality of the academic luck they enjoy. So it is worthwhile investing some time in arranging their rooms according to Feng Shui. For example, paint the room in their favourable colours, place their photos in the western part of their rooms and keep their study area in the north-east. Keep a globe in the north-east along with an image of a god or a goddess to bless them with academic success. Symbolically, when writing pens are kept in the western side of the table, it helps them to be expressive and creative during exams. In fact, when you arrange the room in such a way, your childs energy will automatically get connected with it and will start working wonders for him. It would be even better if these changes are also incorporated at the place he is staying.Q: I have recently bought a new house that faces a church. I now realise that it is inauspicious to live in a house where the main gate faces the church entrance. It is not possible for me to sell this house and look for a new one again. Please suggest some effective remedies so that we keep living in our new house.																								Amarnath Agarwal, Calcutta																								A: It is usually not recommended to live in houses that face religious buildings. This is because the energy here is very yin and cool, and this causes an imbalance with the yang and warm energy prevailing in the house. The best solution is to relocate the main gate and take it to the other side of the building away from the church. Alternatively, you can erect a tall wall or plant tall trees that demarcate your house from the church. If the external environment is less than beneficial, you can still capitalise on the positive aspects of your home by choosing suitable rooms for different activities. Choose the best rooms for yourself, preferably in the south-west and for children in the east. Fresh green plants placed on the stairs help in the flow of energy from one floor to the otherQ: I have recently started a new business connected with metal furniture but somehow do not get bulk orders from my clients. Something or the other goes wrong in the last minute and my deals do not materialise. This leaves me disheartened and discouraged. Can you please help me so that my orders get through without any hiccups?																								Sumit Chatterjee, Calcutta																								A: You must enhance each and every sector of the office so that no obstruction comes in the way of your business. Start by sitting in the south-west sector facing your first best direction. Next keep the order books in the south-east corner that will help attract orders and generate wealth. Ensure that your stocks are kept in the north-west sector of the office. You will be amazed to see how they move out. This part of the office room must contain the contact list of your big buyers and clients along with the picture of an angel. By keeping a water feature in the northern sector of the office, you will see continuous movement in the business. There will never be any stagnancy.Q: I have a duplex flat where the living and dining room along with the kitchen are on the level floor and all the bedrooms are on the upper floor. My stairs are quite bare and I feel that the two floors are completely segregated from each other. Please let me know how this part of the house can be decorated so that it becomes livelier.																								Sunita Mahajan, Calcutta																								A: Plants play a very significant role in Feng Shui. Apart from being decorative, they have life in them and also generate their personal flow of energy. Healthy fresh green plants are yang in nature and have the power to bring life to any quiet corner. When placed on the stairs, they work like channels that help the energy to flow smoothly from one floor to the other. They help avoid stagnation of energy, especially in the corners where it tends to accumulate. Pictures or paintings that depict movement help the energy to further move upwards and downwards. These features will help keep both the floors well-connected and the upper floor will not be devoid of the life-giving energy. As the bedrooms are on the upper floor, it is vital that there is a generous flow of chi here to nourish the residents.

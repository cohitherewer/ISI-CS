																								Evil deeds beget evil consequences. This is the theme of Natayarangas historical play, Shahjahan, which deals with the last few years of this Mughal Emperors reign. The play brings to the fore the political waywardness of power hungry individuals which, in its all consuming desire for power, even stifles the voice of conscience. It opens with Shahjahan reminiscing over his own treachery during the time when Jehangir, his father, ruled. He tries to prevent his son Aurangzeb from unleashing a reign of terror and infidelity, but in vain. Directed by Swapan Sengupta and edited by Surajit Banerjee, this play, with Gautam Halder, Surajit Bandopadhyay and Bijoylakshmi Barman comprising the cast, enables us to gain a philosophical vision into the fact that we all have to pay for our sins in the end.																								Event: Play in Bengali, D.L. Roys Shahjahan, produced by Natyaranga																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Girish Mancha

																								Mati. A word whose very mention brings to the mind the familiar association of the soil and its essential simplicity. It is therefore only befitting that an exhibition on terracotta sculptures be named after that selfsame soil that is the cradle of its origin. Mati is the name of an exhibition that showcases the terracotta sculptures of Shyamal Roy and Thakurananda Pal, both of whom have carved formidable spaces for themselves in the world of terracotta sculpting. Roys works are marked with a disarming simplicity that lends a strongly individualistic note to his artful creations. His terracotta pieces steer clear of political innuendos and are lyrical reflections of the artists interpretation of man and nature. Pal (a picture of his work appears above) on the other hand is more realistically inclined and his creations are marked by a subtle playfulness while casting a relatively pragmatic reference to visual images captured from the everyday world. Mati is a tribute to that soil which has borne the ideas that have taken shape in the form of terracotta pieces in the handiwork of Roy and Pal.																								Event: Mati  an exhibition of terracotta sculptures.																								When: Till May 15 (except Sunday); 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

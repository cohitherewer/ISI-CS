 Thursday, July 29, 2004  Nostalgia nook  SANGITA S. GUHA ROY, 
					HIMIKA CHAUDHURI June cosying up in Archies gallery.															Yet another shutter went up at City Centre recently, with Archies opening its 42nd company-owned store. Apart from the usual greetings and gift items, it fits right in with its surroundings. Its proximity to INOX is justified, with stuffed Spiderman dolls spinning an enticing web.																					For old-timers like actress June, however, the nostalgia of a card is still the biggest draw. The greetings bring back memories of all my past crushes and affairs, gushed June at the inauguration. I used to buy loads of these for all my boyfriends, she smiled. On this occasion, though, she picked up a birthday card for her father. Its one good thing Ive done today. Dads birthday is just round the corner.																					ebrating its silver jubilee this year, Archies is planning to add yet more lustre to its repertoire. Leading the rack revamp will be Oyzterbay jewellery, Funskool toys, premium perfumes in the range of Rs 800 to Rs 3,000 that will include celeb scents like J.Lo and Amitabh Bachchan and a lot of imported knick-knacks.																					We are pitching the City Centre outlet as our flagship store in the city, said executive director, Archies, Vijayant Chhabra.																					agging off a series of freebie fun, Spiderman posters and postcard prize are to be given away to shoppers. Friendship Day freaks stand to gain free Cadburys chocolates and Excel video CDs on the purchase of goodies worth Rs 150 and above. In a bid to catch them even younger, the store has tied up with Disney and is soon to unveil a whole new toy story. Model Nicola dazzles in a Durgay ensemble.

Ace astrologer Bejan Daruwalla was in town for an interactive session with the winners of a contest conducted by Airtel. 																					led Airtel 121 with Bejan, the contest required the customers to call the live astrology service on Airtel at 616 and answer a question about the astrologer. The lucky winners were given an opportunity to put a question each to Daruwalla at ITC Sonar Bangla. 																					June, however, didnt have to ask any questions, as all her queries were answered without her asking. While Daruwalla forecasted that the period from September to December 2004 would be particularly good for her career, for some real good luck on the professional front she might have to wait till 2006. 																					The grand old man of Indian astrology might be well into his seventies, but you know that age hasnt taken a toll on his memory when he rattles off the birthdays and zodiacs of some of the countrys biggest heroes  be it in sports, politics or films. Manmohan Singh is a Libran like some of our countrys greatest leaders including Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri. He will change the face of India, but I feel he should be a little careful till August 2005, he predicted, adding, The 21st century will see a lot of women coming to power, particularly in India. 																					e Daruwalla will happily oblige you with predictions on any subject, talk of cricket gets him really excited. Sachin Tendulkar will be in peak form for the next couple of years, he forecasted. 																					e the ongoing Asia Cup doesnt really excite him, he is more concerned about the bigger battle  the ICC Trophy in September  where he feels India has a very good chance of winning.																																														Ethnic chic																					After a dose of heavy ethnic wear, Durgay, an eight-year-old boutique at Beckbagan, has decided to go casual. A new collection of saris in crepe and georgette and salwar suits in large floral prints and solids are the latest additions here.																					Pick up six yards of kotah in summer shades and block prints for Rs 400, or a dressy evening gown with large floral prints on a bright base with sequin work for Rs 1,500. For special occasions, light Benarasis with intricate embroidery on the anchal are flying off the racks at Rs 2,000.																					Stitched and semi-stitched salwar suits are mostly in georgette with interesting prints and hand embroidery. The dressier short kurtas with heavy sequin and bead work come for Rs 1,000 and above.																					The core competence of the shop, however, is its original ethnic line, stressed designer Vibha Jain. Our lehngas, which range from Rs 30,000 to a few lakhs, are our biggest hits, said Vibha. Each piece incorporates as many as five different fabrics and various kinds of embroidery. An interesting feature of the lehngas is that instead of dupattas, saris form part of the ensemble, the idea being that the bride can use the drape after she has stopped wearing the lehnga. June Tomkyns plays hair inspector at Ice Skating Rink. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Tress talk																					Wednesday afternoon saw ladies letting their hair down at the unlikely venue of Ice Skating Rink. The party in question was a beautiful hair contest, part of Temptations 2004 exhibition-cum-sale organised by Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta. 																					A row of Rapunzels made a beeline to get their hair inspected by beautician June Tomkyns who gave them a shine certificate or some stern tress talk depending on the condition of the hair. Dryness, split-ends, unconditioned hair, use of incompatible shampoo were the chinks in the armour Tomkyns looked out for. Long, thick hair doesnt necessarily earn you a mane merit. What matters is the quality of hair, said Tomkyns. The bounce bonus, sponsored by Tomkyns herself, included free hair streaking, hair spa treatment and shampoo with blow drying at her eponymous Ballygunge Circular Road parlour. 																					The not-so-lucky ones went back to the business of browsing with a toss and a turn at the meet that saw city designers and small-scale entrepreneurs display their wares in a glittering array. Designer wear, accessories, gift items, rakhis (the festival being round the corner) and a host of lifestyle products vied for attention at the exhibition on till tomorrow. 																					The proceeds of the annual show go to charity. We concentrate on educational programmes that benefit the poor in the city suburbs, said Mamata Agarwal, founder member of the all-womens club.

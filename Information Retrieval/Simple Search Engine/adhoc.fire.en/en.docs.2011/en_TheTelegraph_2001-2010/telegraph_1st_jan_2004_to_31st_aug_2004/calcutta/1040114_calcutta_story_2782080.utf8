The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 14, 2004  Calcutta Column
 
	That the PSUs cannot compete with their counterparts in  the private sector has once again been proved in case of  the CellOne mobile phone service of BSNL. I subscribed to  the network on January 6, and on making the payment, the  SIM card was issued and post-paid connection given in the  afternoon. But an SMS sent to Hyderabad did not reach. STD  facilities are not available even after a week despite complying  with all the formalities. Lodging a complaint at the help  desk was useless.  
	Namita Bhattacharya, Salt Lake.  
	A makeshift temple is coming up on the platform of Lake  Gardens station, on Sealdah South section, encroaching on  seats for commuters, just below the flyover. Some action  needs to be taken.  
	Chameli Pal, Batanagar.  
	Can someone correct the spelling of Writers Buildings  in the new roadsign at the Race Course end of the flyover? 
	Name and address not given.

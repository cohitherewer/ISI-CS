The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Alarm bell on foreign universities 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Tuesday asked the universities in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal to upgrade their courses to check the drain of students to foreign universities operating across the country.																								There is no denying that the competition will be tough for universities here and in other parts of the country, following the developments relating to the World Trade Organisation, said P.N. Rajsekharan Pillai, UGC vice-chairman. On a days visit to the city in connection with a seminar at Calcutta University on the challenges posed by foreign universities, Pillai said there was no law to prevent a foreign university from setting up shop in any part of the city. The local universities will have to take appropriate measures, by way of modern courses, quality control and increased competitiveness, to counter the threat, he said.																								The UGCs investigation has revealed that a section of foreign universities is trying to rope in students by offering low-quality courses. The unsuspecting student will not know that such courses are low in quality, and are not even taught in the countries where the universities are located, Pillai said.

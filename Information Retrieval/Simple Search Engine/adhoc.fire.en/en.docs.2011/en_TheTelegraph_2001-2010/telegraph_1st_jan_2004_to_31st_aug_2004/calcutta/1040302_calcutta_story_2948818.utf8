 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Sewage swim for slum area
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Hundreds of residents, mostly of Shibpurs Chora bustee in Howrah, are exposed to severe health hazards as the entire pocket has been under knee-deep drain water for more than a week.																								The reason: the underground drains are choked by the debris of part of the concrete wall that collapsed recently.																								This stretch of the drain  one of the main outlets of southern Howrah  carries a few gallons of waste every day.																								Its hell, complained local resident Sultana Begum. Children are falling ill. The stinking water flows into our homes each time a vehicle passes by, added neighbour Lakshman Sharma. 																								They feared an outbreak of enteric diseases if immediate steps were not taken to drain out the accumulated water.																								Howrahs mayor Gopal Mukherjee admitted that the area was waterlogged but denied the cause was the collapse of the underground sewerage wall. 																								I have asked municipal officials to find out the actual reason, he said.																								A special jet machine has been deployed to pump out the filthy water, he said, elaborating on the measures already taken. 																								Residents, however, maintained that a part of the inner wall of the underground drain had collapsed and rendered the sewerage system defunct.

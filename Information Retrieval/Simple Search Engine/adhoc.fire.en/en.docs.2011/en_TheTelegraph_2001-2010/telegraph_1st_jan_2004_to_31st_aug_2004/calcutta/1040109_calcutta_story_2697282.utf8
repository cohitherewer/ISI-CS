 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 A home in bloom, where alphabets heal

Pictures by Anja Damm 																								Biukhya is sitting patiently at her sewing machine, face aglow. Her work is yet to begin, but shes rattling away enthusiastically, in anticipation of her supervisor.																								Biukhya is a patient at St Thomas Home, where each woman has a sad story to tell. All are united by ailment, suffering multiple sclerosis (abnormal hardening of soft tissues) and tuberculosis. All come from families without the means for medical treatment.																								But on Howrahs Belilious Road, 21 patients have found new hope, a new home, new company, and since December, a new opportunity  education. Three times daily, the patients turn students. Two hours each morning are spent learning to read and write. They are also taught sewing techniques.																								I am so happy about this new opportunity for the patients, says St Thomas Home director Monika Naik. Most of the girls stay here at least six months before they recover enough to leave. And lying in bed is not ideal for the healing process, she adds, explaining what prompted them to bring tables, chairs and a blackboard into the sheltered verandah.																								The home was founded 27 years ago by philanthropist Joan Evans, who now lives in London. But the work she began goes on. Since May 1996, Naik has been at St Thomas with her husband and two school-going sons.																								Most of the children were brought to St Thomas by their parents from the Howrah South Point Charitable Dispensary or the government TB clinic for a free check-up. Each receives a package of medicines for six months therapy. Three times a week, they visit a nearby doctor.																								Some former patients keep dropping by. But Sumitra Pramanik has gone nowhere for quite some time. This 25-year-old lost two children at birth. Then, one survived but after her birth, Sumitra contracted tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis, and was reduced to crawling on all fours. Her husband abandoned her and her health deteriorated.																								While Sumitra received medical attention at St Thomas, her four-year-old daughter was taken in by a hostel. Sumitra is now undergoing physiotherapy and is able to walk with crutches and corset. She smiles at the thought of returning home with her daughter. But that is easier thought than done.																								It is nice to see them smiling, says Naik. But they remain people without money, clothes, belongings or hope. They have nowhere to go.																								And so, work at St Thomas keeps piling up. A new rooftop accommodation for up to 25 patients is being planned and new sewing machines are being brought in.

																								Cutting paper into fragments and creating exquisite designs with them is an ancient art form, perhaps as old as the invention of paper itself. This art form originated and flourished in China where paper was invented. Hua Yang, as the paper cuttings/collages are known in China, is still very popular and practised by a wide cross-section of society. The designs are used to decorate dresses, caps, bags, shoes, lanterns and other functional items. In Japan, this art form is known as Kirigami and used as embellishments on hand fans, walls, door posts and screens. In the West, too, this art form is very popular. Trina Lahiri (picture here) is a talented artist who specialises in paper cuttings. Recipient of a number of national and international awards, Lahiri is currently holding her third solo exhibition of paper cuttings titled, Abar Kati Snati. She uses a small knife (nick-cutter) some gum and lots of paper, and with these she creates magic. Her creations include both intricate motifs and scenes from rural India. She even touches on contemporary social issues. She experiments constantly with forms and styles in her unique manner.																								When: Till February 5; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Gaganendra Pradarshasala

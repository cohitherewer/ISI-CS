 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 The boumas day out
																								Have you ever wondered how women are given a raw deal in not having a single day in the cultural calendar dedicated to them, unlike men, who receive great pampering and attention from their womenfolk on occasions like Bhai-phonta, Rakhi and Jamai-sasthi? If so, then here is some good news for the wives! Trincas, one of Calcuttas premier restaurants, hosts Boumashtami, an event specially devoted to the boumas (daughters-in-law) of the city. The occasion will provide food for thought, in addition to some fun and humour, through a session of stimulating adda and discussion based on the portrayal of women in television serials today. Taking part in Boumashtami will be a number of Calcuttans who have distinguished themselves in various fields  Moon Moon Sen, Chaiti Ghosal, Churni Ganguli, Rita and Kishore Bhimani, Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdev, Indrani and Shankarlal Bhattacharya, Chaitali Dasgupta, Anindita Sarbadhikari, Nandita Raja, among others.																								Event: Luncheon event dedicated to daughters-in-law																								When: Today; 1 pm onwards 																								Where: Trincas, Park Street

Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								A fair wind blows on the fairways for the aged and the cardiac conscious.																								Even as the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) gears up to make the entire city part of its 175th anniversary celebrations, Tollygunge Club, across the road, has chipped in with two unique stops to break barriers in a sport that boasts the fastest growing enthusiast base in town.																								On Friday, it was a swinging first for the senior citizens. Grandparents Golfing Hungama, a one-day event organised by Tollygunge Club and sponsored by Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Ltd, saw around 70 participants, aged between 60 and 78, wielding their irons.																								Saturday will see BM Birla Heart Research Centre organise Golf for Good Health on the same greens, in association with Tiger Sports Management (TSM). Governor Viren J. Shah, who played nine holes at the seniors meet, will tee off Saturdays field as well.																								The idea behind this event (the grandparents golf) is to both popularise the sport and bring together a group of people with a yen for golf. Such a tournament is being held for the first time in the eastern region and probably in the whole country, says A.K. Chowdhuri, managing member (golf), Tollygunge Club.																								The setting is comfortable for the uninitiated, as the players are of similar calibre, smiles Vijai Singh, one of the organising members of the Hungama.																								The Golf for Good Health tournament, to be played in a stableford format, has already received more than 120 registrations from amateur golfers, including doctors and corporate captains. There are six categories of prizes, plus a putting contest for non-golfers.																								Sport of any sort keeps a person physically fit and is instrumental in reducing work-related stress and bad blood cholesterol, thereby reducing the incidence of coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke and peripheral vascular diseases. Golf has the added advantage that one can carry on with it till late in life, points out Amit De, administrator, BM Birla Heart Research Centre.																								Brandon DSouza, president of TSM, agrees: Golf is meant for all age groups from all walks of life and has its unique positives. Its a walk with nature, a tremendous stress-buster. Besides, being a morning sport, it inculcates the habit of going to bed early. An increasing number of Calcuttans are realising that the serene golfing greens are a better retreat than smoke-filled bars and crowded discotheques.																								DSouza, who heads the core committee planning Royals 175-year celebrations, sees tournaments of this nature having a stupendous impact on golf in Calcutta. The focus seems to be on reaching out to a larger audience, and that can only augur well for the city, he declares.

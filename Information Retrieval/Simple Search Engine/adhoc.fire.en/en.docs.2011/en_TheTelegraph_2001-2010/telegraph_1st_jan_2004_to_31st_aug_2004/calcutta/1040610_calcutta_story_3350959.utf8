The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Setting their sights on the east
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 The cup that cheers: Sourav Ganguly and Sanath Jayasuriya share the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. This years tournament features in a major way in SET Discoverys programming. 																								On the verge of launching a new kids channel, SET Discovery is looking at the eastern market for considerable growth.																								We have great expectations from Animax, said SET Discovery president Shantonu Aditya on his trip to Calcutta on Saturday for the Max Q Factor quiz and a gala distributors bash that featured Kapil Dev, Mandira Bedi (both Max brand ambassadors) and a host of MTV VJs.																								Animax, Japans leading childrens channel featuring the best of anime (a la Pokemon), makes its Indian debut on July 5 (with a special launch in Calcutta in the first week itself). It has a phenomenal fan following in Japan and the rest of Asia, and we plan to make India no exception, reveals Aditya. The target for the channel would be the 5-24 age group. The programmes would all be 2D animation initially, including the popular Astro Boy, and later move to include 3D animation programmes. The buzz is that pace bowler Irfan Pathan has been roped in for promoting the channel.																								The acquisition, according to Aditya, is in keeping with SETs plans of having the best of brands. SET Discovery currently has 10 channels, including SET Max, HBO, NDTV and Discovery Channel, and plans to add on more channels this year.																								Aditya also sees the strong growth in the east continuing, particularly with new markets opening up. Calcutta has always been a very strong market for us, still growing at the rate of 15-20 per cent, but its smaller markets like Guwahati, Patna, Ranchi and Bhubaneswar that we are particularly focussing on now. Some of the tools being used to make inroads into these markets include rural schemes and decoder-box promotions for cable operators.																								Calcutta is the third-largest market for SET Discovery, after Delhi and Mumbai. Promotions for Nick (the new avatar of Nickelodeon that the bouquet recently acquired along with MTV) by Saif Ali Khan, would also cover the city in a big way.																								The channel acquisitions, exclusive live content and distributor incentives, SET Discovery hopes, would add up to that magical number one slot that doesnt seem a distant dream anymore. 																								In several places were already a close number two to STAR, claims Aditya, but within this year, were confident of becoming the number one bouquet in revenues, subscriber base, quality of programming and customer support.																								Soaps like Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin on Sony and lots of cricket on MAX --- beaming the 12-nation ICC Champions Trophy in September and the Holland Cup featuring India, Pakistan and Australia in August  should cover the programming front.																								Growth in Calcutta and elsewhere has boosted the overall growth prospects of SET Discovery, a joint venture between Sony Entertainment Television and Discovery Communications. The company grew by 10 times in the last four years and is targeting 30 per cent growth this financial year.																								The imminent broadband revolution would also throw up new avenues for the company, but last mile connectivity will be the challenge, feels Aditya. 																								The proposal for SET Discoverys move to Zees direct-to-home platform is also being considered, he said.

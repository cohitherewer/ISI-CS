 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 A permanent forum for folk arts
 India has a very rich heritage of tribal and folk arts that dates back to thousands of years. Artists have been practising and preserving their arts for generations, but lack of patronage has led many of them to discard their profession and take up other modes of livelihood. Gallery Kanishkas aims to popularise and preserve folk and tribal arts and provide a platform to rural artists to showcase their creations. Its inaugural show, Mithila Utsav, features folk paintings from Mithila, Bihar, popularly known as Madhubani paintings. The festival collates the works of immensely gifted artists from Darbhanga district, led by its passionate crusader Krishna Kumar Kashyap. Kashyap has been working tirelessly among the Dalits by his innovative literacy programmes, using Mithila art forms and helping in their social and economic uplift. The creations of Kashyap, himself a talented artist, are also on display. Besides Madubani paintings, the exhibition showcases needlecraft or sujni work by Kailash Prasad Singh, papier mache art by Subhadra Devi and sikki grass handcrafted items by Gauri Shankar Thakur. Also, paintings by Vijay Kumar Jha are on view.																								When: Till January 31; 10.30 am - 8 pm																								Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindustan Road

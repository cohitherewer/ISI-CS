The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Repoll in advance of results
 A STAFF REPORTER																								All eyes are on the results of 42 parliamentary seats in Bengal, to be declared on Thursday, but theres work to be done before that.																								Nine booths  including six under the Calcutta Northeast constituency and one in Diamond Harbour  go in for a re-poll, as per the Election Commissions directives.																								Polling will be conducted between 7 am and 5 pm. Counting begins from 8 am in 39 constituencies, while for the three constituencies under which nine booths go in for repolling, counting begins from 2 pm.																								Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee announced on Wednesday that there would also be repolling in two booths under the Murshidabad constituency, along with booth 71 under Diamond Harbour, booths 135 and 51 to 55 under Calcutta Northeast.																								On the day of the elections, bombs had been hurled in some pockets of the Calcutta Northeast constituency. 																								In Beleghata, voters were forced to beat a retreat, disrupting the electoral process.																								Banerjee, however, refused to elaborate on the reasons why the commission had ordered a re-poll. It is being held on the basis of observers reports. So I cannot comment, he said. 																								Banerjee said special observer Afzal Amanullah had asked him why the central forces were not very visible on the city streets on May 10, when Bengal went to the polls.																								I asked the deputy commissioner (headquarters) to explain the situation to me. What he told me was satisfactory, added Banerjee.																								Nearly 300 people were arrested in the city and 100 motorcycles seized on Monday.

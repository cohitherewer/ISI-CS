 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 PICK of the week Sweet and sour
Pick of the Week Douglas da Silva hands a girl a lollipop at Candy Treats on Monday, and a can of goodies (below). Picture by Rashbehari Das If you thought only creatures of the night cherished red-eyed skulls, vampire dentures, innards of a stomach and snakes turned to jelly, check out the little tykes slurping them up at Candy Treats on the ground floor of Forum.This candy is as good on the tongue as it is to look at. Jelly Beans, Yellow Bellies, Crocodiles, Mini Teeth Fangs, Red Lips, Spiders, Piranhas, Candy Watches, Candy Necklaces, Ice Cream Cones, Fried Egg, ABC Letters, Fizzy Cola Bottles, Strawberry amp; Cream are a few of the sweet and sour options that come in the form of chocolates, gummies and jellies.Stocking over 150 kinds of candies and chocolates in a variety of shapes, the store has been doing brisk business since it opened shop at the Elgin Road mall last August. Boasting imported brands from Europe like Ashbury, Hancocks and Kingsway, the brand has already made inroads in other malls like Emami Shopping Complex and Pantaloons in both Gariahat and Camac Street, as well as in Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, Amritsar, Chandigarh and Jaipur.We hope to have 50 shops by the end of this year in the form of kiosks and boutiques, says Manjari Tibrewal of the Calcutta-based Candy Treats.It may be a little steeply priced at Rs 60 for 100 gm of candies, but there is no stopping the kids, who cant get enough of the orange, lemon, strawberry, black currant, coconut and mint flavours.Customised gift packs and the concept of pick-and-mix are other attractive features, with the customers having the freedom to choose as many varieties as they want in a single bag. There are sugar-free varieties as well for diabetics.

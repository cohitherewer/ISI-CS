The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 Air crew Eliza to AIR Prof Higgins 
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Indian Airlines hostesses at the voice culture course being conducted by All India Radio. A Telegraph picture																								Nomoshkar. Welcome aboard Indian Airlines Airbus 320 IC 263 to Delhi.																								The next time you hear the familiar announcement on an Indian Airlines (IA) flight, the voice could well be more confident, the words more audible and the modulation more soothing.																								Under pressure from private players in tune with the times, the nations public sector carrier is getting its crew voice-trained by the voice that rules the national airwaves  All India Radio (AIR).																								As part of a nationwide exercise, Akashvani Bhavan is holding a voice culture course  from how to pronounce the vowels to how not to let a crisis show  for the cabin crew of IA across the country. Tuesday marked the start of the three-day workshop at AIR, Calcutta.																								There were mistakes in the pronunciation of the in-flight personnel. The IA human resources development head had approached us in Delhi to train cabin crew for announcements in English and Bengali. As we have 80 years of expertise in training our own personnel, we readily agreed, explained Hari Charan Verma, director, Staff Training Institute (Programme), who has flown down with the rest of the faculty.																								The course aims to make the crew aware of the technicality of voice  pitch, volume, tempo, phonetics and the like, added Ashim Kumar Rej, station director, AIR Calcutta.																								The ground-floor studio of the Eden Gardens address is the fourth venue for such a workshop, after Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai. Having conducted the morning session, in which the participants were encouraged to overcome inhibitions and speak up, Verma concluded that the problem areas for Calcutta were poor Hindi and bad pronunciation of vowels.																								So, in the post-lunch session, on musicality of speech, Verma, a specialist in Hindustani music, took up the Aas, ees and uus. The 15 airhostesses, all of them with more than 10 years of flying experience in their service book, were soon intoning their Ohhhms with Verma running a personalised sound check.																								Forget the message you have to pass on to the pilot, stop worrying about the open cabin door, keep the count of lunch packets out of your mind when you make the announcements. For that one minute, you should be totally focussed on what you are saying and how, Verma urged his students. 																								Yoga exercises to improve and preserve voices were also in Tuesdays syllabus. 																								The airhostesses seemed to take in everything with enthusiasm. We may have the experience, but if this training makes us better announcers, why should we not be interested? argued Ruma Ghosh.																								Most passengers hardly listen to us. They may do so if we can make the announcements more interesting, added Dolon Acharya.																								We feel the difference between us and the young crop that is joining the airline now. They have received specialised training from professionals. The training we had when we joined was not so intensive, pointed out Latika Barua, with 24 flying years behind her.																								The course will also teach stress control. Even if the plane is on fire, there should be no panic in the cabin crews voice, said Brijmohan Gupta, deputy director (training), Staff Training Institute, who will conduct that module.																								Or, even during minor exigencies, like shortage of vegetarian lunch packets, the participants added, with a laugh.

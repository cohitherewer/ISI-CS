				 	SHARAD MALHOTRA																									Sharad Malhotra																									Is this 21-year-old. Hes been in the glamour industry only for a couple of years, but Sharad has already got his face on several billboards. Expressions greeting cards to PC Chandra jewellers, Allen Solly to Vedic Village, the first-year B.Com student has an impressive kitty.																									He might have been, if not for his exams. Although he was shortlisted for the contest this year, the St Xaviers College student gave up his dream for the sake of studies. Although Sharad admits academics is not his forte, hes determined to finish graduation first. He has already tasted crowning glory though  at the group dance events in inter-school fests.																									Is what the first runners up in Face of the Year 2001 at Saturday Club and Knight of Nights 2002 at DI Club deserves. But not just for modelling. Learning an entire script for a telefilm in a language he doesnt speak  eight long hours in one night  and doing a good job of playing his part was no mean feat. But then, no pain, no gain is his motto. Shodh is now complete, and will be screened on a private Bengali channel next month. 																									Is what the Shah Rukh Khan fan hopes to be, some day. But hes in no hurry and headed in the right direction, with his first national advertisement, for National Insurance, ready for release. No stranger to acting is the Capricorn, being a member of Kala Manthan Academy. The latest feather in his cap was playing Devdas in a Hindi stage version of the Sarat Chandra novel. English theatre is now on his to-do list.																									Is the dictum Sharad lives by. Hes no stranger to hard work, having balanced a budding sports career and school. The under-16 and under-19 champ played football and cricket for inter-school and other contests. Also played state-level matches, including Cricket Association of Bengal tournaments. Not to mention his penchant for squash and swimming. And although sports doesnt quite fit into his hectic schedule these days, Sharad is conscientious about staying in shape through regular workouts.

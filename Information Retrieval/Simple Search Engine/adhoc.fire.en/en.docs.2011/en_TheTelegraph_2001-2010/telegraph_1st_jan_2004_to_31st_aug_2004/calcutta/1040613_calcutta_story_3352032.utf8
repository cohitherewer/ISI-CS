adLIB / Shiloo ChattopadhyayIf they dont want to be kept away, doctors need to use their personality to boost credibilityLet me start this week with a naughty joke. There was this man who lived in an apartment building. His next-door neighbour was a doctor who had a very pretty and, well, adventurous wife. One day, our man woke up to find that he was feeling feverish and worse, he had almost lost his voice. Still in his night suit, he rang his next-door neighbours bell. The door was opened with the safety chain on. The doctors wife peeped through the gap in the door. Seeing her, our man asked, in his now hoarse voice: Is the doctor in? An equally husky voice replied from the other side of the door: No, please come in.Doctor jokes are not rare  but the characters are inevitably foreigners. Maybe the awe we have for our doctors inhibits. Does it? Do we still put doctors on a pedestal? Today, the associations with doctors are unflattering  lack of care and concern, cuts from diagnostic clinics or commissions from nursing homes.Doctors on the other hand are peeved. They feel that for every case of negligence that is reported in the media, there are at least 10, if not 100, other cases where the doctors have gone out of their way to cure a patient or alleviate his agony. Add to that the long hours and loss of normal family life.There sure is a problem. If we can easily accept that a travel agent earns commission for sending you to a particular hotel, why do we crib about the doctors commission for sending you to a nursing home?Perhaps the crucial difference is elsewhere. It is you who choose to go on a holiday; you decide on the hotel. When you are ill, the doctor decides on your behalf. And there lies your worry  did I have to be sent to a nursing home? Was the nursing home really the best choice or was it the most paying for the doctor?In short, we do not trust his decision. We do not trust his ethical standards or professionalism. Trust, ethics, professionalism: these are perceptions.Doctors are trained to deal with the ultimate human reality  death. Curing perceptions  which are often notorious for bypassing reality  is not their strong suit. Perhaps time for change has come.Doctors are not totally unacquainted with the world of advertising. Directly or indirectly they have often lent helping hands to brand advertising. Toothpaste (remember the Colgate white coat), over-the-counter medicines like analgesics or cough syrups (did you see the Dcold ad where the pretty wife tells the doctor that her experience is as good as his trained diagnosis?), even milk food drinks like Horlicks and Complan, have liberally used the doctor image in their advertising. Use of doctors in these ads underscores their popular image  a source of trust, an assurance of do good.It is this very image that is under threat. Doctors may now need to bolster their own credibility. Image correction has to be done differently  they themselves have to be their own ads. Their personality and demeanour will be the crucial image carriers.

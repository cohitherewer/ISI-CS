The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The high and the low coexist in Dalhousie  Square. For neglect has worked as the great leveller, reports  Soumitra Das The military secretariat at 6 Esplanade East  The british tried to keep the  bedlam of the black town in abeyance by creating an illusion  of orderliness in central Calcutta. However, as was often  the case, the hordes would surge past the barriers as they  marched from Wellington Square threatening to overrun Government  House itself. Dalhousie Square had been witness to the swadeshi  movement in its most violent manifestation, and also trade  union movements like the tram workers strike in the late  Forties and the bank strike called thereafter. The ugly face of unionism was  revealed in those early post-Independence years. Smriti  Mitra was witness to it. Mitra is one of the first Bengali  women to break into what was essentially an Anglo-Indian  bastion. She was a telephone operator who had worked at  8 Hare Street (Telephone House) at the beginning of her  career and had seen Telephone Bhavan come up. Widowed and 73 now, I met Mitra  in her small house in Park Circus that she shares with her  family. Born across the border, she was one of nine sisters  and came to Calcutta in 1938. In 1949, when she joined Calcutta  Telephones, she used to live with her sisters family,  her sister and brother-in-law being the legendary Tripti  and Sambhu Mitra, respectively. She remembers how she never lost  her nerve at the interview though she could barely speak  English and did not have her quot;refugee card quot; either  to prove that she was dispossessed. She remembers taking  the tram, night shifts and the ghostly gaslights of Dalhousie.  We had to wear our hair in a bun because of the headsets.  The Park telephone exchange had sofas and some Anglo Indian  girls would scream at us: Get up miss. But I would shout  back: If you can sit I can also sit. Fortunately, our  superintendent Miss Macdonald appreciated efficiency, says  Mitra breaking into giggles. She also remembers with anger  how during the strike in the Sixties, unionists heckled  the harmless Anglo-Indian girls and had actually urinated  on a man on the verge of retirement whose only crime was  that he refused to join the strike. Calcuttas black and white  divide during colonial rule becomes clear as a picture from  the balcony of Arun Lalls flat on the top floor of Esplanade  Mansion, known as Ezra Mansion after the Jewish family that  owned it till the LIC took over. The overlooking Maidan  resembles thickly wooded rolling parkland, a luxury north  Calcutta never enjoyed. With its panoply of balconies, the  mansion has the air of a great prima donna, though, of late,  the blooming pink paint gives it the look of a giant wedding  cake. The military secretariat at 6,  Esplanade East just a block away, looks dour and stony-faced  in comparison in spite of the swags and rows of female heads.  Constructed in 1904, it houses several government offices  and is also the newspapers reading room of the National  Library. Lall, whose father was head honcho  of three big companies in Dalhousie and has lived in that  flat since birth for 50 years, says he was struck by the  tremendous amount of marble, gilded mirrors, walnut wood  panelling in lifts and the Burma teak wainscoting in three  successive offices of his father. It was his first exposure to sophisticated  office equipment like the teleprinter on which written  messages would come from another end of the world, time  zones notwithstanding. Lall was also taken in by the opulent  attires of the staff and the masses of American cars. That  was up to his teens when Indira Gandhi put a stop to a stylish  lifestyle. Gas lamps used to light the roads  till the Sixties when Queen Elizabeth dropped by and ugly  angular tube lights were installed. Now the yellow lights  are back with halogen lamps. Another vivid memory is that of  protest marches up to the east-facing gate of Raj Bhavan.  Very often the police were outnumbered and they used to  resort to teargas. We retreated the moment we heard gunfire.  Our eyes used to smart. Police used to hammer the demonstrators.  Today it is relatively quiet. Lall, himself a tea man,  speaks with relish about the street food of Dalhousie, but  despairingly about the nightmare of vehicular and human  traffic. What Lall never mentioned is that it is a nightmare  for pedestrians with the unstoppable rush of buses, cars  and other lumbering vehicles for which road laws do not  exist.  So, where is the real Dalhousie  Square of today  in the boardrooms of mercantile houses,  in the corporate-look banks, in the sprawling weed-infested  grounds of St Johns Church, or among the lawyers in rusty  black at Bankshal court, whom artist Ranen Ayan Datta had  sketched for his famous ad campaign, the streetfood-sellers  who commute from the districts, or among the cogs in the  wheel, the formidable workforce of officepara,  as this heritage zone is called? My quest for Dalhousie Square  took me, among other settings, to the waiting room of a  fashionable orthodontist in Waterloo Street, the posh apartment  in Queens Park of an ex-chief of the CESC and Andrew Yule,  the stuffy drawing room of an ex-secretary in Beniapukur,  and the spartan living quarters in Kansaripara of Parameswaran  Thankappan Nair, better known as an walking encyclopaedia  on anything Calcuttan, whom I woke up long after he had  retired. As in the rest of Calcutta, high  and low life coexist in Dalhousie Square today, rarely treading  on each others corns. For neglect has taken down the  nose-in-the-air types a peg or two. At Maxims in the semi-deserted  Great Eastern Hotel, that used to be a hot nightspot, the  gigantic mirrors reflect the dark walls. A notice hanging  outside the hotel entrance reads: Everything here is normal  as was on 19 Nov 1840. We survive to serve you.  Newmans is meant for cut-price  sari and garment sales. Books, with which it was once synonymous,  have taken a back seat quite literally. The building housing  the showroom of Cuthbertson amp; Harper, saddlers since  1837, seems afflicted by a virulent form of dermatitis. A little further down I came upon  a marble plaque: Federico Peliti  importer of English,  French and Italian provisions. Fancy presents and wine merchants.  I knew that this fancy restaurant, where the office crowd  used to lunch, was opposite the Raj Bhavan but had no idea  that it looked so shabby now. The woodwork of the verandah  is falling to pieces. Even Hamiltons, jeweller of royalty,  has turned into a grubby bank, its walls announcing the  availability of holiday homes. In the evening, Old Court House  Street is even more forlorn in spite of the clogged roads  and pavements choked with thousands of people waiting for  buses that never seem to come to take them back home. The  darkness hides their desperation. Is that how the empire  has struck back?

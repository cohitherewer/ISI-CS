				 	VARUN OBEROI																									Varun Oberoi																									Is this 21-year-old. The tennis champ has played for school and college, at the state and national levels. Modesty makes him admit that he wouldnt continue it professionally, but would love to be a college coach instead. 																									Is the name of the game. Learning the skills of the sport since age eight  first at the YWCA and then Calcutta South Club  might have given him an edge. Playing tennis up to 15 hours a week  off-season  however, has honed his talents. The Cancerian can often be found racquet in hand for up to 25 hours a week during the gaming season.																									The fourth-year student of the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) might not be, although he has done his bit, taking part in a river clean-up project and tutoring first-year students in his subjects of choice  computers and applied mathematics. But the double major student is definitely the captain of the college tennis team.																									Was Guddu, on and off the court. To keep himself occupied, the ex-Don Bosco Park Circus student took part in inter-school fests, in events like medley and short plays. The Boris Becker fan spent most of his time on court though, in under-16 and under-18 national tournaments. Steered his school tennis team to the third position once, in his four-year inter-school career. 																									Is Varun, with awards like most valuable player for three years and Arthur Ashe All American Award in college. Over 25 winning matches later, hes a top player in the singles and doubles circuit in college. The Arthur Ashe Sports Scholar 2002 is also an assistant in the sports department at NJIT.																									Is he, from sun-glasses salesman to a caller in a university department. A memorable job was being the only under-graduate student in a physics department research programme in college. Varun also assisted in a research project for the maths department. In future, he would like to turn his love of computers and maths into an MBA.

On Thursday, a day after it monkeyed around the buildings near South Point School, the primate entered a flat and started smashing things. Officials from the forest department who came to cage him finally had to give up. When it turned up on Wednesday we offered food  and so did others  hoping it would go away. But it didnt. Instead, in the morning, it started barging into the flats, said Subha Mukherjee, one of the flat owners. The harried residents first turned to cops and then to forest department officials. Towards the afternoon, when a team arrived with a huge cage, the monkey refused to budge. After several attempts, the officials left saying the only way out was to use sedatives but that would require special permission.

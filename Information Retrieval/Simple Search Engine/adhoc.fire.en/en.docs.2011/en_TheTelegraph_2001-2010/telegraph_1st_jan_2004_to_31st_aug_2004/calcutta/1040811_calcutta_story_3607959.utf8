 															- CULTURAL TRANSLATIONS TO HARNESS RICHNESS OF MIGRATORY WRITING A STAFF REPORTER				 	 (From right) Susheila Nasta, David Dabydeen, Amit Chaudhuri and moderator Sanjukta Dasgupta at the discussion. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								His great great great grandfather had been forced by the British to migrate from Calcutta to the cane plantations in the West Indies. A hundred and fifty years later, the British have invited him back to Calcutta to talk about migratory writing.																								Its ironical and funny, observed David Dabydeen, professor at the Centre for British Comparative Cultural Studies at the University of Warwick. The Guyanese author, with five novels, three collections of poetry and several works of non-fiction and criticism to his credit, was at the British Council on Monday for Questioning Borders, a discussion on hostile divisions, migratory writing and cultural translations. 																								I always thought Tagore was a Malayalee, said Mini Krishnan, translations editor with Oxford University Press. She had been christened Mini by her mother, from the little girl in Kabuliwalah. She used to narrate Tagores stories to me in Malayalam. It was only in the seventh standard that I read a piece on Tagore myself and found out that my mothers Tagore had been translated from Bengali. 																								Krishnan realised the potential of regional languages  she calls them national  and has now made it her lifes mission to get as many as possible translated into English so that people across cultural divides get to sample each others literature. I believe cultural translation, is the only way to harness the inherent richness of migratory writing, she stressed.																								For Susheila Nasta, editor of Wasafiri  Swahili for cultural traveller  a literary magazine concerned with post-colonial and new writers, every small journey, even from the village to town, is migration. A reader at Open University, Milton Keynes, Nasta believes Calcutta is a case in point. Post-Partition, the city is a melting pot of migratory cultures and traditions. Besides, there is mind migration too, thanks to the media. 																								Calcutta, hometown of fourth panellist Amit Chaudhuri, is at a pivotal point for cultural translations as part of inescapable cyberspatial globalisation. So, the right mix on the literary platter would be a mindset that loses all sense of tradition, language and geography. 																								Dabydeens new book, to start in Calcutta, where he is tracing the roots of his family to 1855, promises to have all this.

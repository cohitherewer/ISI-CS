		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 		 Banibrata BasuBanibrata Basu								Joint commissioner, traffic, Calcutta Police																																							The blanket flyover tax proposal has several benefits over the toll system in operation at Vidyasagar Setu. The toll collection system is manual, which makes it prone to lapses. If an annual tax is collected, it ensures 100 per cent collection. Moreover, it saves on manpower. The flyovers are situated at key intersections and vehicles cannot escape crossing them every now and then. Compared to the Rs 10 charge for crossing Vidyasagar Setu every time, the one-time tax of Rs 500 for using all the flyovers is also cheaper.

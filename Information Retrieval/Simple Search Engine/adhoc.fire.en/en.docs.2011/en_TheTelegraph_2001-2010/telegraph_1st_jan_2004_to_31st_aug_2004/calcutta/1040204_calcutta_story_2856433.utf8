					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Chef de cuisine Alex  Bignotti with Italian dishes from The Hub and (below)  Tiramisu  an all-time favourite from the same restaurant															Theres a lot more to Italian food than just pizzas and pastas. And to celebrate this, The Hub at The Taj Bengal has turned into a full-fledged Italian eatery, with chef de cuisine Alex Bignotti and executive chef Surinder Singh, at the helm of things. 																					Twenty-six-year-old Alex is an Italian who started cooking from the age of 10. What followed was an impressive stint with star hotels in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Oman and England, following which, for the first time ever, he has brought his expertise and culinary skills to the City of Joy. As The Hub turns into a round-the-clock Italian eatery, Alex, armed with 17 years of experience, promises to redefine the tastes of food lovers. He believes that the Italian kitchen is changing and there is an emphasis on light, low-fat cuisine. The Hub will, therefore, offer Italian cuisine rich in herbs and healthy sauces. And to go with it, a variety of Italian wines that could give French wines a run for their money. 																					Foodies who head for The Hub will be amazed by the sheer variety of Italian delights on offer. While appetisers include home-made Tuna Fish Bresaola with Grano Podano and extra virgin olive oil and Naples Mozarella, such soups as Porcini Mushroom Cappuccino with Pan-seared Chicken and Clear Minestrone Soup with Pesto Croutons are sure to have many takers. The chef has also come up with a range of sandwiches and burgers seeped in the flavours of Italy and these include Salmon Bagel and Black Forest Ham Panino. The Hub is also the place where you dig into a variety of pizzas. 																					For vegetarians, theres loads lined up right from Cajun Spiced Vegetable with Italian Salad to Charred Balsamic Vegetables with extra virgin olive oil. Meat and fish specialities include roasted Beckti Fillet with black olives, potatoes and pine nuts and Steak Tenderloin with porcini mushroom and baby spinach, and to complement these dishes, the wines suggested are Chianto Classico Riserva and Antinori Galestro Toscana. To round off an Italian meal, theres no way you can do without the Tiramisu with bitter coffee sauce and Classic Sicilian Cassata with caramel sauce.

The establishment, fronted by poet and social activist Rita Basu, recently organised its very first major show  Roopkatha  in the central courtyard of Swabhumi, where a number of well-known names from the citys literary circles descended on the heritage plaza for over four hours of music and entertainment. 																					Post an inaugural address by Rita Basu on the aims and objectives of Adda Shanibar, the programme kicked off with a rousing rendition of Atulprasadi songs, Nazrulgeeti and Rabindrasangeet by the Indian Choir Academy conducted by Arun Bose, which was much appreciated by the gathering. 																					Music over, it was on to theatrics and here, the Swayam Theatre Group impressed with a hard-hitting satire on the dowry system penned by Malini Bhat																					tacharya. The play, Meye Diley Sajiye, which highlighted the plight of women in society, was followed by a prize-distribution ceremony, where awards for their contribution in the fields of dance, poetry, music and drama were handed out to noted Bharatnatyam exponent and chief guest Thankamani Kutti, poet Kesto Chattopadhyay, musician Arun Bose and playwright Jayati Basu. The Umadevi Smriti Award  Ankursmarak  instituted to honour those showing exceptional promise in cultural fields, was awarded to young poet Debojyoti Mukhopadhyay. Rounding off the show was a poetry session, where Rita Basu, Papri Gangopadhyay, Krishna Basu, Brata Chakraborty and Kesto Chattopadhyay among others, participated with much enthusiasm.

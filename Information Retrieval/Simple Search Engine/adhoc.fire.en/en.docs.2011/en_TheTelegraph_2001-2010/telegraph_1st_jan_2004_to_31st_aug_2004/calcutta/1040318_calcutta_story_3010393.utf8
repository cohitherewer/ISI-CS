 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Varsity union puts its men in vacant posts
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Left unions intervention in the selection of candidates for 14 vacancies in the non-teaching staff category at Netaji Subhas Open University has left nearly 600 others, who had appeared for the interview three years ago, wondering what happened.																								An advertisement in dailies in January 2000 for the vacant posts elicited 3,000 applications. Each of us had to pay Rs 100 to buy the form and then, the eligible candidates were informed by post to appear for the examination on December 3 the same year, said Rabindra Sarkar (name changed on request), one of the aspiring candidates.																								Sarkar had applied for a junior assistants post. Five months later, I was told that I had made it to the interview and appeared for it on July 30.																								With the selection procedure complete by mid-2001, the candidates were told they would be informed by the end of the same year. But that was not to be. The staff union affiliated to the Forward Bloc intervened and allegedly stopped then vice-chancellor Radharaman Chakraborty from recruiting the successful candidates for the posts.																								The posts needed to be filled urgently as the university was expanding. So, people allegedly backed by the union were recruited. 																								Soon after vice-chancellor Chakraborty was transferred, Surabhi Banerjee took over. In the next six months, with the introduction of 16 courses, the names forwarded by the staff union were employed on a temporary basis by a committee, headed by vice-chancellor Banerjee, university officials alleged.																								When contacted by Metro, registrar Dipak Roy refused comment. I am not supposed to say anything on this matter, as it relates to the internal procedures of the university, Roy said. 																								Vice-chancellor Banerjee could not be spoken to as she was out of station.																								The increasing workload had prompted us to advertise for the posts  one accountant, two assistants, six junior assistants, two clerks, two peons and a stenographer, a university official explained.																								As soon as the notice was published, however, representatives of the union forced us to recruit their men and the selection procedure turned out to be a farce, he alleged. 																								A Calcutta University official, who refused to be named, said that if the selection procedure goes awry, the university authorities should see to it that the applicants are handed back the amount paid with the application. Usually, the amount is non-refundable. But in this case, the sum is Rs 3 lakh or more. As none of the candidates were recruited, they should be returned the deposit, the official said.

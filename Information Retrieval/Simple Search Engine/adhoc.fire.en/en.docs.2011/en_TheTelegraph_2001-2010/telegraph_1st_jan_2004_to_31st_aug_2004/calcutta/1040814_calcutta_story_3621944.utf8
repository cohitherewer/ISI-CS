The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 14, 2004  Top gear to dress up dudesHimika Chaudhuri, Zeeshan Jawed(From top): Model Neeraj sports a Medhavini outfit; new recipes from The Hub; shoppers check out rakhis on display at Ice Skating Rink. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 															She is all of 22 years old, but Medhavini Khaitan has already got her designs right. Indeed, not only has this young Wigan and Leigh graduate got her cuts and styles in place, she has also zeroed in on a face of fashion that is as yet almost untouched in Calcutta  mens clubwear line. 																					Everytime I went out for an evening do, I would have to look really hard to catch a glimpse of a well-dressed man, laughs Medhavini sitting in her Queens Park residence and studio. She made the smart move to cash in on the as yet untapped area, starting off with uppers for men. A line of party shirts in cotton and linen is what she has to offer as of now in muted shades like white, peach, sea-blue, cream as also the classic colour black. Embroidery, hand-painting, kantha and patch work are the embellishments she chooses to work with. She has also experimented with floral prints but is not too sure if the still conservative Calcutta will actually go for it. 																					Here are a few tips on dressing up from her stable: A range of striped cotton shirts in combinations of browns and blues are just right for the man whos just beginning to go the trendy way. For the more adventurous, red polka dots or kantha work on a white shirt, or a patchwork shirt with floral embroidery could be possible picks. She also knows to jazz up a good party. Priced at Rs 900 and above, her range of short and normal length shirts are a good addition to the almost non-existent mens partywear line in the city. 																					Medhavini hopes to put her finger more firmly on the male pulse (or on their generous girlfriends) with a two-day exhibition at the store Hugli starting August 15. 																																														Risotto roster																					Whenever Italian chef Bignotti at The Hub, The Taj, is tired of his pizzas and pastas, foodies get a treat. Its a new menu at the coffee shop yet again.																					Risotto with porcini mushroom and truffle oil, whole green pastas with fresh green potatoes, rack of lamb with cheese polenta and wild mushroom ragout are some of the highlights. 																					Pizza lovers have a lot more varieties to bite into as well. For the veggies theres Fungshi with assorted mushrooms and tomatoes. Mozzarella and fresh herbs, Caprino with goat cheese, mozzarella and oregano are a few other options. 																					As usual, non-vegetarians have a lot more exciting options in Marinara with a topping of prawns, bekti, smoked salmon tomatoes and mozzarella; Prosciuttocrudo with ham, tomatoes, mozzarella and fresh basil flavouring and the like. 																					We have a niche clientele which drops by at least twice a month. So we keep changing our menu frequently to avoid repetitions, said the chef. 																					But if you think the chefs loyalty to his clientele translates into compromising on the authentic taste to pamper local tastes, prepare to be surprised. 																					I want everyone to have a taste of authentic Italian cuisine. Italians prefer light food and the use of spices is sparse, stressed Bignotti, who hails from the city of Milan. 																					Most dishes are priced between Rs 245 and Rs 345, while soups start at Rs 195.																																														Oh brother!																					With rakhi round the corner, shopping has again taken more than usual priority among a large section of Calcuttans. With gifts to be given, new clothes to be bought and houses to be done up for the occasion, the Rakhi Festival sale at the Ice Skating Rink is proving to be a big hit. 																					With everything from rakhis to modular kitchens selling under one roof, the rush is indeed maddening. Handicrafts from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are a big draw with women falling over themselves to buy mina-work jewellery boxes and colourful dupattas from the Rajasthan stall and dozens of glass bangles from the jewellers of Benaras showcasing their ware at the exhibition. Jewellery and clothes displayed come a close second, if the crowd outside these stalls is anything to go by.

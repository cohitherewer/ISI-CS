The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 City top-notch in eating-out culture
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcuttans are eating out more than anybody else in the country  and thats almost 50 per cent more than those in Bangalore, the second-ranked city on the gastronomic totem pole.																								A survey of restaurants across the country, conducted by the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI), reveals that almost 2.6 lakh people in Calcutta eat out more than once a week. Bangalore is a distant second with 1.75 lakh, followed by gourmands in Greater Mumbai and Delhi.																								Out of a total of 165 restaurants that responded to the survey, 90 responses were generated mainly from cities like Calcutta, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. The study said more than 80 per cent of the respondents felt that the culture of eating out has increased over the past three years and multi-cuisine restaurants serving Indian, Chinese and continental fare are all the rage when it comes to favourite menu themes.																								Pole position for Calcutta is not surprising, because cover prices are still the friendliest here, feels S.K. Khullar, immediate past president, FHRAI, and proprietor of Amber, a perennial favourite in the heart of the city. For Nitin Kohli, director, Grain of Salt, the boom has been on slow-fire boil over the past four-five years, with working couples and nuclear families being major drivers.																								Calcutta took off late and hence, the business curve here is still on the rise. With newer options and stricter benchmarks, the bar is being raised every day, and I dont feel the euphoria will plateau off in the next two-three years, says Kohli. His multi-cuisine restaurant at 22 Camac Street does over 750 covers on weekends, and has recently launched an all-new Oriental spread to cater to latent demand.																								Bar-B-Qs Rajiv Kothari agrees the eclectic mix of eateries sprouting all over town has tickled the tastebuds of the youth. Earlier, there were only a handful of options. Now, there are so many places to choose from, offering such amazing variety. But the bottomline is still value for money and in Calcutta, good food matters more than snazzy dcor, he observes. Kothari agrees with Khullar that children constitute a major component of the growth engine in Calcutta. At One Step Up, (the latest offering from the Bar-B-Q stable), we often see kids leading on elders for a hearty meal, which is a refreshing sign.																								Mainland China, on Gurusaday Road, which can claim a pioneering role in kicking off the fine-dining revolution south of Park Street, also lays store by moneys worth to stay in flavour. Traditionally, Bengalis are never loath to spending on good food. Most of our exotic dishes of lobster and crab are lapped up by the quintessential Bengali and its much the same at Oh! Calcutta (the groups Calcutta cuisine outlet in Forum), says a spokesperson.																								According to the FHRAI survey, restaurants located in commercial markets are the biggest draws, with almost half of the respondents preferring to go there to grab a bite, and 26 per cent choosing restaurants located within hotel premises. The study also underlined an increasing palate preference for vegetarian fare and a sharp drop in the consumption of red meat.

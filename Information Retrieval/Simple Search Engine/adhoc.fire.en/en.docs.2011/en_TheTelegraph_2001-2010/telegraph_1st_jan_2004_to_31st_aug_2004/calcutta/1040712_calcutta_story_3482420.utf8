 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Club on grabbed land ordered demolished
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Local toughs and political strongmen, who have forcibly set up clubs on vacant government or private land, beware. 																								Recently, the hearing officer of the building department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ordered the demolition of a club, as well as a canteen, on a private plot in Southend Garden, in Garia. 																								Local youths had grabbed the 102-cottah plot over two decades ago and used portions of it to play football and run a cricket coaching camp. Subsequently, they set up a club  Sabuj Dal  and constructed a two-storeyed building and a canteen there. 																								During the hearing, the secretary of the club could not produce any legal document to prove either ownership of the land or the club building. 																								Hence, the building structure constructed for clubhouse and canteen have to be demolished, the order of the hearing officer said.																								The hearing officer asked the CMC authorities to demolish the club without notice if Sabuj Dal members did not do it on their own within a fortnight from receipt of the order.																								Sabuj Dal secretary Satadal Chowdhury said: We have received the order on June 17. We have made an appeal to the building tribunal. 																								Director-general of building Ashoke Roy Chowdhury said he was not aware of such an appeal. The file relating to the demolition order is still with me. I have no alternative but to demolish the structure. We expect to carry out the order this week, he added.																								 Officials in the CMC said that if the demolition was successfully carried out, it would set an example of how such illegal clubs can be dealt with.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said in many parts of the city and its neighbourhood, strongmen backed by local leaders of the ruling party had taken over a number of vacant plots and had set up clubs. Civic estate department officers said over 25,000 cottahs, particularly on the eastern fringe of the city, Behala, Jadavpur, Santoshpur, Garia, Kasba, Tiljala and Beleghata have been taken over forcibly for construction of clubs.

 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 One sons blow kills, other son suffers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He starts his journey from Dhantola, a remote pocket in Nadia district, at 6 am and reaches the city around 10 am. 																								He spends the day in front of the morgue at Nilratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital and goes back home on a suburban train from Sealdah at 6 pm.																								For 26-year-old Swapan Mandal, this has been a daily routine since March 18. Every day, he comes to the morgue to collect his fathers body, who was allegedly murdered by Swapans elder brother. 																								But the absence of a one-line requisition slip means that the body must lie unclaimed.																								Police here plead helplessness. The body cant be handed over to Swapan until he produces a requisition slip from Nadia police. We have conveyed this to our counterparts in Nadia twice, but there has been no feedback from them. We have ordered a post-mortem and decided to preserve the body, said A. B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge, Entally police station.																								Swapans father, Nakul Mandal, 60, was brought to NRS on March 17 with serious head injuries. He died the next day.																								Nakul told police that the injury had been caused by a blow to his head, delivered by elder son Haradhan. The moment Nakul died, his statement turned into a dying declaration, which we conveyed to Nadia police, said an officer.																								Swapan confirmed that Haradhan had hit his father on the head with a lathi, following an altercation. 																								My brother got married a few months ago, for which he borrowed money from the local money-lenders. My father, a small farmer, was upset over this, said Swapan, adding that Haradhan was absconding.																								On March 18, Swapan went to Entally police station seeking permission to take his fathers body back home. 																								He was told to collect a requisition slip from Dhantola police station. But Dhantola thana refused to do so and claimed that as no complaint had been lodged, a case could not be started.																								My family members wait every day for me to return with the mortal remains of my father. I dont know how long this will go on, said Swapan.

 															- BROAD PICTURE OF THE PARSIS  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Richly-embroidered saris on display at the Parzor show to mark 3,000 years of Zoroastrian culture. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Five Parsis died in Calcutta last week. Such a mortality rate is quite high for a once-sizeable and thriving community that is dwindling at an alarming rate. Many Parsis have settled abroad and even today, they marry outside their community at the risk of being excommunicated. 																								The Unesco declared 2003-04 as the 3,000th anniversary of Zoroastrian culture, and to celebrate the occasion, the Delhi-based organisation Parzor (Parsee Zoroastrian) organised a two-day travelling exhibition that ended on Sunday.																								The exhibition was a collection of some wonderful photographs, artefacts, documents and very rich textiles, along with a film show that gave a broad picture of the community that loses 10 per cent of its population every decennial census. 																								Many of the photographs, dating from the first half of 20th Century, were from the Parzor Foundation for Preservation of Vulnerable Human Heritage. 																								The black-and-whites, occasionally quaint, showed Parsis in cities like Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Multan. The women may have worn saris but they were draped empire-style. There was a scene from Hamlet staged in Bombay, reminding us of the glory days of Parsi theatre. There was a Parsi gent in a kimono at a tea ceremony. 																								Zoroastrianism is said to be the worlds oldest revealed religion and it emphasises the sacredness of every element of nature. Rituals such as Yashna and Jashan demonstrate this environmental consciousness of the religion, as is demonstrated in the short film Asha that was screened. 																								The rituals and the implements used in them were shown in many of the photographs on display. They reveal how through years of acculturation, many of the rituals and the implements used are similar to the ones quite common in India, where they have lived for generations ever since they arrived in Navasari.																								Of the photographs, an entire section was on the General Sam Maneckshaw, the hero of the liberation of Bangladesh, now in his nineties. It recorded his illustrious career from early youth up to ripe old age. One wished there was a section on the contribution of this community to the arts and business, although there was an original Madan Theatre document. 																								There was a wealth of colour photographs of Zoroastrian priests from all over the country. It was touching to see these solitary old men who tried to keep the flames of tradition alive. We were also reminded of the Parsis in the court of the Hyderabad Nizams.																								The biggest attraction was the fascinating collection of richly-embroidered saris, slippers and garments, all 100 years old. Inspired by the Chinese, this was a feast for the eyes.

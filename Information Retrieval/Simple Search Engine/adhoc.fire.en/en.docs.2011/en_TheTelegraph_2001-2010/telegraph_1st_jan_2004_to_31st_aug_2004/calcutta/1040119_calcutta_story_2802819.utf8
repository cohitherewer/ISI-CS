The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 19, 2004  An ode to art  Piu Sarkar with  Russi Mody at the opening of her new studio  Pius  Passion  at the Hyatt Regency				 															The Hyatt Regency, Calcutta is all set to encourage upcoming talent in the field of art. And to mark the beginning of this new venture, an art gallery called Pius Passion was opened recently on the lobby level of the hotel. Russi Mody, who flew down to grace the occasion admired Piu Sarkars paintings even as the artist, resplendent in a black and gold sari, looked visibly excited showing off her work to the select gathering.																																																				Using charcoal and acrylics, Piu has given full flight to her imagination and from peacocks with multiple eyes to such abstract themes as meditation, the paintings, priced anywhere between Rs 7,500 to Rs 30,000, have it all. Russi Mody, who purchased the artists Ganesha painting for Rs 8,000, remarked that Piu was indeed a gifted artist and advised her to spend more and more time and effort on her paintings.																																																				Pius Passion is just the beginning of what Praveen Chawla, general manager, Hyatt Regency, Calcutta calls an effort to associate ourselves with art and culture which is an integral part of the city we are in. So, while the gallery will serve as Pius work studio, she will soon display her works all over the property. And not just that, the Hyatt Regency also has plans to hold regular workshops on art to make its presence felt in cultural circles of the city, where upcoming artists will be promoted instead of already established names. Street food vendors  outside the ongoing Rasta Fare festival at the Atrium  Caf				 															Street-side story 																																																				The next time you drop in at the Atrium, dont be taken aback if an enterprising rickshawallah greets you at the entrance or a ballonwallah lures your kids with his colourful wares. Instead, just brace yourself to be floored by more, for these are but a few of the many delightful surprises that the ongoing street food festival  Rasta Fare  at the caf has lined up just for you. On till January 26, this promotion celebrates what is by now a veritable institution in Calcutta, the mind-boggling variety of lip-smacking street food that flourishes in the many lanes and by-lanes of the city.																																																				With the walls of the Atriums waiting-area splattered with eye-catching graffiti, a paanwallah perched behind the coffee bar and a chana and balloonwallah circulating all over the place, the ambience of the caf is straight out of a typical Calcutta roadside, phuchkawallah dishing out shalpatar thongas, No Entry signs, waiters in tapori gear, et al. And all this, even before you take in the menu, presented in a conical thonga, that lists any number of delectable street items that never fail to send foodies into a tizzy.																																																				The good old phuckas, of course, top the list, which despite being served with a tamarind-mineral water combo are every bit as delicious as their rasta version, while running a close second are those other street staples  spicy-hot jhalmuri, aloo-kabli, thick kathi rolls, dal chilla and deep-fried moong dal pakodas with tangy lasoon and pudina chutney and the absolutely delicious golden jalebis dripping in syrup. Dont stop here though for theres plenty more where these came from  karaishutir kachuri and phulkopir singaras just the way grandma made them and chops, dimer devil, chicken kabiraji and chingri macher cutlets straight out of every college-goers memories, all topped by steaming bhars of masala chai.																																																				e the food ranks right up there, prices of course, cant quite match those on the streets. So while the choper jhuri will cost you about Rs 120 for an assortment of mixed vegetable, potato, brinjal and mocha croquettes, expect to fork out about Rs 275 for a basket of dimer devil and chingri macher cutlets.

The venue this time around was the lush green grounds of Nicco Park Bowlers Den where lip-smacking food apart, great music, scintillating performances and a host of celebrities came together for a roller-coaster ride of fun and excitement.

Central to all this was the blazing bonfire surrounded by pretty thatched-roof huts, where a variety of desserts (payesh, pitheys and pulis) were displayed, rustled up by the 10 best-recipe winners of a cooking contest organised earlier by the channel.																																																				With each item more delicious than the other, the panel of celebrity judges including film artistes Indrani Haldar, June Maliah, Lily Chakraborty,Dolon Roy and Krishna Kishore Mukherjee, singer Indranil Sen, painter Suvaprasanna and entrepreneur and producer Bipin Vohra had a tough, albeit enjoyable time deciding on the winners, though, finally it was the delectable Pithe Paturi, Khirer Patishapta and Chanar Dudhpuli that got the maximum votes. All the participants were presented with mementos while the winners got to take home attractive prizes.																																																				Those who missed the action at Bowlers Den, can catch it on Monday, February 2 at 2.30 pm when Alpha Bangla will be doing a repeat telecast.

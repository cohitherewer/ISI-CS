 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Sleuths put on cheat case
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								With the arrest of a quack in the Dasnagar area of Howrah on Sunday, on a charge of cheating working-class people to the tune of Rs 3 crore, district police chief Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya has ordered the enforcement branch to probe the matter. 																								The people duped by Shyamaprasad Hazra have claimed that he had accepted deposits from them individually, but we are still in the dark about the number of people he had cheated and the amount he had deprived them of, said Bhattacharya. 																								We have asked Hazras victims to deposit copies of their documents with the police so that we can calculate the actual figure, he added. The breakdown of the sums deposited by 1,200 people with Hazra was essential for investigation.																								I have asked the enforcement branch to investigate the matter, Bhattacharya added. 																								Inquiries revealed that Shyamaprasad Hazra, alias Ratan, a resident of Amta, in Howrah, was involved in financial rackets for more than 15 years. 																								His victims, mainly from the working class, were persuaded to deposit their savings in his chit fund. Later, he would disappear with the entire sum deposited. Police have seized Rs 24,000 in cash from his home in Amta.																								He is still in police custody and we are trying to extract more information from him, Bhattacharya added.																								Police could not find out from Hazra what he had done with money deposited by 1,200 people. He has mortgaged his home to a bank and his bank savings are nil, said police. 																								Hazras wife and daughter have been arrested on the same charges. Along with Hazra, they were involved in this chit fund. It was the job of his wife and daughter mainly to dupe the women, said a senior police official. Both are in judicial custody.																								Asked whether the operation of chit funds was on the rise throughout the city and the suburbs, and if unauthorised organisations, like clubs and a few companies were involved, Bhattacharya replied that until and unless public awareness increased, chit funds cannot be stopped. 																								The districts police officers complained that though the police brought culprits to book, they got away scot-free owing to procrastination by judicial staff.

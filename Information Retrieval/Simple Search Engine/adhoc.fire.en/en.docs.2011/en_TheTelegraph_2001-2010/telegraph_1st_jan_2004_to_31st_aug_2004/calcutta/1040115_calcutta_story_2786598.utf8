 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Jewellery shop trips doorstep dupe group
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Strangers at the doorstep claiming to be salespeople, frantic phone calls, a long chase on foot and a trip to the police station. It was all happening in Salt Lake on Wednesday afternoon, as a jewellery house, acting on customer complaints, tripped what appeared to be a dupe group.																								For the past few weeks, our customers in Salt Lake had been telling us how door-to-door salespeople had been calling on them, claiming to be representatives of Anjali Jewellers, says Ananya Chowdhury, owner of Anjali. But we sell out of our outlets only, not in homes.																								Worried about the queries pouring in, even from Behala, Chowdhury decided to insert an announcement in a local Salt Lake publication, warning customers against such salespeople claiming to be from Anjali. We provided a number, and told them to alert us when the so-called salespeople came calling.																								On Wednesday, the phone calls started flooding the Anjali outlets in HA and BE Blocks. Arindam Basu, manager at the HE Block store, received the crucial call.																								People kept calling to tell us the trio had come and gone. Finally, one gentleman called to say that the three had just left his house and gone to his neighbours. I told him to keep a lookout, and rushed there.																								Then began a chase, as Basu and his store assistant Ratan Haldar followed in the footsteps of the three across Salt Lake, down main roads and alleys, till the trio was stopped near EC market.																								When we asked them which company they were from, the answer was Om Shree Jewellers. But they couldnt produce any documents, not even cash memos or bill books, to back their claim. They then produced some cards from a marketing company, adds Basu.																								When the three  who Chowdhury says are from Andhra Pradesh  were taken to Salt Lake (North) police station, they claimed never to have used the name Anjali. But the customer who helped identify the miscreants insisted that they had used the words Anjali Jewellers.																								Officer-in-charge of Bidhannagar (North) police station Arup Roy detained the accused. A book of customers addresses was recovered from them.																								An officer from the police station visited the homes in Salt Lake and verified that the trio had sold jewellery to people in the name of Anjali Jewellers.

 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Dancing into the blue
																								As part of an endeavour to intensify the European-Indian cultural dialogue, Max Mueller Bhavan Calcutta is organising a series of programmes aimed at contributing towards setting culture in motion in the city. Into the Blue is a contemporary dance from Germany that has been incorporated into this culturally rich schedule. Using digital, incorporeal communication, Jan Pusch and his dancers constantly create a variety of different living spaces in which they can re-invent themselves and their environment. It is in the virtual world that the dream of surpassing the given restrictions of physical reality seems to have come true. It is this very creative space born out of the imagination that allows for an escape from the brutality of the real world. Presenting three different solos, Into the Blue reflects the future of the human body. With subtle interactions between video projections and the performers, consequences of an existence on the edges of the tangible and the intangible, the concrete and the abstract, between the body and the idea, are explored.																								Event: A contemporary dance performance by Jan Pusch Repertory from Germany 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

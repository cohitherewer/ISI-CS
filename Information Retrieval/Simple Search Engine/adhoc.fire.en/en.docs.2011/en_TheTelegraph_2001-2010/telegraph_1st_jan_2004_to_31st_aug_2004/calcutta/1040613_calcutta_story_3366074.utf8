The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 13, 2004 Life - Party HoppingMusic menu mix Party HoppingGone are the days when you grooved to the same old beat through the night. The business of partying these nights involves swaying to a different sound every hour or so.This is the fun formula: chill with lounge music (and a drink or two) to start off, warm up with some upbeat hip hop and R amp;B, hit a 120 bpm (beats-per-minute) high with chart-toppers and round off with some heady house and trance. With things getting this complex, night-long revellers would do well to go armed with the music menu. Heres a timeline to the tempo...Get in the moodWith lounge music, if an early start is imperative. Be it DJs Lloyd, Sethi or Pre-anjana at Tantra, DJ Harish at Dublin or DJ Girish at Sisha, its easy to relax with their brand of music (the resident bartenders complementing the act with heady concoctions). e Karunesh remains the gem of the genre owing to his trance tunes, African tracks like Tumba, packing in a range of soft-tempo percussion sounds, make for easy listening as well.ectronica doesnt do it for you, theres soft rock on offer at restobar Cloud 9, perfect to pack in an early dinner before getting into serious party mode. U2, Chris de Burgh, Lionel Ritchie, Tracy Chapman, Eagles and Doors are the choices resident DJ Sooraj swears by, while DJ Harish at Dublin sometimes alternates lounge with Eric Clapton, Paul Young and Rod Stewart during the evening.Kylie craze: The city cant have enough of her brigade (AFP)Warm upWith some hip hop and R amp;B henceforth with the likes of Tantra and Dublin dishing out a select repertoire, the most popular of them being Aisha by Outlandish, Superstar by Jamelia, Turn Me On by Kevin Little and Yeah by Usher. The scene at Cloud 9 at around 10 pm is still retro, the younger crowd preferring to start off with some disc hopping before moving on to resto and lounge bars. Sisha prefers to play it safe as well with a mix of Bollywood and Indipop on packed weekends, reserving club music for Wednesdays and Fridays when other hangouts in the city witness a leaner crowd.Shake a legWith some thumping chart-toppers as the DJs push the tempo post midnight, with faster tracks that span everything from Bollywood remixes, Indipop, western pop and, yes, some rock as well. If you thought youve heard those Enriques, Kylies, Bin Tere Sanams and Chhod Do Aanchals for the umpteenth time, catch the party animals groove to the heady mix like the sun wont come up. After all, familiarity breeds comfort on the dance floorRound offWith the latest house and trance tracks in the wee hours, when the DJs finally feel free to experi-ment with a range of electronically-induced sounds that pack in progressive house, funky house, tribal house, happy trance and techno. Tracks by Deepest Blue, Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyke, Sasha, Mark Knight, Benny Benassi, Sean Paul and bootleg versions of remixed Michael Jackson and Madonna are doing the rounds. But take care not to get hooked as before you can say encore, the DJs come up with yet newer sounds in this ephemeral genre.Sangita S. Guha RoyClowning around at Cloud 9Monkey businessThe licence to scare women out of their skin and have a good laugh over it. Indeed clowning around has never been more fun as it was at Cloud 9 on Friday night even as the restobar played host to a circus theme party. Being greeted by fire-eaters is not what the Calcutta party people are used to. They enjoyed the fiery encounters for sure, but hardly as much as the next trapping which proved to be the ultimate shocker.ourful statue of a clown at the entrance to the nightclub sprung to life, jumping towards a passing guest, fooled many and scared a few.The inside of the club was decorated with props from a circus though the freaky Friday crowd had its sights firmly set on the bar and ears glued to the sound of music.Neither the look of the place nor the going-ons made a real difference. But the show went on  the jokers juggled, a man did a balancing act with a football or four, and someone dressed like a monkey escorted women to the dance floor.Not that the ladies dressed in their spaghettis and slit skirts were game to monkey around on the dance floor, but it added to the circus spirit, nonetheless.The performers came and went, but those in the party zone were in no mood to call it a day well past witching hour.Camp champsThey are the serious party people of tomorrow. Wednesday evening was only a trial run for 30 of the 18-plus brigade that went for an early evening do to celebrate the successful completion of a month-long business awareness camp. Called Millennium Youth, this annual camp targeted at the crowd fresh out of college and school provides all-round personality development and general awareness for these budding entrepreneurs. After a day-long trip to Raichak earlier in the week, the round-off with a disco session sent both the fun and glam quotients of the camp soaring. Whats work without play; whats business without pleasure, summed up the gang high on enterprise and excitement. (Pictures by Rashbehari Das)Party PooperGuess who got a short fuse last weekend? Party-goers literally stopped in their tracks at Dublin when they suddenly realised there was no beat to groove to. Ladies and gentlemen, please bear with us for five more minutes, boomed a voice instead of the music. But it was past 2 am and disc-hoppers had no time to lose. Quite a handful trooped out to louder pastures leaving the console to fix its fuse in peace.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Blight hits flight light path
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								What comes first, the fog or the visibility tools to fight the fog? This is the chicken-and-egg problem plaguing the Dum Dum airport today. The flight schedule is not  the sole casualty of the dense fog enveloping the airport  these mornings.  The fog has forced the Airports  Authority of India (AAI) to switch off immediate plans for  Category II (CAT-II), the special lighting facility to help  aircraft land despite low visibility. THE OFFICIAL LINE: The  fog has disrupted flights and upset our plans. It should  take at least another 15-20 days before the skies clear  and we can hand over the runway to the company that will  carry out the CAT-II project, says airport director Rajendra  Pal. HOW BAD IS THE DISRUPTION?  Over the past few days, almost all morning flights have  been held up at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International  Airport due to dense fog, causing huge losses to the airlines  and the AAI. With every flight cancellation, an airline  incurs an estimated loss of Rs 1 lakh, officials add. Such  disruption can be minimised by CAT-II. WHAT IS CAT-II? The Rs  18-crore installation involves setting up bright lights  along the centre line of the runway (picture above),  making it easy for the pilots trying to touchdown in low  visibility. HOW LOW CAN THE VISIBILITY  GO? Once the CAT-II facility is in place, pilots can  land even if the visibility is just 350 metres. This, say  AAI officials, is good enough by Calcuttas weather conditions.  At present, a pilot cannot risk landing if the visibility  is less than 800 metres.																								But, Calcutta airport will do tomorrow what Delhi airport did yesterday. The Category III-A facility is in place at Indira Gandhi International Airport, allowing pilots to land with a visibility clearance of only 200 metres. HOW WILL CAT-II BE INSTALLED?  Once work starts, the main runway will remain inaccessible  from 10 am to 5 pm for six months. While the smaller flights  will take off from the secondary runway, the bigger flights  will be accommodated whenever the runway is free. WHOS CRYING FOR CAT-II?  Both the Indian Commercial Pilots Association and the Airlines  Operators Association have voiced concern over the CAT-II  hold-up and expressed fog fears of it not being ready next  winter, either. WHATS THE LAST WORD FROM THE  RUNWAY? Senior AAI officials confirm that once the weather  clears, work by PNC Constructions, Agra, will start in full  swing and the special runway lights will be aglow by next  winter. With CAT-II in place, flight delays and cancellations  will definitely come down next winter, they take off.

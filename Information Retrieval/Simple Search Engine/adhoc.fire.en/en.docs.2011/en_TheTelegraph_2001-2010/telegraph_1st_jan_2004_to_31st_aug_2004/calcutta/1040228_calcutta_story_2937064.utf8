 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Doctors cry strike over ESI arrears
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest representative body of doctors in Bengal, is on the warpath. The reason: the government is in no mood to comply with a recent high court directive to pay enhanced fees to all Employees State Insurance (ESI) doctors in the state.																								The plan of action includes a march to the Assembly, and then a statewide strike, according to IMA state branch secretary Moloy Patra. The situation needs urgent attention. Since the governments doing nothing, we have decided to agitate, said Patra.																								The government and the IMA have been at loggerheads over the fate of nearly 1,200 ESI doctors, who are not receiving salaries on time, despite huge grants received from the Centre. An ESI doctor would get Rs 60 per person for a total of 750 to 1,000 patients a year. But in 2003, the government conducted a review and brought out a fresh list of patients for ESI doctors. 																								The IMA has contested the figures. According to the government list, one ESI doctor has 150-odd patients assigned to him, while another has only 10 or 15, which is totally incorrect, Patra said. The IMA has also alleged that the Centre had earmarked Rs 750 each for nearly seven lakh labourers in Bengal. However, the government has an insurance cover for only three lakh labourers, while the remaining four lakh have been kept out.																								However, a spokesperson for the ESI Corporation dismissed the allegation. We had to review the case because the original list of insured persons was full of errors. It had on it the names of several dead persons, he said.																								Earlier this month, the IMA laid siege on the ESI Corporation regional directors office in Grant Lane, and also the administrative medical officers office in Bagmari Lane. We submitted deputations and demanded a detailed probe on how the errors have been occurring, a group of ESI doctors said. Recently, the court directed the government to speed up their dues.																								The IMA has also alleged that the ESI doctors are not getting their salaries on time. The doctors get their salaries at six-month intervals, it claimed.																								An IMA delegation has got in touch with several ministers and also reported the doctors grievances to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The chief minister assured us he will look into the matter at the earliest, Patra said. It is learnt that the chief minister has asked finance minister Asim Dasgupta to initiate a dialogue with the doctors.

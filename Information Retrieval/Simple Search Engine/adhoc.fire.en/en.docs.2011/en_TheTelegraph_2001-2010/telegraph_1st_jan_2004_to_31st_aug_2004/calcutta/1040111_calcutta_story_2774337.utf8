The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 President pawn to checkmate Mamata bandh
 SWATI SENGUPTA																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to checkmate Mamata Banerjees party. In a shrewd move, the Left Front-ruled state is inviting the President to lay the foundation stone of a trade-fair complex on February 3, the day its rival Trinamul Congress has called a state-wide bandh.																								The development is bound to weigh heavily on newly-anointed Union minister Mamata Banerjees mind in the face of a growing clamour to call off the bandh. 																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will be requested to lay the foundation stone of an alternative trade-fair complex which has been necessitated by a Calcutta High Court order, asking the government to free the Maidan of the fairs that are perceived as threats to the environment.																								The complex, to come up on a 17-acre plot off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, will be developed into a permanent fair ground, say officials.																								Though a section of the officials insist that the date of the function  and the plan to get the President to do the honours  have nothing to do with the Trinamul Congress bandh, others are confident that the move would act as yet another form of pressure on Banerjee to call off the bandh. She is a Union minister now and there will be pressure on her not to spoil a party attended by the President, who came to power supported by the National Democratic Front alliance, in which Trinamul Congress is a partner, one of them said.																								A key home department official said the administration was not bothered with the 12-hour bandh. We will go ahead with our programme. There should not be any problem in making it a success, he stated.																								For the past few years, environmentalists have been crying hoarse about the necessity to relieve the Maidan  the largest green belt in the city  of its fair duty. There have been allegations that organisers of the fairs do not follow the norms to clean up the Maidan when they leave. The state government, too, as keeper of the Maidan, has had to contend with charges that it is not serious about preventing the green expanse from choking.																								Things, however, seem to be looking up following the courts intervention. A division bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar, has set April 14, 2004, as the date for a freed-from-fairs Maidan. 																								The government has already identified the area for the complex, to be developed by West Bengal Promotion Organisation, a company formed jointly by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and the India Trade Promotion Organisation.

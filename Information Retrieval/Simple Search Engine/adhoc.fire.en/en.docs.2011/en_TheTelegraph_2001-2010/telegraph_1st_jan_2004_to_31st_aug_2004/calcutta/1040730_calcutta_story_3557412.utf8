Picture by Rashbehari Das 															Wednesday evening saw the CII throwing a dinner bash for the members of its retail fraternity. This was preceded by Day One of the confederations annual conference, Retail 2004, at the Oberoi Grand. The purpose of the conference was to celebrate the steady emergence of Calcutta in the retail market. 																					The party saw the business biggies turn up in droves strictly sticking to the punctuality punch of an 8 pm entry time. Welcoming the guests was B. Muthuraman, president, CII (eastern region).																					Retail is an upcoming industry in India with huge investment potential and encouraging returns. Calcutta was one of the last cities in the country to join the retail bandwagon but is showing an upward trend, what with so many malls and retail chains dropping anchor here, said Muthuraman.																					Those who thought that a CII meet is an exclusively male affair had their doubts put to rest for the occasion was graced by a leading lady as well. Danseuse Tanusree Shankar for one was among those who found the place a perfect platform to mix business with pleasure.																					Its a great way to turn showbiz into big business by showcasing the potential of Bengals showbiz, was how Tanusree chose to push her cause in a party she found ideal to form a good network with the business fraternity. 																					There were yet others with not just pure pleasure on mind. On a normal day you might have to struggle hard to get an appointment with some of the businessmen present here. So its great to have got the opportunity to share a drink and a business idea or two with the same people today, gushed Biswadeep Gupta, president, The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.																					Add to it an elaborate Indian and Continental fare and theres no way the party could have thrown a pooper.  Samples of the Awadhi cuisine being promoted at Saffron. Picture by Rashbehari Das												Dokra drive																					Bengals exquisite handicrafts have been brought under one roof by a Bengal Ambuja initiative at City Centre. Akriti, the store that houses handwork created by members of at least a dozen city NGOs, is a rare treat for shoppers, housed on the first floor of the mall near the statute of the horse-drawn carriage. 																					The shop stocks a range of items, from night wear to dokra figurines. Designer candles, glass paintings carved to form wall-hangings, hand-made paper products, hand-painted greeting cards, and kantha items are up for sale.																					Great workmanship is coupled with great prices as well. While you can pick up mens handloom kurtas for Rs 250, a dokra Ganesha comes for Rs 100. Earthen flower vases are going at Rs 40 and above, depending on the size and hand-knitted colourful bags are priced at Rs 100.																					The kantha, which one is more used to seeing in grandmas closet, has been reinvented. Being sold at Rs 1,500 a piece, the 6 ft-by-4 ft spreads are in cotton, embellished with intricate kantha work and colourful motifs reminiscent of rural Bengal.																					The shop, which was formally opened with a cultural show by children from various NGOs involved, is an effort to provide a platform for these organisations to showcase their work, said mall authorities.																					Awadhi aroma																					A royal treat minus the spicy regalia is the order of the day at Saffron, the Indian speciality restaurant at The Park. Part of their food promotion series highlighting various cuisines of the country, Saffron has zeroed in on Awadhi-style cooking this time, after a recent south Indian sojourn.																					Most of the recipes featured on the menu smack of the Qureshi brothers culinary skills, but others have been especially devised by Chef Debashis Saha. Regulars will find the usual Chawk ki Tikki (plump potato patties with asafoetida-tempered fresh peas filling), Cheese Kurkure (cheese wrapped in roomali roti and deep fried), Khazaana-e-Lazzat (creamy spinach kofta stuffed with sweet corn and simmered in tomato gravy), Gobi Keema (stir fried cauliflower florets with kasoori methi and chilli), Nahari (lamb simmered in a flavoured gravy) and Chapli Kebab (pan-fried mutton patties) firmly in place. There are a few new additions like Rajma Galawati Kebab (pan-fried kidney bean-and-nut patty flavoured with fresh herbs) and Bansi Raja ke Tikkey (boneless chicken marinated with lemon, black pepper and garlic and grilled on a hot plate).																					Whereas authentic Awadhi cuisine is a brilliant blend of flavours, colour, seasoning, aroma and visual appeal, the resident chefs have taken the liberty to cut down on some of the frills to appeal to contemporary tastes. 																					We refrain from using too much oil and spices associated with traditional Awadhi cuisine. Everyone has become extremely health conscious and we would lose out if we strictly adhere to the original recipes, explained Saha. Coming up next are north Indian, Bengali, kebab and biryani promotions meant to make patrons aware of these culinary styles that otherwise seem to get lost on larger menus.

Thats what Global Local, a 10-day exhibition hosted by the British Council, is all about. 																					The presentation, inaugurated by actress Debasree Roy at Uma art gallery on Wednesday evening, features Indian designers of international repute whose works have an immediately recognisable Indian identity. The exhibition has toured Delhi and Chennai before coming to Calcutta and will roll out to Mumbai next.																					Said Sujata Sen, director, eastern India of British Council, While the designers have displayed outfits especially created for the exhibition, the clothes reflect each of their typical style.																					The designers featured are Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Anshu Arora Sen, Darshan Shah of Weavers Studio, Alex Davis of Indi Store, Delhi, Mandira Malik and Rita Arya of Manna Studio Line, David Abraham and Rakesh Thakore, Ghulam Saikia, Manish Arora, Ramachandran Karthikeyan, George Chakravarthi, Jason Cherian, Nipa Doshi and Jonathan Levien, Tania Khosla, Rajesh Pratap Singh and Paul Khera. 																					The exhibition explores how global influences inspire regional fashion and vice versa. The showing would be very helpful for fashion design students, said Sabyasachi. 																					The young designer is exhibiting a couple of outfits from his Lakm India Fashion Week 2003 line, influenced by the British Raj. 																					The collection had lots of Victorian influences and I have revived some of their techniques like tea staining and layering. Local influences have been imbibed in the cuts, said Sabyasachi. The two jackets he has displayed in the exhibition flaunt Mughal cuts and long churidar sleeves. 																					ike to work with traditional weaves and embroideries of India and use them to create global silhouettes, Sabyasachi explained. 																					Darshan Shah, on the other hand, works with textile techniques from across the globe, particularly Japan. The exhibition displays some of her works highlighting the use of indigo dye. 																					The exhibition, on at the gallery till August 8, will be followed by a two-day workshop at Weavers Studio on August 9 and 10.

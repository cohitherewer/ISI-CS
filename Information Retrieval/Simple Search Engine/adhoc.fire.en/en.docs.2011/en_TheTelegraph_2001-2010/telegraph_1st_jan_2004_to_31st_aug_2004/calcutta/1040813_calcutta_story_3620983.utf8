Caped crusaderIt is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever told by one of the comic book greats. Jeph Loebs Hush brings in almost every character the Dark Knight has ever encountered in his life  friend or foe, as Bruce Wayne or Batman  in one dark, mysterious and visually stunning tale. Theres someone out to get Batman, who is using usual suspects like the Joker, Two-face and Poison Ivy as red herrings. Worse, he knows that Bruce is Batman and does not hesitate to harm (and even kill) his near and dear ones. Through the course of events, the caped crusader tries to analyse his relationships with those he trusts the most and must make up his mind about his feelings for Catwoman.

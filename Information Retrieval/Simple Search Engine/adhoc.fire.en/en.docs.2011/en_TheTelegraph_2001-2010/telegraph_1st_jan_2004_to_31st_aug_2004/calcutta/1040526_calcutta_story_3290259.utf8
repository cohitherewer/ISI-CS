 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Basu road divider shaved for traffic safety
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed over frequent mishaps in the vicinity of Indira Bhavan, Jyoti Basus residence in Salt Lake, the authorities plan to remove part of the barricade around the building that has been blocking the main thoroughfare. 																								This will help widen the parallel roads in front of Indira Bhavan, but necessitate the demolition of a portion of the pavement on the other side of the barricade, erected to provide greater security to the former chief minister.																								Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said Basus security would not be hampered if a portion of the outer boundary is reduced to create some roadspace. 																								There is a divider and a police camp within the outer boundary that can be replaced and it will have no effect on the former chief ministers security cover, Deb said at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.																								Three persons have died and at least 50 have been injured in as many as 15 accidents near Basus residence over the past six months. 																								This has, apparently, prompted the authorities to devise a way to ensure accident-free traffic movement in the area, without compromising on the CPM leaders security.																								According to senior officials connected with the Salt Lake administration, the steel structure surrounding the inner boundary of Basus residence, which blocks the entire three-lane road space, is mainly responsible for the mishaps. 																								It is the main road connecting the area to the business district zone. The barricade, however, is forcing the up and down vehicles to ply on a single road at considerable risk, the officials said.																								Besides, as the road has taken a 90-degree turn at the junction of the barricade, no car is generally visible from the opposite side. This often leads to head-on collisions between vehicles coming from opposite directions.																								The government woke up to the problem last week after two persons, including an autorickshaw-driver, were killed and three others injured in a collision between an auto and a bus.																								We do admit that vehicle operators are facing a problem as the road has been blocked. But what can we do ? Basus security arrangements have been finalised by the police and we do not have any authority to intervene in the matter, said Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta.																								However, we are exploring all possibilities to create some roadspace to ensure smooth and safe vehicular movement, he added.																								Gupta, however, blamed rash driving for the frequent accidents on the spot. 																								Smaller roadspace may be a problem, but the major cause of the mishaps is violation of traffic rules by a section of bus and autorickshaw-drivers, he said.																								The Opposition parties have been quick to seek political mileage from the issue. 																								We had earlier launched agitations, set up roadblocks and submitted memorandums to the municipal authorities, demanding steps for safe vehicular movement, but all our pleas went unheeded, complained Salt Lake Congress president Amitava Sinha.

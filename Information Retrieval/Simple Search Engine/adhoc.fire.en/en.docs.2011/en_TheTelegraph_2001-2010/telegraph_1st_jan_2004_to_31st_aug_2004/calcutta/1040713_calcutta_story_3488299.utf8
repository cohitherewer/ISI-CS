																																																		The city and its adjoining areas experienced widespread power cuts on Monday evening following decreased supply from the state electricity board to the CESC grid. The shortfall in the CESC-supplied areas increased to about 90 MW in the peak evening hours. Power department sources said generation at the state-run power plant had plummeted over the past few days, leading to a drop of about 200 MW. A few days ago, the plants were supplying about 1,800 MW to the SEB grid. But we are getting about 1,600 MW over the past few days, said an official. The situation was further compounded by the collapse of a giant 500-MW unit at the National Thermal Power Corporations (NTPC) power plant at Farakka. We are taking steps to increase our generation and firing up another unit at the Kolaghat plant on Tuesday. This will help reduce the deficit to a great extent, said an official.

				 Ode to the mystery womanJaya Seal				 																																																											Sunil Gangopadhyays poetry, a fling with an ex-flame, some steamy scenes and a publicity blitz to match Subrata Sens Hothat Neerar Jonnyo has packed in quite a few punches. A sneak peek into the rough cut of the film revealed some fizz and lots of firsts. The authors take:				 																																																											When Subrata came to discuss the idea with me I had insisted that Neera be left to the imagination. There was no need to show her in flesh and blood, says writer Sunil Gangopadhyay. So, they have used the poetry to conceptualise Rani, the heroine in one of my short stories Rani O Abinash, on which the film is based... I had written the story at a very young age.				 																																																											Hothat Neerar Jonnyo takes off from where Gangopadhyays story of dissatisfaction in a man-woman relationship ends. I havent read the script and I am curious about the film. I would like to catch the premiere if possible, he adds.The directors cut:				 																																																											I have long been toying with the idea of doing a film on one of Sunildas works, says Subrata Sen about his fourth film that weaves in the concept of Neera, the fictive female character on whom Gangopadhyay has penned a series of poems. 				 																																																											Neera is like Banalata Sen; she encapsulates the poets image of the quintessential woman... Lots of films have been made on the theme of unfaithfulness in a relationship, Indecent Proposal, Unfaithful... The novelty of Hothat Neerar Jonnyo lies in the conflict of two perspectives, adds Sen, having wrapped up the film in a start-to-finish 19-day shoot last winter.The main man:				 																																																											I have never acted before, not even in a college drama and had some trepidation on the first day of the shoot, admits Bikram Ghosh, who is foraying into filmdom as the leading man in Hothat Neerar Jonnyo. The bohemian look, the footloose feel, the glib talk and a way with clothes have helped the tabla exponent put more than a bit of himself into Abinash.				 																																																											But I have no plans of taking up acting as a full-time career, says Bikram, who has also scored the films soundtrack. 				 																																																											The audio album is a standalone product brought out by Sa Re Ga Ma, featuring six songs by Srikanta Acharya, Indranil Sen, Prateek Chowdhury and Raghab Chatterjee, among others. The songs visualise Neera from a male perspective. So, there is no female singer, he adds.The leading lady:My role has a lot of depth and portraying the conflict in an ordinary woman was challenging. But there were some bold scenes and I was a little jittery about doing them, confesses Jaya Seal , into her third Bengali film after Buddhadeb Dasguptas Uttara and Probhat Roys Shesh Thikana. The workshop with Sohag Sen helped me shed my discomfort and shooting turned out to be one great picnic, says the Bengali girl, reared in Guwahati and settled in Mumbai for the past seven years.Money talk:				 																																																											The film has two pivotal hooks  the Sunil Gangopadhyay factor, which will attract a whole generation that thrived on the Neera poems, and the Bikram Ghosh-Subrata Sen combo, which has a non-conformist shade and will pull in the youth, hopes Kanchan Datta. His five-year-old advertising agency, Inner Circle, has pumped in about Rs 65 lakh to enter Tollywood with Hothat Neerar Jonnyo. Of this, the publicity blitz itself has eaten up a solid chunk of Rs 20 lakh. 				 																																																											Our campaign has the look of a Kal Ho Naa Ho promo. I wanted our campaigns to be right up there, claims Datta, who has already flooded the city streets with teaser ads. Sample this: Shorir jokhon moner kotha bole...				 																																																											A lot more is in the offing  42 billboards, 350 kiosks, trailers on TV and FM channels, college promos, T-shirts, caps and on-line publicity  before the film hits Priya, Globe, Mitra, Jaya, INOX and Swabhumi on July 9.Reshmi SenguptaThe stage is set, yet again				 																																																											A whiff of fresh plays is in the air, with two new stage productions waiting in the wings for the theatre-loving city to savour.				 																																																											Swapnasandhanis Kolkatar Electra and Blind Operas Thake Shudhu Nachiketa will premiere at Odeon 2004. They will be specially scripted and presented for the annual theatre show promoted by cellphone operator Hutch. To spice up the theatre platter, the festival organisers are also bringing in two productions  one in Hindi and the other in English  from beyond Bengal.				 																																																											The five-day fare covering two successive weekends kicks off on June 24 at the Oberoi Grand with a panel discussion on globalisation of Indian theatre, featuring actor Manoj Mitra, film-maker Anjan Dutt and quantum physicist Dipankar Home. Actress Konkona Sen Sharma will host the event, introducing each play to the audience.				 																																																											We have been trying to revive quality theatre in the city through Odeon. The earlier festivals had showcased good plays from outside the state. Last year, we thought of creating a new play with a local troupe. Promoting two plays this time was a logical extension of that idea, says Hutch CEO Sunil Sood. The troupes need funds to keep the citys theatre culture going. We chose to promote theatre because this medium wasnt getting enough support, adds Sood. 				 																																																											With financial and infrastructure support from the cellphone biggie, Swapanasandhani and Blind Opera will hold double shows of Kolkatar Electra and Thake Shudhu Nachiketa at Rabindra Sadan. 				 																																																											A panel comprising Samik Bandopadhyay, Usha Ganguly and S.B. Raman has shortlisted Kaushik Sens Swapnasandhani and Subhasish Gangopadhyays Blind Opera from 32 troupes across Bengal. 				 																																																											The three panelists held one-to-one sessions with the directors of the various groups before deciding on the two. The entire process has been a six to seven-month effort, says stage veteran Sohag Sen, consultant for Odeon 2004.				 																																																											We have watched the rehearsals and have helped them evolve two quality productions, adds Sen, whose acting workshops with directors from the city and artistes from home and away have become vital to Tollygunge ventures.Pen and penchant: Konkona does what comes naturally Mrs Iyer has moved beyond the sari, the gajra, the bindi and the baby. In Madhur Bhandarkars Page 3, Konkona Sen Sharma has slipped into the working clothes of a high-flying scribe, partying with celebs and writing on them. But I slowly get disillusioned with what I see and try to move on, sums up Konkona, currently shooting in Mumbai. The talented daughter of Aparna Sen will soon be home to host Odeon 2004 for the third time running. Anchoring the show helps me keep in touch with what is happening in theatre, says stage buff Koko.

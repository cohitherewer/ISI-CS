The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 09, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The Chandni Chowk stretch has all but lost its entire footpath to hawkers. The encroachers have constructed permanent shops and sell a variety of items, from electronic goods to fruits. Even the tram stop at the Chandni Chowk Street-Lenin Sarani crossing is occupied by hawkers. Passengers are compelled to literally jump over the wares displayed on the footpath to board the tram. Accidents on the stretch are common. Will the authorities keep the area clean and hawker-free for the convenience of tram passengers? A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, Chandni Chowk. 
	We are students of a business school in Pailan. We have noticed that the nearby market, Pailan haat, is in very bad shape. Moreover, the traffic in the area goes haywire during peak hours. Earlier, the government had promised to allot more land for the Pailan haat. But it has turned out to be just a casual statement. There seems to be no intention of fulfilling the promise. The lack of drinking water is also a major problem. A visit to the municipalitys office reveals that many applications for water connections are rotting on the tables of the babus. We, despite being outsiders, feel that it is our duty to request the government to recall its promise and take steps for improving the infrastructure of this area. Name not given, New Mens Park, Pailan. 
	Its a pity that educated people pluck flowers from private gardens when they go on morning walks, without seeking permission from the owners. Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.

 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Polio-like cases at NRS: hospital mum, top brass red-faced
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After the slap, its suppression of facts.																								Weeks after Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital was embroiled in a controversy over a pregnant woman being slapped to induce labour, the health department has ticked off the citys largest teaching hospital for suppression of facts  for not reporting cases with polio-like symptoms.																								Worse still, at the end of the day, the health department tried to hide its own findings  hints of polio resurfacing in the districts of Murshidabad, South 24-Parganas and Nadia.																								Both the director of medical education and the director of health services tried to skirt the issue, saying these were cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis  a broad category that includes diseases like polio and the polio-like Gullian Barre (GB) Syndrome.																								Both admitted, however, that they were concerned over the hospitals effort to suppress facts, as GB Syndrome is not a common occurrence. 																								This symptom is rare and occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has developed respiratory or gastro-intestinal infection. Besides, this is an ascending paralysis, where the lower-limb muscles are affected first, explained a medical officer.																								Rattled by the findings, the Swasthya Bhavan headquarters of the health department conducted an inquiry at NRS on Tuesday. 																								The team stumbled upon three patients in the paediatric medicine ward, who were suffering from polio-like symptoms, but had not been brought to its notice by the authorities.																								Of the three, the youngest is a four-year-old from Murshidabad and the oldest, 12, is from Pathar Pratima, in South 24-Parganas.																								Later in the afternoon, the team got NRS vice-principal Basanta Khan to ink the report, which was tabled at Swasthya Bhavan, much to the discomfiture of minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and health secretary Kalyan Bagchi.																								The report revealed that the first case was admitted on July 10 and the last on July 23. 																								Even four days after the last admission, the hospital had not bothered to inform the health top brass about the cases, that struck the very root of the state governments anti-polio drive. 																								On Wednesday, the health department called the college principal, vice-principal-cum-super and the heads of five departments, including paediatric medicine, medicine and neuro-medicine, for a meeting at Swasthya Bhavan. 																								The agenda: to inquire why the hospital tried to cover up the cases and drive home the necessity of increased surveillance.																								We are not willing to take chances. Besides, its the hospitals onus to inform the state about any case of polio or those with similar symptoms, explained C.R. Maiti, director of medical education. Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said that even if the three were suffering from GB Syndrome, they needed special scanning, since such cases are not common. 																								The state was keen to make a proper presentation at a conference on surveillance in the presence of representatives from other states on August 5 at Medical College and Hospital.

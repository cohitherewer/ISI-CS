 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Salt Lake will rent out parks
 SANJAY MANDAL																								The Salt Lake civic authorities are planning a new way to maintain the greenery of the township. Bidhannagar Municipality has initiated discussions with the block committees to take up the responsibility of maintaining the small parks in the blocks. Those who run coaching centres and schools on these small parks will be charged for using the bigger playgrounds. 																								We have also decided to give the bigger playgrounds on rent to various clubs of Calcutta that are approaching us, a senior Bidhannagar Municipality official said on Sunday.																								In Salt Lakes GD block, the block association has taken up maintenance work with the help of the municipality, officials said. The association has raised funds and four parks have been given facelifts. We have provided them with free water supply and electricity, said Chandan Ghosh, CPM councillor of ward 17. 																								Earlier, the parks were in bad shape and did not have any equipment. We have set up a fund for maintaining the parks, said Tapan Samaddar, president of the GD Block Residents Association. The authorities are also drawing up a plan to generate revenue from the playgrounds and spend the funds for maintenance of smaller parks inside the blocks. 																								Various playgrounds are used by coaching centres and schools. We are debating whether we should ask them to pay fees for using these grounds or not, an official said. The municipality is also planning to generate income by renting out playgrounds to big clubs. Already, we are giving the ground adjacent to Central Park to two big clubs of Calcutta Maidan for practice. This can be implemented for other playgrounds, too, the official said.

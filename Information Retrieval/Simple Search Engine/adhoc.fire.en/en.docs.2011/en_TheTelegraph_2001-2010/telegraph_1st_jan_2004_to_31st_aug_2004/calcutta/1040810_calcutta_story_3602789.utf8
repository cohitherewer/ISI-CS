 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Go-green tips for Thai law squad 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bangkok is taking a leaf out of Calcuttas green-bench book.																								A 10-member team, including five Supreme Court judges and three from the lower courts of Thailand, was recently in town, as part of United States-Asia Environmental Partnerships (US-AEP) environmental regulatory dialogue programme. The agenda: to study the use of the judicial system to mitigate environmental threats.																								Many of our countrys environmental problems are similar to Indias and we, too, are in the process of setting up green benches, explained Supreme Court justice and delegation leader Praphan Subsaeng. We will start with the Supreme Court and similar benches will be created in the lower courts, he added.																								Though Thailands judiciary has not become as active yet as its Indian counterpart in addressing environmental issues, the number of such cases are increasing steadily, Justice Subsaeng added.																								The exchange was initiated almost a year ago, when two delegations from the Indian Supreme Court visited Thailand to explain the role of the judicial system in enforcing environmental regulations and how the green benches were set up, explained Arup Mitra, regional director, US-AEP, and Paul B. Violette, Bangkok-based US-AEP policy adviser.																								Calcutta was the first city in India where the green bench was set up in the 90s, after the Supreme Courts directive came through, calling for the special bench to ensure accessible and prompt delivery of justice.																								During the one-day trip, the Thai team met stakeholders, including the chief justice of Calcutta High Court, environmental activist Subhas Dutta, West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) officials and members of the appellate authority dealing with pollution-related cases. They also witnessed the green bench in action.																								The delegation made note of the good interpretation of law, cooperation amongst stakeholders, the active role of public interest groups in litigation and the PCBs public grievance cells.																								The PCB presented its experience with the public grievance cells, which have reduced the pressure on the already overburdened judicial system.																								While before, over 2,000 cases would come before the court every year, more than 90 per cent of those cases are now resolved in the public grievance cells, explained Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer, PCB.																								Exchange of ideas is important, as many environmental issues are global in nature. Countries need to share notes about how to control problems, opined Sudip Banerjee, chairman, state PCB. 																								He believes that the environmental protection initiatives only gained importance in the country after the judiciary became actively involved in the mid-90s.

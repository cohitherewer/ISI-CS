 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Pleas go out for blood as poll dries flow
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SANJAY MANDAL 				 	 A file picture of a blood donation camp																								An acute shortage in the supply of common blood groups and the increasing reluctance of voluntary units in organising camps before the elections appear to have forced major city blood banks, including the Institute of Blood Transfusion and Immuno Hematology (IBTIH), to turn to individual and apolitical organisations for help.																								Six voluntary organisations in the past week have turned down Bhorukha blood banks request to organise donation camps. This week, two such organisations have refused the IBTIH authorities, formerly known as the Central Blood Bank, saying donors are too busy with election campaign and are in no position to organise camps. 																								Now, the blood banks have done something extraordinary  rented billboards at key road intersections to issue appeals to youths to bail them out of the crisis by donating blood.																								On normal days, the IBTIH has 4,000 bottles of common and RH-negative blood groups ready for needy patients, but on Thursday, it had only 1,800 left. These, too, were disappearing fast.																								As a result, common blood groups, like O-positive, B-positive and AB-positive, have become scarce, while RH-negative blood groups like O, B and C are simply not available. 																								In summer, fewer blood donation camps are organised as a rule, but the timing of the election couldnt have been worse. The situation will worsen on election eve. We dont know what we will do now, other than appeal to the government and the public to organise at least some camps, says a senior IBTIH official. He admitted that even response to the appeals has been poor.																								Shankar Acharya Majumdar, senior administrative officer of Bhorukha blood bank, admits that the number of camps has dropped almost 50 per cent. At the moment, we have 500 bottles, but with the election day nearing, the situation will become more grave, Majumder added.																								Other private blood banks, like Ashok Laboratory, have faced many refusals this week. From 12 camps a week to only four, the situation could not have been worse, says Deb Kumar Mukherjee, marketing and public relations manager of the Jodhpur Park-based laboratory.																								Usually, the 56-odd blood banks, both in the government and private sector, depend on voluntary organisations for blood donations. But this month, the number of camps has dwindled from 280 a week to only about 130 in a week. 																								The grim situation has forced organisations like Medical Bank to put up 22 billboards across the city, including Nagerbazar, Sealdah, Bhowanipore, Hazra and Garia. The problem has compounded after the Supreme Court debarred in 1998 professionals donors. 																								Blood banks have no alternative to seeking help from para clubs and volunteers. Last week, a club, after a lot of persuasion, promised us 100 volunteers, but only 20 turned up for the camp, said D. Asish, senior member of Medical Bank. 																								State-run hospitals are feeling the pinch, too.

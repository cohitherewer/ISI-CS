					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Ma Dharam Jyoti  at the inauguration of Osha World at Forum 															Osho World now has a new address in Calcutta. The second Osho World gallery in the country (the first is in New Delhi) was recently inaugurated at the Forum Shopping Mall by Ma Dharam Jyoti, a long-time disciple of Osho.																					Located on the fourth floor of the mall, the gallery houses Osho literature in the form of books (in English, Hindi and Bengali), cassettes and CDs. Lifestyle products, including robes, slippers, artefacts and stationery, designed by Osho-loving artistes are also available at the shop.																					Speaking at the inauguration, Pulak Chamaria, director of Osho World, Calcutta, said, Calcutta has long felt the need for an Osho World and we are delighted to have been able to fill the void. Ever since we have made Osho discourses available, we have been continuously encouraged by a fabulous response from the city.																					A unique feature of the inauguration was a meditation session conducted by Ma Dharam Jyoti, among the first group of 20 persons to take sanyas from Osho, who has lived most of her life with him and translated and edited a number of his works. This session was attended by invitees as well as walk-ins and also present were Swami Atul Anand and Ma Anand Urvashi, both closely associated with the Osho Rajyoga Meditation Centre in Delhi.

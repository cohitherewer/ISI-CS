 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Shelter in stitches, freedom in style
 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Women work on their creation at NIFT. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Thirty girls studying at the citys premiere fashion design institute may have never before seen a copy of Vogue, but that doesnt mean they dont have an inherent sense of style.																								National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) is running a three-month course in garment construction for trafficked and vulnerable girls from Sanlaap, an NGO. The project, funded by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), is designed to offer hands-on, occupational training.																								Sanlaap, through the Hyderabad-based IOMs economic rehabilitation programme, has also recently tied up with corporates like Amul and Caf Coffee Day to set up retail opportunities for the rescued girls.																								Though most of the 27 girls, from the NGOs Narendrapur shelter home and drop-in centres have studied little, innovation and creativity come naturally to them, with style icons like Aishwarya Rai and Bipasha Basu dominating their ideas of fashion.																								There was a degree of resistance at first, but then the girls have enthusiastically embraced unconventional concepts, explains Noopur Anand, NIFT faculty and project coordinator. Now they are doing some amazing work, she adds.																								Some of the girls have some basic tailoring skills, but most have gone from clean slate to creating asymmetrical hemlines and detachable sleeves, just halfway through the three-and-a-half-month course.																								We would all like to take designing up as a business, as a way of supporting ourselves and being independent, says one of the participants Kalpana Jana. But we also know that we have to be better than the competition if we want our clothes to sell, she adds.																								Designed by NIFT, the crash course starts with the basics and attempts to impart enough skills to ready the girls to face the industry.																								Some of them may find placement in boutiques, while others may prefer to set up small businesses. We are still exploring the options, explains Indrani Sinha of Sanlaap, which initiated the project.																								Language and education levels dictated the need for devising alternative teaching methodologies. We have used a largely pictorial approach, says Anand. References are also kept relevant, restricting examples to those from Hindi films and TV.																								The classes are conducted in a mix of Bengali and Hindi but many technical words in English have been kept deliberately. When the girls interact with buyers in future, these are things they would need to know, she adds.																								Six days a week, the girls will be at the sprawling Salt Lake campus, where they appear to be thriving. They have already made one set of garments, working around checks as a theme, for the mid-term display last week, which impressed both IOM and Sanlaap officials.																								We made some of the clothes in our own size so we can wear them now, smiles Reshma, one of the girls from Sneha, the shelter home. They are given all the raw materials  from thread and needle to cloth  to learn the art.																								The success of this batch, in class till July 19, will decide whether a second group is feasible.

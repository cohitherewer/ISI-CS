Picture by Rashbehari DasSchools have reopened after the summer vacations, and students are ready for some action after much-needed rest and relaxation. What better way to have fun than fests? Here are two this season that lined up a whole host of activities.				 				 																															Last week, all the fest action was happening at La Martiniere. Karma Yatra 2004 brought together 11 schools under the same roof. Apart from the two hosts (LMB and LMG), the fest included schools like DBPC, Queen of the Missions, Frank Anthony, CIS, Birla High (boys and girls), Pratt Memorial, GD Birla and LSA.				 				 																															The off-stage events were held on July 16, comprising Prose, Kartooning, Strokes and more. The prom night was also a popular feature. The next day featured events like Kwizz, Medley, Mock, Pact and Jazz. 				 				 																															On July 18, Konflict, Ham, Taal, Hog, Klip and Karythmics (western dance) were held. The last contest saw some fancy footwork. The fest had been organised by the Interact Club of La Martiniere.				 				 																															While the hosts dominated the off-stage events, Ham and Taal (eastern songs) were won by Birla High for Girls and GD Birla respectively. However, LMB proved its ability in events like Jazz, Konflict and Mock.				 				 																															The most popular feature of the fest, western dance, was won by LMG, followed by LMB and DBPC. Besides team prizes, some individual prizes were also awarded  best actor, best vocalist, best instrumentalist, etc. 				 				 																															Anirudh Mukherjee of LMB, selected the best participant, received a scholarship of Rs1 lakh from Ready To Go magazine. In the end, LMB was declared the overall winners, followed by LMG and Pratt Memorial. 				 				 																															Maitree, the Modern High fest, was not short on action either. Ten schools, plenty of competition and an intoxicating atmosphere added spice to the proceedings. 				 				 																															Schools like St James, Birla High (boys), Calcutta Boys, GD Birla, Loreto House, South Point, St Joseph, LMB and DBPC joined in with gusto in the two-day fest. The events included Mastermind (quiz), Monologue (elocution), Moves (western and eastern dance), Mirror (photography), Mosaic (collage) and Mind Speak (debate).				 				 																															The events witnessed stiff competition, with the host school emerging on top. But brilliant performances were also put up by other schools, particularly Loreto House in debate and St James in impact. 				 				 																															Modern High was the winner, with St James, Birla High and DBPC close behind. In keeping with tradition, the hosts handed over the winners trophy to runners-up St James. Asif Salam,

	 Curtains up				 				 																															July was a month for some sparkling stage performances, beginning with Threatecians teenage production. Here are two that shone through in the limelight.				 				 																															2It was their first stage performance but they were naturals. The Saturday crowd at Swabhumi thronged the urban zone stage as six students displayed their talents in combining dance and painting to perform two new art forms  ballet-painting and music-painting. 				 				 																															It began with Sreemoyee Roy Chowdhury, 3, drawing flowers while music played in the background, and occasionally dancing. Next was music-painting, and as the range varied from sitar, sarod and tabla to guitar, synthesiser and piano, the speed of the hand also changed.				 				 																															It took them about 21 minutes to create the landscapes on canvas. Also staged was a puppet show on Gupi-Bagha, ranging from bhuter raja giving a boon to Gupi and Bagha singing Aha ki ananda akashe batashe. But ballet painting by Priyanka Das stole the show. With rhythmic body movements and brush strokes she created a kathakali dancer. Priyanka is very serious about this art form and wants to take it up as a profession. She will perform in Jakarta, Indonesia, and North America soon. 				 				 																															This has already made it to the Limca Book of Records and has been sent to the Guinness Book of World Records authorities, said Arunava Roy Gosthipaty of the Singing Fingers Group, the school to which all of them belong.				 				 																															2The anguish of the Americans during and post-World War II, the fight for artistic liberty by pioneers of living theatre, a portrait of every mans struggle against an oppressive society This was Beck and Call, an experimental play directed by Parnab Mukherjee.				 				 																															Expounding the spirit of Antigone, the ancient Grecian tale of a woman rising against authority and hypocrisy, the play was a tribute to Julian Beck and Judith Malina, pioneers of living theatre. Born in 1947, living theatre went through many obstacles, with the duo being thrown out of America, getting involved in the Paris students riots in 1968 and being put behind bars a dozen times. 				 				 																															Using innovative props like masks, toy robots, a slide shoe and even drops of water on a projector screen, Beck and Call made a bold statement against the idleness and sufferings of ordinary people.				 				 																															Delivering powerful performances were Janardan Ghosh, Inam Hussain Mullick, Joi Chatterjee and Fahd Hussain. A brief introduction, pictures of torture and quotes from Allen Ginsbergs Howl carried the pace of the play. The message  Antigone is still present, in Andhra Pradeshs Muthanga, Bengals Amlashol and elsewhere. Subhajoy Roy, Mitra Institution

	 Budget talk				 				 																															On July 16, St Xaviers College auditorium was abuzz with just two letters  P.C. The union finance ministers Budget 2004-05 walked a tightrope as the corporate heavyweights and economists went deep into the promises and projections, and discussed the various facets of Chidambarams third budget. 				 				 																															The list of speakers included Abhirup Sarkar (ISI, Calcutta), Rajiv Tandon (ITC), Anjan Chakravorty (CU) and R.S. Jhawar (Eveready Industries). Questions were raised on the rationale behind slashing the plan outlay for the rural sector and jacking up expenditure for defence to a whopping Rs 77,000 crore.				 				 																															The panelists then delved in detail into the intricacies of service tax, turnover tax and value added tax. Doubts were raised on rosy revenue projections, ambiguous resource allocation and probably an unrealistic fiscal deficit target.				 				 																															Finally, it was up to the students to express their views on the budget. As the show ended, we wondered whether P. Chidambaram would address our concerns by saying Main Hoon Naa.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Cancer research in doldrums
 																											- Prestige meet minus allopathic representative from city BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Conventional cancer research here has all but hit a dead-end. Case in point: not a single allopathic doctor from the city or the state has been invited to the international conference on cancer research, being held in Delhi from Sunday.																								Instead, it is a homoeopath, Asim Chatterjee of Lake Town, who will represent Bengal at Watch 2004, organised by World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Society of Medical Oncology and others like the International Congress on Oral Cancer and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.																								This is a unique cancer-research conference, where most of the participants are from abroad. And only the best work will be presented, says A.K. Varma, convener of the conference and former surgeon to the President of India.																								Cancer experts in Bengal admit that lack of motivation, opportunity, and facilities hinder cancer research.																								Our young researchers do not have an opportunity to go for exchange programmes abroad to learn how research work is conducted there, complains Anup Majumdar, head of radiotherapy at SSKM Hospital.																								There are many top cancer specialists in the city, some of whom have spent years abroad or in leading hospitals of Mumbai and New Delhi. But no one has made it to the Watch 2004 list, that includes researchers in oral, laryngeal and oesophaegal cancer.																								Subir Gangopadhyay, head of the radiotherapy department in Medical College and Hospital, admits that patient pressure and the long hours of practice prevent them from pursuing any research work.																								It is true that we dont have enough quality work to be presented at an international conference, says Gangopadhyay. I think what has happened (vis--vis Watch 2004) is a stark reminder that it is time to do something about it.																								Asish Mukherjee, director of Subodh Mitra Memorial Cancer Hospital, blames the lack of infrastructure for slowing down cancer research in the state.																								In Calcutta and the rest of Bengal, around 60,000 new cases of cancer are reported every year. Treatment is an option only at a few centres and no research of note is being carried out.																								Not much work has been done here. But we are now creating the right atmosphere to encourage more cancer research, promises C.R. Maiti, director of medical education.

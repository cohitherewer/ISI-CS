																								Agift from a friend is to be preserved forever. Renowned painter Jatin Das did exactly the same when many years ago someone gifted him a pankha. For the last 25 years he has been collecting handfans of various forms, sizes, designs, textures and shapes. Because of the hot and humid tropical climate here, India is a major user of handfans. If mirror work, bead work, crochet and embroidery are the specialities of Gujarat, Rajasthan and UP, eastern India boasts a wide variety of handfans made from woven bamboo and plaited palm leaves. Das rare collection also has varieties sourced from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. If some are meant for domestic use, others adorn temples and ceremonies. 																								Event: Pankha, Handicrafts of the Indian Subcontinent: A collection by Jatin Das																								When: Till July 25 (except Monday) 10 am - 5 pm																								Where: Victoria Memorial

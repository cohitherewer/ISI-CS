 Sunday, June 06, 2004 A drink for all seasons
Who said anything about thirst quenchers? We need the colas to have a good time, any time Shiloo Chattopadhyay Beckham and Zidane: The Real Madrid matesHilsas do not swim upstream in winter. Seasons are unique compartments. Nature has its own laws for each. Strange as it may sound, so does advertising. You do not buy a sweater in June, unless you are planning a mountain holiday. It makes little sense for a marketeer of woollens to catch your attention this evening. For a prickly heat powder, it may well be worthwhile.Then there are other products that are used right through the year but are bought only in a particular season. For example, in this part of the country, sales of readymade garments, saris and many durables peak during the Pujas. Come August, you will find a deluge of advertising for such products. These are time-tested media schedules and are followed every year with the rigours of a religious ritual. This makes eminent business sense, too.What about soft drinks? When would you place their advertising in the media? I can hear you saying, of course in the summer months. Your logic would be simple, that is when most people drink most number of bottles of soft drinks.If you were slightly more familiar with the soft drinks market, you would keep some money for September/October, the second summer. But still, the bulk of your adspend would be in summer. Vivek OberoiNow, the million-dollar question  have you seen much advertising for Pepsi on TV in the recent months? Or Thums Up? Yes, there has been a launch. Most of us would readily recall the somewhat unusual campaign for Vanilla coke ). But that apart, there has not been any heavy burst of advertising for any of the major brands.Have they run out of money? Is this summer less hot? Are people consuming less soft drinks? The answers are likely to be in the negative. Why on earth then have they not advertised?One can, at best, hazard a guess. Advertising for soft drinks does not drive their consumption in summer months. The heat does.Possibly the strategy is to wait for Euro 2004, Asia Cup, Champions Trophy or whatever, all the mega events that are lined up from monsoon onwards. The heat would have subsided by then. You need an engine to drive sales. So a campaign can give fillip to a sagging top line.Perhaps the clinching argument lies somewhere else. Think of the extra eyeballs you would get when Zidane dribbles past Beckham in Portugal or Ricky tries to step out to Harbhajan in Kanpur. Much better value for your money  GRP wise, at least.The ambience would also be just right. Performing cricketers themselves would be endorsing the brands. Minds would be focussed. Why waste money in the summer months?Sorry, did I hear you say, summer, heat, thirst? Who said anything about thirst quenching? Soft drinks are essential for having a good time. Especially in monsoon and winter!

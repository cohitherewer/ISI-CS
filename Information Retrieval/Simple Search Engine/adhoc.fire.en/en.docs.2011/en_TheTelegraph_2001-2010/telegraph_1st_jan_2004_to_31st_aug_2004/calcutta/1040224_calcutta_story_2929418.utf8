 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Comrade shield in liftmen head hunt
 OUR BUREAU																								The management of SSKM Hospital, where a 23-year-old woman suffering from bronchial asthma died on Sunday after being forced to climb up the stairs for an X-ray, spent most of Monday trying to track down the culprits.																								The SSKM authorities were busy using sources in the public works department (PWD) to dig up the names of the two liftmen missing in action early on Saturday, forcing the patient to take the stairs.																								The name hunt was prompted by the local PWD units steadfast refusal to cough up the names. Only when the hospital management came up with two names and confronted them did the PWD officials finally yield.																								Despite being forced to divulge the two names  Ajay Dhara and Ashok Naskar  the PWD officials posted at SSKM Hospital continued to insist that the duo was not at fault.																								The liftmen are often sent on personal errands by the doctors themselves, alleged PWD assistant engineer Shiv Gopal Ojha. How can you blame them for that? he demanded of the hospital management, refusing to add which doctor would have a personal errand to run at 6.30 am, when the incident occurred.																								Moumita Kundu died at the hospital on Sunday, hours after she was forced to climb up from the emergency ward to the X-ray lab on the first floor. Neither of the two liftmen on duty was there.																								Monday began with SSKM Hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi asking Ojha to appear for an inquiry. Ojha turned up but maintained that both the liftmen were on duty, forcing Tripathi to ask for the roster and the names of the two on duty on Sunday morning.																								Ojha left, promising to be back with the names, but never showed up. Using sources in the PWD, the hospital authorities found out who the absconding liftmen were.																								A preliminary inquiry found both Dhara and Naskar prima facie guilty. A report was then sent to the health department, to be forwarded to the PWD. Stern action was recommended against the duo.																								PWD minister Amar Chaudhuri was evasive. We will conduct a fair probe If found guilty, they will face the consequences, he told reporters at Writers Buildings. Back at SSKM, Ojha remained hopeful that his subordinates would be exonerated.

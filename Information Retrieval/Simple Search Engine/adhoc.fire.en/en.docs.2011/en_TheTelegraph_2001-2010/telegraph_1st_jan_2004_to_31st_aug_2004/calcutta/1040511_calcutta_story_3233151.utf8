 Tuesday, May 11, 2004  Chill-out campaignSANGITA S. GUHA ROY, HIMIKA CHAUDHURI A woman and her children dig into the buffet spread at Starstruck on Mothers Day. Picture by Rashbehari Das															Monday morning blues were traded for red, saffron and green as the city was treated to an extended weekend. Not surprisingly, it was a different sort of partying at the happening spots around town as people proceeded to chill after witnessing the gruelling fight for hot seats. 																					Even firebrand activist and Congress candidate Nafisa Ali was seen taking a break at Starstruck, the resto-bar in Forum. Victory in mind  maybe, not quite  a power lunch is what she opted for. Vegetable and egg fried rice accompanied with Schzewan chilli chicken, crunchy crispy lamb, a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and some coffee seemed to do the trick for her before she took to the road again with party workers.																					There was no mistaking which side skipper Sourav Ganguly was on as he trooped into Chinoiserie at The Taj for lunch in his flaming red Merc, parents, brother, wife and kid in tow and opted for his usual shrimps. 																					Yet others voted for the two-day spa package at ITC Sonar Bangla, hoping to make the most of the bonus holiday, checking in on Friday and staying over till Monday, de-stressing in the sylvan surroundings of Sonar Spa. 																					Lunch and dinner were promising as well with a Punjabi food fest on at Eden Pavilion. More so as neighbouring counterpart Hyatt Regency stood out like an independent candidate, registering quite a low footfall. 																					Anticipating a low turn-out, most eateries like Mainland China and Kewpies chose to remain closed, while others like Grain of Salt opened to a lazy evening hoping to capitalise on the holiday mood. 																					The brew was better at Atrium, The Park, as an enthusiastic bunch dropped by post-lunch to wash down the poll hangover with steaming cuppas. Nafisa Ali.												Mamma meal																					Calcuttans hardly need an excuse to eat out. And if they do find one, theres no stopping them.																					Astor decided to make the most of this on Sunday on the occasion of Mothers Day. Offering a sumptuous family buffet for Rs 225 (plus taxes) per head, Ravindra Palta, general manager, Astor, explained the significance of the day: What began in ancient Greece as a spring celebration to honour Rhea, the mother of gods, has become a popular festival all over the world today. Every year, the second Sunday in May is dedicated to mothers and celebrated as Mothers Day.																					At Astor, children turned up to treat their mommies to a special meal  while the rest of the family had to pay for the dinner, the mothers meal was complimentary, along with a rose.																					Spotted digging into the delicious fare comprising Russian Salad, Coleslaw, Chicken Hawaiian Salad, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Mutton Kasha, Fish Chaman, Paneer Makhani, Chana Palak, Kashmiri Dum Aloo, Dal Makhani, Mixed Raita, Peas Pulao, naan and desserts like Gulab Jamun and ice cream were TV actor Mahima Mukherjee and family.																					The mother-daughter duo of Banani and Annie Ghosh seemed to be having a whale of time. Motherhood is the greatest gift of god, said a beaming Banani. I cannot think beyond Ma, said 20-year-old college student Annie, hugging her mother.																					The days delight continued at Starstruck, Forum, as mothers with kids in tow were out to enjoy the special buffet for Rs 250 per person, after catching a movie at INOX. While moms were mostly nonchalant, their children seemed acutely aware of the implications of the big day.																					I made my mother a big card with a family photograph pasted on it this morning, said 14-year-old Pavni. This is a day to thank our mothers for everything they do for us, added her younger brother, Gursaheb.																					At Starstruck, the offer went like this  for a party of four, including a mother, the mothers meal was complimentary. Not just that, mothers were asked to fill in lucky draw coupons promising prizes like a diamond from Ishis, a silk scarf from Satya Paul and free meals.

Thats exactly what the nine finalists who were short-listed from 2,000-odd entries in eastern India did at the regional finals of a mega microwave cookery contest.																					ed Samsung Spice of Life, this contest has been hunting for the best recipes in microwave cooking all across the country.																					On the day of the big fight on May 8, our Calcutta ladies came armed with not just their culinary skills but also with a conviction to become regional champs.																					Starting right from 10 in the morning, the ladies cooked a full sit-down lunch from starters to the main course and then on to the desserts. One could cook anything from the most mundane to the most exotic, but the only two criteria were that the recipes had to be original and the dish had to be cooked in a microwave. 																					I think the microwave has not just made cooking easier, its also made cooking a fun thing. Now, everyone from the eight-year-old child of the house to the husband can take part in the cooking process, making it a family affair, said celebrity cookbook writer Tarla Dalal who, along with actor Chaiti Ghosal, judged the nine finalists.																					This is the first time Im judging a cookery contest and Im taking a little bit of time to decide on the marking, but I am enjoying this thoroughly, said Chaiti who confessed that cooking, for her, is confined to a few stray days when guests drop in.																					But Ive picked up a few good recipes today which Im going to bombard on my son and husband soon enough, promised Chaiti, digging into her favourite fare of the day, Parwal ki Payesh.																					a Dalal seemed impressed by most of the food formulae that the Calcutta cooks had come up with. Though the veteran food expert agreed that cooking today has changed from what it used to be when she started her cookery classes way back in 1966, she stressed the need to eat food that would help a person stay fit and feel younger.																					A difficult judging session over, the final verdict was out. While Imon Sarkar grabbed the culinary crown in the starters segment with Swoop-a-Soup, Mithu Das topped the list in the main course category with her delicious Prawn Dopiaza, and Subha Banerjee swept the dessert stakes with her innovative Parwal ki Payesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Polished poise for pageant pretties
 The girls being grilled at the sub-contest round at Dublin on Saturday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								It may have just been the fruit of one weeks labour, but the 20 Sananda Tilottama hopefuls have shown what sheer hard work can achieve. The difference in their appearance and carriage, thanks to a gruelling grooming schedule, is startling.																								The finalists were all confidence and poise at the sub-category contest on Saturday at Dublin. Competing in the Godrej Renew Sananda Tilottama pageant, the girls fought it out at the ITC Sonar Bangla nightclub for the Miss Bedazzled, Beautiful Eyes, Skin, Hair, Smile and Congeniality titles.																								It was hard to compare these polished contestants with the fumbling lot at the pre-selection round. I am a slave master, smiles Sanchita of The Dream Merchants, in charge of the grooming regimen. The sessions start at 8 am with a health food breakfast, followed by aqua aerobics and gym at Solace. Some of the girls have lost as much as three kilos in the past week, gushes Sanchita.																								After the workouts at the south Calcutta spa, the girls are subject to lessons on catwalk, corrective speech, diction, poise and posture, make-up, dressing, etiquette, table manners, meditation, pranic healing and even interior decoration and career counselling by in-house and guest faculties, including ex-Tilottamas.																								The idea is not just to train them to be beauty queens but to be well-rounded women, adds Sanchita. And the contestants did her proud as they sailed through tricky questions like What would you gift your husband on your wedding night and why, If your husband compares your smile with a stone, what would it be and What do you understand by perfection, posed by the four judges  actress Sudipta Chakraborty, singer Shilajit, gynaecologist Anubha Chakraborty and fashion designer Chhuti. 																								The high point of the show was the Miss Bedazzled round (sponsored by M.P. Jewellers), where finalists, clad in jeans and black tubes, sported intricate yet unconventional gold jewellery encrusted with precious and semi-precious stones like onyx, diamond and blue and yellow sapphire. The look, by contrast, was quite bare in the subsequent rounds, with the girls changing into white spaghetti tops.																								But the results are still under wraps till the grand finale on April 28, as they dont want to kill the suspense or give the select few a big head prior to the finals. 						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

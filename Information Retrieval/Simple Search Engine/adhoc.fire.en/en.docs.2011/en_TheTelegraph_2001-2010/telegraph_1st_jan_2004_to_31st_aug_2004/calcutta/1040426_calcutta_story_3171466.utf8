 POWER DISH: A child is explained the workings of a solar-power generator at Energy Park. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryD. Ghosh Choudhury: In order to use renewable energy, solar panels, generators and other gadgets have to be installed in individual homes. There are risks of mechanical faults. Who will maintain and repair them?																																																													Thats a pertinent question. Developed countries like Sweden, Germany and the US, where the use of non-conventional energy is nearly 30 per cent of the total power generation, have adopted an all-out approach to familiarise people with the repair and maintenance of the gadgets. They have formed green clubs in different zones that interact and help each other tackle any problem. We will have to set up similar organisations. Presently, I feel that for the entire effort to succeed, we need a well-planned and well-knitted policy so that people can switch easily from conventional energy to the non-conventional variety.

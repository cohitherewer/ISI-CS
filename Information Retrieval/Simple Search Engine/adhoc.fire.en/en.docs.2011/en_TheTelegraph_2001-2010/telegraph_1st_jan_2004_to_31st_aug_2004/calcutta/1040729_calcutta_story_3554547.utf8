 Fare weather: The taxi stand at Howrah station at night Apropos the report Needless tests that drain the wallet, June 30, and the subsequent outburst of Surjya Kanta Mishra against doctors advising extra investigations for commercial gain, a doctor usually listens to a patients complaint, examines him and forms a provisional diagnosis.  On the basis of his findings, he advises certain laboratory investigations to confirm the diagnosis before deciding on the final course of treatment. No doctor can advise a battery of irrelevant tests blindly, without examining the patient clinically. For example, a patient suffering from a headache cannot be sent for ultrasonography of abdomen or an MRI of the hip joint.  We are lucky to have investigative tools at our disposal to pinpoint the disease. A couple of decades ago patients had to suffer a lot at the hands of physicians treating only on the basis of clinical diagnosis.  I remember a patient who was put on psychiatric treatment for years while he had a tumour in the cervical region of the spinal cord, which used to result in periodical paralysis of his limbs. The neurologists diagnosis was multiple sclerosis. Both psychiatrist and neurologist were proved wrong.  The point of discussion should be how to reduce the cost of these investigations and not how to avoid them. Instead of blaming doctors for extra investigations, the health minister should try to stop commercialisation of even the government hospitals.  Poor patients used to get tests done in government hospitals free of cost but now they have to pay as private agencies are being given charge of laboratories in state-run hospitals. Putting doubts in the minds of patients about the intentions of doctors will only deteriorate the doctor-patient relationship and help nobody. Dr Ram Dayal Dubey,
Joint secretary, Indian Medical Association (Headquarters) Apropos the report Crooked cabbies sleaze station, June 29, it is true that taxi drivers demand exorbitant charges from passengers late at night while the law-keepers look away. This happens at both Sealdah and Howrah stations. The government should safeguard the interest of passengers against such harassment. Rabindra Nath Kar,
Sankar Ghosh LanePassengers reaching Sealdah after 10 pm are fleeced due to an unhealthy nexus of cops, cabbies and touts. GRP officials defend themselves on the plea that public complaints are few and far between. But passengers do not dare to complain as this usually invites more trouble than the desired remedy. When will something be done? Govinda Bakshi,
Budge Budge Apropos the report Blood on the soiree ground (June 29), it is sad that two innocent people were murdered over a simple altercation during Ulta Rath celebrations. The sordid incident is another pointer that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees oasis of peace is now overrun with murder, dacoity, rape, molestation and eve-teasing. Prahlad Agarwala,
Majdia, Nadia The report Cheap clinical tests for slum-dwellers, June 23, was reassuring. The news is welcome not only for slum-dwellers, but will also help the citys hygienic condition. Kudos to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Rotary Club and the NGOs involved. Anil Kumar Sen,
Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane The report Toxin link to brain tumour, June 23, depicts a serious health hazard for the 40-49 age group. Calcuttans are at a larger risk as pollution is on the rise and astonishingly, the transport department appears to be nonchalant about the issue. When will the government rise to the occasion? Sunil Banerjee,
VIP Road That Subrata Sens Hothat Neerar Jonyo ran into trouble with the censor board again shows that Indians are not considered grown-ups and the censor board likes to play moral police (Sudden scissorhands slap for Neera, June 29). For heavens sake, let the viewer decide what he wants to see. Kalyan Ghosh,
Park Street Kudos to Ramakrishna Math and Mission for introducing educational programmes in Howrah correctional home to reform prisoners (Math training, The City Diary, June 29). Prisoners are not born criminals. Most of them look for opportunities to change for the better and lead normal lives. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
Behala

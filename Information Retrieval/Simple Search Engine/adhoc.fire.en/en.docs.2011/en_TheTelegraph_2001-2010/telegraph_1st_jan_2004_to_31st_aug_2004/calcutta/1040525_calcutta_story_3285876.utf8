 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Puff peril for her: stroke and cancer 
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Women in the city face a greater risk of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis and heart attack. They are also falling prey to the killer C faster than the men. And the peril, warn doctors, lies in the puff.																								With the number of women smokers rising alarmingly, the warning has been issued in the countdown to World Anti-Tobacco Day on May 31.																								Recent medical research data available with the health department reveals that the average age of women smokers falling prey to cancer in the city is 52.5 years, as compared to 60 years for the men.																								The risk of heart attack among women smokers using oral contraceptives is also 10 times greater than for non-smokers.																								Women who smoke one to four cigarettes a day face a 2.5-fold increased risk of fatal coronary heart disease than their male counterparts. And smoking during pregnancy can affect the intellectual ability of the child.																								Armed with the dire data, doctors have embarked on a mission to dissuade women patients from smoking. Women are increasingly climbing up the ladder in the corporate world, but most have taken to smoking, which they feel helps them ease the tension and handle pressure better. But its a costly bargain in the end, says onco-surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay.																								In the past 12 months, Mukhopadhyay has been visited at the Bengal Oncology Centre by at least eight to 10 women cancer patients every month, with a heavy history of smoking, compared to hardly two to five patients two years ago.																								Cardiac surgeon Ajay Kaul has two premature newborns with congenital heart defects admitted at the BM Birla Heart Research Centre. In both cases, the mothers were heavy smokers. They have both admitted that what they have done is totally wrong, but it is too late now, said Kaul.																								Smoking has been seen to cause more harm to women than men due to the effect of nicotine, which negates the effect of hormones that otherwise genetically help a women fight diseases, added Kaul.																								Regular smoking leads to atherosclerosis in women, causing deposition of fatty substances, cholesterol, cellular waste products and calcium build-up along the inner lining of an artery, ultimately leading to reduced blood flow.

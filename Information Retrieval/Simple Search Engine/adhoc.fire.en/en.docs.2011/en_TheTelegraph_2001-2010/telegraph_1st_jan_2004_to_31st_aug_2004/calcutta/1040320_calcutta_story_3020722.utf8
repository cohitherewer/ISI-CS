				 Summertime amp; all that jazzNondon Bagchi (on drums), Anjum Katyal and Usha Uthup practise for the jazz amp; blues evening. Picture by Aranya Sen Its been billed as the second coming of jazz and blues music, the soul food of Calcutta in the 70s and early 80s, a golden era when the likes of Louis Banks, Braz Gonzales, Pam Crain and Donald Saigal kept Park Street rocking all night long.				 																																																											Six months ago, Blue Moon saw jazz veteran Pam Crain and rhythm n blues queen Anjum Katyal return to stage in a sold-out concert that left the audience screaming for more. Coming on the back of the Jazzfest revival by Congo Square, it successfully broke the dark spell of creative vacuum that had shrouded the citys once-vibrant music scene.				 																																																											Summertime (GD Birla Sabhagar, Monday, 7 pm) is another effort by Calcutta-based musicians and lovers of good music to carry the revival refrain forward. The evening, sponsored by SAF Fermion and presented by Open Doors, will see Usha Uthup singing jazz on a city stage after a lengthy interlude, while Anjum handles the blues in her inimitable style.				 																																																											Itll be great to sing alongside Anjum again before such an amazing audience. Monday will bring a magical dawn to summertime. We need to do this more often, says Usha.				 																																																											The duo, together with a line-up of seasoned musicians (Sumit Ramachandran on guitar, Debabrata Mitra on keyboards, Nondon Bagchi on drums and Willy Walters on bass) will give Calcuttans the experience of a stage concert the way it used to be in those good ol days. Part of the proceeds will go to CHIP (Children in Pain), an NGO working with deprived children of Tangra and Dhapa and with corporation schools in Mumbai.				 																																																											Nondon, who has kept his drum-kit beating through the general lull in live music during the 90s, doesnt feel the void was due to any cultural cross-currents. Yes, the craze for canned music got stronger and DJs took over where the bands once ruled supreme. But essentially, it all boils down to individual effort and there werent enough people to get the job done, triggering the free-fall, observes the ex-High drummer, looking forward to playing in front of a live concert-hall audience.				 																																																											If Nondon and the rest of the band are confident this storied city will again respond to a quality product, Shomenath Roy Chowdhury of SAF Fermion, driving the engine room of the jazz-and-blues project, is keen to take the song ahead. We are looking to sponsor four to five such gigs a year and our aim is to showcase a Calcutta band on a national platform with the message that good music is alive and kicking here, says Roy Chowdhury. Also on his agenda is unearthing and encouraging fresh talent in town.				 																																																											Monday evenings set will feature an interesting mix of blues, R amp;B and jazz (not avant garde, more vocal-centric and no fancy trumpets). From a funky version of Summertime to Blue Prelude, Im in the Mood for Love, All Too Soon and This Masquerade  the menu is as eclectic as nostalgic. Subhro Saha				 																																									 The horsemen of Genghis Khan swore by its vitality, as did the Russian cosmonauts aboard the spaceship MIR. These days, the Indian Army endorses the healing and energising qualities of seabuckthorn, a fruit found in the Himalayan peaks of the Ladakh region. And now, its trying to find a place on breakfast tables in town. 				 																																																											Mythically believed to be the Sanjivani Buti, that finds reference in The Ramayana, seabuckthorn is now available as bottled juices throughout the country. Produced by Ladakh Foods Ltd under the brand name of Leh Berry, the product has been developed by DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), that has a technical collaboration with the company.				 																																																											The fruit-growing regions are protected areas under the DRDO, says Ajay Kumar, general manager, sales and marketing, Ladakh Foods. As a result of this collaboration, Ladakh Foods has to sell 20 per cent of its total produce to the defence sector.				 																																																											The fruit, rich in vitamins A, B1, B2, C, E and K, is recommended for soldiers posted at high altitudes. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam discovered more than 100 uses of this fruit when he was the chief of DRDO, reveals Kumar.				 																																																											Keeping the Indian jawan going is priority number one. The DRDO has recommended a ration of 300ml of seabuckthorn fruit juice for each soldier a day, which helps check respiratory problems and fatigue due to a high level of vitamin K found in the fruit. The fact that this is the only fruit juice that does not freeze at even minus 40 degrees Centigrade also works in its favour. We supplied 1,20,000 litres of seabuckthorn fruit juice to the defence sector last year, stresses Kumar.				 																																																											The juices are supplied from the Bhopal unit of the Godrej Industries Ltd, with whom Ladakh Foods has a packaging contract. From here the tetrapacks are despatched to the defence depots at Ladakh, Jammu and Srinagar.				 																																																											Currently, Leh Berry is available in three flavours  Seabuckthorn, Fruit Mix (a combination of apple, guava, banana, mango, papaya and seabuckthorn) and PeachApp (apple and peach)  with prices lower than the competition, thanks to special subsidies.				 																																																											But will the army mans ration find favour with the civilian? Sangita S. Guha Roy				 																																																											Rediff Radio has two channels. Channel 1 features exclusively produced RJ shows, and Channel 2, the non-stop music library. The shows include Bollywood gossip, nostalgia and cricket. Unlimited access to the channels, an ad-free environment, and interactive programming are what Rediff hopes will help the service sell.				 																																																											On the technology front, Rediff Radio uses a dedicated network of caching servers deployed in the US to ensure fast and reliable streaming and crystal clear audio.Sutapa Talukdar and her troupe perform at a programme to celebrate the centenary of National Library on its campus. Picture by Aranya Sen				 																																									 Crossing borders that are lined with barbed wire, manned by heavily-armed guards and journeying without even the basic necessities through hostile territory is often the only chance at life for some people. It is the celebration of the human spirit, as much as the struggle for survival, that is in focus at the ongoing photography exhibition at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre. 				 																																																											Borders and Beyond features the works of 10 cameramen from different conflict zones around the world, where desperation born of reasons ranging from poverty and oppression to race and religion, drives people to risk their lives on a daily basis in the hope of something better. On till April 30, the exhibition also contains a set of accompanying publications, with commentaries on these refugees and immigrants.				 																																																											The black-and-white stills highlight the contrasts between those in power and the victims, serving as a stark reminder of the often-unseen harsh realities of life.				 																																																											Some of the images are obvious  the battered and bruised body of a young boy affected by the Serb-Albanian conflict in Kosovo, or the coffin of a young girl who failed while trying to cross the Mexican border into the US.				 																																																											Others are more subtle  a toothbrush and a pair of undergarments lying unclaimed in the desert sun or a torn shoe almost buried by dry weeds and overgrown grass, Palestinian schoolgirls being escorted by Israeli soldiers, a youth from Mozambique jumping off a moving train while being transported back to his flooded homeland from South Africa, Tibetan families fleeing the Chinese Red Guard through snowstorms and across barren landscapes				 																																																											The exhibition is moving, as each section is introduced with a brief outline of the regions problems, like the civil war in Cyprus, the background of the Chinese community in San Francisco and the history of the former Soviet state of Transdniestria. The figures are an indication of the rising problems and the lack of solutions  in 1999, 3,000 Morrocans made their way across the Stait of Gibralter, to Spain. In 2000, the number rose to 15,000.				 																																																											Along with the exhibition will be a series of events through April and May, including seminars and a film festival.

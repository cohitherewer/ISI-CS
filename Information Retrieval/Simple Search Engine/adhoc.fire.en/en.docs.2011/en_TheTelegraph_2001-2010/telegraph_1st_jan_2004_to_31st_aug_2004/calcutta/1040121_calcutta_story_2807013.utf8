The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 A riot of colours
All nature is but art, unknown to thee,/ All chance, direction which thou canst not see;/ All discord, harmony not understood/ All partial evil, universal good/ And spite of pride, in erring reasons spite/ One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right  Alexander Pope																								Of those many obsessions Calcuttans have, art happens to be a major one. As a result, both senior and upcoming artists consider this place a mecca for exhibiting their works. Hence, exhibitions continue, round the year; some good and memorable ones, some eminently forgettable ones. Galerie La Meres Annual 2004 showcases brilliant paintings, drawings and sculptures of renowned artists including Aditya Basak, Amal Chakladar, Amitava Banerjee, Amitava Dhar, Ashoke Mallick, B.R. Panesar, Debabrata Chakraborti, Hiran Mitra, Jogen Choudhuri, Kishore Chatterjee, Krishna Bandyopadhyay, Munindra Rajbongshi, Nandadulal Mukherjee, Niranjan Pradhan, Paritosh Sen, Partha Pratim Deb, Rabin Mondal, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Ramlal Dhar, Sanat Kar, Shakila, Shyamal Dutta Roy, Siddhartha Sengupta, Suhas Roy, Suktisubhra Pradhan and Wasim Kapoor.																								When: Till January 22; 4 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie La Mere, 3 Regent Park

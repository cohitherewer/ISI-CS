 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Liluah inmate flees
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Fifteen-year-old Bandana Singha and her caretaker, Mona Kulai, escaped from Howrah district hospital, where Bandana was taken for treatment from the Liluah home for destitute women on March 4.																								Inquiries at the hospital revealed that Bandana was brought there with deep scratches on her body, allegedly caused by a fight with other inmates in the home. She had almost recovered completely from her injuries. We dont know why she suddenly took off. She seemed quite happy here, said a hospital official.																								Bandana was brought to the Liluah home after being rescued from a city brothel two months ago. Officials at the home were tightlipped about her escape.																								We are aware that a lot of clandestine activity takes place at the Liluah home. Thats nothing new. The girl has escaped from hospital. We cannot divulge any more information. Please speak to the superintendent of police, said an officer of the local police station. However, superintendent Mihir Bhattacharya was unavailable for comment.																								I have not been informed about any such incident as yet, but if it is true that an inmate of the Liluah home has escaped from Howrah district hospital, I will look into the matter. In fact, an inquiry will be initiated tomorrow, said S. Kishore, Howrahs district magistrate.																								The Liluah Home has notched up quite a reputation: its inmates are allegedly tortured and exploited by the home authorities, according to a number of victims, who have submitted several written statements to the district authorities.																								There have been several instances where inmates who failed to escape attempted suicide. The homes figures of unnatural deaths are staggering.

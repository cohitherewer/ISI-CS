The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 Festive fare: jewels for the Pujas, rags for RakhiZeeshan Jawed, Himika ChaudhuriDrape dazzleThe look: Sensuous, sophisticated. Actress Nelanjana Bhowmick sashays in yards of georgette designed by Rupam Banerjee ( by Pabitra Das). The outfit: Turquoise blue and red georgette sari with a golden bustier. The border flaunts silver sequins, zardosi and thread work, while the body is done up with coloured sequins and kundan stones. Set off by heavy kundan necklace and danglers set in white gold and make-up by Prabir De.Designer drool: Red complements Nelanjanas earthy tone. I wanted classy, not in-your-face glamour, for her, says Rupam, who retails from Soul, her store at 23, Chakraberia Lane. Every year, the build up to the Pujas seems to get longer and more hectic. The scene of the rush is jewellery stores, with brands trying to be first of the block to catch the ladies eye with a spread of gold and diamonds.Just in time is Ashwini Kumar Mehrasons, a 79-year-old jewellery brand, which launched their young and vibrant range of jewellery christened Kasmia on Monday, to be available at leading stores. The jewellers are present in all the major cities of the country and have created quite a name for themselves before foraying into the Calcutta market.While the company has specialised so far largely in traditional ornaments, they are now gearing up to enter the territory of unconventional jewellery due to rising demands in this segment. So, the new line has been created keeping in mind the individuality of the Indian woman.Ashwini Kumar Mehrasons, formerly known as Mehra di Hatti, moved base to Delhi after Independence and has been working with a niche clientele ever since. The collection includes necklaces, rings and bangles which come with a price tag of Rs 20,000 and above. Any Kasmia piece  and there are plenty to choose from  is studded with highest quality bright diamonds and precious stones.Ties that bind(From top) Indrani Halder at the launch of Ford Shoes new Rashbehari outlet, models flaunt M amp;S ensembles and the spread at China Bistro. Pictures by Rashbehari Das  Yet another excuse to splurge  Rakhi. The sundry festive collections on offer would make it seem that the true spirit of the festival is the gifts that go along with the family ties. The mother-daughter designer duo of Saroj and Megha Dalmia has also stepped up to the challenge of wooing all the sisters and their bros into the fold. Retailing from their New Alipore boutique called M amp;S, which is also the label under which they sell, the Dalmias count wearability and affordability as their main selling points. The cosy boutique replete with piped music and a hookah dcor sets the mood for some unconventional styles with wool, beads, sequins and mother of pearl embellishments.The outfits range from ethnic to Indo-western. Their long skirts in Thai silk and fine cotton teamed with colourful shirt-style tops and waist belts work well for the 30-plus age bracket. Projections for the yuppie brigade include short skirts embellished with beads and patch work along with poncho-style georgette tops to match.Mirror work, kantha, beads and sequins are generously used to dramatic effect as well. Salwar-kurta sets, hand-painted kurtis and saris complete a prospective wardrobe.Mens wear forms a thoughtful final note. Crepe, cotton and linen shirts in solids and stripes are some of the pop picks in this segment. Theyve chosen to jazz up the stuff with metal studs around the collar and cuff area.China check Chopsuey might not have its roots in Chinese cuisine (it originated, apparently, in the United States in the late 19th Century), but then it is no less popular then its authentic Chinese rivals.The regular Chinese-American dish consists of small pieces of meat, chicken or shrimp stir-fried with onions, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, mushrooms and other vegetables, served over rice, usually flavoured with soya sauce.But now you can take a break from the regular fare and savour some special variations of this dish at China Bistro, a Chinese and Italian restaurant, which is holding a chopsuey festival at its 119A M.A. Ahmed Road address.China Bistro is my second Chinese restaurant after Pepper Chino simply because Calcuttans love Chinese cuisine. And I always opt for dish-oriented festivals to provide my customers with a lot of variety, explained R. Dewan, who is also the owner of Don Giovanis, the Italian and Chinese food delivery specialists.The chopsuey festival will continue for two weeks, at economic prices between Rs 125 to Rs 165 a plate.The meat eaters, as usual, have a wide variety of yummies to choose from. Chopsuey with Chicken cooked with Vegetables in Hunan Style, Rice Chopsuey with Roast Pork in Spicy Devils Sauce and Rice Chopsuey with Chicken and Shrimp in Oyster Sauce are some of the varieties that have been devised. The fare for the veggies is equally mouth watering with Chopsuey with Shredded Vegetables in Chilli Garlic Sauce and Chopsuey with Assorted Vegetables in Manchurian Style being some of them.

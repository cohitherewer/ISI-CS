The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Family destination for a fee
 															- Rejuvenation amp; relaxation motto of five-storey leisureplex A STAFF REPORTER																								A novel nine-hole putting indoor mini-golf course, temperature-controlled swimming pool, gym, spa, yoga and meditation centre, 3-D video-game facilities, pub, nightclub, banquet hall, business centre, winery and more, all under one roof. The countrys first leisureplex is ready to rock the lifestyle landscape in Calcutta.																								The five-storey, 30,000-sq-ft complex, named Ocio (leisure in Spanish), is halfway through construction on Belvedere Road, bordering the Agri-Horticulture Gardens in Alipore, with the swimming pool, gym and spa set to make a splash on May Day.																								The rest will follow in the next few months. The adults, kids and aqua aerobics pools and the rain shower (a simulated downpour) are housed on the first and second floors, but located at basement level. The sweat zone  gym and spa  is on the third floor, on ground level.																								The banquet hall will have Dolby sound, and the pub is adjacent to the Par 21 golf course  to double as a nightclub after dark. The gym, where lots of elbow room is the trademark, promises state-of-the-art trekking and cardio-vascular equipment, with individual LCD monitors and headphones. The gym, yoga and meditation centres have personal trainers, with a massage parlour thrown in.																								The winery, in a thatched-roof hut on the terrace, overlooks the horticulture gardens, with a caf on a lower floor. The business centre will be open for conferences, and the multi-event hall will be hired out for parties. For the little ones, there will be a specialised play area, while the teenagers will have a 3-D computer games zone.																								Rejuvenation and relaxation is the key, according to S.S. Kanoria, of Kanoria Chemicals, the Calcuttan behind the Rs 18-crore mission. Its a family destination that provides something for everyone  for a fee.																								The promotional price for an annual membership at Ocio is Rs 35,000 per person and Rs 45,000 per couple, including children, for the use of one facility. The swim-and-sweat membership is Rs 50,000 for an individual and Rs 60,000 for a couple. There are also provisions for corporate memberships.																								Around 300 memberships are expected in the first year. Future plans include reciprocal memberships in other clubs and concept-based programmes and activities, like personality development workshops.

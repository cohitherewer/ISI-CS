The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 07, 2004  Software for softwear SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND SOMA BANERJEE
 A model at the Moustache fashion show at the Taj Bengal. Picture by Rashbehari DasDhoti-kurta has finally gone hi-tech. Even though mens wear designer Sharbari Datta seldom uses a computer and is not at all net savvy, she has now claimed her share of cyberspace.																					Sharbari launched her corporate website www.sharbaridatta.com, designed and hosted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, on Tuesday amid much fan fare. Though she was yet to take a good look at the site, the designer was misty eyed and overcome by patriotic feelings at being given the chance to showcase Indian styles and craftsmanship abroad.																					ook at the site promised easy navigation with separate sections on the designers work, background, media coverage, celebrity clients, contacts and even the inspiration behind her creations. PricewaterhouseCoopers is honoured to be part of a Calcutta entrepreneurs endeavour to go global. This is an excellent match between software and softwear, said managing director Roopen Roy at the companys Salt Lake office on Tuesday.																					Patriotism apart, Sharbari was visibly excited about going global herself. Her label Sharbari is being launched formally by a San Francisco-based event management company, KMP (Kala Music and Play) in the coming months. The city-based Sharbari will also go globe-trotting to promote the brand. I am going to New York, New Jersey, San Francisco and Houston, by their invitation, for the first phase of the promotion, says Sharbari.																					This might explain the haste to put up a website, enlisting the help of the IT major, though it is still some time before online purchases are an option. Her existing global customer base also makes Internet presence imperative. I have clients all over the world, from places as diverse as Tokyo, Seychelles and West Asia, and they have been requesting me to come up with a website for more information on my work, she explains.																					The site is not the only new feature in Sharbaris repertoire. After being considered the first designer to specialise in traditional Indian mens wear and priding herself for lending couture status to the humble dhoti, Sharbari is launching a western and indo-western line to keep up with the times.																					She is also continuing her crusade to help men accessorise, having ventured into mens jewellery. Now she is adding the dazzle of diamonds to her gold neckpieces, cufflinks and even kamarbands.																					But without the e-commerce component is the website just a teaser for out-of-towners? It seems so, at least till the planned second phase of the site is up and clicking. Sharbari Datta checks out her website at Pricewaterhouse Coopers on Tuesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Macho misfit																					 Its about time Moustache did something to reposition itself. The brand with a macho name has more on its racks for women than men, as was unveiled at its spring summer collection at Incognito on Monday night. The new collection has little novelty and is still lagging behind, failing to pick up on the latest style trends. The designs presented were the same old boot-cut jeans with little innovation in finish or embellishment. 																					But the collection does include a lot of season-appropriate cottons and chinos. Capris and denim hot pants for women are other draws. Jeans are available in straight fits, regular fits and boot-cuts in ice-wash and worn-out finishes. Stretch jeans are only available in straight fits, and there is a collection of cargos for men and women.																					A wide range of tops are also part of the line. Classic check shirts for men and bias stripe shirts for women pass muster, which the short kurtas do not. 																																													Warp and weft																					 Banana leaves, hemp and pineapple fibres were a few of the unusual materials on show at a handloom exhibition that concluded on Tuesday at Identity Gallery.																					Cotton bleached saris with pallus using extra weft made of banana fibre were a novel inclusion at the sale organised by Sujata Sarawgi, bringing weavers from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar to the city. Prabha Nagarajans label, Prana, from Tamil Nadu uses banana fibres to add texture to cotton saris in off-white and cream. Priced between Rs 500 and Rs 650, the saris can be dyed and printed in various hues. Washable banana fibre mats and eye-catching tussar from Maharashtra saw many buyers as well.																					Vegetable-dyed fabrics woven in pit loom with dyed koria in warp and tussar in weft have given birth to beautiful silks priced between Rs 1,800 and Rs 3,600. Suit lengths in Pashmina texture range from Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,800. From Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh came a huge collection of kosa silks and tissue saris with zari lining. Spun tussar and matka from Bhagalpur and Gichha silks were also on display. Other interesting saris on sale included tribal embroidery and zardosi on cotton.

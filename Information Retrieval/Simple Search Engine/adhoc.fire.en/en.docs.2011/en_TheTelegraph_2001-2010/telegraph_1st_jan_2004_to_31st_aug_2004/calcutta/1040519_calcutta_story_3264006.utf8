 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Disappearance, not death, father tells court
 TAPAS GHOSH																								The father of a woman, who died on May 14, 2001, has demanded a CBI inquiry into the disappearance of his daughter. 																								Shyam Sundar Nag (30), son of a businessman and a resident of the Maniktala area, owns large tracts of prime land on VIP Road. In 1994, he married Jaba, then 24. But a couple of years later, the marriage soured.																								Jaba moved Amta court in 1996, seeking maintenance from her husband, although she stayed with him. On May 13, 2001, Jaba allegedly poured kerosene on herself and set herself on fire. She was admitted to NRS Medical College and Hospital. The next day, she succumbed to her burns.																								Her husband found out that Jaba had made a dying declaration at the hospital around 5 pm, two hours before she was admitted there, blaming him and her in-laws for her death.																								Despite Jabas reported declaration, neither was a post-mortem ordered, nor was any report suggesting torture submitted with the police. Nonetheless, Maniktala police registered a case against Shyam Sundar, which prompted him to go underground.																								For the next three years, he remained underground to evade arrest. He, however, continued to pursue his case through lawyers and tried to reason with the police, without result.																								On Monday, Shyam Sundar and his father-in-law, Tusthi Pada Pal, moved Calcutta High Court demanding a CBI inquiry into the disappearance of Jaba Nag  and not her death  in hospital. 																								My clients wife is alive and has been kept in hiding by some persons with vested interests in keeping her and my client away from their house and property, which is worth several crores of rupees, said Abdur Rehman, advocate for Shyam Sundar. 																								During the hearing, Rehman said that on April 2, Justice S.K. Gupta of Calcutta High Court had awarded maintenance to Jaba, which she had demanded in 1996. How can maintenance be awarded to somebody if she is not alive? This is the point we wanted to raise, advocate Rehman argued.																								To substantiate their conspiracy theory, Rehman has submitted a list of his clients properties where multi-storeyed apartments have come up without any clearance from Shyam Sundar. We strongly suspect that Shyam Sundars close relatives are behind the game. They have deliberately framed him and abducted his wife so that they can appropriate the property, Rehman alleged in court.																								Hearing the pleas, Justice Shankar Prasad Mitra set aside the arrest warrant issued by Sealdah court against Shyam Sundar in 2001 and asked the court to submit all relevant documents of the case for a thorough inquiry.

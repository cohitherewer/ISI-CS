 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Sushmita case in high court
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Finally, the Sushmita Dhar disappearance case has reached Calcutta High Court. 																								Additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami on Tuesday moved a petition seeking an order setting aside the verdict of the Alipore district sessions judge, who refused to grant the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) prayer seeking custody of the three accused. All three were sent to jail by a sub-divisional judicial magistrate of the same court. 																								Justice D.P. Sengupta, hearing the matter, refused to pass any ex-parte order and directed the state to serve notices to the three accused  Debanjan Das, Rajib Chowdhury and Suparna Banerjee  through the authorities of Alipore Central and Presidency jails.																								Additional public prosecutor Goswami told the court that Sushmita, a Bengali MA student of Jadavpur University, and eight friends had gone to Chandipur on May 13, 1995. 																								On the morning of May 16, Sushmita went missing. Her friends informed her parents in Calcutta and they reached Chandipur the same day.																								Subsequently, the state police had started a case on Section 366 IPC (abduction) against Sushmitas friends, but later exonerated them. 																								After nine years, in 2004, the CID started a fresh case on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees intervention. This time, the CID framed the case on charges of abduction with intent of murder.

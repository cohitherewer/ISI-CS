The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Red stains rip apart Metro repute
 SANJAY MANDAL				 	 A wall mop-up at Chandni station. A Telegraph picture																								Once hailed as one of the cleanest Tubes in the world, Calcuttas Metro Railway reputation now stands stained.																								Spit, cigarette and bidi butts strew the underground, complain the Metro authorities, and the problem has become hard to check, despite campaigns and spot fines targeted at civic-unfriendly commuters.																								With scant cooperation from members of the public, it has become increasingly difficult to protect the citys solitary claim to cleanliness.																								Last year, 683 people were fined for spitting on station walls and littering the place with cigarette and bidi ends. Nearly Rs 2 lakh was collected in spot fines. Till June 2004, over 200 passengers have already been fined.																								Figures show that this year, fewer fines have been slapped for throwing cigarette and bidi ends.																								Last year, there were quite a number of people who were fined for the offence inside the station complex. But this year, there has been only a handful of cases in this category, a Metro Rail spokesperson observed.																								While this could be the result of anti-smoking campaigns, spitting has taken its place as the major concern. 																								Campaigns, fear the authorities, have not been effective at all in reducing consumption of gutka and paan masala. Nor are people more aware of the nuisance they cause with the red stains.																								Even affluent travellers, Metro personnel found, have been regularly spitting on walls, leaving red marks.																								The corners of walls just after passengers come up from the platforms have been identified as the most vulnerable spots. There are also instances of spitting on trains, where vestibules are the most likely spots of choice.																								The Mahatma Gandhi Road, Esplanade and Girish Park stations are the most affected by the problem, and have been the hardest to keep clean.																								The staff members have been mobilised to catch people in the act on platforms. Mobile teams keep a vigil on trains, as well.																								Passenger attitude has been identified as the main stumbling block. Most offenders claim it is a one-off offence that wont occur again, explained officials. In most cases, the people we nab are well-dressed professionals, with mobile phones, added the spokesperson.

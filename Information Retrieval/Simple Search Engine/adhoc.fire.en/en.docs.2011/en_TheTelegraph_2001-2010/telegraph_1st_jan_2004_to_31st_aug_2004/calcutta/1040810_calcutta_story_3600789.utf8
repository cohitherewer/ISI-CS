The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Dressed to dupe, set to steal
 KINSUK BASU At Forum, on Elgin Road. The police are troubled by the new breed of suave women shoplifters operating in the malls UNDER SCAN 
	DANGER ZONE: Mega stops on Park Street and Camac Street, like MusicWorld, Pantaloons, Westside and Vardaan; Elgin Road addresses (C-3, Forum, INOX, Crossword) and Metro Plaza, on Ho Chi Minh SaraniIN PIPELINE
	 A dossier, based on records from adjoining police stations, on the new-age women shoplifters, to be provided to security officers of these malls
	 A pre-Puja emergency meeting by the police to tackle this new breed and thrash out surveillance modalities
	 Special task force, with sleuths in plainclothes, to beef up vigil in these zones. Owners will be asked to cooperate by providing video clips of suspicious movement inside stores																								Stilettos, streaked hair, coloured lips and deft hands. Thinking salons and beauty parlours? Were talking new-age mall-pickers. 																								Meet 24-year-old Parveen Begum, alias Khurshida. A resident of 38/H/6, Suresh Sarkar Street, in Entally, shell stump you with her grace and eloquence. 																								Atop her four-inch high heels, a confident Khurshida will move around a mall, betraying no sign of the purpose of her visit  to grab bags. 																								Her favourite haunts? The malls on Camac Street. 																								On August 2, she had been on her regular prowl and had nearly succeeded in walking away with her booty. But a woman got suspicious and trailed her. Khurshida was finally arrested by plainclothesmen.																								Khurshida turned into a shoplifter after a disturbed marriage and separation from her husband a few years ago. She would lift cash, jewellery, and even credit and debit cards of unsuspecting customers who would leave them at a designated place while doing the rounds. 																								Last week, at one of the two major malls on Camac Street, Khurshida had picked up a womans bag. But luck ran out, as the victim proved smarter than Khurshida. 																								Its not Khurshida alone. Impressively smart, this breed of women  who have been on the prowl at malls, music stores and multiplexes across south Calcutta  has rattled the sleuths. 																								Having dealt with amateur shoplifters so long, officers believe professionals have jumped into the fray. Police have decided to hold a special meeting before the Pujas to discuss ways to tackle the new menace at high-end retail outlets. 																								The problem of women shoplifters, particularly those from well-to-do families, is a cause of concern. We want to check the menace before the Puja shopping spree kicks off, said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (south). 																								Sharma has called an emergency meeting of the officers-in-charge of police stations that have in their areas the big shopping malls and plazas. Besides the usual talk about intensifying vigil, the meeting will discuss how these women shoplifters can be spotted and arrested. 																								One of the options is deployment of more sleuths in plain clothes. If required, police will also supply the security officers of these malls with photographs of the women shoplifters. 																								During peak season, such as the Pujas, it becomes extremely difficult to tackle the situation. Theres little you can do unless the vigil is intensified, said R.S. Rekhi, head of operations (east) of the Pantaloon chain of shops. 																								While most of these shopping addresses have been fitted with cameras and hidden eyes, sleuths believe its time the owners employed trained staff to track suspicious customers inside the stores. 																								Earlier, students would go about stealing bags. But this new breed of woman is all-pro. She knows how to go about her way, said Subrata Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 																								The menace came to light after the arrest of Archana Burman, alias Munmun Hossain. The 30-year-old resident of Prafulla Kanan, Rajarhat, was arrested a month ago from Forum. The hunt began thereafter.

 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Crackdown on traffic truant cops
 PRONAB MANDAL																								The next time you spot a police vehicle flouting a no-entry or no-parking rule, just shout out to the nearest cop.																								For, police themselves are cracking down on lawkeepers-turned-lawbreakers. In a move initiated by city police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty, a special drive will be started against policemen guilty of flouting road-rules.																								At a recent meeting, Chakraborty expressed displeasure at the alarming habit of his officers to disobey and disregard traffic rules, and directed the traffic department to take strong action against errant members of the cop brigade.																								If a policeman is found violating rules, we have been told to take stern action against him, whoever he may be, said an officer of the traffic department.																								With the crackdown call coming from the top, the traffic wing of the city police conducted a string of surprise checks to catch offenders off-guard.																								Several police vehicles driven by our department staff were caught red-handed while violating road restrictions. Most of the cars were caught while being driven in the wrong direction, ignoring no-entry boards. Besides, police vehicles parked in no-parking zones, too, have become a major problem, said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police, traffic department.																								After identifying the drivers of the offending vehicles, we informed their departmental bosses. It was a warning, he added.																								Police will begin surprise checks soon. This time, we will be strict. If any driver is found violating traffic rules we will send his name to his superior to take departmental action against him, explained Basu.																								Police, however, will not impose fines on the drivers. The drivers wont have to pay up. They are constables; if they are fined, the money will be deposited from our own departments fund, explained an official of the traffic department.																								At least 300 traffic sergeants who patrol the streets have been asked to keep a close watch. We were told to inform the control room at Lalbazar police headquarters as soon as we found a vehicle of our own department violating road rules, said a traffic sergeant.																								Commissioner Chakraborty said in the meeting: When a policeman violates traffic norms, he can be described as a most irresponsible person. What worries me is that the trend is increasing. You do something right now.

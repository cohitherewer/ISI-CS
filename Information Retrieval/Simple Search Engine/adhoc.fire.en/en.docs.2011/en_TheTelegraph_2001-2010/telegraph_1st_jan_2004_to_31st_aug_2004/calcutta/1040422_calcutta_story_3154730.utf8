The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 For global citizens, a special school
 															- Flexible education system to develop practical attitude to life A STAFF REPORTER																								Another school to fill the need gap in the city but different in more ways than one  its only for Class XI and XII students, it will follow the London and Cambridge boards and it will have no uniforms for the youngsters. And, The International School already has most of the infrastructural facilities in place, at the Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad, on Shakespeare Sarani.																								The brainchild of Kusum Khemani, president, Shri Shikshayatan College and primary secretary, Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad, the school will focus on building global citizens through a flexible education system and moral learning. The A (advanced)-level course will offer 15 subjects in the commerce and humanities streams. For extra-curricular activities, there will be opportunities for debate, elocution, drama, music, basketball, extempore and public-speaking.																								Housed in the Parishad building, classes will be held from 8.15 am to 3 pm, with about 40 minutes of yoga, meditation and art of living in the morning, before the day begins. Students can choose their subjects, with any combination  statistics, art and design and government and politics, or maybe business studies, dress and textiles and Hindi. The school has special permission for Urdu and Hindi to be taught as Indian languages.																								Three A-level subjects are the norm, but four help for further studies in the US and Canada, since they provide a years credits, explains principal Sunita Sen, former vice-principal of Calcutta International School. The examinations will be conducted by the British Council, and the students are free to change subjects at any time in Class XI. The exams are held twice a year, by both the London and Cambridge boards, and the students can take them whenever they are ready, or maybe a second time, to improve grades.																								The aim is to develop practical attitudes to life, through the application of education, instead of rote learning, stresses Sen. So, for instance, in principles of law, the students will have to apply their knowledge through case studies, instead of question-and-answer formats.																								For admission, the Class X results of any Indian board is required, and an all-round development. The student will also have to go through an interview with the principal and the subject teachers. Fifteen teachers  for all the subjects  have already been recruited, and admissions will begin from April 22, with the first term due to start on June 28. The initial capacity is around 60 students, with a 1:5 teacher-children ratio.																								Although an admission charge of Rs 15,000 and a monthly fee of Rs 3,000 is no small amount, the facilities include air-conditioned classrooms with audio-visual aids and the use of a 200-seater auditorium, game room, cafeteria, library and computer laboratory with Internet connection. With plans for lower classes at a bigger place some time in the future, The International School hopes to bring change in the education system in Calcutta, says Khemani.

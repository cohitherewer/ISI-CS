The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 23, 2004  Calcutta Column
 
	I was appalled to find some people urinating in front of  the Netaji mural on the wall of Netaji Bhawan Metro station  a few days ago. The stench and the filth make it difficult  for one to walk along the stretch. Inside the station, I  overheard some foreigners saying: It stinks out here.  But for us, it does not make much difference, as we have  become immune to the muck all around. Will the civic body  please change the name of this metro station, as I am sure  it does not have the funds to build a urinal in the vicinity?

	Some months ago, steel railings were erected on the road  leading to Howrah station to separate the minibus stand  located near the river, leaving a small gap. Commuters getting  off buses and trying to catch trains have no option but  to wriggle out through this passage and cross the road.  During rush hours, the situation turns alarming with people  from both sides bumping into each other.

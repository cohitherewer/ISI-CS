 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 Tricks to tackle tan tangle 
				 	 Model Sharan uses goggles to cut off the glare in the season of the sun blitz. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Its easy to convince yourself fair is foul with the sun beating down in all its fiery glory (in between the intermittent showers) and brag about that glorious tan you got on your recent trip to Hawaii. Not that you have much choice either with those water-based sunscreens ideal for the season merging into the wet look as soon as you take the first tentative steps out of your air-conditioned cocoon and humidity doing double duty in the absence of a real shower. But if youd rather be fair to your efforts to avoid the dark days of brown brouhaha (as a certain brand of cream would have us believe in all fairness), weve thought up a few obvious options (our creative juices ran dry for equally obvious reasons) to fill in the patches you probably forgot to cover up.Screen presence Given the dare-bare flavour of the season, it will be a little tame to make light of tan talk. Its best to prevent the tan in the first place which causes premature wrinkles and irreparable damage to the skin even if you discount the complexion factor, says beauty expert June Tomkyns. UV and SPF equation is what you have to get right here she advises, nature vs technology for the uninitiated. While the sun is obviously not going to let up on the dreaded ultra violet rays, you can always use the SPF (sun protection factor) cloak in moisturiser and gel form. One should use a sunscreen that has an SPF of at least 15+. And if you are going to be out in the sun for a long period of time, you need to replenish it every hour, says June. An SPF of 30+ makes for especially good combat gear apart from sun blocks, she adds and recommends its use at least half-an-hour before stepping out. But if you would rather bow down to the beauty of nature than battle it, theres a green antidote in the juice of Aloe vera plant to the violet vagaries.Under the umbrella Hiding behind the bush is a safe bet as well, more so if you would rather breathe easy than smother yourself with juices and gels. Theres no beating the sturdy presence of the rain and shine supernova that offers a protective canopy like no other. Its easy to be floored with summery floral prints but it makes better horse sense to cut down on frills and go for a more sturdy option in silver layered umbrellas in solid colours. The shiny shield also cuts down on accessory overheads that score on style but surrender on substance. Head start If you would make a statement in any case, without damning the dark dread that is, summers are as good a time to stock up on styles as any other. Sticking to the bone of contention here, sunglasses and hats help herald sunny days with some cheer. Sunhats and floppy caps have been the top draws this season, with the cotton crochet ones being the latest find. Hand-free movement is what you should cite if their rather limited role in the canopy contention is questioned. As you turn heads thus geared, squinting at your admirers wont do either. Return the gaze from the confident comfort of snazzy goggles. Roadside stalls provide eye candy in a variety of shades but theres no beating the brand equity of glasses that come with the UV protection promise.Hide and seek																								There are yet other ways of hoodwinking your way through blazing thoroughfares if playing by the rules is not your style. 																								Take a hooded rickshaw instead of walking that mile to the stop station, or use that dupatta as a wacky wrap. Lightening the load may be the way to hot things up to a cool effect, but making a splash in a wispy burkha is a thought we couldnt avoid either!						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

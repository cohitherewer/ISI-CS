				 																																									It was announced that a science exhibition will be on inside the Vigyan Rail on platform no. 21 of Howrah station till March 18. But when I reached the station at around 3.30 pm on March 18 to view the exhibition, I was told that the train had left Howrah at 7 pm on the previous day. Who will take responsibility for the harassment and strain that I was subjected to due to the incorrect information passed to the public? 				 																																									Prantik Sanyal, 				 																																									SP Mukherjee Road.				 																																									Illegal constructions have sprouted in wards 64 and 65 of Howrah. Some of the structures, built decades ago, may collapse any day. The authorities have not learnt a lesson from the collapse of the Howrah Town Hall roof.				 																																									Name not disclosed.				 																																									Beleghata canal, Tollys Nullah, and Bagjola canal could be made navigable to take the load off the citys road transport. 				 																																									B.N. Bose, 				 																																									Dum Dum.

 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Civic budget a slew of sops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Its the mayors turn now to make the voters feel good. 																								With an eye on the civic body elections next year, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has lined up a slew of sops for Calcuttans in his delayed budget for fiscal 2004-2005. The budget will be placed on June 8.																								It will be a compassionate budget, asserted a senior accounts officer monitoring its preparation. 																								For the first time in its history, the civic budget will announce a repeal, reduction and revision of the fees, charges and taxes paid by house-owners, traders and builders. 																								In monetary terms, the tax relief proposed by mayor Mukherjee translates into a gift pack of Rs 200 crore.																								Highlights of the compassionate budget will be: Rollback of water tax																								(Delinking water tax from property tax and exemption for house-owners with 10-mm and 15-mm ferrule connections) Scale-down of property tax																								(Presently, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) charges 40 per cent of the annual valuation of a residential building as tax. It is 60 per cent of the annual valuation in the case of a commercial building. The sum is likely to be slashed by 15 to 20 per cent)  Slash in development charges and sanction fees for the construction of residential buildings Return of inheritance rights to stall-owners in civic markets Grant of special floor-area ratio for construction of commercial buildings and apartments to encourage rainwater harvesting Relaxation of building rules in the reconstruction of old markets and tenanted residential buildings.																								Last year, mayor Mukherjee had presented a budget proposal of Rs 767.75 crore, with a deficit to the tune of Rs 29.17 crore.																								The deficit has since been covered and the budget for 2004-2005 will be Rs 800 crore-plus.																								Chief of municipal finance and audit Abdul Ohid pointed out that the mayor had broken all records of revenue-earning in the past 50 years by mobilising an amount of Rs 350 crore from the CMCs own resources.																								According to officer on special duty to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh, the loss in revenue to be accrued by the tax relief will be made up by harnessing untapped sources of civic revenue. 																								Billboards, shopsigns and the display of products with signboards and posters in shop counters will be the prime driver for recovering the loss of civic revenue, Ghosh explained.

 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Opp backs mayor cry for car tax handover 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The ruling Trinamul Congress-BJP board in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the CPM Opposition reached a consensus to claim the proceeds of the motor vehicle tax from the state government on the concluding day of the civic budget discussion on Thursday.																								Road is mine and tax is yours, is no longer a joke, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said, announcing that he would hold a meeting with CPM leader of Opposition Nirmal Mukherjee after his (mayors) return from Sao Paulo, before submitting a joint deputation to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								The mayor is leaving for Sao Paulo on Friday evening to attend the International Fair and Congress of Cities  URBIS 2004.																								Mukherjee, in his reply at the budget debate on Thursday, said the state government had imposed an extra burden of Rs 100 crore on the CMC by asking the civic authorities to foot power bills. The CMC was ready to pay its own power bill if the state government transferred the entire proceeds of the motor vehicle tax from its coffers to the civic authorities.																								He said the roads in the city belonged to the civic authorities, and the CMC was responsible for maintaining them and had to face severe criticism for roads in a bad condition. Therefore, the transport department had no right to enjoy the motor vehicle tax. 																								Backing the mayors demand, CPM leader Nirmal Mukherjee declared in the house: I will be with you to raise the demand for the transfer of motor vehicle tax to the CMC from the state government coffers. The mayor said the CMC maintained over 1,200 km of roads, for which it spent about Rs 60 crore a year.

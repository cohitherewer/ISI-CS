The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Oil on steps shuts Metro gate
 A STAFF REPORTER																								One of the entry-and-exit points of the Belgachhia Metro Railway station was rendered unfit for use on Saturday morning after unidentified miscreants poured engine oil on the stairs. Oil was also sprayed inside through a small gap under the shutter. 																								Officials from Belgachhia police station rushed to the spot. Nearly 200 litres of engine oil was spilled on the stations stairs, they said.																								The station authorities had to keep the entrance closed for over an hour. Had we allowed the commuters to use the staircase, accidents could have taken place. We opened the entry-point only after cleaning the stairs and the basement, said a station official.																								The staff noticed the oil when they came to open the station at around 5.30 am. Engine oil had been poured not only on the staircase but also on the pavement in front of the station, said an official, adding that the basement, too, was flooded.																								According to police, the arrow of suspicion points at a section of the local auto-rickshaw drivers. We have enough reason to suspect them, said an official of the Belgachhia police station.

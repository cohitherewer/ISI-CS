 A STAFF REPORTER																								Reviving the Tagore connection with the land of the rising sun, Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) has, for the first time, decided to knock on Japanese doors to seek foreign funds.																								A team of RBU officials, comprising vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee and registrar Santosh Kumar Ghorui, is slated to leave for Japan on February 21.																								During their week-long stay, Mukherjee and Ghorui will meet officials of Sokajokki International, a university with branches across the world. They will try and convince their Japanese counterparts of a financial grant for the development of RBU.																								Tagore had forged a bond of friendship with Japan. We will approach Sokajokki International to collaborate with us in introducing scholarships and new courses in faculties such as the fine arts. We will also discuss the overall development of the university, Mukherjee said.

 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Teenage duo battered for pump theft, one dies
 A STAFF REPORTER																								What started out as a petty crime by a teenage duo early on Thursday ended in a dark tragedy.																								Istad Ahmed, 14, was beaten to death, while his partner, 15-year-old Fayyaz, was hospitalised with severe injuries.																								At around 4 am, Sadruddin, alias Munna, came down the stairs of his R29/A, Garden Reach Road residence and noticed the two boys trying to flee with the water pump they had stolen from the multi-storeyed building in Masjidtala, Metiabruz.																								Munna chased and stopped the duo. Navi Rasool, a resident of the area, said the boys were then mercilessly beaten up.																								Munna pinned Fayyaz down and kept kicking and punching Ahmed. When the boy collapsed under the blows, he turned his attention to the 15-year-old. By then, the screams of the victims had drawn other residents to the spot. But, instead of stopping Munna, they joined in, added Rasool.																								Ahmed, who had regained consciousness and was trying to get up, was then lynched by Munna and his associates. 																								The second round of beatings proved fatal and the assailants left Ahmed dying on the road, with Fayyaz badly injured, a neighbour added.																								Woh chori karne aye they. Maara to dono mein se ek mar gaya, kya karen (They had come to carry out a theft. They were beaten up and what can be done if one of them died)? asked Mohammed Pervez, a resident of the building.																								This is the third time that the two had come to steal in the building. We had no idea that Fayyaz was also involved in the earlier thefts. This time, they were caught in the act and given a good thrashing It was not really our fault, he added.																								Fayyaz lived with his father Nooru, a driver, in a corner of the same building where the two were caught stealing. It was Nooru who first spotted the boys lying on the road, at around 5 am.																								The two were rushed to a local hospital, where Ahmed was pronounced brought dead.																								The other boy is undergoing treatment with serious injuries, said a police officer.																								Additional officer-in-charge of Metiabruz police station A.K. Das Mohanty tried to play down the incident and said Ahmed had died of internal haemorrhage after being slapped by Munna.																								It was a freak case. Ahmed was slapped by Munna, returned home and later died in his sleep. We have started a murder case and Munna has been arrested, said Mohanty.

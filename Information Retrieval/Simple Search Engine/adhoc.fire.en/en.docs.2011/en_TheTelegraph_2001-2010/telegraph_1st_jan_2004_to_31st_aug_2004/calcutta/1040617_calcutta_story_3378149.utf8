 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Report propels rights panel to Liluah home
 SWATI SENGUPTA 																								The home is very badly maintained, with drains overflowing and the place was stinking all over. There is no proper drainage system, and despite two malis to maintain a garden, almost no garden was visible. 																								The medical unit was deplorable, and the instructor in the vocational training unit could not make the powerloom function properly. Most inmates were idling. Only 22 inmates in the tailoring and weaving units, out of 248 inmates, were gainfully engaged in work at the vocational training unit. 																								This is how P.K. Agarwal, principal secretary of the social welfare department, described the Liluah home for destitute women after a visit some months ago. 																								After being repeatedly pulled up by the state human rights commission for not doing much to improve conditions at the completely unhygienic home, the government has finally managed to send the rights panel a report on action taken.																								But the commission is not taking any chances and will visit the home on Thursday to verify the report submitted to it by the social welfare department. 																								It took the government three years to submit the report. The commission team had visited the home way back in August 17, 2001, and asked the government to take action and submit a report. That report has come to us only recently. So, we are going to visit the home and check whether the report is correct or not, said commission registrar G.C. Sarkar on Wednesday. 																								Commission chairman Justice Shyamal Sen had visited the home in May and noted the horrific conditions prevailing there. Destitute women brought to the home continue to escape from it. 																								The report claims that law-breakers and non-delinquents have already been segregated. The government has informed the rights panel that rules of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act have already been framed and it will ensure better care and protection of a large number of inmates at the home. 																								The report said the government had already sanctioned Rs 21 lakh, and handed it over to the state public works department (civil), to improve the drainage system of the home and for other essential repairs. 																								The government report does not clearly state what actions were actually taken. So, our job will be to check if there has been any visible change at the home, registrar Sarkar added.

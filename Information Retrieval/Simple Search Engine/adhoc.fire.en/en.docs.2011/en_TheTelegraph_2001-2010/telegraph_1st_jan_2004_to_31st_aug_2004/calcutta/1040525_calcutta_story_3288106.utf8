The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Monsoon signals say early arrival
 															- Low-pressure trough, upper-air cyclonic circulation may hasten rains to city OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The dark clouds over the city on Monday could be the harbinger of an early monsoon. The rains are likely to hit the city earlier than the scheduled June 8, provided there is no change in the prevailing weather conditions.																								Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore said on Monday that there was a trough of low pressure from Haryana to the Andamans across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, north coastal Orissa and north-west and south-central Bay of Bengal.																								Tailing this trough is an upper-air cyclonic circulation over Bihar and adjoining areas.																								Under the combined influence of the two systems and incursion of moisture-laden winds from the sea, dark clouds have gathered over Calcutta and its neighbouring districts.																								The monsoon is progressing quite fast this year and if these two conditions prevail for the next few days, it will help hasten the monsoon into the city, said the weatherman.Officials said that last year, the monsoon had arrived at least a week behind its June 8 schedule. But this time, the monsoon has advanced quite well so far. It has reached Guwahati, Gangtok and Jalpaiguri about 12 days ahead of schedule.																								Officials said last Friday evenings Norwester and the formation of rainclouds since Saturday night had helped cool Calcutta down after a sweltering spell. Last Thursday was the hottest day of the season, with the mercury at 40.6 degrees Celsius.

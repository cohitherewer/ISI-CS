- Bedwin

	 This is truly a roll to riches story. What started out as a humble roll joint spanning 3 ft by 7 ft on Gariahat Road has, over a span of 16 years, spawned a chain of restaurants that is associated with all things Mughlai and mouth-watering. Bedwin at Golpark is one of the most popular eating haunts in the area and sees people of all types pouring in families open to an inexpensive dinner, lovers looking for a quiet meal and basically anyone whos in the mood for some good old Mughlai food. 
With 15 franchises, Bedwin is indeed a growing chain. Says one of the directors, Mohan Choudhury, Over the years, we have introduced several new dishes, but such items as Reshmi Kebab and Fish Pahari still remain the hot-sellers. 
	Of course, if its biryani that gets you going, have the waiters bring you any of the Bedwin versions be it the Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani, the Murg Sahi Biryani, the Afghani Biryani or the regular chicken and mutton ones. Up the flavour by teaming your choice with a handi delicacy be it the Rogan Josh, Hariyali Gosht, rezala, chap or the hands-down winner, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. 
	Kebabs and tikkas are in plenty here too. All the usual seekhs, kathis, botis, kalmis and kasturis can more than satisfy your kebab cravings while fishy affairs also come by way of Pomfret Tandoori and Fish Butter Masala. Vegetarian delights also find their way on to the menu what with Navratan Mixed Vegetables, Alu Gobi, Jhal Frazee and Paneer Kadhai Tikka being just some of the dishes you can dive into. 
	On Sundays, Bedwin churns out authentic Bangla khabar in addition to its regular fare. So go ahead and dig into a range of specialities including Chitol Macher Muitha, Baati Chorchori, Doi Puri and much more. Prices at the restaurant are far from intimidating starting from Rs 2.50 for a roti and going up to Rs 140 for prawn kebabs.

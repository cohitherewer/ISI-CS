 Sunday, May 16, 2004 Quality time for family, friends amp; chill
VoicesShonal Rawat, modelSunday means sleeping late into the day, then going for a swim and lunch at Tolly Club with family. A half-an-hour nap in the afternoon, and Im ready to hit the streets with friends. We catch a movie in the New Market area or INOX, or simply walk down Park Street, eating rolls. The night-out is often capped with a quiet dinner at Kim Ling in Tangra.Jishu Sengupta, actorI work seven days a week and Sundays are pretty much the same. The second Sunday of the month, when the industry is closed officially, is somewhat different, though. I prefer to stay back home then and chill with friends. I do drop by at Someplace Else sometimes, but theres no specific day for that.Grace Gomes (Tilottama 2004)Sunday is reserved for friends and family. My day starts with a visit to the church at around 7 am. In the evening, it can be a quiet dinner at home or outside, or just chatting with relatives and friends at my place or theirs. I am not much into partying, but if I go out, its usually the night before. I look forward to Saturday, as its like a holiday warm-up.Raima Sen, actor I dont step out of the house on a Sunday. Its the day to laze around; I wake up late, have a late lunch and like to watch movies or TV.

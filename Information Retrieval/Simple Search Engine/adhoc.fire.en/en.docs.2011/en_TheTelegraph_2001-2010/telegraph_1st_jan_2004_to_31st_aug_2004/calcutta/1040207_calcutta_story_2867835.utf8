The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Is Job Charnock Coming to Dinner?
 The play unfolds in the Mukhopadhyaya household. The family members are busy preparing for an important dinner. The play explores the relationships between the characters as events unravel gradually, bringing forth the idea that all is not lost in this dying city yet. We still have a throbbing, thriving, pulsating city in Calcutta...a city very much alive that has come the whole 360 degrees...a city born again like the phoenix from its ashes, a city with promises...a city that tends to grow into ones system and one can neither forget nor write it off so easily. What it seeks to cement is that even though its name has changed, for the majority it continues to remain just Calcutta with its untouched spirit, ease and warmth. Directed by Ramanjit Kaur, this Creative Arts production is the result of a site-specific workshop performance which is perhaps a novel concept that is yet to catch up in the city. The workshop brought together artists from visual and performing streams, teachers, executives, students and children. Young adults from Disha Foundation and hearing impaired actors from TAP integrate with other artists to perform this piece. A 15-day workshop involving theatre, games, experiments, discussions, exchange of ideas, an ever-evolving script and exploring expression not only through the actors body, but also through mediums of visual arts, videography, light and sound culminates in this experimental piece.																								When: Today amp; tomorrow at 8 pm																								Where: Swabhumi

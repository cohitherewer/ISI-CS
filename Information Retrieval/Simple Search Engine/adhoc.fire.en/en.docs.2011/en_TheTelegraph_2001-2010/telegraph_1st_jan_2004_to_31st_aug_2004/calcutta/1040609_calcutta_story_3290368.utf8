 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Rising trend in racket of trade secrets
 SAMARPAN DUTTA																								When Swapan Mitra joined as a marketing executive of a city-based steel-manufacturing firm, he was readily accepted by the owners, who trusted him with data that would help him and the company succeed in the market. 																								However, when Mitra migrated to a rival firm after a three-month stint, the owners were unaware that they had been betrayed and would have to pay dearly for trusting Mitra.																								Apparently, Mitra had opted for a better job. In reality, he was engaged by the rival firm to gain access to the trade secrets and cash in on the data that he would siphon out. Mitra received a hefty sum from his new employers. 																								Computer espionage, or transfer of confidential electronic data to a rival firm for personal financial gain, is on the rise in the city, and with each passing day, more and more instances of such crimes are being reported. 																								Employees of corporate houses  mostly information technology (IT) and marketing professionals  are involved in the transfer of confidential data that they have access to, once they gain the confidence of the employer.																								According to police, such offences are becoming a trend and regular complaints are being lodged at police stations. 																								In the past couple of years, we have received more than a dozen such complaints from leading and reputed corporate houses but often, it is not possible to establish the crime and bring the culprit to book, said an officer.																								Echoing his views, Calcutta High Court lawyer Joymalya Bagchi said the city police are not equipped to investigate such crimes and often, the miscreants go scot-free. 																								At present, there are several cases pending in the high court and an offender, if proved guilty, can serve a minimum term of three to seven years. If he turns out to be a government employee, he could face life imprisonment, lawyer Bagchi said. 																								With the recent modification in the IT Act, where electronic data were included in the definition of a document, a person proved guilty of having shared company data stored in a computer for his personal gain can be convicted under Section X of the Indian Penal Code for criminal breach of trust and sharing of entrusting property.																								According to Bagchi, firms engage agents to ferret out the trade secrets of rival firms to outwit them. It was difficult earlier. At best, one could take down a portion of a document or pass on information from memory. But with the introduction of computers in most organisations, data can both be stored and then carried away in compact discs and floppy discs without raising the slightest doubts. This has, indeed, made the difference in increasing the rate of this type of crime, Bagchi added.

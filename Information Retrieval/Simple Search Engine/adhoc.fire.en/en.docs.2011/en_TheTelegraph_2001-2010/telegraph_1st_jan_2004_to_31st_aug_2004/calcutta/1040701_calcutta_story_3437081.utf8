 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 More terminii need to keep roads clear
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE  Of the 5,500 buses and minis plying in the city, 3,500 are parked on the roads at 50 key spots At least 100 state buses plying on 15 routes in the city are parked on the roads In Howrah, 1,200 buses are parked on roads at 25 spots																								The reason: There arent enough terminii.																								The result: Traffic congestion, passenger inconvenience. 																								The alarm: Vehicular movement will come to a halt on these roads if the encroachment is not removed.																								The traffic and transport engineering department has submitted this recommendation to a committee set up by the government last month to find ways to ease traffic chaos in the city. The six-member committee, headed by public vehicles department director H. Mohan, was constituted on instruction from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								We conducted a detailed survey for the report and found that traffic turns chaotic during peak hours on roads that have buses parked on them. The roads cannot be widened and the count of vehicles is on the rise. In such a situation, if any portion of road is grabbed for parking heavy vehicles, how will traffic move? asked chief traffic and transportation engineer B.K. Sadhu.																								As a remedial measure, the traffic and transport engineering department has suggested that terminii be constructed on the citys outskirts. 																								Our opinion is that not a single bus terminus should be located in the city, Sadhu said. His department has plans to construct a comprehensive bus terminus below Vidyasagar Setu.																								Transport department officials said route permits were issued in violation of norms and bypassing the police and regional transport authorities.																								Sometimes, I had to bend the rules under pressure from local people and political leaders, admitted transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. The bus operators had assured us they would build terminii but they have not. Now, if we yank those buses off the roads, there will be public outrage. However, we are trying to solve the problem, he added.																								The department plans to construct some bus terminii jointly with the operators. The government will provide the land and the operators will invest in the construction. 																								We do not have any objection to contributing for the construction of terminii but at the same time, we demand that not a single permit be issued without our approval, said Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.

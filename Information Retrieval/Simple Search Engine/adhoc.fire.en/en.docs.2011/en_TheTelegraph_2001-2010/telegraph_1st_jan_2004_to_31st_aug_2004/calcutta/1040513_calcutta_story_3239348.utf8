 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Court call for fee-cut affidavits
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court has observed that the resolution adopted at the March 26 board meeting of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta will be subject to the decision on the writ filed by the institutes faculty council. 																								Justice Pinaki Ghose, hearing a case challenging the legality of the meeting, also directed the parties to file affidavits and fixed the matter for hearing six weeks after summer vacation.																								The court, however, refused to pass any order of status quo or interim injunction on the resolution adopted by the institutes chairman, Y. C. Deveshwar. 																								But indicating defiance to Deveshwars resolution, in which the ITC chairman had accepted the fee cut at the institute from Rs 1.5 lakh a year to Rs 30,000, the institute on Wednesday started sending out admission letters to students, without mentioning a fee cut. 																								The letter stated that the institute hasnt accepted the cut and the Supreme Court will take a decision on the issue. We have given an indicative fee of the last year and asked the students to deposit Rs 30,000 during admission, said a faculty member. 																								The letter also sought an undertaking from the students that they would have to pay up the difference after the apex courts final order on the issue.

 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Cash snatch from trader
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								In a daylight robbery at Barasat on Monday, two armed goons on a motorcycle snatched Rs 7.25 lakh from a trader and his employee while they were headed for the local branch of a nationalised bank to deposit the money.																								According to police, Pradip Sett, a distributor for ITC Limited, was going from his office at Saroj Park to the Barasat branch of Allahabad Bank to put in the days collection. 																								Accompanied by an employee, Nirmal Lodh, he left for the bank around 1.30 pm. Both were on bicycles and the cash, kept in a gunny bag, was with Lodh.																								At Kalikapur, hardly a kilometre away from the bank, two youths on a motorcycle blocked their path and ordered Lodh to hand over the money.																								When Pradip protested, one of the youths got off the two-wheeler and threatened him. The other goon parked the motorcycle on the busy Taki Road, in full view of pedestrians, and snatched the bag from Lodh.																								As the duo began to ride away, Pradip and Lodh started calling for help. This prompted one of the goons to get off the motorcycle and fire a round in air to disperse the crowd that was beginning to gather. 																								Then, he pushed the pistol into Lodhs mouth and told him to stop shouting. The two even hurled a couple of bombs, before zooming off towards Basirhat.																								Police later detained Lodh for interrogation. It is not clear why they were carrying such a large amount in a gunny bag. Moreover, they could have used a car, instead of bicycles, to take the money to the bank, observed Basudeb Bag, district superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. It also seem that the miscreants had been tipped off, he added.

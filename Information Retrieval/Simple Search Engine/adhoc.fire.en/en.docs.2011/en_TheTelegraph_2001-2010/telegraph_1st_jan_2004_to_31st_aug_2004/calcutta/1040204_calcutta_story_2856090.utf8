	The footpath on the western side of Strand Road is in a  shambles. There are far too many potholes, especially in  front of Millennium Park. As this tourist spot draws a lot  of people, the stretch must be repaired soon. 
	 B.L. Chandak, Salkia.  
	Waterpipes are being installed on Budge Budge Trunk Road,  between Jinjira Bazaar and Amtala, since December 2003.  We are given to understand that a highway will come up,  connecting Taratala with Diamond Harbour Road. For the project,  the workers are razing all encroachments, but the encroachers  turn up as soon as they are gone. Will the project ever  materialise?  
	T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	Few traders in the city are paying heed to the civic authorities  requests to use polythene bags of a specific thickness.  Its time for some stringent action.  
	Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town.

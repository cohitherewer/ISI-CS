 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Tourism ties: helping hand across the border
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Barrier lowered: Sonar Bangla, the first goods train from Bangladesh to India, at Benapole																								In what is billed to be a huge boost for cross-border tourism, hands have come together from two sides of the Bengal border, as well as from far-away Indonesia. Parjatan Epar Bangla Opar Bangla will act as a facilitator for those crossing over to either side for reasons medical, mercantile or cultural.																								We may not be able to bring down the wall like East and West Germany did, but at least the barrier will be lowered, said Dipankar Roy, president, Harrison Estates and Plazas, Indonesia, sitting at The Stadel, which will function as the city office of the organisation. A considerable volume of visitors makes the journey every month for various reasons. We want to help them, added Roy.																								As the first step, an NRI Club will come up in Bengal and Bangladesh. We have identified land on the EM Bypass between Salt Lake and Ruby General Hospital, said Sadique Ahsan, president, Bangladesh Hotel and Guest-Houses Owners Association.																								The 44-cottah plot will house a recreational club with deluxe facilities and membership restricted to NRIs. Though NRIs from any corner of the world can become members, there will be a quota for Bangladeshis, added Ahsan. A corresponding club will come up in Dhaka on 300 acres.																								The organisation has on its agenda aid for Bangladeshis who visit Calcutta for treatment. About 600 people cross the Benapole border everyday. Half of them come for treatment. In all, medical facilities in Calcutta attract around 15,000 tourists every month from Bangladesh, stated Ahsan.																								The health cell of Parjatan Epar Bangla Opar Bangla will do the hand-holding for them. There was a huge volume of Bangladeshi patients flying to Singapore, where facilitating groups have sprung up. But there was nothing of this nature in Calcutta, said Ahsan. The cell will have a doctor advising visitors on the specialists to see and a public relations officer will set them up in hospitals like Peerless, Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Ruby and Woodlands.																								An offshoot of such medical trips will be a health tourism package. Many who come for check-ups want to get a feel of the place. We will help them with guided trips as well as hotel bookings, Ahsan pointed out.																								Parjatan also plans to set up two motels on either side of the border. With immigration not open round-the-clock, forcing tourists reaching the border at night to wait in their vehicles till morning, the need is obvious.																								Culture, of course, will play a crucial role in cross-border tourism. That is where our common roots lie, pointed out Anil Bhutoria, managing director of The Stadel. Artistes from both sides will come together at the Salt Lake stadium hotel for musical soirees and poetic discussions, while food festivals and digital film festivals are the other unifying possibilities.																								The Bangladesh home and tourism ministries are behind the project and it has received enthusiastic response from tourism minister Dinesh Dakua and youth affairs minister Mohd Salim, who were briefed about the venture at Writers Buildings on Tuesday. February 21 is when the foundation stone for the NRI Club will be laid.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Ugly duckling becomes busy bee
				 	 Reshmi Ghosh: Boom time. Picture by Pabitra Das. Outfit courtesy: Anamika Khanna Make-up by Prabir Kr De																								Having wandered in the wilderness of Bollywood for a few years, the sultry ramp scorcher has at last found her calling. Its acting, swears Reshmi Ghosh. With two films slated for release, two more on the floors and one ready to roll out, her career on the big screen is taking off big time. A rainy Thursday afternoon was the perfect excuse for the girl taking a break to hole up in her Bhowanipore home, soak up the warmth of friends and family, and take a meandering trip down work-and-play lane with Reshmi Sengupta.Shy girl in the shell: Teachers of Carmel School (Jodhpur Park) might remember her as the tall, shy girl standing in the last row of the chorus. Deep inside, Reshmi always craved for their attention like all other girls, but just couldnt spell it out. I was a very quiet child and lacked the confidence to come out of my shell. There was no charm about me and I would feel like an ugly duckling, while my friends used to get all the attention, laughs Reshmi, now a beauty queen and sought-after actress, cosily couched in the simple setting of her south Calcutta sitting room.Solitary steps to success: With her sharp features and svelte figure, she opted for modelling while in college after a friend coaxed her into getting a portfolio done. But I had no idea about this profession apart from what I had seen on TV. I had no expression on my face then, she giggles, recounting the watershed year of 1999 when she bagged the Tilottama title. I started taking things seriously as people began noticing and liking me. I also began to enjoy the camera and being on stage. How I had shivered walking down the ramp for the first time, she adds. As fashion shows, telefilms, adfilms and TV anchoring came her way, the diffident girl gained the confidence to step up for the Miss India contest. With a food regimen, daily workout and reading up on current affairs, I began grooming myself in my own way Winning the Miss India-Earth crown changed my life forever. From there, acting was only a natural progression.RESHMI ROSTERReady for release: Tumse Milkar, where she plays a Tamil girl opposite Parveen Dabas
 Awaiting: Hottestmail.com, a film of and by newcomers revolving round cyber crime
 Next up: Tridib Poddars Bengali film that finds her in a tug of love between Jishu Sengupta and Parambrata Chatterjee
 Also busy: Learning kathak in Calcutta for a film based on a Munshi Premchand novelCamera call: Of all that she has done till now, feels flirting with the camera is what Reshmi likes best. Working in front of the camera has become a passion, whether I am good at it I dont know. I try to live the character and be as spontaneous as I can be, is her candid confession. Right away, Reshmi is awaiting the release of Tumse Milkar and Hottestmail.com (see box). If the urge to hone her histrionic skills  and brush up her Hindi  pushed Reshmi to Kishore Namit Kapoors academy in Mumbai last year, she now keeps a hawk eye on her own work and picks out the faults. I watch my body language, makeup, look, costume and expressions, she says. 																								Bright lights, big city: From modelling to beauty pageants, setting up base in Mumbai to grabbing a foothold in films, the going has been tough for the 20-something girl raised in a close-knit joint family of Calcutta. Mumbai was a culture shock for me. I have seen young girls ready to do anything to get work in an ad film, a music video, or even a bit role in a film, she shudders. Late-nights, partying and smoking are a part of networking in the industry, but I never got to do all this because it just wasnt in my nature I dont know how long I will be able to stick around.																								Family portrait: Where does she see herself a couple of years from now? As someones wife and someones mother, is the prompt reply. Reshmi is determined to have a job in hand  it could be acting, direction or producing  and more than eager to marry into a TV serial-type family, with people all around her, just the way it was in her growing-up years. Her choice is a means to an end: Because I want a good nights sleep at the end of the day.

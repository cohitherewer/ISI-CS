 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 New rate of water tax suffers rollback
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Veering from their earlier stand, the citys civic authorities have decided to adjust the water tax already paid at the new rates by house-owners with their property tax dues.																								The house-owners, however, have a wait ahead. The adjustments will be made only after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) passes its budget for the year in April.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced the decision to scrap the new water tax rates last month. He had said no adjustment would be made of the amount already paid as water tax. The CMC will neither adjust nor refund the amount, the mayor had asserted.																								Subsequently, following a special mayoral council meeting, municipal commissioner Debasish Som issued a circular last week, stating that post-budget, water tax will no more be collected at the new rate (on the basis of an annual valuation). 																								Instead, the tax will be collected at a rate based on the size of the ferrule: Rs 500 a year for a 20-mm ferrule and Rs 1,000 annually for a 25-mm ferrule. House-owners with a filtered water connection through a 10-mm or 15-mm ferrule will be exempted from paying water tax.																								According to CMCs deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh, the new rate of water tax had been included in the budget provisions for 2004-2005. A budgetary provision can be altered or changed only with another budget provision in the subsequent years, he explained.																								Prior to January 2004, the CMC would collect water tax only from residential users who had 20-mm and 25-mm ferrules.																								The ferrule size was delinked from water tax in January and a new rate of water tax introduced, based on an annual valuation of a building.																								All residential users of water, owning buildings valued for tax at not less than Rs 5,000 annually, had been brought under the water tax net, irrespective of the size of the ferrules in use in their houses.																								The CPM opposition in the CMC, however, dubbed the mayors rollback an election gimmick. At a demonstration in front of the civic headquarters on Wednesday, they lashed out at the flip-flop adopted by the civic body to harass house-owners.																								Mayor Mukherjee shot back: It is unfortunate that the CPM leaders have failed to differentiate between a rollback of water tax and a rollback of the new rate of water tax.																								He pointed out that water tax for residential users had always existed, even while the CPM was at the helm of the civic body. The Trinamul Congress-BJP combine in the CMC was not withdrawing that tax, he added.

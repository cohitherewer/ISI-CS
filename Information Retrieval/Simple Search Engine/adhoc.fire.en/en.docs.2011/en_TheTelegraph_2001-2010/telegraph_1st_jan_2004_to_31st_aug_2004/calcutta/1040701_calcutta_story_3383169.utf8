 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Umbrella oomph
 Romancing the rains is more fun when armed with funky gear. 
Picture by Pabitra DasThe wet days are here again  just in case you hadnt noticed (!)  and its about time you fortified your wardrobe against the daily downpour.																								While the chiffons and georgettes take over from the cottons in the cupboard, the most important accessory at this time of the year is, of course, the umbrella. And with a little bit of effort you can turn an accessory unwieldy and unattractive, dull and dripping into the fashion statement of the season.																								Black takes a backseat as the brolly brightens its act. Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh admits having a fetish for umbrellas, having nine of them in colours like fuschia pink, silver and gold.																								Umbrellas have really become fashionable now and I see lots of women carrying them in interesting colours. Its no longer restricted to just black or blue. I like using a lot of golf umbrellas that belong to my husband. Also, I pick up umbrellas whenever I travel abroad, she smiles.																								Kiran has used umbrellas for her ramp shows to good effect. I have designed interesting ones with polka dots and in unusual colour combinations, she reveals.																								With the umbrella changing its stripes and moving way beyond the ubiquitous corner store, a hunt for the rain-guard can take you to some of the most happening haunts in town.																								First stop, Shoppers Stop. The megastore has a wide variety of styles starting with long, single-fold ones in pastel shades that seem to be the rage these rains. Ranging upwards from Rs 175, these are mostly in shades of blues and pinks in shiny fabric and have floral prints on the fringes. Also on offer are the three-fold ones in floral as well as abstract prints in slightly darker combinations of red, black, brown or green. Rupee range: 205 to 325. The Elgin Road store has a fun range for the little ones too. Most of these are single-fold, in soft colours with prints of cartoon characters, animals or flowers. Rupee range: 160 to 450.Size matches style as the long single-fold grandfathers umbrella remains the most fashionable thing to flaunt. Among the better places to pick one up from is the Benettons showroom at Forum. As part of its spring-summer 2004 collection, United Colors of Benetton has launched a range of these umbrellas in three solid shades  red, blue and black. Priced at Rs 399, these are slightly bigger than usual and are must-keeps in the car.																								If you dont want to flow with the trend tide, Pantaloons has a line of three-folds in an array of colours. The solid ones in pastels, neutrals and dark hues are the real eye-catchers. From shades of green, pink, blue, purple and red to beige and mauve, theres a whole palette to choose from. Rupee range: 199 to 300.																								For an umbrella for the treasure trove, drop in at Hyatt Regency on July 10. In celebration of the rains, Gallery Kanishka had organised an umbrella painting workshop with a host of artists including like Shuvaprasanna, Lalu Prasad Shaw and Prakash Karmakar. Their interpretations of the monsoon on plain black umbrellas will be auctioned at Hyatt, with proceeds from the sale going to Mentaid, an NGO working for mentally challenged people.Smita Roy Chowdhury

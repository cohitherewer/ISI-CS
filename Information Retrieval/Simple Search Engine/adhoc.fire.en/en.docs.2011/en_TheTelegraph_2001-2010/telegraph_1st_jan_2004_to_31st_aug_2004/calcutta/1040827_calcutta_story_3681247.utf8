 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Hospital to cell, on Day Ten
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ten nights of hospitality later, SSKM Hospital on Thursday released Avtar Singh, husband of athlete-turned-MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar. From the citys largest state-run hospital, Singh was led away to a dingy cell in Barrackpore sub-jail.																								Forty-eight hours earlier, a Bengal police team had been turned away by the hospital authorities as Singh  earlier declared fit for discharge  complained of acute abdominal pain.																								The team was back on Thursday, this time to escort the former national athlete, now accused of running a sleaze racket from his Salt Lake hotel, to jail.																								A medical board set up to monitor Singhs treatment took him off the fluid-only diet on Wednesday night. We had put him on fluids for a day after he complained of acute abdominal pain, explained Santanu Tripathi, SSKM superintendent.																								On Thursday, the board convened again and decided to let Singh go immediately, as he was found fit to be sent to jail, as ordered by the Barasat court following his arrest on August 15.																								Several tests were carried out on Singh over the past eight days. The doctors concluded that he was suffering from mild colitis and lumber spondylitis, for which he has been advised periodic treatment at the hospitals out-patients department.																								The complications detected are not serious and can be treated adequately without staying in hospital. The board thought that he was fit to be released and we found no reason to keep him here any further, superintendent Tripathi said.																								The police from North 24-Parganas reached the hospital around 2 pm. By 4.10 pm, Singh, after a light lunch of vegetables, dal and rice, walked out of his cabin in the respiratory unit of the hospital. 																								In a short-sleeved kurta and trousers, Singh, face wrapped in a towel, walked briskly to a waiting police jeep.																								Around 6.10 pm, the jeep reached Barrackpore sub-jail. On completion of the necessary formalities, Singh was taken to a separate cell, kept clean and ready for him.																								A senior jail official said: He has been very quiet and has not made any demands yet. We have a set of doctors ready, just in case.

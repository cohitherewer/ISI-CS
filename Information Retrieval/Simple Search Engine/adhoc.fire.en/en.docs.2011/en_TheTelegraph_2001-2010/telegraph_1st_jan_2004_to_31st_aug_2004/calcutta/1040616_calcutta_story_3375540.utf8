 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Six-month bar on doctor 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The West Bengal Medical Council on Tuesday held Jitesh Samaddar, a retired gynaecologist of NRS Medical College and Hospital, guilty of negligence in treatment and slapped a six-month ban on him. The council disclosed that five years ago, Samaddar was responsible for the death of a pregnant woman.																								Ashok Chowdhury, president of the state medical council, confirmed that Samaddar was found guilty of negligence in treating a pregnant woman, which proved fatal for her. His licence was cancelled for six months at the final hearing today, he added. 																								According to an official of the medical council, several complaints were lodged against Samaddar, including one by the relatives of the woman, who died at a private clinic while he was performing a Caesarean section.																								Her family lodged a complaint with the council and Samaddar was served a showcause. Soon, the council started proceedings against him, Chowdhury said.																								Samaddar will not be allowed to practise privately or otherwise for the next six months. If he fails to abide by the directive during that period, his licence could be cancelled indefinitely. There are instances where we have cancelled a doctors licence for life, Chowdhury added. 																								Samaddar was not available for comment. The governments decision to take prompt action in all pending cases involving doctors and their alleged malpractice and negligence has prompted the state medical council to take steps to expedite the procedure.

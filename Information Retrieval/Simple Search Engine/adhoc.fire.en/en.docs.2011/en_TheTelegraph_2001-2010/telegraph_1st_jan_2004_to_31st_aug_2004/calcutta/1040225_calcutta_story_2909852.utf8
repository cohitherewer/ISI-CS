 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 College delay for star tag
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) tag for elite government-run colleges in the city will be delayed even further.																								Education officials said on Tuesday the delay was caused by the state-controlled Presidency, the most prestigious of the 17 colleges of its category which submitted the self-assessment reports at least a month behind the government schedule.																								Six government-run colleges -- four in the city and two in the districts -- were selected by the government to send their proposals within December to the NAAC through the state government, in the first stage. 																								According to officials in the higher education department, Presidency submitted its report only last week, while the five others had submitted theirs, along with their proposals, last month.																								We received the proposal from Presidency College only last week. We will now send the reports of all the colleges together to the NAAC by this week, Piyush Kanti Ganguly, director of public instruction, said.																								Along with Presidency, Lady Brabourne, Bethune and Maulana Azad colleges in Calcutta and two other institutions of their category in Darjeeling and Krishnagar have been selected by the government to send the proposals to NAAC for the accreditation in the first stage.																								According to higher education department sources, its rules do not allow the government separately to submit the applications of each college for accreditation to the NAAC. The colleges, too, do not have the power to send their applications to the NAAC on their own. 																								According to officials in the higher education department, Presidencys delay has caused resentment among teachers of the remaining colleges, who had sent their reports to the government on time.																								We were not able to submit the proposals for NAAC accreditation on the date fixed by the government in December. But our report has reached the office of the higher education department in the first week of January, Gopa Dutta, principal, Lady Brabourne College, said.																								Presidency College authorities cite a different reason to justify their delay. They claimed their institution, being the most prestigious of all the colleges of its category, they had a responsibility to make the report as perfect as possible so that they get could get the highest NAAC rating. 																								Is there any other college that offers 17 under-graduate honours courses and nine post-graduate courses as we do? It was a gigantic task. We have taken time as we have tried to incorporate as many details as possible on the institutions activities, Amitava Chatterjee, Presidency College principal, said.

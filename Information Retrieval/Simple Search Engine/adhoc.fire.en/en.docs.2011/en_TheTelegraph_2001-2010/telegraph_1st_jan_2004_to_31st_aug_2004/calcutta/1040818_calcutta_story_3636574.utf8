 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Mayor feelers for World Bank loan
 DEEPANKAR GANGULYThe civic authorities on Tuesday embarked on an exercise to secure a Rs 1,000-crore loan from the World Bank for the development of Calcutta proper  areas excluding Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has urged the Left Front government to shed old reservations about the World Bank and not come in the way of the civic body receiving the funds. 																								The government itself has started taking big money from the bank, he pointed out.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had sought the loan for overhauling the 125-year-old sewerage and drainage system and augmenting the water supply in the city proper. 																								The World Bank had approved the proposal and appointed a US agency to conduct a survey and prepare a pilot project on the citys development. The bank had also sanctioned a $10-million loan for the purpose. 																								After advancing thus far, the proposal had to be scrapped because of the state governments refusal to submit details of its financial position to the World Bank.																								 The bank had asked the finance department for the details since the government had agreed to be the guarantor for recovery of the loan. 																								CMC officer-on-special duty (OSD) Shaktibrata Ghosh said the bank had informed the civic body in 2000 that the state governments refusal stood in the way of considering the loan proposal any further.																								The CMC, through the state government, had approached two international financial institutions  the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank  in the mid-1990s for a total loan package of Rs 2,475 crore. 																								The ADBs Rs 1,475-crore loan was for the development of the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, and Cossipore-Chitpore in north Calcutta. 																								OSD Ghosh said a visiting World Bank team in the late 1990s had insisted on levying charges on filtered water and trimming the staff strength of the civic body. 																								For instance, more than 10,000 employees work in the water supply and drainage departments. The team had suggested that the workforce be reduced to 4,000.																								The development projects, the team advised, should be commercially viable so that the maintenance cost could be met even after repaying the loan. 																								The experts had also sought a separate agency for water supply and sewerage, following the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) model. The BMCs water supply and sewerage service runs on a profit, while the CMC incurs an annual loss of Rs 73 crore on water supply alone. 																								Mayor Mukherjee pointed out that about 37 per cent of the filtered water  around 70 million gallons  is wasted daily because of leaks in underground pipelines. 																								The citys water supply arteries, as well as the drainage and sewerage lines, require immediate repairs and this will cost more than Rs 1,000 crore, he stressed. I am confident of repaying the loan with interest in time, he added.

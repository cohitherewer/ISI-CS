The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Almost there in safe zone
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Are women in Calcutta less safe than in other cities? More letters will be published next week				 LEER FEAR: A woman makes her way past staresSunil Banerjee, 
																		VIP Road																																																														Calcutta may lack civic amenities, but as far as safety of women is concerned, the city definitely scores above any other in the country. The recent murder of a woman on the Maidan is a stray case and does not comment on the city. If 10 points are allotted for absolute safety of women in Calcutta, the city easily deserves seven. 									

Anirban Mandal, 
																		Chinsurah																																																														The murder on the Maidan or the Bapi Sen incident are stray happenings. The rate of abuse of women in West Bengal is much less than in other states. So, it will be wrong to claim that women are more vulnerable to crime here than in any other city.									

Virendra Shah, 
																		Amratolla Lane 																																																														Violence, rape and murder are becoming common occurrences of late and the dignity and security that women used to enjoy earlier in Calcutta have definitely decreased. The situation is alarming and the authorities must take stringent steps before it is too late. 									

Bindu Dungarwal,
																		Ganges Garden																																																														Women were respected in our country earlier. But not any more. Women are not safe anywhere  be it at home or at work. And even then, they are less safe in Calcutta as most of the population here is illiterate, among whom torturing of women is common. Men should be taught right from their childhood to respect women. 									

Santanu Naskar,
																		New Ballygunge 																																																														The word safer can be used for Calcutta only when compared to other cities. When in other cities women are being assaulted in open daylight, here assailants at least are nor that bold. Sometimes, the westernised attires of women are to be blamed as well. 									

Saptarshi Bhattacharya,
																		Jagannath Ghosh Road																																																														Indian society had always been male-dominated. And whenever the male ego is hurt by a woman, violence takes place. In Calcutta, where the number of unemployed men is increasing along with the number of employed women, men are tending to harm women out of sheer frustration. 									

Indranil Sanyal, 
																		Dhakuria																																																														The situation of women in other metros like Mumbai and New Delhi is worse. There, women find it difficult to go out alone after 8 pm. Though there are plenty of cases where women have been victimised, the scenario is still better in our city. 									

Indranil Sanyal,
																		Dhakuria																																																														Women in Calcutta are not safe any more, though compared to other metros, they are much better off. However, that should be no reason for complacency. 									

Adwaita Das,
																		Bansdroni																																																														Calcutta might be safer than a city like Delhi but a woman still cannot travel in comfort by herself. She can hardly wait at the bus stop or walk on the road for long without being subject to some vulgar comment or the other. Women are being harassed, molested and abused every day in the city. Sadly, they still have not learnt to retaliate. 									

Debasish Chakraborty, 
																		Cossipore																																																														If women in Calcutta were safe, the numerous cases of eve-teasing, molestation, rape or murder would not have occurred. So far, the administrations callous attitude towards the miscreants has only increased the frequency of the atrocities. 									

Md Ayub, 
																		Bright Street			Certain womens organisations and Calcutta Police have done a tremendous job of protecting women in Calcutta. Besides, women in Calcutta are not as influenced by western culture as those in other parts of the country. Also here, the literacy rate of women is high. They hold many high posts in the state government. Hence, women are comparatively safe here. 									

SUMITA DAS,
																		Lake Road																																																														Women in Calcutta need not feel reassured by misleading statistics. Several incidents of atrocities go unreported out of fear or ignorance. Films and music-videos blatantly misrepresent women and Calcutta is fast catching up with the nationwide trend of disrespect towards women.									

Rajesh Sharma, 
																		Barasat 																																																														The city has its own problems in the safety aspect for women but to compare it with other metroes and ranking it at the bottom is certainly doing injustice to the ever-helpful and friendly people of the city, and also to the image of the city itself.									

Atif Ayaz,
																		Hooghly																																																														I think women are much safer in Calcutta than in other major cities. It is because eve-teasers here are given strict punishment. In cities like Delhi, eve-teasing is rampant mainly due to the administrations nonchalant attitude.									

Subhasish Majumdar,
																		Sonarpur 																																																														Women are definitely less safe in Calcutta than in any other city these days. While women in other cities like Mumbai and Bangalore feel secure on the streets alone at night, Calcutta is fast losing its shield of security. Industrial slowdown triggering off the unemployment problem is probably to be blamed for rising hooliganism. 									

JOYDEEP CHATTERJEE, 
																		Shyambazar 																																																														Women are treated with respect in our city and given special rights. Seats are reserved for them in buses, trams and the Metro. Inspite of certain stray cases of violence against women, we can say that frequency of such occurrences is less in Calcutta than other cities.

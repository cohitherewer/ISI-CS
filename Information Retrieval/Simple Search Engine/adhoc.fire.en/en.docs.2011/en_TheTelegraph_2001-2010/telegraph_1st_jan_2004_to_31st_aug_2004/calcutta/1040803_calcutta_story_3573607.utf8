 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Court instals green bench twins
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								In an effort to make the Calcutta High Court green bench more effective, two separate benches will settle cases relating to environment affairs and public interest.																								Acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy on Monday assigned Justice Barin Ghosh to hear the public interest litigation (PIL) and pollution suits that had been moved in the high court before 2003. 																								The division bench presided over by the acting chief justice himself will hear the newly registered PILs and pollution cases.																								The decision to set up two separate benches was taken after the judiciary of the neighbouring countries, such as Bangladesh and Thailand, started showing keen interest in the achievement of the green bench. 																								A court source said that a team of six Supreme Court judges from Thailand would be present at Calcutta High Court on August 6 to witness the activity and proceedings of the green bench.																								The foreign judges will also be present in the high court during the hearing of cases relating to pollution. 																								According to reports received by the state judicial department, a few like-minded countries have shown interest in the green bench of Calcutta High Court after several city problems were either solved or reduced with its intervention, a high court official claimed.																								He added: Noise pollution in the city has been remarkably controlled on the high courts intervention. Calcutta is a greener city due to the courts stern views regarding indiscriminate felling of trees.

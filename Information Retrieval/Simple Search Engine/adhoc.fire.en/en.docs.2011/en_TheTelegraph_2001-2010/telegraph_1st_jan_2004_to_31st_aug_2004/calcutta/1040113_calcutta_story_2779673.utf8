 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 A dash of colour to look good, ladies
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 FLAMBOYANT, BUT FINE: Make-up man Herve Bonneau works his magic on Indian crickets first lady Dona Ganguly. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Women here are alluring and colourful when it comes to clothes, be it saris or trousers, but with make-up theyre conventional and traditional, not adventurous or spontaneous.																								That was the rather bleak verdict from a French make-up man, in town to impart tips on looking good. The good news after the grim  the ladies in this part of the world do have the potential.																								Some consolation for Calcuttas beautiful people, who had all queued up for a winter date at The Park with the Christian Dior make-up man from Paris. Some had even put in a call to confirm that they would figure in the exclusive list of around 50 women Herve Bonneau would take a close look at. Actress June Maliah  who Bonneau later referred to as attractive  and Dona Ganguly, model Piu Sarkar and Madhu Neotia they were all there.																								First on the beauticians block was June, followed by Dona. For both, the prescription was colour. Indian women wear make-up like it is an obligation. But it is not a serious thing, it should be fun. And they use too many matts and browns. They should apply more colour, said the 20-year veteran of the beauty business.																								The red lipstick Bonneau used on the women, however, raised some reservations. While June agreed that the eyes looked wonderful, red on the lips, she felt, was too risqu and blamed it on a mind block. Maybe because red lipstick is not traditional, observed Bonneau, a regular in the wings of the Paris stage and ramp, reluctant to reveal his client list.																								The first lady of Indian cricket (she needs colour for animation) found her makeover a little flamboyant, but fine. I quite like it. Since I have problematic skin and wear lots of make-up during my dance programmes, I dont put much on at other times. But I came here to learn, and I did. Maybe next time Ill try the blue eye-shadow, smiled Dona.																								Sitting pretty, as in Devdas																								The questions pouring in from the audience ranged from does the lip liner have to be the same colour as the lipstick to whats the right way to apply the blusher.																								But looking good, it was obvious, was important. And the man who has honed his handiwork on models from Turkey to Tunisia had one complaint about the women in his Monday audience.																								When they sit here and look so good, it is like in Devdas, laughed the Bollywood films fan. But, Indian women just dont look after their skin tones.																								They should wear powder foundation, because the dust causes greasy skin, he observed. Although they know about cleansing and moisturising the face, it is not a routine. The older women, especially, have to look after their skin. Otherwise, you cannot expect to look nice.																								The interaction, said Bonneau, was very lively, and the women were warm, but the aversion to colour left a blot. 																								Make-up is all about time. During daytime, you can wear copper lipstick and beige blusher, for a soft look. In the evening, though, it has to be more sophisticated. You cannot wear red lipstick in the day, but at night, it looks very nice when you go out, Herve tried to convince his conservative clients.																								Event manager Gitanjali Jolly felt most women here have the means and the make-up, but not the knowhow. Young people look nice anyway, but us older women need to know how to look glamorous, yet sophisticated. I need all the help I can get. I came here to learn, and I have.

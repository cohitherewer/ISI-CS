					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Moon with some of the Punjabi specialities from Mahak Punjab Di at Tandoori Nightsi 															Anything Punjabi almost always packs a punch be it their spirited kudis and mundas, their lively music and of course, their simply divine cuisine. Now if piping-hot makki di rotis and delicious sarson da saag appeal, look no further than Tandoori Nights. The Indian speciality restaurant at 54/1/2A, Hazra Road is revving up its tandoor to celebrate all thats good about Punjabi food. 																					able for both lunch and dinner, the menu at Mehak Punjab Di, as the festival is being pegged, features a wide range of kebabs and handis. Ideal starters come by way of the Mutton Boti Kebab, Hariyali Tangri, Til Tikka and Jalandhari Seekh while the Mahi Tikka and the succulent Fish Malai Tikka will probably have fish-lovers hooked. Equally delicious are the few veggie options including Hara Vara Kebab and Tandoori Gobi.																					At Mehak Punjab Di, a go at the gravied delights is highly recommended. You could try out the Sarson Da Saag, Pindi Choley, Saag Paneer and the spicy Rajma Masala even if youre a hardcore non-vegetarian. Meatier bites such as Rara Gosht, Badami Chicken and Makkhan Di Machi also rate right up there on the taste scale. Throw in a couple of parathas (muli, gobi or aloo) and a serving of gajar ka halwa for maximum satisfaction. 																					The best news yet is that Tandoori Nights, a tad on the expensive side earlier, has now slashed its rates by a good 50 per cent. Thus prices at the festival start at a reasonable Rs 55 and go up to a maximum of Rs 145 for a plate of boti kebabs. The flavours of Punjab will continue to hold sway at the restaurant till March 15. For reservations, contact 2486 1212/13. Mamta and Neha Kapoor (left to right) show off a few chikan creations from Navya Naveli 												Chikan chic																					With the sweltering summer days almost upon us, theres no better way to beat the heat than togging up in chikan  a style statement thats as timeless as it is elegant. And for all the chikan-lovers out there, Nayva Naveli has great tidings in store for the cosy little boutique at 114, Jodhpur Park, specialising in all things chikan, has just got bigger, better and busier than ever before. 																					Previously operating out of only one room, the overwhelming response generated by the outlet ever since its launch last year, has prompted proprietresses Neha and Mamta Kapoor to expand their business. Now, spread out over 400 sq. ft, the new-look Navya Naveli houses a huge variety of trendy kurtis, short kurtas, salwar-kameezes, saris and menswear as well as materials for those who prefer to have their clothes made-to-order. Colours are in abundance and while the usual pretty pinks, minty greens and pristine whites rule the roost, the more unusual maroons, bright yellows and blues are also in evidence. You can take your pick here from intricately-embroidered short kurta sets in myriad hues, shaded salwar-kameezes and kurtis jazzed up with sequins and mukaish-work, though, easily stealing the show are the exquisite saris in cotton, chiffon and georgette embellished with various techniques of Lucknawi chikankari such as dhaniya, kangan, murri, tepchi and shadow-work. Prices here start at Rs 350 for the lehariya kurtis with eye-catching chikan-work across the yolk, while the saris could cost you anything between Rs 550 and Rs 2,000.																					The going is equally good for the men. For them, Neha and Mamta have come up with a range of snazzy short kurtas a la Shah Rukh Khan, embroidered shirts as well as traditional kurtas in cotton and georgette, some in a sherwani-style, with intricate thread-work all over. Picking up a kurta here would mean forking out anything between Rs 525 and Rs 1,600. For more on the store, call: 2414 9730.

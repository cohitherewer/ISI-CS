 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Liftmen, docs in death blame
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The family of 23-year-old Moumita Kundu, bronchial asthma patient who died of alleged negligence at SSKM Hospital on Sunday, met superintendent Santanu Tripathi on Tuesday afternoon and submitted a complaint.																								Moumitas father Basudeb alleged that his daughters condition deteriorated after she had to walk up the stairs because the liftman on duty at the emergency ward could not be found. The attendant doctors, too, did not take immediate attention when Moumita was brought to the hospital, the complaint added. 																								The SSKM superintendent has recommended stern action against two liftmen on charges of dereliction of duty. Another inquiry report is scheduled to reach the government on Wednesday.

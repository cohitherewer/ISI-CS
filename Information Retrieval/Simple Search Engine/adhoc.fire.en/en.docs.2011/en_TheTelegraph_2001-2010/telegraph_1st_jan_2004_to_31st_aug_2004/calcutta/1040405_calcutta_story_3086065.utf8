 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Assault cry echo against CAP jawans
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A group of jawans from the Fourth Battalion of the Calcutta Armed Police (CAP) allegedly assaulted a man near Nalban, in Salt Lake, on Saturday night.																								Ananda Mohan Jha, photographer of a local television news channel in Salt Lake, was riding on a two-wheeler on the EM Bypass at around 9.30 pm. A woman journalist of the same channel was riding pillion. 																								Some CAP personnel passed lewd remarks at us while a bus carrying them was overtaking us, alleged Jha. When they protested, the bus screeched to a halt and around 10 CAP men surrounded the two-wheeler.																								They beat me up and abused both of us and even threatened to kill me, Jha said. Pillion-rider Shaonli Das said although the jawans did not touch her, they called me filthy names. 																								Tension erupted after the incident and senior CPM leaders, including the partys candidate for the Dum Dum Lok Sabha seat, Amitabha Nandi, rushed to the spot. A complaint was lodged at Bidhannagar (South) police station. CAP personnel, too, filed a complaint with the same thana.																								Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta felt the law-enforcers should take strong measures against such acts. Police stand for law and order. It is not expected that they indulge in acts of indiscipline, he said. 																								CAP officials doled out denials. According to our information, the person on the two-wheeler was driving rashly. There could have been an accident and so our men protested, said Ajay Ranade, Fourth Battalion deputy commissioner on Sunday.																								But residents near the CAP camp at AF block alleged that the cops had caused much trouble in the locality in the recent past. Last year, complaints were lodged against some jawans by residents of AE block for assault. 																								The jawans reportedly demanded liquor bottles from a paan shop of the local market. They even beat up the shop-owner. Residents who stepped in to protest were also assaulted. A large group of policemen heckled me when I tried to intervene, said Debashis Jana, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward VIII. 																								Late last year, CAP men were again amidst controversy when they allegedly beat up people at AG block during a function to celebrate Lakshmi Puja. 																								Councillor Jana said: We demand an immediate shift of the camp from the area. Earlier, we thought a police camp would provide safety for the residents. It has turned out to be a bane.																								Bidhannagar Municipality officials said the camp was established temporarily for Central Reserve Police Force personnel, who were later shifted to Sector IV. The CAP took over the camp.

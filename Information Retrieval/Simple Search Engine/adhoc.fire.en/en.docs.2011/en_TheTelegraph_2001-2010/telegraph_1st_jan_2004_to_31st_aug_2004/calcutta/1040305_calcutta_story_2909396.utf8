Picture by Aranya Sen 																								A complete rotation of the head  an essential exercise for many, particularly in popular forms of yoga  is bad, as it can damage the spine at the base of the neck. Full sit-ups for a beginner are a no-no																								Fitness is as much about sweating it out as about knowing how to do it right. This was the message from Reebok, as the sports goods giant launched its instructors certification programme in Calcutta on Thursday, at Solace, a health centre in Ballygunge.																								Backed by worldwide research and already established in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore, the Reebok Instructors Alliance (RIA) programme has so far seen 400 Indian instructors  and fitness freaks  go through its rigorous course.																								Spread over five weekends of 16 hours, with 40 hours each of theory and practical, the expert-training regimen doesnt come cheap at Rs 22,000, but it includes the cost of reading material, manuals and music CDs.																								 Lifestyle is changing, even in Calcutta. People want to look and feel good, and they are willing to pay for quality. So, we are quite confident that the course will do well here, observes Parmindar Datt, assistant manager, sports marketing, Reebok India.																								The Sunny Park gym-cum-spa, set up by Yashodhara Khaitan in September 2003, is where the first batch of 20 students will be taught the art and the science of keeping in shape, from March 27, by Reebok master trainers.																								At the end is an exam, with objective and subjective questions in the theory section, and demonstrations in the practicals. The minimum requirement to qualify as a Reebok certified fitness trainer is 70 per cent. Less fit mortals must keep coming back to meet that magic mark.The RIA course is conducted on the basis of quot;scientific, research-based knowledge and principles of exercise quot;. And the syllabus includes a wide range of subjects - physiology, nutrition, choreography, the speed of the music, teaching techniques, rhythm, control (moving fast and keeping an eye on a class to spot individual mistakes), communication skills and even voice modulation, besides the basics. quot;The quality of equipment available, too, has improved, quot; points ot Radha Krishnaswamy, a former national sprinter who cleared the RIA programme before heading for Reebok University in Canton, Massachusetts, and the American Sports University. quot;They work on flexibility, strength and endurance, but include the fun element as well, so people dont feel like they are in a PT class, quot; smiles the only woman master trainer of Reebok in India.With the advancements in knowledge and technology, the gap between the sports community and the general public is closing. And although there are still limitations, the horizons are widening. quot;For instance, a beginner should not do a full sit-up, while an athletes abdominal muscles are more developed. But the spectacular jumps and leaps that ordinary people were told not to do, because it might be bad on the knees, they can do now, with the right training, quot; says Radha.While 90 per cent of her early students were women, now, the men are catching up. Young, middle-class people in India are looking to fitness training as a profession these days, quot; she sums up.

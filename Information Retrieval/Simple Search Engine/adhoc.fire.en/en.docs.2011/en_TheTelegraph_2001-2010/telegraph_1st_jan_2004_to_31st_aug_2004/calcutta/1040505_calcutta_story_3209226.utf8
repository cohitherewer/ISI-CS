Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ) My son is very fond of fish and keeps an aquarium with an Arowana in the northern part of the house. The aquarium stands three feet off the ground. Is this okay? I had also purchased a bunch of bamboo shoots. Where and how should I place them?																								Name and address withheld																								A) Three feet from the ground is perfect for the aquarium. If it is any higher, water can symbolise the drowning  rather than bringing in  of prosperity. Three shoots of bamboo plants are best placed in the east for good health. This can be accompanied by a tall, slim green vase and a lamp with a green shade. 																								Four bamboo shoots when placed in the south-east on three silver coins or on a high-denomination note will help money grow. Two shoots tied together with a red ribbon and kept with a couples photo in a yellow frame, with two yellow square earthen plates or boxes, in the south-west sector, help strengthen the bond between the couple. If you want to boost your career, place nine shoots in the south with star-shaped crystal candle stands, with red candles on a red mat. Fish in an aquarium are fine according to Feng Shui, but make sure it is no more than three feet off the ground. Any more, and the water may symbolise drowning, not success! (Reuters)Q) I am a 25-year-old woman and am planning to get married soon. My fianc and I have taken quite a fancy to wrought iron furniture, and we want to use it in our bedroom. But we were advised against it as wrought iron is not supposed to be Feng Shui friendly. Is this true?																								P. Mukherjee																								A) A wooden framed bed has a positive effect on the bodys energy. It promotes relaxation and restful sleep, whereas metal magnifies surrounding energy and may disrupt sleep. Moreover, metal beds are believed to alter the earths magnetic field. It also depends on your personal pillars of destiny, which can be calculated from your time of birth.																								Q) I am a 28-year-old married woman. Our bedroom, on the first floor of the house, used to be a storeroom earlier. It then became my husbands room, and I moved in when we got married. Due to lack of space and poor design, we have to keep our shoe rack and dustbin right outside the bedroom. Is this auspicious? Married life hasnt been going too well.Priya Mitra, Gariahat A)If negative things like shoe racks and dustbins are kept exposed outside the bedroom, the cosmic chi absorbs the negativity of these objects and is no longer as powerful as it should be inside the room. The entrance should be kept clean. Shoes absorb negativity and dustbins are symbolic of sucking in positive energy when exposed.																								If you cannot remove the shoe rack, it should be enclosed. Ideally, both the shoe rack and the bin should be kept covered in the bathroom, because that is already a negative area.																								Attract positive and healthy energy into your bedroom by placing something beautiful and stable like earthen pots outside the entrance. These will help your marriage.																								Q) I study facing the west. My date of birth is 26.11.89. I perform well in school but would like to do better. How can I increase my concentration? My room is painted light lemon yellow. The eastern wall has pictures of goddesses.																								Name and address withheld																								A) Your name would have helped me know if you are a boy or a girl. Your favourable directions  revealed by your kua number  are the best way of knowing which direction you should face to increase concentration. 																								If you are a girl, add the last two digits of your year of birth to a single number and then add five. This means four is your kua number and north, south, east and south-east your auspicious directions.If you are a male, subtract the single number from 10. This makes two your lucky number and north-east, west, north-west and south-west your favourable directions. In general, north-east is considered best for education, as it is connected with the mind. Keep a small earthen image of a deity or a cluster of crystals here.E-mail your Feng Shui queries, along with your name and date of birth, to:goodlifeabpmail.comOr post them to:The Good Life

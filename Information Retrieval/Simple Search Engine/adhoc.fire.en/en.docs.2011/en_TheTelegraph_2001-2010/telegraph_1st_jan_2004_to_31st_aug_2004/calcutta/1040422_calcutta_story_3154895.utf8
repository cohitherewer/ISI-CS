The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Italian shimmer
 The Italian collection. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 Apart from food, Italians are almost legendary for their sense of style. Though Milan or Rome may still be a far cry away from Calcutta, some fine Italian jewellery has made its way to the city. 																								Trendsmith, the Loudon Street jewellery store, has decided to go big for the auspicious Akshay Tritiya. Italiandi Jewellers has plans to explore the jewellery market and has touched down with a breathtaking collection ranging from classic daily wear to exquisite designer jewellery.																								Affordable and trendy seems the bottomline of the collection. (Comparatively speaking, of course: prices begin from Rs 500 for the lightweight pendants, but you may also have to cough up something like Rs 85,000 for some of the heavier sets.)																								The silk and gold woven scarves are unique, both in design and in concept. They can also double as a waistband, to be easily matched with different outfits, as the colours vary from gold and silver to maroon, black and green. The mesh-like finish and lightweight designs are trendsetting at the very least. 																								The pieces are 18 carat, white, yellow and pink gold in geometric shapes. From a distance, some of the chiselled white gold neckpieces look like diamond-studded necklaces, owing to their bright shimmer.																								While the sand-finish gold pendants are surely worth the price, the design patterns of the smooth, plain gold matte jewellery on display is difficult to find elsewhere. Gold ropes and springs are also guaranteed to add a dash of glamour. 																								While the loop earrings would make for elegant officewear, lightweight pendants shaped like cellphones, shoes, anchors, lamps, engines, elephants and chillies could be great choices for gifts.																								The semi-precious stones, ranging from aquamarine to citrine and amethyst, have been strung together with gold threads to amazing effect. For sheer novelty value, a necklace in which thin strips of black leather are held together a bunch of hollow gold coins, is also worth checking out.						SOMA BANERJEE

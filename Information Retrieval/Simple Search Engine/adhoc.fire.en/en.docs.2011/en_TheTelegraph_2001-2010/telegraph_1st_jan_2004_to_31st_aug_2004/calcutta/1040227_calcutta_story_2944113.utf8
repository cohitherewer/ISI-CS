 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Public flak paves bus depot plan
 A STAFF REPORTERConcerned with the growing public ire over traffic chaos resulting from buses parked on roads, the state transport department is chalking out an action plan to construct bus termini in and around the city with the help of civic bodies. 																								From Tallah to Tollygunge, Howrah to Beleghata  the government has been facing flak from the people in various areas for regular traffic mismanagement due to erratic parking of buses and minibuses on roads. 																								Not only these, several state buses do not have any terminus either and are parked on the streets. This is also one of the reasons behind a rising mishap toll across the city.																								Transport department officials admitted the problems, adding that the operators were compelled to park their vehicles on roads for want of termini.																								According to the existing norms, the onus for constructing termini for both private and state buses lies on the government. The Public Vehicles Department (PVD) is authorised to issue permits to private buses, minibuses and taxis in the city, while the State Transport Authority (STA) is entrusted with issuing permits to vehicles in the districts.																								Both the agencies, officials admitted, have issued a large number of permits on different routes without building the number of adequate termini.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the government, in many cases, had to issue permits to buses and minibuses on certain routes without building a terminus on public demand. 																								I have held talks with various municipal authorities in this regard and asked them to identify the plots where the transport department can build the termini. We will soon hold a meeting with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation on this issue. We have already earmarked some plots, which will be finalised soon. I have asked my officers to draw up an action plan, Chakraborty said.																								Traffic disorder takes a serious turn during rush hours both in north and south Calcutta with nearly half the road space blocked with parked buses and minibuses. Normal flow is severely hampered in congested zones like Shyambazar, Bagbazar, Beckbagan, Gariahat, Bansdroni and Behala.																								The transport department will issue permits for a particular route only after arranging a terminus. While the terminus has to be built by the government, the permit-owner has to ensure a garage where the vehicle can be parked at night, said member of regional transport authority Subhas Mukherjee.																								Some bus and minibus routes would also be restructured, so that they can operate from a terminus, said transport department officials.																								Mukherjee said the transport department had arbitrarily issued permits without making provisions for termini. So, the bus operators are forced to park their vehicles on the road and operate from there. We had brought the matter to the notice of the government several times, but nothing much has happened.

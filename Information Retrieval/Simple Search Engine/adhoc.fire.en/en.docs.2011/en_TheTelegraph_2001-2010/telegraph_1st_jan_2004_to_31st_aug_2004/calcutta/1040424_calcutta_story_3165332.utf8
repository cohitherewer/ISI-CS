The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Ministersvictory by whisker in sugar suit
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee may be gloating over the verdict in the case against Apollo Gleneagles Hospital at the district consumer disputes redressal forum, South 24-Parganas. But his victory does not seem so, at least from the details available about the case.																								The minister had alleged that results of his fasting blood sugar tests conducted by the hospital on samples collected separately were vastly conflicting. A complaint had been filed at the consumer forum on his behalf against the hospital and the doctor who had conducted the tests.																								Documents suggest that the verdict of one of the members of the forum on April 16, directing the hospital to pay a compensation of Rs 5,500 to the minister, was contrary to the position taken by the forums president, who had dismissed the case on December 12, 2003. Another member of the three-member bench had refused to pass an order, saying he had no definite knowledge about the ministers lifestyle.																								A quick reference to Section 14 (2A) of the Consumer Protection Act: Where the proceeding is conducted by the president and one member and they differ on any point or points, they shall state the point or points on which they differ and refer the same to the other member... and the opinion of the majority shall be the order of the district forum.																								But, pointed out Prabir Basu, lawyer on behalf of Apollo Gleneagles: In this case, the order passed by the third member is not in consistence with that passed by the president, and the other member refused to give any verdict. So, this is a drawn game.																								However, minister Chatterjee claimed it was his victory. I had appealed afresh in front of the third member and there is no question about my victory, he told Metro on Friday evening. 																								The verdict delivered by forum president P.C. Kundu on December 2 says: ...it is amply clear from the records that reasonable care and caution was taken by the opponent parties in evaluating the blood sugar level... Stating that deficiency of services could not be attributed to the hospital, he dismissed the case.																								Member B.C. Gomes did not agree and opined that without definite knowledge about the lifestyle of Pratim Chatterjee during the period of time, I am not in a position to adjudicate.																								The third member was ill and absent. She later died. Her successor on the forum, Rama Acharya, directed the hospital and the doctors to pay compensation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Ranks swell of ballot-denied brigade
 A STAFF REPORTER																								What can an oncologist, a professor, a banker and a domestic help in chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Assembly constituency possibly have in common? Nothing, perhaps, except the mystery of a missing link in the list that matters on Monday.																								Poll day 2004 will play supreme leveller, as a wide cross-section of Calcuttans finds itself curiously dropped from the Election Commission voters list.																								Among a host of voters denied is Subir Gangopadhyay, head of department (radiotherapy) at Medical College and Hospital and immediate past president of the Indian Medical Association.																								This is bizarre. I have voted for decades and I also possess a voters identity card, yet nobody bothered to inform me that my name was missing. I got in touch with the Election Commission and respective political parties, but they are just not bothered whether I get to cast my ballot or not, grumbled Gangopadhyay, a resident of Patuli and part of the Jadavpur parliamentary constituency.																								His wife, Kaberi, too, found her name missing from the electoral rolls. Unlike other poll years, no one from either the local CPM or Trinamul Congress camps had alerted the Gangulys about their names going missing.																								Their neighbour Kalyan Sen, too, has a complaint. He had informed the election duty officers, with some time to spare, that his mother had died a year-and-a-half ago. The poll officials had taken note of this and assured Sen that the name would be omitted. When the fresh voters list for this year was released, Kalyan found that his name had been dumped, along with his late mothers.																								In quite another part of town, way up north, stage veteran Rudraprasad Sengupta, wife Swatilekha and daughter Sohini will not be able to exercise their franchise this year, thanks to their names inexplicably disappearing from the list.																								Basudeb Banerjee, chief electoral officer, admitted that some names had mistakenly been omitted while the government was preparing the computerised revised list.																								There is nothing one can do about it now, he added.																								Thats precisely what Trishul Pani Banerjee, an employee with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a resident of Patuli, was told when he made his way to the Election Commission office in BBD Bag a month ago.																								I reminded them that the Election Commission was coming up with a revised list and my name could easily be added there, but they were adamant and insisted that it could only be accommodated later this year, said Banerjee.																								The grouse brigade has assumed formidable numbers, with several names rolling off the rolls. Alpana Banerjee, a professor of physics at a Hooghly college, was resigned to spending a day in front of the TV after learning from the local CPM party office that she did not figure on the voters list.																								Shankar Deb Banerjee, a retired banker and a resident of the Jadavpur Assembly segment, sounded devastated. After living here for 13 years, I got the shock of my life when I found my name missing, he said.																								Vaulting social barriers, the voters list has also left domestic help Shakuntala Bhakta in the lurch. When I found my name missing, some partymen tried telling me that I was to blame. They said I should have checked sooner. I would like to ask them whether their responsibility ends with bringing out a faulty voters list only, demanded Bhakta.

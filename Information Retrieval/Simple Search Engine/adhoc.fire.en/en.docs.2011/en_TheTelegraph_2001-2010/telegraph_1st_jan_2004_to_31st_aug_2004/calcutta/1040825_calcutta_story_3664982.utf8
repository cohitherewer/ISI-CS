 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Ready reckoner on heritage houses
 SOUMITRA DAS																								The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) is doing what either the Bengal government or the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ought to have done a long time ago. 																								Intach has put together a listing of heritage structures in the city, and this will be launched in book form during the Pujas, said Gaur Mohan Kapur, convener, Intach West Bengal and Calcutta regional chapters, on Monday.																								Among its varied activities in the city, Intach has, of late, signed a memorandum of understanding to set up an art conservation centre in association with the Academy of Fine Arts. 																								For quite some time now, the CMC, too, has undertaken a similar documentation. But Intach will, in all probability, beat the CMC to the task of reaching the public. The Intach book will be about 350 pages thick, but its price has not been fixed yet. 																								The massive task of creating a comprehensive inventory of what amounts to the history of the citys built environment was undertaken by architect Nilina Deb Lal on behalf of Intach in June last year. 																								Initial documentation was done in the late 80s and again in the 90s collectively by various teams, prominent among its participants being architects Debasis Nayak, Anjan Mitra and Sriparna Kundu.																								But all this data on buildings in the Calcutta municipal area, says Deb Lal, was neither collated nor double-checked. 																								The structures had not been graded, there were no map markings, no details of ownership and certainly no photographs. 																								All buildings are not necessarily prominent ones but have a place in the culture of the city. Intach has shared all this data with the CMCs expert committee on heritage, headed by Barun De.																								Intachs aim was to enhance public awareness and bring to the attention of statutory bodies buildings and structures that may or may not figure on their heritage list. 																								Intach also sought to create a photographic record of buildings that are bound to disappear. Of the 500-600 structures documented will be unique ones like Writers Buildings and the Town Hall; prominent religious places; a few churches (We are aware that we have left out others that are of various historical or social interest, says Deb Lal); residences of prominent personalities; residences typical of a style such as the buildings on Sarat Bose Road, with their frontage divided into three bays, the central being for egress with the other two flanking it; and miscellaneous structures such as the ghats.																								Deb Lal says this was a massive exercise within a limited period of time, and dates and information on ownership and occupancy, current usage and original usage (if they were different) are accurate as far as possible. 																								Where a structure has a social, historical or cultural value, a short background note is provided. Deb Lal acknowledges her indebtedness to Debasis Bose and Abhik Ray, both of whom have dealt with Calcuttas history for a long time.																								Deb Lal is trying to grade the buildings in accordance with three values they have identified  archaeological, architectural and historical or social. This will help readers interpret the significance of a building at a glance. Deb Lal sums up her attempt thus: This is one step in the whole process of conservation. We see ourselves as facilitators.																								About the conservation centre, Kapur says Calcutta has a wealth of art and art objects. Intach already has such centres in Lucknow, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar and Jaipur. Now it is Calcuttas turn.

 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Floral trail for cosy corners
Picture left by Rashbehari DasAs the globe shrinks into a village and sprawling bungalows into pigeon-hole apartments, there is little choice but to package natures bounty in miniature form.No, we are not talking bonsai here, fruity-floral fragrances of pot-pourrie is the pick of the week. Jasmine, rose, lavender, mulberry, lime, oranges, apples, peach and even cinnamon and vanilla are a few of the aromas wafting out of homes, with an assortment of dried flowers, leaves, seeds, cones and twigs bringing the great outdoors onto table tops.																								Combined with essential aromatic oils, a bowl of pot-pourrie can enliven the dreariest bedroom, bathroom, car, closet or drawer. Some brands of assorted dry mixtures come with their own distinctive oil, a few drops of which can perk up the pack once its own fragrant steam runs out.RACK RAIDERPot-Pourrie Brands

 How much
Around Rs 60 for 90 gm, 
Rs 90 for 100 gm, Rs 110 for 190 gm; Rs 65 for 8 ml of essential oilsThe nose job apart, pot-pourrie, in bright natural or artificial colours, provides refreshing eye candy as well. However, its advisable to cover the contents with a lid before stepping out of the room for longer fragrance endurance. The smells last longer in closed air-conditioned rooms rather than in the open. Dont even try to perfume a verandah or terrace.																								But wide open spaces are a natural source for pot-pourrie. Next time you hear the crunch of leaves under your feet, look closer. You can scoop a bowl full of dried darlings like tiny buds, seeds and cones to try your hand at some home-grown pot-pourrie.																								Heres how it goes: Gently shake each flower and seed to make sure it is free of bugs. Put your collections in a large container of borax crystals. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and let it stay for a few weeks in a cool, dry place. After a few days, sift through the mixture to scoop out the dried parts and let the rest sit for a little while longer. Eventually, youll get a disinfected bunch of beauties, ready to be swathed in an essential oil of your choosing. Pack in pillow sachets or gift containers or just sprinkle them around for a happy feeling.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

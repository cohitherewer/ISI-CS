The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 A Tuesday of train trauma
 OUR BUREAU																								P.N. Singh, 55, shifted in his wheelchair. The mining engineer of Eastern Coalfields arrived at Howrah station, from Thiruvananthapuram, at 4.40 am on Tuesday by the Shaktipunj Express. Singh was on his way to Asansol, but on Tuesday, he was going nowhere, with the tracks blocked by the bandh battalion. 																								We found it difficult to survive at Howrah, said the ECL engineer, who has been bound to the wheelchair after a mining accident in 1989. 																								Like Singh, hundreds of passengers were stranded at Howrah station on Tuesday as train services were paralysed. Outside the station, there was no transport. Station manager Virendra Prasad said despite earnest efforts by the railways to run trains, squatters had stopped them in their tracks.																								Among the long-distance trains cancelled due to the obstruction were the Up Poorva Express, Up Toofan Express, Up/Dn Black Diamond Express, Up/Dn Santiniketan Express, Up Coalfield Express, Up Howrah-Asansol Agniveena Express, Up Howrah-Rampurhat Intercity Express, Up/Dn Sealdah-Asansol Intercity Express, Up Mithila Express, Up Howrah-Jamalpur Express, Up Upasana Express, Up Himgiri Express, Up Bhagirathi Express and the Up Jammu Tawi Express.																								Tales of train trauma abounded at Howrah. Ajay Agarwal was travelling by the Poorva Express with his family when the train was blocked at Belmuri station, in Hooghly, early on Tuesday. His two children, aged four and five, were the worst sufferers. The train finally rolled into Howrah at 3.30 pm, but there was no way the Agarwals could reach their Duttapukur destination.																								At Sealdah station, the chaos was caused by a large number of passengers who had come into the city with the intention of attending office, only to realise that they could get to nowhere from the station. And there were no trains to take them back home, either.																								Some of the train trouble will spill over into Wednesday, with the following trains being rescheduled from Tuesday: The Sealdah-New Jalpaiguri Superfast Express will leave Sealdah at 9 am The Howrah-New Delhi Superfast Express will leave Howrah at 6.45 pm The Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express will leave Howrah at 8 am The Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express will leave Sealdah at 8.15 am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Odd silence on trade licence
 Anupam Dutta				 	 Anupam Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward no. 7, Bidhannagar Municipality, met readers of The Telegraph at his ward office to answer their queries. Participants included Subhasish Ghosh, Anira Dutta, Shambhu Ghosh, Ashoke Ghosh, Achyut Basu and Wrik Bhattasali				 																																																																																																																																																																																																													

Subhasish Ghosh: We hear the municipality is issuing licences to local jobless youth for setting up pollution-free manufacturing units.																																																			Such a decision was arrived at during a board meeting in December 2003. Three months have elapsed, but the municipality has yet to act on it. Even we councillors arent aware of how such licences can be obtained. The matter is hanging fire for no apparent reason.																																																									

Wrik Bhattasali: Plots in the municipal area are being transferred in an unlawful manner.																																																			The problem is that the conditions of lease are flouted and the municipality has very little vigilance to check it. We had appealed many times earlier to put an end to this lease clause and to start an ownership system while distributing the plots. But the required transparency in land transfers has not come about. So, theres a spurt in sub-tenancy and illegal leases.																																																									

Anira Dutta: The mosquito menace needs firm handling. Civic workers who spray repellents dont use the full quantity allotted to them.																																																			Keshtopur canal, that runs along the township, is the cradle for mosquitoes. The canal is being dredged and it is expected that the menace will subside. The sewerage treatment plant at Bagjola, too, is not functioning properly. If the plant is not repaired, theres no checking the mosquitoes. About repellent sprays, I can only say that the entire operation is ill-planned.																																																									

Shambhu Ghosh: The township never had any serious sewerage problem. But now, even a smart shower results in water standing on the roads for days.																																																			We have two outlets that drain out the sewerage water into Keshtopur canal. Both are blocked. So, the water that accumulates in the ward takes a long time to recede. A few months ago, a foreign company had offered to clear the outlets, but the project was stillborn. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had appointed a three-man committee to prepare a report on the condition of the outflow channels, but no report has been submitted yet.																																																									

Shambhu Ghosh: There are several vats in our ward but the clearance is erratic.																																																			The municipality collects the waste through a centralised system. A few vehicles are deputed in the entire municipal area to collect the garbage and deposit it at Mathpukur. We were told that there is a shortage of vehicles. But we see many of them lying inoperative for want of maintenance. The municipality does not have any immediate plan to increase the number of vehicles. However, there is a plan for more vats, once the election is over.																																																									

Achyut Basu: Drinking water is scarce.																																																			We are trying our best to resolve the problem. There are four deep tubewells in the ward and two pumps operating non-stop in shifts. We also have a reservoir for excess water. In spite of all these, the scarcity has cropped up. We notice that the pumps are lifting less volume of water. We dont know the reason but it needs immediate redress. Water department officials of the municipality have yet to respond.																																																									

Achyut Basu: The bylanes need to be better lit.																																																			The funds are ready but work was stalled by the pre-election code of conduct. We will instal some tubelights in the area, and rest of the lamp-posts will be fitted with incandescent bulbs. That will save us money, which can be used for maintenance of the streetlights. 																																																									

Wrik Bhattasali: Petty theft is on the rise.																																																			Though this not a civic problem, we have informed the police about it. But they arent adequately equipped to tackle petty theft. The total road length of my ward is 80 km. It is very difficult for police to keep a simultaneous vigil on the entire stretch. Earlier bids by district police superintendent M.H. Harisena Verma to rein in these criminals was resisted by some CPM members.

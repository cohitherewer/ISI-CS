 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Master and his music
																								The timeless appeal of Indian classical ragas has been enriched over centuries by poetic compositions rendered in accordance with the strictures of the ragas. An essential creative pursuit of our classical masters, these immensely popular bandishes have had magical effects on connoisseurs and casual listeners alike. Sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan has a number of such wonderful compositions to his credit. Two of his disciples, Violin brothers Deb Shankar and Jyoti Shankar, along with renowned percussionists S Sekhar and Tanmoy Bose, will showcase these compositions on both Indian and Western orchestrations; a rare attempt to synthesize Indian and Western instruments on purely Indian classical compositions. The programme would be preceded by a lecture demonstration by the Ustad himself.																								Event: Lecture-demonstration by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan; violin recital by Deb Shankar and Jyoti Shankar																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall

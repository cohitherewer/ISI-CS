 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Mini-markets secure civic crackdown
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic authorities on Wednesday announced plans for a crackdown on mini-bazaars on pavements along highrises. These bazaars, said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), dirty the neighbourhood and block the sewerage channels.																								These bazaars are a nuisance, the result of mushrooming multi-storeyed buildings in the city, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said, adding that he has asked his conservancy chief Rajiv Deb to form a special team to carry out a regular drive against them.																								We have spotted 600 such mini-bazaars in front of big and small housing estates in the city, said chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar. The proliferation is more to the south and east, apart from the added areas of Behala and Jadavpur. Assistant director (conservancy)  Swapan Mahapatra identified some of these bazaars at: Dover Lane, in front of  the central government quarters Under Bijon Setu, close  to the CIT quarters Broad Street, in front  of Uttara Garcha Road, off the housing  quarters of the RBI, central excise and income-tax officers Patuli, near Ruby General  Hospital, in front of Manjulika and Railbihar housing estates Ultadanga in front of the  government housing estates Kankurgachhi, near Maniktala  Civic Centre, and Ananda Palit Road, in front  of the government quarters.																								In a good number of these markets, everything from green vegetables to livestock, fish and meat are sold.																								It is a riddle why flat-owners allow littering of the roads and pavements leading to their housing estates, when there are 33 civic markets and more than 150 private markets in the city, and the nearest market from each of these housing estates is hardly 20 minutes on foot, said the mayor. If the mini-bazaars were really convenient, the flat-owners could settle them on the open spaces in each housing estate, he added.																								According to conservancy officials, the garbage the vendors leave behind on the road or pavement or in a vat remain there for the rest of the day, until the civic sweepers arrive the next morning. Some of the vendors pour the trash into the open drains or the underground sewer lines by wresting open the manhole covers, clogging them completely.

 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 The movie merchant
 Ismail Merchant It has been three winters since Ismail Merchant made public his plans to make a film about Rabindranath Tagore. But the announcement has been followed by silence, with no concrete word from the producer-director on the subject.																								The untitled project, with Soumitra Chatterjee slated to play the lead, has been registered and listed on the Internet Movie Database (or www.imdb.com) as a project in pre-production. And while the details are subject to change, the film will be about, as Merchant had announced at the Calcutta Film Festival 2001, Tagores friendship with the French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland.																								If Ben Kingsley can play Mahatma Gandhi, Soumitra Chatterjee can play Rabindranath Tagore, Merchant, maker of films such as Howards End and A Room With a View, had then said.																								Scriptwriter Caryl Philips, whose pen was behind Merchants screen adaptation of V.S. Naipauls The Mystic Masseur, has been enlisted as writer for this project as well. The film is to revolve around the meeting of the minds, against the backdrop of Europe in the 1920s and 30s.																								Merchant has his hands full of films at the moment. One that has made it to the headlines is The Goddess, after it faced opposition from conservative Hindu lobbies in the UK. Another venture with long-time collaborator James Ivory, it is to have Tina Turner playing Shakti or Kali. The rock stars sexually-charged stage image is the peeve point among protestors. The Mumbai-born film-maker will direct The Goddess, also to feature Matthew Modine.																								Merchant is also bringing together Vanessa Redgrave, Ralph Fiennes and Natasha Richardson for The White Countess, scripted by Kazuo Ishiguro. Filming will start soon, with the story set in 1930s Shanghai. Glenn Close is returning to a Merchant production called Heights after last years Le Divorce. James Marsden and Isabella Rossellini have also been roped in, though Mia Farrow had to back out, reportedly due to stage dates. 																								Finally, Merchant, who has been busy of late penning memoirs and cookbooks, is also producing The City of Your Final Destination, to be directed by Ivory and adapted by another enduring partner, Ruth Jhabvala.

 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 An Odissi experience
In celebration of Utkal Dibas, Utkal Shiksha Sansad presents Sthapatya Satya, an Odissi dance ensemble based on Bandha Nritya (a specialised form of Odissi dance in which dancers make highly stylised acrobatic movements forming intricate body postures). Based on extensive research and embellished with Bandha in four kinds of performing arts  Chitra, Kavya, Nritya and Geeta  the choreography of this production is inspired by ancient monuments and temple sculptures, capturing the essence of Orissas magnificent heritage and tradition. Performed mainly by gotipuas or young male dancers, this unique dance recital blends the old, rustic, pristine, gotipua dance with the sophisticated Odissi dance of the present age. Presented by the artistes of Abhinya Sundar Gotipua Nritya Parishad of Raghurajpur, Orissa and Shinjan Nrityalaya, Calcutta, Sthapatya Satya (choreography: Aloka Kanungo) also makes a sincere effort to revive the traditional Bandha Nritya from the verge of extinction.

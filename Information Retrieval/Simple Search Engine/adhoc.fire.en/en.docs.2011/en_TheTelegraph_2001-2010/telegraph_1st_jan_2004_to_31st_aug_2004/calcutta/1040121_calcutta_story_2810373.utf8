The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004  Cal Guide Shanghai Tiny yet cosy with a warm  and homely atmosphere, Shanghai is a little-known-of restaurant  tucked away in the heart of Jodhpur Park  low on swank  and swagger but high on good old Chinese food.  Set up by Shantanu Doss,  Kaushik Bose and Nilanjan Haldar late last year, Shanghai  has become a big hit in the neighbourhood by dint of there  not being too many outlets dishing out Oriental fare. Says  Doss, Customers feel like theyre sitting in someones  dining room and were fine with that. We are concentrating  our energies on providing good, wholesome food and judging  by all those who keep coming back, the formula is working  out fine.  The elaborate and the  exotic you wouldnt find on Shanghais menu but then again,  its all about the simple stuff. Have a go at such soups  and starters as Sweet Corn Soup, the spicy Hot and Sour  mix, Chicken Wontons or Fried Prawns before moving on to  the main attractions. Here pork-lovers have reason to rejoice  given the several pork dishes offered including Pork Hot  Garlic, Manchurian Pork, pork tossed with veggies and a  not-to-be-missed Chilli Pork. Theres plenty of fish, chicken  and prawn as well  all available in a variety of sauces  and combos. Those who prefer avoiding meat can take their  pick from Egg Foo Young teamed with chicken, pork or prawns  or an array of vegetarian items.  Eating out at Shanghai  is far from a costly affair as prices range between Rs 20  and Rs 125. Open throughout the week except Thursdays, Shanghai  undertakes home delivery and party orders too.  Address: 255/2, Jodhpur  Park, close to Nava Nalanda  Phone nos: 2473 9313/ 98311  69769.

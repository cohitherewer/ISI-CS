The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Rajarhat drug supply source
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The interrogation of a peddler has led the police to a major drug racket in the city and its adjoining areas. 																								The man had been rounded up recently. The racket involves supply of narcotics and psychotropic substances from North 24-Parganas to the city and its southern limits.																								Mohd Ayub, who peddled drugs in the Watgunge-Ekbalpore belt, was arrested on Wednesday. Police seized 255 g of heroin from him, worth about Rs 22 lakh, one of the largest hauls in Calcutta recently. Ayub is now in police custody.																								A resident of Watgunge, Ayub has a record of selling narcotics, and had been arrested several times earlier, said T.K. Ganguly, officer-in-charge of Ekbalpore police station.																								Ayub told his interrogators that he would acquire his stock from the Rajarhat area, confirming suspicions about the location of the source of narcotic substances that come into the city.																								Tanmay Mandal, Rajarhats Trinamul Congress MLA, said the zone, spanning Rajarhat, Rajbati, Khairibari and Koypool, had grown into a notorious crime belt, with narcotic substances being sold openly at wholesale rates.																								This is where a significant portion of drugs comes into Calcutta from, he added. 																								A crackdown has proved to be difficult, since the criminals operate from the fringes of two different police station areas, Rajarhat and Barasat. It seems they get information about police raids in advance, a senior police officer said.																								There are also many loopholes in the law, and the racket bounces back after a few days. As it is, the peddlers operate out of insulated places, where it is difficult to reach them, said the officer.

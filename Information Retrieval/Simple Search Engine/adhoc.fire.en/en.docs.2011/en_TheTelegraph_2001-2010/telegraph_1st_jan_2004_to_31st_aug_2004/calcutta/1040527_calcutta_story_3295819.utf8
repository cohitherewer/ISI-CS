 															- CBSE results analysis puts Calcutta ahead of most cities A STAFF REPORTER 																								A slice of school students did the city proud on Wednesday by coming through the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) for Class XII with flying colours.																								The board does not practise the system of providing statistics of region-wise positions on performance of students in CBSE. But a quick analysis of the results available from the schools definitely shows that the performance of students in Calcutta was better than many other cities in the country, confirmed an official working closely with the board.																								Students of over 100 CBSE schools  a bulk of which are in the city and 54 of which are Kendriya Vidyalayas  had appeared for the school-leaving examinations this year. And the results were almost all good.																								No failures were reported from most high-profile institutions, like Apeejay School, both the girls and boys sections of Birla High School, Lakshmipat Singhania School, Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School and Ashok Hall.																								The pass percentage in the 54 Kendriya Vidyalayas is over 90 per cent, which is higher than most states, said K.K. Dubey, education officer of the schools in Calcutta.																								Though CBSE awards only grades to students and no aggregate marks or divisions, many schools were busy on Wednesday downloading results of their students from the websites, preparing their own merit lists by adding up marks obtained in different subjects and tabulating the highest percentages.																								A total of 246 students had appeared in the examination this year, of whom 232 have scored first division marks and many of them managed above 80 per cent in aggregate. The students of my school in all three streams  science, commerce and humanities  have performed brilliantly this time, said Mukta Nain, principal of Birla High School for Boys.																								The results of Birla High School for Girls were equally good, with 157 out of 159 examinees managing a first division.																								Rita Chatterjee, principal, Apeejay School, said all 90 students appearing for the exams had performed brilliantly, with Vivek Upadhyay of the science stream topping with over 93 per cent. At Mahadevi Birla, a commerce student scored a 90.																								An official of Lakshmipat Singhania School said around six students scored above 90 per cent, which was an improvement upon last years results.

																																																																																		The case filed by Eastern India Automobile Association, challenging the validity of the notification issued by the state government asking four-wheeler owners to pay five years road tax at a time, came up for hearing on Wednesday before Justice B. Bhattacharjee of Calcutta High Court. The court adjourned the hearing and directed that the interim order would continue till further order. Earlier, the court had passed an interim order allowing the state government to collect the new tax from owners of the four-wheelers but said that the collected amount would have to be refunded if the petition was allowed after the final hearing. The government had asked the owners to pay the road tax. But Justice P.K. Roy of Calcutta High Court had already passed an interim order of injunction on the notification of the government. Subsequently, the state government had also extended the time limit of paying the taxes till January 31.

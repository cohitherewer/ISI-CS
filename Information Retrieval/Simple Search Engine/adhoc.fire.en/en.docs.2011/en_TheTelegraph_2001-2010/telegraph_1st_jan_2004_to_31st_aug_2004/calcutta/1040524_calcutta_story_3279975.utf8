The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Switch-off over subscriber list
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 Britney Spears on a promotional tour of her film Crossroads, which 60,000 households in Calcutta, Howrah and Hooghly didnt get to see when Star Movies beamed it on Sunday																								The STAR and Sony bouquet of channels remains off-limits for close to 60,000 households in north and central Calcutta, parts of Howrah and Hooghly. The homes to suffer are under multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCables Calcutta Communications (Calcom) franchise.																								RPG Netcom, city distributor of the two bouquets, blamed the Saturday afternoon switch-off on Calcoms refusal to provide the subscriber listing report, a check-list of franchisees and number of connections that all broadcasters seek from MSOs.																								While others regularly provide us with the report, Calcom, despite repeated requests, has failed to provide us with theirs, said an RPG Netcom official. We cannot sell a product without knowing where and how much of it is being sold, he added.																								Calcom officials, however, claimed the switch-off had taken place on illegal and unethical grounds. Our payments to STAR and Sony are clear till May, claimed a spokesperson for the company. The issue is actually a revamp that RPG Netcom is seeking. If need be, the channels will remain off-air as long as its necessary, he warned. Calcom has replaced the two bouquets with channels from Zees direct-to-home platform and other free-to-air channels, he added.																								With polls out of the way, the STAR and Sony switch-off could kick off a fresh round of cable conflict, with a section of operators protesting the steps being taken to further streamline the industry and address the under-declaration issue.																								RPG Netcom is seeking a declaration of 40 per cent connectivity from its own operators from June. Calcutta, of course, is infamous for notoriously low declaration from cable operators.																								In the absence of regulation, there is a lot of anomaly in the market, said an industry source. Around 30 per cent of the operators declare only around 17 per cent, another 30 per cent have a declaration of around 40 per cent, and the remaining declare around 80 per cent.																								RPG Netcom aims to target the lowest-declaration segment among operators. To remove the existing disparity in the market, we are trying to make those with less than 40 per cent declaration fork out more, while those with over 40 per cent can have the option of bringing down their declaration, explained an RPG Netcom official.																								This operator friendly move, the MSO feels, would actually help its cause and calm small operators complaining of their being squeezed dry while others are getting away with low declaration.																								To back its claims, RPG Netcom is carrying out extensive market surveys to find out the number of operators under the bigger cable operators and the 180-odd master control rooms that dot the CMDA area. The company is also requesting MSOs like SitiCable, Manthan and CableComm to take the message to their operators.																								Ill be happy to sign the agreement of 40 per cent declaration, provided everyone else is made to do the same, said a senior cable operator in the Dum Dum area, mirroring the mood among most.

 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Wall collapse kills three
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Police inspect a pit in Alipore in which a wall collapsed, killing three on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Three labourers, working at a petrol pump on Belvedere Road, were crushed to death when a wall collapsed on them early on Saturday. The contractor, sub-contractor, supervisor and a lorry driver, Salam Ali Mollah, were arrested in the evening.																								Kausar Khan, 26, Mani Sheikh, 22, and Saidul Vaidya, 27, were digging a pit along the wall to instal an underground fuel tank when the incident occurred.																								While Khan and Sheikh died on the spot, Vaidya succumbed to his injuries at SSKM Hospital. Mollah, who was lending a hand, said all three were residents of Kultali and Raidighi, assistant commissioner of police, K. Chattopadhyay said.																								We were asked to dig deeper into the pit at the base of the wall and remove the soil. At around 4 am, soon after the three climbed down into the pit and started digging, the upper portion of the wall caved in. The rest of us were standing outside the pit in a queue to take away the soil, Mollah told the police during interrogation.																								Other labourers panicked and fled the spot leaving the three buried under the debris.																								Perhaps they felt they would get into trouble when the police arrived. The Alipore police station is located close to the petrol pump. By the time we reached, two of the labourers had already died. We found Vaidya gasping for breath and rushed him to the hospital. He died later, Chattopadhyay said.																								Ruby Dutta, local councillor and chairperson of borough 9, said: We have issued a notice to Indian Oil Corporation for negligence, as a supervisor should have been present, she said. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has served a stop-work notice to petrol pump owner Ramesh Chandra Ojha.																								According to Ashok Roychowdhury, CMC director general, buildings, the contractor had not taken adequate safety measures at the site to set up an underground LPG gas chamber.																								Though they had taken permission for the work from us, they were not abiding by all the rules. A shoring (a structure to support the surface on the sides to avoid the adjacent ground from caving in) has to be set up while digging a pit more than a metre in depth. In this case, the pit was more than two metres in depth, Roychowdhury said.																								However, police are also looking into allegations by petrol pump workers that the digging was unauthorised.																								Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division, said a case of negligence endangering human life had been started against the four arrested. S.K. Tripathi, spokesperson for Indian Oil Corporation, said: If police investigation reveals negligence on the part of the contractor, action will be taken against him.

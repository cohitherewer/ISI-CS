The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 18, 2004  Next week you can be at Gongoni
Heard of names that have a nice ring to them? Well, heres one that has a gong to it. Gongoni. This is red-rock region, where wind and water have carved and chiselled a harsh ravined landscape of forbidding grandeur. Its just like the Grand Canyon, only scaled down.																								The craggy cliffs of laterite, saw-toothed and stripped bare, seem a scene straight out of the wild west, only this west is in West Midnapore, four hours by train and a short jerky journey by bus or trekker from Garbeta station.																								This narcissist, crimson land that blushes with every sunrise looking, as local residents say, at its beauty mirrored in the Silabati stream that threads its way through the canyon floor, is no place for luxury lovers or logic seekers. But if it is legends of epic proportions that youre looking for, this is the place.At a time when the Pandavas, of Mahabharata fame, were roaming the length and breadth of the country keeping a low profile, they had passed Gongoni.																								The land then was as flat as a wallet at the end of a month and ruled by a demon, Bak Rakshasa. His culinary craving was topped by a daily dose of humanity. So, each day, a person from the nearby village would have to go to the demons cave to offer himself for lunch.SURVIVAL KITMosquito repellent

 Camera, to catch the play of light and shadowWhen the Pandavas reached Gongoni, if that is what the place was known as in that era, they stayed at a brahmins house. Soon, it was the turn of the head of the family to offer himself to the rakshasa. Always ready to put bullies in their place, Kunti asked Bhima to fill in for the brahmin. 																								Bhima gladly obliged. Bak Rakshasa was elated to find such a meaty meal headed his way. The poor devil had no idea what he was getting into.																								Bak Rakshasa and Bhima fought a pitched battle. The earthshaking combat lasted several days and left the land creased and battered with scars that even time could not heal.																								The rest, as they say, is history and a very successful Sunday television series. The demon was vanquished and we got ourselves a wonderful tourist destination.																								On the far bank of the Silabati stands Bhimnagar, a cluster of hamlets named after the legendary hero. Visitors can wade across in the dry season or have a boat ferry them during the monsoon.If Gongoni sounds interesting, visit it as soon as possible because the government has woken up to the places tourist potential. Soon, hotels, resorts and other such eyesores, including a proposed ropeway, will cram the crown of the cliffs. And the Gongoni of today will be going, going Gongoni tomorrow. How to get there Train: Rupashi Bangla Express. Leaves Howrah every day at 6 am and reaches Garbeta at 9.43 am. Fare: AC chair car Rs 229, second class seat Rs 70. Bookings open 10 days in advance. Take a bus or trekker to Gongoni from the station.Where to stayA spartan dharamshala on the way to Gongoni. Its on the main road itself and all buses and trekkers stop there. Around Rs 70 for a double-bed room. You can eat at the nearby hotels. Adventure lovers can take tents and food and rough it out in the canyon Sankar Sridhar

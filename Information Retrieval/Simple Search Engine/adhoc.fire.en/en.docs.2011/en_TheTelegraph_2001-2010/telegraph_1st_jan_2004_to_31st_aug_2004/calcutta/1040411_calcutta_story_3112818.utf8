 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Bar council rap for lawyer
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The West Bengal Bar Council on Saturday suspended for three years an advocate of Calcutta High Court for gross professional misconduct.																								The council found Shakti Kumar Chatterjee guilty of cheating his client, Dye Chem India Limited, a company based in Park Street.																								A three-member committee of the council asked both the lawyer and the representative of the company to be present before it. But Chatterjee did not appear before the committee on the given date, even after receiving repeated notices and reminders.																								On the basis of the documents furnished by company representative Manish Bihani, the committee, comprising Siba Prasad Roy, Rabin Saha and Ashok Bakshi, was convinced that the accused lawyer had taken Rs 9,240 from the company for doing various legal jobs for it. The lawyer gave his client false information that he had filed a title suit in the court of assistant district judge in the Alipore court. The client became suspicious following inordinate delays on the part of the lawyer. The company made inquiries and found that the lawyer had not filed any suit on their behalf, the council committee observed.																								Describing the matter as a criminal breach of trust and against the rule laid down in the Advocates Act, the committee decided to impose a ban on his practice for three consecutive years.																								Bar council sources said the number of complaints against lawyers filed before the council was increasing alarmingly. At present, 53 cases against lawyers remained to be disposed of, they said. According to the sources, the longest sentence in recent history was given to a high court lawyer in 2003. He was suspended for five years.

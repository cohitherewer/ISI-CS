The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Journey to discover grassroots music
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Moushumi Bhowmik at a programme at CIMA Gallery																								The grants being awarded by the India Foundation for the Arts (IFA) to promote and encourage the arts, particularly practitioners and research workers looking for an alternate source of funding, first came into prominence about two years ago in Calcutta. Headquartered in Bangalore, the IFA was registered as a public trust in 1993.																								This time one of the grantees from Calcutta is Moushumi Bhowmik, known for the past 15 years for writing and singing her own compositions. Bhowmik will explore and collect compositions in Bengali folk music on biraha or the sense of longing and sadness that overwhelms one when ones beloved has gone out of sight or is far away from ones immediate surroundings. She has won a grant of Rs 4,25,000 over two years. She will have to return to the IFA equipment worth Rs 65,000 that she will acquire for her work.																								Bhowmik says that although she has been working independently for the past two decades this is the first time she has won institutional support. She says she has an affinity for folk music. Music is my chosen field and after being deeply involved in it for the past 15 years I want to keep my practice alive, she says. She asserts that she can never become a regular performing artist and so has to create her own alternate space.																								She plans to embark on a journey through Birbhum, Burdwan, north Bengal, Goalpara and Cachar in Assam, travel along the Tripura border to Comilla and along Shillong to Sylhet, subject to whether or not she will be allowed to travel across the border. In Bangladesh she will travel through Mymensingh, Rangpur, Jessore, Faridpur and Kushtia. Earlier, she had planned to do this with singer Shubha Mudgal but nothing came of it.																								Asked how she will ensure authenticity, Bhowmik says purists are horrified if there is any deviation. So I wonder, do I have any business at all to practice folk music? But I do take a genuine interest in it and am honest in my approach, she says. She is not afraid of subjective interpretation. 																								Ultimately, she will hand over the collection to an archive. The only one she has found till now is the American Institute of Asian Studies in Gurgaon. Bhowmik says she would have preferred Bengal but she has to be careful about copyright. 																								The other grantees are Himanshu Burte of Mumbai who supports publication of Include by design architecture for the inclusive artspace, Mahendra Kumar, Calcutta, for public workshops in animation, and Nilina Deb Lal for interaction between architect and middle school children. 																								Nandita Palchoudhuri, trustee and chairperson, IFA, says the foundation has taken up a project of translating art material and manuals available in English into Bengali and Marathi. An effort is on to create a module for art education in association with the Indian Museum so that students can relate visits to the museum with their syllabus. A mobile museum will allow children to drop by.

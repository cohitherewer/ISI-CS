The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 All eyes on a marked man
 																											- Jail vigil beefed up to ensure well-being till last minute A STAFF REPORTERIt was around noon when the iron-bar gate of cell no. 3 was unlocked. Four men took up position, cordoning off a four-ft-by-five-ft open-air concrete platform just in front of the condemned cell of Alipore Central jail. All eyes were on a middle-aged man, tall and dark, till he finished his bath.																								The special vigil, beefed up immediately after word reached the south Calcutta prison that the President had rejected Dhananjoy Chatterjees mercy plea, is, ironically, to protect more than guard him.																								We are keeping a close eye on him even while he is bathing so that he does not slip and fall, explained a jail official, adding: We are concerned about his physical and mental health. Any sort of illness could become a major problem for us.																								The day after the tiny radio in his cell brought him news of the Presidents mercy plea rejection, Dhananjoy, according to warders, was less restless.																								The radio remained his sole companion, but unlike Wednesday, when he was frenetically switching channels, Thursday found him tuning into film songs on one particular frequency.																								He also shared a joke with the warders during his afternoon bath. Aare, ami paliye jabo na (Its okay, I wont run away), Dhananjoy told the four guards watching him.																								He may be thinking that the vigil has been beefed up so that he cannot flee. But it is his well-being that is vital to us, said a jail official.																								Jail doctor Basudeb Mukherjee examined Dhananjoy after the official order of the Presidents rejection reached the Alipore prison. Mukherjee also asked the condemned man several questions and all the answers were satisfactory.																								A jail official said: After carrying out a half-an-hour check, the doctor has certified that Dhananjoy is physically fit and there is no sign of any mental illness.																								Thursday was like any other day for Dhananjoy. He slept for one-and-a-half hours after lunch. In the afternoon, he was seen walking around in his cell. And around 6.05 pm, he switched on his radio set and tuned into the news, said a jail official.																								Just once, Dhananjoy came close to the iron bars of his cell and asked one of the warders whether there was any visitor for him.																								There was no one and the man awaiting a date with death returned to his radio.

				 																																									The recently held match between Calcuttas soccer giants witnessed a packed house at Salt Lake stadium. This shows that football is still the most popular sport in Calcutta. It is heartening that after a lull, local soccer is back in demand among the citys sport enthusiasts. The behaviour of the spectators was praiseworthy. The IFA authorities should also be applauded for reviving interest in the league which was previously a lacklustre affair.

Fuel cost is only a small part of the total expenditure incurred by bus-owners. The cost of fuel makes up only about 25 per cent of the fare. The break-up of the ticket price also consists of interest and depreciation, cost towards maintenance of the bus, taxes, insurance premium, provision for contingencies, other overhead costs and profit. Authorities should derive a permanent formula so that the hike in fare is proportionate to the rise in the bus-owners expenditure due to increased fuel price.

 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 Ramp n rhythm SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY, HIMIKA CHAUDHURI AND SANGITA S. GUHA ROY  A model walks the ramp at the Saturday Club fashion show. Picture by Rashbehari Das															 Saturday night at the Saturday Club may have been a dance show punctuated by fashion sequences, or it could have been the other way round as well. Whatever the case, Summer 2004 packed in three hours of entertainment for club members. Sizzling performances by the members of Mayhem and a host of neat collections from city designers choreographed by Prithviraj Ghosh, kept the audience glued to the action.The show kicked off with Priya and Allens jhatkas with Jhumka Gira Re and Chhod Do Aanchal, which set the mood for the rest of the evening. Soon, a riot of colours was unleashed on the ramp with Ritu Sonthalias collection of salwar suits and saris. The lady behind Virgo presented her line called Rave in the first public showing by the boutique. Glitter, heavy embroidery and bright colours were the highlights of her collection, complemented with jewellery from Tanishq.																					As soon as the last model left the ramp, members of Mayhem made their entry, with the first of the dance interludes, showing off well-choreographed fusion movements, great music and amazing lighting.																					Next came Shruti and Kiran Dhanukas line of ethnic ensembles from their label Aksh. This comprised special-occasion garments in hues of red, lime green and turquoise. This was followed by Mansis range of salwars in hot pinks and oranges.																					Soon, Mayhem was back with Babuji Zara Dheere Chalo and Aisa Jadoo Dala Re. Mansis second sequence displayed ghagras in heavily embroidered, textured fabrics in bright blue, raging red and pretty pink. The ethnic look was offset by modern cholis, halters or knotted.																					Prabha Poddar of Anubhuti started off with a line of bridal, party and casual saris in pastels as well as bright shades and moved on to the first mens wear collection of the evening, marked by dhotis with embroidered dupattas. Mayhem packed in Its Your Birthday between two of the sequences.																					Lipika Kedia of Sukriti dazzled the ramp with a collection of party wear saris in whites, pastels as well as bold hues. Veena Agarwal of Aradhika showcased some striking cocktail saris in various shades of blue. The collections were separated by Mayhems sizzling Bachke Tu Rehna, Ishq Khudai and Dekh Le. Bandhni, a boutique, displayed bridal lehngas and saris mostly in reds and oranges. The Mayhem guys bid adieu with Yeh Hai Jalwa.																					Singer Moushumi took the stage with her troupe, keeping the tempo up with her renditions of numbers like Nikamma Kiya Is Dil Ne, Dola Re and Woh Ladki Hai Kahan The final fashion sequence of the night was the only western line of the show, comprising jeans and tops in pastel hues from Kalpanas Collection. The Caf Bollywood spread. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Casual couture																					Live-in, a garments brand, launched their spring-summer collection on Sunday evening at The Park. The company, better known for its denims, unveiled a whole range of casuals, formals, semi-formals, including a collection of khakis and cargoes.																					The clothes were paraded by a bunch of novices  with most known ramp names missing. But the garments themselves are worth more than a mention. Especially the innovatively named Per-formal line, (meant to help you perform better under stress), included a lovely range of shirts in pastel shades. Formal trousers for women as well as denims for men count among the top rankers in the collection. 																					For the hoards of distributors who consisted the bulk of the audience, a show with not much glamour was hardly their idea of Sunday fun. 																					But the organisers had pepped up their entertainment chart with some interactive games for the audience, and, finally, a performance by an Egyptian belly dancer. One of the games had men guzzling drinks from a feeding bottle. And it was hard to say if the dancer really was from the land of the Pharaohs (and it really didnt matter), Katiyana, as she was called, put up a more contemporary dance performance, nothing strictly to do with belly dancing. 																					An hour of stage shows, and some good food and drink later, it was time to call it a night. The Live-in fashion show. Picture by Pabitra Das												Snack stop																					Shoppers working up an appetite at 22 Camac Street had one less option with the closure of Caf Bollywood at Pantaloons a few months ago. But the eatery is up and running again in a new avatar. In this case, size does not matter. Significantly smaller though the place may be, now the menu has more on offer.																					The second floor outlet has shrunk from a 134-seater to 62, but there is enough cause for cheer. Non-vegetarian items have finally found their way into the selection. Prices have also been brought down and the snack-oriented offering has been expanded to include meals. The Steamed Chicken Momos, chaats, Mexican wraps and Cheese Masala Dosa are doing particularly well.																					The cheapest buy comes at Rs 10, for a tea or coffee, going up to Rs 85 for the non-vegetarian pizza. 																					The reopening coincides with the summer promotions on at the anchor store to capture the holiday mood. Customers are being bombarded with offers, explains a company spokesperson, to satisfy Calcuttas craving for freebies. Participants at the IIM quiz on Sunday. Picture by Pabitra Das 												Quiz craze																					From business blitz to bard basics, Sunday saw some spirited brainstorming in three quiz shows about town. Corporates and kids put on their thinking caps and avid quizzers had it easy with the three venues a stones throw away from each other, encouraging some quirky quiz hopping instead of the usual pub crawling on a Sunday evening. Heres a round-up:																					Trade trivia: The bulls and bears of the city and beyond put their heads together at BizQuiz 2004, presented by IIM (Calcutta) Alumni Association, in association with The Telegraph and Businessworld at Oberoi Grand. It enlisted over 40 entries amongst which 30 companies were selected for the preliminary round. Quizmaster Gautam Ghosh shot off a quick-fire elimination round of 40 questions interspersed with audio-visual clips.																					An enthused audience got involved too, with questions including a healthy dose of lifestyle and entertainment, not just cut and dried figures and facts. The Telegraph, JWT, TCS, Lafarge, Eveready, Sanmar Group from Chennai, HSBC and UshaComm were the lucky finalists with JWT and TCS coming a close first and second respectively.																					By Jeeves: Appropriately titled Punch, the humour quiz dedicated to P.G. Wodehouse packed a whole lot of fun at Oxford Bookstore, organised in association with Blithe Spirits, a P.G. Wodehouse society in the city (which also held a reading of the dramatised version of two Wodehouse novels on Friday). 																					The occasion roped in school and college students, quizzed on a variety of topics ranging from American underground comic strips to Sukumar Rays Abol Tabol, English literature to, of course, Wodehouse. Quiz masters Kingshuk Niyogi and Dipyaman Sanyal took the participants through a total of eight rounds of which three to four were dedicated exclusively to Wodehouse and his characters.																					Abhishek Mitra, Anirban Mitra and Sritanu Chakrabarti walked away with the first prize, given out by the chief guest of the evening, writer Sukhendu Ray.																					Poetic license: Tagore was the topic at the Landmark terrace, from his muses to his music and much more. The open quiz on Rabindranath Tagore saw six participating teams comprising professionals and avid fans of his work. Organised by Argus Quiz club in association with Landmark, the quiz included 10 rounds, five of which were audio-visual, conducted by quizmaster and secretary of the club, Ram Mihir Sen. 																					It spun an interesting connection round, where participants were shown a visual and had to connect it to a piece read out or a song. Sen showed a picture of Sister Nivedita, for example, and asked participants to establish the connection to a part he read out from Gora (Sister Nivedita had helped Tagore christen the novel). The quiz impressed Sujit Basu, chief guest and vice chancellor, Visva-Bharati, so much that he invited Sen to conduct a similar quiz in Santiniketan.																					Two executives from Standard Chartered of the team Sonar Tori walked away with the first prize, while Abol Tabol, a team of two teachers, came in second.

 															- RECYCLING DRIVE: MONEY FOR TRASH  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee flags off the plastic collection drive at Chetla on Sunday. Men in green T-shirts will pay a monthly visit to households in select south Calcutta localities and buy up plastic refuse for Rs 4 per kg. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Dont throw away plastic carry bags, bottles, footwear or even broken toys and furniture. Well buy them at Rs 4 a kg.																								That was the message from mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who went door-to-door in south Calcutta on Sunday, collecting or buying household plastic trash. 																								Pedalling a van  in which the collected items were being dumped  on Pyarimohan Roy Road, in Chetla, the mayor flagged off a pilot scheme to collect plastic trash for re-cycling. He paid Rs 4 to a beaming housewife Sangeeta Sen, who sold plastic milk packets, carry bags and broken toys.																								Mukherjee was accompanied by, among others, Debasish Chakraborty of the pollution control board (PCB). 																								After a four-week trial on six roads, this drive will be extended to other parts of Chetla, Gariahat and Ballygunge, said mayor Mukherjee.																								According to him, Calcutta households dump plastic and polythene garbage worth more than Rs 2 crore every month on roads and in drains, blocking the sewage system. 																								The dumped items are, to a great extent, responsible for waterlogging, he added. 																								The civic body has the Indian Plastic Federation as its partner in this drive. Under this recycling scheme, a man donning a green T-shirt with Earn from plastic waste printed on it will visit each family in a locality to buy the plastic trash.

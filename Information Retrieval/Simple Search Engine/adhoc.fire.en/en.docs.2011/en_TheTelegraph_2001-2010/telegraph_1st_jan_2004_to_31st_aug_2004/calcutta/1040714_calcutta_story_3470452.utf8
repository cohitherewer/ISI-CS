The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 Life - A Thought for FoodSizzling stunners set to horrify 
 Dig in at The Kenilworths sizzler and burger festival. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 Little Russell Street is sizzling these days, with The Kenilworth playing host to a nine-day sizzler festival that kicked off from July 9. In fact, the coffee-shop of the hotel which was always a place for great burgers and sizzlers is back with the grub that Calcutta has always loved.																								The fun is in not sticking to the pre-decided buffet at The Crystals, but experimenting with a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian sizzlers. Prawns, chicken, tuna and veggies are the base for the eight non-veg and five vegetarian sizzlers. 																								For those high on seafood, the Horrified Prawns (named so for their huge size) are a must try  and are sure not to horrify you. The smoky prawns with a light aroma of mustard coupled with crispy French fries makes for the perfect meal on a rainy day. Couple this with a drink of your choice, and you have a winner on your hands.																								There are more options for fish freaks. Try the Herby Fish Steak Sizzler (fish steak flavoured with herbs) or the Tuna Steak Sizzler. Lasooni Pomfret on Tawa is an Indianised steak for those who like the garlic-pomfret combination should go for. The meat options are beef and chicken. 																								An improvisation comes in the form of the Chinese Fantasy Sizzler where the guest get to try fried rice or noodles with chilli chicken. There are some interesting vegetarian options, with paneer and corn and Arabian Kebabs on Cinnamon Rice. All sizzlers in the non-vegetarian section are priced around Rs 230 with the prawns touching the Rs 450 mark. Vegetarian sizzlers are priced within Rs 200. The burgers, each a full meal on its own, have been priced between Rs 200 to Rs 230, while the vegetarian options are all available at Rs 190.Szechwan spell																								 While Chinese is still definitely the most preferred foreign cuisine for Calcuttans, few actually know of the vast gourmet treasure trove that each province of China has to offer. Cantonese, Szechwan, Hakka are just few of the varieties of Chinese cuisine. While most eateries in the city offer a mix of all these, Chinoiserie at The Taj Bengal is one restaurant that has specialised in Szechwan food over the years. 																								The Taj group has been promoting Szechwan food throughout India, with Golden Dragon at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower in Mumbai being amongst the best when it comes to this cuisine in the country. 																								The Chinoiserie is showcasing a section of the menu of Golden Dragon between July 9 and 18. Master chef Shi Xi Lin, who has been associated with the Golden Dragon for the past eight years, has flown down to rustle up the magic he dishes out at the Mumbai restaurant.																								The speciality of Szechwan cuisine is that the flavour lingers in the mouth for a long time after one has had a meal, says chef Lin, adding that there are certain closely guarded secrets of Szechwan cooking.																								The selection being offered at Chinoiserie includes starters like Butter Garlic Prawns, Sliced Oriental Chilli Fish with Wild Pepper, Shredded Chicken with Spicy Honey Sauce and La Jiang Eggplant. There are soups like Spicy Lemon Flavoured Seafood Soup and Jade Asparagus Soup. In the seafood section, there are delicacies like Scallops with Po Hai Yoh Chilli, Singapore Chilli Tiger Prawns, and Red Snapper in Dry Red Chilli Sauce to name a few.																								The poultry and meats section offers choices like Roast Beijing Duck, Sliced Chicken with Cucumber, Stir Fried Sliced Lamb with Vegetables in Five Spice Sauce, Tenderloin with Mushrooms in Spicy Oyster Sauce, and Sweet  Sour Pork. The vegetarian main course is equally varied. Spicy Braised Beancurd Triangles, Dry Cooked French Beans, Assorted Vegetables in Garlic Wine Sauce are a few of the listed items. 																								Interesting rice and noodle options are Pickled Vegetables with Lettuce Fried Rice, Burnt Garlic Egg Fried Rice and Tobai Flavoured Prawn Noodles. For desserts, the chef offers some sinful delights like Fruit Flambe and Honey and Kahlua Noodles.

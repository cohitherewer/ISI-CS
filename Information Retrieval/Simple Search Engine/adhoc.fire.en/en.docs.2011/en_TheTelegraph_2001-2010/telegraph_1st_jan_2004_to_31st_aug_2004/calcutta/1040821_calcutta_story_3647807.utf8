The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Ethnic jewels in star crowns 
(From top) Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron 																								If Hollywood is hotting up thanks to Indian film-makers, a little desi influence is bound to rub off on the filmi folk as well.																								Just take in an eye-full of Reese Witherspoon. The Legally Blonde southern belle is no longer blonde, and her ear gear looks more like it is from the south of India rather than sweet home Tennessee.																								To be fair, the brunette act is for another film, and is not a result of Mira Nairs Vanity effect. Becky Sharp is blonde, as the world will see post-September 1, when the blockbuster releases. And Becky never dreamed of looking as native as Reese now does.A glimpse through the Hollywood red carpet picture albums reveals more ethnic influence, at least when it comes to ear ornamentation. Nicole Kidman donned a positively Bengali pair of gold danglers in London last year for the European premiere of Cold Mountain, long after the Chhamma Chhamma hangover should have worn off (Moulin Rouge was at least a movie millennium and style century ago). But Nicole seems to have taken to all things Asian, appearing at the Tony Awards in June in a black Chinese silk dress as well.																								And then there is that truly stunning South African, Charlize Theron. The Oscar winner (for Monster) sported two pairs of gold earrings with strong Indian overtones at Cannes  one while presenting the Palme dOr to Michael Moore for Fahrenheit 9/11 and the other during a photo-call for The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.																								Maybe the sudden Indian touch can be traced back to the grandest necklace ever created by the most revered name in jewellery  the Maharajas Jewels and Cartier. The 2,930 diamond-studded necklace created by the jeweller for Maharaja Sir Bhupinder Singh of Patiala in 1928 was recently on display in New York, and blinded the rich and famous that lined up to see it.																								Or maybe, Hollywood is simply dreaming a Bombay kind of dream.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								An hour-and-a-half of arguments and counter-arguments before the special bench of Supreme Court left the battery of lawyers trying to save Dhananjoy Chatterjee from the gallows disappointed and emotionally drained.																								Na, aar kichhu kora gelo na. Sob rokom chesta kore dekhlam (No, nothing else can be done. Weve tried everything), said advocate Jaymalya Bagchi, who stayed up till late on Wednesday, making last-minute preparations for the final showdown.																								Bagchi had rushed to Delhi on Wednesday night after the Alipore Central jail authorities refused him permission to meet Dhananjoy.																								Sekhar Basu, who has taken Dhananjoys battle to court several times over the years, preferred not to talk. Thursday was his birthday, but Basu returned greetings without a smile in Calcutta High Court. 																								Aar na (enough), was all he would say, when asked to comment on the setback.																								Minutes after the special bench rejected the last-minute petition, the lawyers led by Colin Gonzalves left the Supreme Court, despair writ large on their faces. They had banded together after President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam stayed the earlier hanging order on June 24, providing a glimmer of hope to Dhananjoys family. 																								By noon on Thursday, the hope had given way to despair. 																								All our hard work has come to naught. Many things in this case were kept outside the ambit of justice. My conscience told me to rush and fight the case for Dhananjoy, who has suffered more than any other convict, said Subroto Mookherjee, a lawyer who had fought Dhananjoys case separately, but later joined Gonzalves and his band.																								Almost all the lawyers declared that their case could have been considered. It was clear that the special bench did not want to interfere with the Presidents decision. However, it has every right to re-examine even the Presidents verdict, one of them pointed out.																								Bicharpotira to onek kichhu shunte chailen na (the judges did not want to listen to many points), Bagchi murmured over phone from Delhi.																								I had a hunch about the special bench decision, but still, I feel very bad. It could have, perhaps, been a little considerate, was all Gonzalves said.																								Some lawyers were toying with the idea of filing a review petition on Friday, but there was no confirmation till late in the evening.

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Students lathicharged after tap-side tussle
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A scuffle broke out between a group of Jadavpur University (JU) students and the families of policemen on Tuesday when the students went to fetch water from a tap in the Jadavpur police station staff quarters.																								Like every other day, Shibaprasad Das, a Ph.D student of JUs physics department, went to fetch water from the tap at 7.30 am. He was accompanied by some friends, who also stay in the post-graduates hostel. 																								Some policemen and members of their families were also at the spot. Soon, an argument started between Das and Laltu Banerjee, whose father is with the state police. A scuffle ensued and Das was dealt a nasty blow on his left ear. 																								News of the fracas drew JU students in large numbers to the police station, demanding that officer-in-charge Swapan Bagchi arrest Laltu. The mob dispersed after a lathicharge.																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir said later in the day: Laltu has been arrested. He and his father have even apologised to Das. The situation is normal now. 																								Nabakumar Biswas, another student, said: For the past 15 years, theres no water in the hostel. We fetch water from the police station compound after a tap on the boulevard at the Bengal Lamp bus stop was sealed last year, following an accident involving a student. 																								JU registrar Rajat Bandopadhyay asked the 800 students to manage till alternative arrangements for water are made.

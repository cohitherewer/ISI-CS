The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Set shortage cuts short CalTel ring
 																											- Applications pile up for land-line connections A STAFF REPORTER																								Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limiteds much-hyped Connect India programme has hit a speedbreaker in the city. 																								Nearly 30,000 applicants for Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) B-phone (land line) connections cannot be obliged owing to shortage of sets and dropwire.																								There is a huge number of applications for new telephone lines in February and March this year. The number of applicants was three times the usual, said S.K. Bhaduri, general manager, sales and customer services, CalTel. This has caused an accumulation of applicants and we expect to clear it by mid-July, he said. 																								The beeline for new land-line connections was mainly owing to the hype created by CalTel through its attractive schemes (Sulabh and Balo Calcutta) and an intensive marketing drive. 																								Sources said no new push-buttons telephone sets and dropwires could be procured as there was no proper stock-taking on the old sets recovered from surrendered connections. There is lack of proper material planning, an official said. 																								Since last year, CalTel has been fast losing its subscriber base in B-phones owing to the penetration of the mobile network. It lost more than 80,000 subscribers during the period, triggering an alarm among the top brass. The setback forced authorities to take up extensive market-survey and initiate marketing drives. 																								Once the new applications flooded in, CalTel found itself in an unenviable position. The materials management department (of CalTel), was not properly communicated about the surge in the number of applicants for land line phones, a senior CalTel official said. 																								The shift of priority from basic telephony to mobile phone (CellOne) services was a major cause of shortage in the supply of instruments. 																								Installation and maintenance cost of basic telephony services is much higher than mobile phones, the official said. Also, the return on investment in mobile phone services is fast, he added.																								Officials admitted that there has been a shift of focus. Land-line connections are saturated. Our policy is to maintain the base and ensure that the number of subscribers does not fall. The stress is on increasing the customer base for mobile phones, said general manager Bhaduri.																								According to him, the installation cost of a base telephone has dropped from Rs 22,000 per connection to approximately Rs 14,000. Costs have reduced mainly due to cheaper switching equipment and less length of cables. The cost of installing a mobile phone connection is less than Rs 10,000, officials said.																								CalTels CellOne project was running on a fast track in the city. The mobile phone pilot project was launched in October 2001, and till April 2004, there were only 28,000 connections. 																								After the Excel (CellOne pre paid) service was launched on May 12, there were nearly 45,000 new connections for Cell One. The target of CalTel for the year 2004-2005 is nearly 300,000 subscribers for Cell One.

		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Vibrations give destiny a nudge
Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: Career-wise, its been quite a good year for me so far. Could you please suggest tips to prolong this trend? My date of birth is 27.12.1980, 2 pm. Since 2000, I have been going through a lot of ups and downs in my life. My love life has been pretty dry. I am yet to find a partner. How can I overcome these problems? What colours and numbers would be lucky for me?Lopamudra Chaudhury																								A: To keep your career strong, install a water feature in the north side of your living room along with a music system or a TV. The movement of water and the vibrations created by the music system and TV will help you progress. 																								According to your pillars of destiny calculated from your date of birth, there is a strong chance you will get married this year. Your chart shows you lack fire energy. So you need to balance soft colours of summer with something red. In the southwest side of your bedroom, keep a small bowl with nine semi-precious rubies and energise them by keeping them near a red lamp. Switch on the lamp in the evening for at least two to three hours.Q: I am a married man, born on April 2, 1970. I have an M.Com degree along with a C.A. (Inter) certificate. I am yet to find financial security. I own a plot of land at Rishra (1,080 sq ft), and am planning to build a house on an area of around 765 sq ft, with three bedrooms, drawing room, kitchen and bathroom. What is the best possible direction for these, as well as the main gate and overhead water tank?Rabindra Choudhary, Mitra LaneA: The entrance to your house can be from north or northeast. This can lead to the drawing and dining room, with the kitchen in the east. The three bedrooms should be in a row in the back with the master bedroom in the southwest and the childrens room in the south and southeast. Though bathrooms are negative wherever they are located, care should be taken that they do not fall in the northeast, southwest or southeast. The overhead tank should ideally be placed in the west.Q: Money has never stayed in our house. It is spent as soon as it enters. The entrance of our house is in the west. There is a verandah in the centre. Then comes our room, facing the north, where the almirah with our money is kept. To its left is our bed, in front of which is a TV. Please suggest ways to restrict the outflow of money.Kaustav DasA: The almirah where you keep your money may be facing the entrance, which is a sure sign of money flowing out. It shouldnt face any outlet, whether it is the bedroom or a bathroom door. Try relocating it in the southeast sector facing north. Southeast is the wealth area ruled by the wood element and north is the business area, which is supposed to ensure money flows in and grows in abundance.Q: I have passed the CA, CS and M.Com and am presently employed in a transport company earning Rs 2,00,000 a year. But I am not satisfied. Should I look for a new job? Also, when am I likely to get married? My date of birth is 12.05.78, 8.45 pm.Nishant AgarwalA: The time has come for a new job and new openings in life. This year shows a change in residence or city or a job. From 2006, you will enter a new period, which will bring a change in your lifestyle. This period will bring status to your career and indicates upward movement for the next 10 years. Marriage also seems to be round the corner.

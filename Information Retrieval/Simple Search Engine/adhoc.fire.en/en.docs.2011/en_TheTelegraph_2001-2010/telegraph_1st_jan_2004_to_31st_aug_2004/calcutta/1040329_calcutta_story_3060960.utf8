The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 29, 2004  Drape drill SOMA BANERJEE AND SANGITA S. GUHA ROY 
 Model Sanjukta sports a sari. Picture by Pabitra Das															Devdas created ripples with this (but not Chokher Bali). And Chhoti bahu Raveena could soon add fuel to Ashs fire.																					If the topic is trend-setting sari drapes, nothing could beat the Paro effect. The Devdas sari became a national craze, and suddenly, the good ol Bangali way of wearing six metres of cloth made it big, featuring on the ramp, in the home and for special occasions, too.																					But how does one get it on? Answering this question and other sari essentials is a new VCD, titled Sensual Sari Wearing. A dummys guide to 18 sari-draping styles  traditional to chic  the CD has been created by Calcutta-based production house Fourth Dimension.																					We are primarily targeting a foreign clientele. A lot of foreigners come to India each year and pick up saris but do not know how to drape them correctly, explains Subhash Tulsiyan, CEO, Fourth Dimension. This, as far as we know, is the first self-educative VCD on saris of its kind, he adds.																					At home, the main target is women between the ages of 18 and 35 years, who may not regularly wear a sari.																					Encouraged by the increasing number of orders placed on the Internet, Tulsiyan feels this venture may also boost sari sales across the world.																					A research and development team has studied the style and patterns of sari-wearing over time and matched them with modern trends, picking those most appropriate for the collection.																					The VCD covers everything from bridal styles to what could look good on the ramp. Models Sougata Mukhopadhyay and Sheena Chauhan appear with Kavita Tulsiyan doing the draping.																					Here a tuck, there a wrap, detailed visuals form the complete do-it-yourself tool, with background information provided on each. From the conventional reverse style (pallu in front) to the airhostess look, Gujarati, Rajasthani and Devdas styles (differentiated from the real Bengali way), as well as more contemporary trends like graceful, elegant and chic, little is left out. There are suggested wraps with dupatta and chunni variations. Preferred materials for each style and the correct way of tucking the sari, the number of pleats and suggested blouses are also included.Priced at Rs 199, the CD is available at leading retail stores. It will also be able online through www.myrightangle.com. Dhruv Mookerji and Roshni Bose in The Marriage Proposal at Trincas on Saturday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Lunch laugh																					Popping the question might have been easier a few decades ago, over a candlelit dinner at Trincas, aided by the soulful music of Usha Uthup or Gary Lawyer. The Marriage Proposal  a one-act play by Anton Chekhov, reproduced by Theatrecian  may have been lapped up by the crowd over a sumptuous luncheon at Trincas on Saturday, but the protagonist still had a tough time winning the hand of his neighbours daughter.																					The suitor, played by Deborshi Barat, is a hypochondriac trying to summon the courage to propose to his neighbours daughter, enacted by Roshni Bose. But instead, he and her father, actor-director Dhruv Mookerji, end up arguing about the ownership of a piece of land, whose dog is better and anything else they could think of. The end result  a laugh riot that kept the lunch crowd in splits. 																					Luncheon theatre has to be light and short, stresses Dhruv, a student of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. These kinds of one-act, over-the-top bedroom farces do not require intense audience concentration and can be enjoyed very well over a meal. Most importantly, your cellphones can keep ringing! smiles Dhruv.																					Trincas and the adjoining Ming Room proved a good setting for the informal gathering. Trincas provides for a natural ambience for a luncheon theatre, feels Shashi Puri of Trincas. The small dance floor that bands use to play their music in the evening doubles as a stage for such events, while the Ming Room area is transformed into a greenroom. The audience  seated at the heart of all the action  seemed to enjoy the afternoon fare, both on their plates and on the platform.																																													Bday banquet																					Flavours of India has just turned a year old. The anniversary celebrations have lured in foodies to the AJC Bose Road restaurant with a brand new festival menu.

Vegetarians havent been left out either, with Veg Hara Bhara Kebab, Paneer Shikampuri Kebab and Hara Masala Bhoona Paneer, each priced at Rs 70 per plate, as the main attractions. The anniversary offer also includes a 15 per cent discount on food and beverages.																					Offers are on at the banquets as well.

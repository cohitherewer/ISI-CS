Feng Shui
Pinky KapoorI am a mechanical engineer and an MBA. I was working with a liquor company where I used to draw a good salary. But after working there for over a year, I quit due to internal politics. For the past year, I dont have a job. I am married with a child. What I can do to get a job with higher salary?Pannalal Ghosh
Birati The Solution: Since you were successful in a liquor company, I can only assume that water element is productive for you. A temporary bad phase should not lower your spirits. Surround yourself with a blue colour scheme. Keep your important documents in a blue folder in the north side of your bedroom along with pictures of rockets, airships and aeroplanes taking off on a blue background. Such a display definitely helps when you are trapped in a situation that is holding you back.My 17-year-old son is appearing for the board exams next year and wants to know if his study table can also be enhanced using Feng Shui to help increase concentration.Amitabh Chowdhury
Calcutta  FLY HIGH: Are you stuck with 
a bad job or unable to get a job? Displaying pictures of aeroplanes, rockets or airships on the northern side of your bedroom might help you override the problem, advises Feng Shui The Solution: Divide his study table in nine parts and start by placing a tiny symbol of a tortoise in the north, as it is believed to enhance career opportunities. Study books should be kept in the north-east along with a religious idol. Put a family picture in the east for his mental support. South-east can have a computer, a calculator or a glass of drinking water. The study lamp along with any certificate of achievement displayed in the south will help him to gain recognition. A round stone paperweight or amethyst rock in the south-west will keep him stable and enable him to study for long hours at a stretch. The west is his creative corner and should have a metal glass filled with stationery. A crystal globe in the north-west travel area will help him get admission in college in cities or countries of his choice.We live in an old house with very high ceilings in all rooms. In our living room, the ceiling is very high on one side and slopes deeply. We are renovating our home and would like to change the look of the ceilings. How can we do this without making structural changes?Manish Agarwal
Calcutta The Solution: A false ceiling could solve your problem. Or, you could create a line between heaven and earth, as it is called. This horizontal line can be a running wooden or wallpaper border all around the room that is anywhere from six to 10 feet off the floor. The border can also run along the natural line just above doors and windows. Paintings or photographs beginning at the same height also effectively break the vertical height. You can balance the living room with a large mirror and plants. The heavy furniture can be placed against the wall on the higher side to help stabilise the chi.Our house is designed such that my room is at the end of a long corridor. Someone suggested I hang a big mirror outside my door. Since I have done this, everything has gone haywire. How can I rectify the problem?Sumitra Banerjee
ShillongThe Solution: Chi has a tendency to move quickly in long corridors. As a result, its strong current works negatively for its residents. The mirror is very harmful as it virtually doubles the length of the corridor and increases the speed of the flowing chi. Instead, place mirrors, paintings, plants, artefacts and lights on the walls. You can also hang a round faceted crystal on your bedroom door and a crystal chandelier in the centre of the corridor with a round carpet underneath. This will help catch and disperse the fast-flowing energy in all directions.I was born on January 5, 1979. What is my lucky number, colour, birth element, animal sign, kua number and direction? I am a graduate but have weak memory. How can I improve my memory? What are my career and marriage prospects like?PiyaThe Solution: Your lucky number is two, animal sign is horse and best directions in order of preference are northeast, west, north-west and south-west. You are a very strong water person. You should be balanced with wood, fire and earth elements and their relative colours like green, red, maroon, beige and cream. To increase concentration, enhance the north-east. Lighting a candle in front of an earthen idol twice a day could help. From the year 2003 you have entered a period which will change your life. This could reflect positively on your career and marriage.

 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Mirik
How to get thereTake the 9.40 am Saturday flight (45 min) to Bagdogra. Hire a car in Siliguri, half-an-hour away. Takes less than two hours to Mirik, if the weathers right. For the train option, take the Friday evening Darjeeling Mail that reaches Siliguri (NJP station) at around 8 am, Saturday. Take a breather before heading for Mirik.Where to stayOrange Country Retreat

Just play along and make your way to Mirik. 																								The almost two-hour journey (52 km from Siliguri) winds its way past picturesque tea gardens, an impeccably maintained army base at Khaprail and lush scenery that will take your mind off the stress that you shouldve left behind in Calcutta, but couldnt.																								The Siliguri weather lingers and changes only when the road starts winding and you start the climb. Its a lot like the road to Darjeeling, but slightly wider and the bends seem less sharp. Krishnagar, in the heart of Mirik is like any other small hill town, maybe only a little quieter (at 1767 metres).																								We put up at the Orange Country Retreat, the beautiful Swiss cottages that once belonged to the Gurkha Hill Council, now taken over by the management of Glenarys of Darjeeling. The cottages are on top of a hill, and overlook the Mirik lake.																								The lake and almost all of Mirik are visible from the cottage itself. You can also take a walk to the cottages own helicopter landing pad, about 10 to 15 minutes away, that serves as an observatory point. 																								The lake is the obvious must-go-to when you are in Mirik. You can take a trip around the 1.25 km waterbody in paddleboats, ride ponies in the adjoining open space, take a walk in the small forest that borders the lake, or simply get yourself photographed on the footbridge that connects the garden on the east to the woods on the west.																								Feeding fish, at a spot a little away from the lake, is also a popular tourist activity. Locals, mostly women, sell muri and bread from makeshift stalls, to ensure that the tourists hang around longer.SURVIVAL KIT Light woollens a must, no matter how the Siliguri weather is
 Camera, preferably video
 A pair of binoculars 
 Sturdy walking shoes																								There are shops near the lake and dotted around the town that sell wall hangings to fancy umbrellas, decorative pieces to other household items.																								Orange orchards, cardamom groves and tea estates, all within a few kilometres, can be visited, too.																								You can also take the DGHC Tourism-conducted day-long tour of Mirik (at Rs 130 per individual by bus or Rs 160 by Tata Sumo), or even take off for Darjeeling, which is only 49 km away. Trekking is another active option, with Sandakphu or Kurseong via Balasan river calling all climbers.																								But if stress-busting is what you are looking for, just lounge around in the cottage lawns sipping special Darjeeling tea.

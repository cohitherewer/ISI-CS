The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 23, 2004  Calcutta Column

	People crowd at the base of the Ultadanga flyover on VIP Road for boarding airport-bound buses. These buses often try to overtake each other and in the process, careen precariously close to those standing on the narrow pavement and on the road. Some passengers even try to board the running buses and, in the process, risk their lives. The authorised bus stop, however, is located further up the flyover. The traffic police at the busy Ultadanga crossing seem to be indifferent.

	I have been living in Sarangabad since 1978. But I am surprised that we still have no post office in the area. We are forced to travel either to Dak Ghar or to Budge Budge. The authorities should set up a post office in Sarangabad for the convenience of the large population in the pocket.
	 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge. 
	The road dividers on the stretch along the Race Course have become a bane for drivers and motorists at night. Accidents take place almost daily because of these dividers. As it is, the road is too narrow for two-way traffic. The dividers only add to the chaos. The solution could be a permanent railing between the two flanks. 
	Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street.

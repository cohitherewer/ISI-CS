 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 English schools face control code shift
 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Rules key to the running of English-medium schools in the city are set to change, with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government deciding to strengthen some norms involving the administrative functioning of such institutions.																								Through the proposed amendment  the first since 1993, when the existing Code of Regulations for Anglo-Indian and other Listed Schools came into effect  the government intends to modify clauses dealing with the composition of managing committees.																								One focus area is the inclusion of teachers representatives. The other is the granting of no-objection certificates to new English-medium schools.																								The government feels that there is an immediate need to modify some of the clauses and sub-clauses of the code. A special meeting of the State Board for Anglo-Indian Education will be held soon to finalise the areas that need to be amended for smooth functioning of English-medium institutions, explained Santosh Chakraborty, deputy director of Anglo-Indian Schools, and a member of the state board.																								Clause 15 of the code, dealing with management and administration of the 200-plus English-medium schools, including around 70 Anglo-Indian institutions, says: Provision shall be made for the inclusion in the managing committees of two confirmed teachers elected by the permanent teaching staff of the school																								Officials in the education department said complaints from teachers had been pouring in from some reputed English-medium schools, including the Church of North India (CNI) set, alleging that representatives from the faculty were not being included in the managing committees, in violation of the code.																								These allegations have prompted the government to consider restructuring of Clause 15, so that no school is able to exploit any of their teaching staff, said an official of the education department.																								Rev P.S.P. Raju, head of Calcutta Diocese under the CNI, however, said each of these schools had its own set of rules and the board of governors (as their managing committee is called) is constituted in conformity with those rules.																								The government is also hoping to drop the word recognition from the code. Sources said: This is allowing the authorities of many new schools to challenge the state government in court whenever it refuses a no-objection certificate.																								Ismail Nehal, president, Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools, said: There are schools mushrooming every year. Often, the committees are not formed in conformity with the rules set by the government.

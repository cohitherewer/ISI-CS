 Nikhil mixes it up at the turntable at Tantra. Picture by Rashbehari DasHes still considered the gangster in the prankster brigade. VJ Nikhil Chinappa may be an 11-year-old face on the tube, but even today teenage hearts flutter every time he flashes his dimpled smile or shoots a cheeky one-liner. 																								Yet, a mention of how young women freak on his bulging biceps and funky finger-rings is met with a composed, I dont think women freak on me, its only that they find me very approachable. 																								This time around though, he just concentrated on serious business and yet managed to floor the lot at the Tantra dance floor. VJ Nikhil donned the new avatar of a DJ and made a kill of it. 																								It all happened when we went to Rains, a nightclub in Mumbai and played some records that we wanted to hear. The club owners called me two weeks later to ask me if I would be interested in playing at the club once in a while, reveals Nikhil. Ever since, the smart talker morphed into music maker. 																								And its not just the DJ console hes restricting his activities to. Nikhils gone right ahead and signed up to make music for three Bollywood flicks. Musafir directed by Sanjay Gupta, Dino Morea and Bipasha Basu-starrer Chel and Desi Raaj are the projects hes working on at present. Though I am not trained in music, I have a discerning ear, is what this Bangalore boy thinks will lead to success in his musical career. 																								So what kind of music can people expect from him? My music is simple and linear, something soothing to the ear, is what he offers. Now its for the audience to decide whether they will put him on the hot seat or make a bakra of him.						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

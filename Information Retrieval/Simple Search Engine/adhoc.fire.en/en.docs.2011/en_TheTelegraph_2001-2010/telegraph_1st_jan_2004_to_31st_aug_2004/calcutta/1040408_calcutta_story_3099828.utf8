 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Disaster in a thunderclap
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Nothing like this had hit them ever, so none of them was prepared for the lash doled out in the dead of the night.																								Early Wednesdays Norwester, with all its bluster and thunder, changed the course of thousands of lives in the city and its neighbourhood in the space of just 40 minutes.																								The north and east seemed to have borne the brunt. Makeshift shelters were either destroyed or badly damaged in the slums of Belgachhia, Bagbazar, Cossipore in the north and Gobra, Tangra and Tiljala in the east.																								Reports of destruction and despair also came in from the Rajarhat new township on the eastern fringes, as well as from Tikiapara, Pilkhana and PM Basti, in Howrah, where at least 100 houses were wrecked.																								Meher-un-nisa slouched outside what had been her home for a decade near the Gobra burial ground. Head in hands, she was trying to figure out how she and her family, including three children, would spend the night or the next. Only the brick-and-mud walls of her home remained.																								We were sleeping when a clap of thunder woke us up. The lights outside had gone off and we could hear the breeze. Within minutes, the breeze grew to a gale. There was a sudden gust and the next thing we knew was we were under the open sky, with the rain pouring down. The gale had blown our roof off.																								Not very far away, Haridas and Rabidas Rajak of Christopher Road were also woken up from their slumber. Their house was shaking. At first, we thought it was an earthquake and rushed out. Then, a tree nearby came crashing down, uprooted by what they then realised was a fierce storm. We have lost our home and dont know how well rebuild it, they cried.																								Similar stories of despair were repeated to ministers Asim Dasgupta and Mohammad Salim when they visited the affected areas by hundreds left homeless.

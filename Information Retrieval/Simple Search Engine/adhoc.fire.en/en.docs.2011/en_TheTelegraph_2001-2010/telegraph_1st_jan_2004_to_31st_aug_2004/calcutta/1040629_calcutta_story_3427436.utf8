The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Shot, hacked to death in crowded bus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a Bollywood-style scenario, a 27-year-old man was first shot and then hacked to death in a crowded bus near the Calcutta Leather Complex, off the EM Bypass, on Sunday night by two members of a rival gang. No arrests have been made yet.																								The murder took place around 9.30 pm as the Bhangar-bound private bus from Sealdah neared Chandibari. The bus slowed at a stop, and two men brandishing a revolver and a chopper hopped on. Victim Rejaul Mollah was hunted out from among the 60-odd passengers returning home in the last bus of the day. 																								One of the youths asked Mollah his identity. Mollah denied he was the person they were looking for. But the killers were sure and one of them shot Mollah in the temple. The other hood then proceeded to hack him with the chopper, while the other passengers cowered in fear. 																								The assailants hopped off the bus as it slowed down at the next stop and disappeared into the darkness. The passengers and some bystanders then went to the leather complex police station. The body was taken to MR Bangur Hospital.																								The police were able to identity Mollah from some papers in his pocket. He was a resident of Khash Sardaha, in North 24-Parganas Sandeshkhali, and was wanted in at least two dozen murder and dacoity cases. 																								Additional superintendent of police Bhuban Chandra Mondal said: Mollah was a terror across North and South 24-Parganas. He had been arrested once earlier.																								A police officer said Mollah and four others had come to Mahestala to disrupt the municipal election there on Sunday. They were apparently backed by the CPM. The police managed to arrest the four associates while they were escaping after hurling bombs at policemen on duty at Dakshin Kankhuli, where one person had died in an encounter. Mollah had managed to escape.																								He then went to Sealdah, where he took the last bus to Sandeshkhali. But rival gang members knew he was on board. Mollah was a member of a gang led by Bare Miah. Of late, he was trying to start a gang of his own. Most probably, Miahs men bumped Mollah off. We are looking for Miah, the officer said.																								CPM district secretary Shantimoy Bhattacharya has, however, said that the party had no links with criminal Mollah or his associates.

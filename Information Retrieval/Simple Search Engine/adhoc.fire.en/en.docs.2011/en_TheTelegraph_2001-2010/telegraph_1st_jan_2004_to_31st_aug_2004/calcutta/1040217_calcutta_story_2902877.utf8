 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Bail denied in cheating case
 																											- Bank manager paid Rs 5 lakh for sons entry into medical college OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail prayer of the co-owner of an institution, who feared arrest in connection with a case of cheating for failing to get the son of a branch manager of a nationalised bank admitted to a medical college.																								Appearing for the state, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah opposed the bail prayer and told the court that the fake institution had made lakhs of rupees on false assurances of helping students get admitted to medical colleges across the country.																								Shyamalendu Sinha Roy, manager of a nationalised bank in Bhowanipore, had lodged a complaint with the local police station against Subhabrata Majumdar and another person, owners of Academic Heritage of Calcutta. He said they took Rs 5 lakh from him after promising that they would help him admit his son in a five-year medical course.																								Sinha Roy told police that he had noticed an advertisement in a daily newspaper by the institution, inviting people to their office if they wanted admissions in medical colleges.																								When I went to meet them, they asked me for Rs 5 lakh. Accordingly, I deposited the sum with them. After a few days, they told me my son had been selected at Nepals Birganj Medical College. They also told me the college authorities would send me a letter soon. But no such letter arrived, Sinha Roy told police.																								When Sinha Roy went back to meet Majumdar, he found the office closed. On the heels of Sinha Roys complaint, Majumdar filed an anticipatory bail petition in Calcutta High Court, and this plea came up for hearing on Monday.																								The public prosecutor told the court that a group of people was engaged in cheating citizens with false assurances. Every parent wants a good education for his child. These people take advantage of the situation and fleece the parents, Kazi added.																								Three months ago, a similar case was heard by Calcutta High Court, in which a businessman alleged that a fake institute had taken Rs 10 lakh from him to admit his son in an engineering college. He filed a complaint with the police when the admission did not come through. In that case, too, the court had rejected the anticipatory bail prayers of two persons who were the owners of the institution.																								Both the accused were arrested and lakhs recovered from their bank accounts.

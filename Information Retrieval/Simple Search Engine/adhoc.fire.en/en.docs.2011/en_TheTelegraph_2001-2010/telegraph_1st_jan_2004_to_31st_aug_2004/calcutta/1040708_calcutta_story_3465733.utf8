The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Tuned off glamour clamour
 RESHMI SENGUPTA Nandita Das at the Rotary Club of Calcutta centenary on Tuesday evening. Picture by Aranya Sen 																								A bunch of rats was trying to scale a wall, one by one. Whenever one would climb close to the top, the others would scoff at him and drag him down. 																								But one rat went on oblivious to the jibes and taunts and threats. Even after he had scaled the wall, he seemed deaf to the clamour all around. That, in fact was the secret of his success  he was deaf.																								The tale, narrated by Nandita Das at the centenary celebrations of Rotary Club of Calcutta on Tuesday evening, drew laughter and applause from the audience.																								But that deaf rat providing a curious twist in the tale probably comes closest to a role model that the actress-activist could have in this phase of her life. Nandita, after all, is trying her best to shut out the clamour of the glamour world and listen to the voice within, to dabble in different things and try to find her true calling.																								It has been eight long months since Nandita was on the floors  a Tamil film with Mamootty was her last  and she is comfortable with it. I love being at home, smiles the Delhi girl, during a daylong stopover in the city where father Jatin Das pankha exhibition is on.																								Commercial films are not what I look forward to. I was disillusioned with many of the films I did and what helped me keep my sanity was doing a lot of other work. I never took up acting as a full-time profession because it comes with a lot of baggage. I wanted a more private life, explains Nandita.																								Which explains her conscious decision to stay away from Bollywood and settle in the Capital, to associate with several NGOs, attend a steady stream of workshops for children and youth, direct commercials for rainwater harvesting and literacy, campaign against Narendra Modi and undertake a peace-mission trip to Pakistan.																								The Pakistan mission has yielded an Indo-Pak music video, the first of its kind, featuring Nandita and Salman Ahmed of the Pakistani band Junoon.																								Yet, an actress or a social activist is not what Nandita likes to be called. Maybe communicator is a better word for me, says she, choosing a combination of films, theatre, talks and workshops as the tools to spread awareness about the issues closest to her heart  women, children and the need to create a peaceful society.																								I am drawn by a host of issues I am more of a catalyst. This suits me fine, she adds.																								The brief brush with direction has reaffirmed in Nandita a deeper desire to get behind the camera. I would like to direct a series on gender And someday, I would like to direct a film.

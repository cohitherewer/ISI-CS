The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 22, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Andrew Llyod Weber.You are easygoing, and prefer to work at your own pace. Youre generous by nature, but dont trust others with your money. You are lucky in love and faithful and dedicated to your partner. A streak of loneliness runs in you. Lucky days: Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays.  Kusum Bhandari

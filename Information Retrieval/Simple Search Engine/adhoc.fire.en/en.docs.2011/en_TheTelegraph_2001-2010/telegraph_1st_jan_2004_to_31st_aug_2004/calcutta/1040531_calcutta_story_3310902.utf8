 															- Tie-up with varsity lends practical approach to fashion courses A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Former Tilottama Jyoti Brahmin, beauty queen Sayali Bhagat and designer Sharbari Datta at the NiFD-Annamalai University tie-up symposium. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Designer dreams will now be endorsed with a formal degree. NiFD (National Institute of Fashion Design) will be offering three-year B. Sc degree programmes in fashion design, textile design and interior design, plus one to two years diploma in the same streams, as part of a technical collaboration with Annamalai University.																								The formal announcement came at a symposium on Saturday, with stars from the fashion fraternity espousing the cause of budding designers from an immense creative pool in the country.																								In her zeal to hold forth on the emerging trends in the Indian design industry, reigning beauty queen Sayali Bhagat said: India has been contributing to global warming... er... civilisation for quite some time now, before going to pronounce the collaboration historic.																								Former Tilottama Jyoti Brahmin focused on how she had been visiting NiFD centres in the past (she aspired to be a fashion designer herself once upon a time) and had been very impressed with the good work the students were doing. These upcoming designers hold the reins of the future of Indian fashion, she stressed.																								Real-life projects, guest lectures, interaction with industry representatives, visits to relevant industries, fashion shows to cap the course and compulsory internship are some of the highlights of the practical approach NiFD emphasises to prepare students for the world of design and fashion.																								These aspects will continue to be handled by NiFD in the new set-up, with the role of Annamalai limited to supervising the course conduction, holding exams and awarding degrees and diplomas. Students will have to attend regular classes at local NiFD centres six days a week for two hours every day, even though the course has been designed in the distance-learning mode.																								The parameters will stay pretty much the same, said Jayanta Bagchi, regional manager, NiFD. The only reason we had to go in for this collaboration is that a lot of students who enrol for our courses go for a graduation programme simultaneously, which can be quite a strain, he added.																								The institute will continue to conduct the regular certificate courses for graduates and other professionals in its 65 centres spread across the country.																								A government of India-recognised autonomous body, the first NiFD centre was opened in Chandigarh in 1984, while it came to Calcutta in 1989. With a great demand for courses leading up to glamorous professions like fashion and interior design, the institute is addressing an obvious need gap.																								The industry has a lot of scope to absorb new talent, said designer Sharbari Datta. Designer Lalit Jalan felt that Calcutta really needs more of such courses, as it is a big labour source but there arent enough trained professionals to meet the demands of the industry.

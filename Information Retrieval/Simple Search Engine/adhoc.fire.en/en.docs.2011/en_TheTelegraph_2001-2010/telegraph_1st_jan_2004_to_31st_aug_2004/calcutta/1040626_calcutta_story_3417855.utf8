The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 Bearing a torch for none
Victor Banerjee on why he rushed to grab the Olympic flame and how he could hardly get close, in the mad march of and for celebrities (Top) Cricketer Virender Sehwag with the torch. (Above) Delhi chief minister Shiela Dixit hands over the flame to Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi, to mark the start of the relay in India. (Below) Aishwarya on the run (PTI)As soon as I heard actors were being asked to carry the Olympic torch, I dashed off to Delhi and checked into the Marriott WelcomHotel where the flame was being housed during its historic stopover in India. It was a cinch.First, I was an international star that even Mugabes white farmers would recognise as the one who sat on the elephant with Judy Davis and Dame Peggy Ashcroft on our way to Forsters caves.Last, Suresh Kalmadi was from Pune. All my Maharashtrian relatives there voted for him and he would never learn that my Punjabi relatives voted for that red-necked Arun Bhatia whose values simply did not gel with contemporary Indian ethos.Kalmadis phone was busy. Naturally. Nevertheless, I left about 14 messages at different places giving him my minute-to-minute whereabouts, while I bought an Adidas track suit (after all I love football), a pair of Nike Joggers (though they didnt match the pink track suit) and a Reebok headband.Sponsors who would watch me on television, I felt, need to be reminded who the real role models were and, with a bit of luck, they would realise that the grey-in-the-temples brigade was an important market segment. I am told all the sportswear companies were looking for me after Joggers Park but an envious Subhash Ghai, who never made it in the movies as an actor, told them that I was wearing a wig for the part.I was up at the crack of dawn and had appropriated a route map of the torch from the lobby manager of the custodian Marriott Hotel. My cell phone (in a snazzy red pouch to go with my pink suit) bounced at my crotch, and hurt, while I fought through the milling crowds and kept speed-dialling Kalmadis hotline. By 10 oclock, our population of crazy hero worshipers had all descended around me and my hardly noticeable bald patch, instead of reflecting the sun, was broiling in it. I hadnt bought a T-shirt so I was forced to keep my track top on and could feel the rivulets of sweat running down my torso.I was surrounded by a culture-less Delhi crowd who had no idea who I was. I tried fighting my way to the edge of the road down which the Olympic torch would travel, only to be thumped on the head by an idiot who asked me to stand back. This, after I had politely let him and his sweaty wife and four precocious brats step out in front of me. The fools kept screaming and chanting: Aishwarya, Aamir, and Rani ki jai which was, of course, the limit of their knowledge of the arts. Tagore, Ray, Teresa ki jai I shouted back at the numbskulls (remembering one of the million billboards that hid Calcutta from prying strangers), only to be kicked in the shin by the idiots wife whose cheap georgettey dupatta had got caught in my precariously positioned mobile. I had enough.I went back to the hotel, where I forced them to recognise who I was  even told them I knew Yogi, their chairman, just in case they felt they could greet me uncouthly seated in an air-conditioned lobby while everyone from Paharganj was guzzling alcohol in the middle of the day and waiting for their favourite piece of cellular-loid flesh to prance in with the flame up his or her pants.I stood in my cold shower for half an hour cursing the fact that politicians, whether in the BJP or the Congress, were all out of touch with the general public. Not one of my calls or messages had received a response. I began to realise why successful middle-aged actors preferred hobnobbing with the likes of Mulayam Singh Yadav.I sat back with a large watermelon juice and stared at the television coverage of Kalmadi: an obese, out-of-condition and ridiculous bundle clomping along with what looked like a butane flame coming out of a rotten banana leaf cone painted in aluminium. Then came the batting of eyelashes over contacts whose unchoreographed run spoke volumes for what Farah Khan can make knock-kneed and pigeon-toed heroines achieve, to deceive.That is when the first murmurings of discontent began airing. Yeah. Not just me, where indeed was PT? What the hell did film stars and their close cousins, those super-hyped and over-paid sycophants of a colonial pastime like cricket (while natives were taught to acknowledge caste, religion and language as differences they hadnt properly recognised), have to do with an Olympics that doesnt even acknowledge their existence?Where are our greatest Olympians? The hockey players who made us famous all over the world? The greatest footballers who defeated Peles team in Calcutta? Our self-made badminton players, archers, etc. etc. etc? The nation was up in arms. Every news channel was sizzling with rage at the way the event had been made into a showbiz extravaganza, complete with an awkwardly-staged song and dance number by an unknown who gets paid millions.Late in the night, after all the hullabaloo had died down, I crept into the basement of the Marriott WelcomHotel where the flame was being guarded by guys ready to shoot anyone carrying a water pistol. The thing looked like an MNC version of a hurricane lantern and didnt have enough zing to boil a potato, aloo seddho.As I went to sleep, content that I could criticise instead of celebrate, I realised how this bitchy state of mind had always been my favouite.Did you read somewhere about a mentally challenged young orphan, called Arja, who had won golds and silvers in the Special Olympics, grinning and carrying the torch that meant little to him but everything to millions around the world? But who gives a toss about him? Who cares anyway. Aishwarya remains my secret flame that no dishonour can douse.

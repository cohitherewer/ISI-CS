From the simple sauna to advanced hydrotherapies, water is the thing of the moment, finds Himika ChaudhuriDrinking water is no longer the secret to glowing skin. Getting sprayed, immersed and massaged with it might be a better bet. Water-aided treatments are the thing of the moment and very much in keeping with the mood of the monsoons. The citys top spas are using the colourless fluid to keep patrons in the pink of health.Options range from computer-programmed hydrotherapy or a Vichy Shower, or the more basic half-hour session in the Jacuzzi followed by a steam bath and a dip into the cool pool.Indeed, the everyday liquid can be used at various temperatures and at different pressures to give the body the rejuvenation it needs after a rough week at work.A number of techniques are available under the general purview of hydrotherapy, including baths, showers, steam inhalations, hot and cold compresses, body wraps and wet-sheet pack.Hydrotherapy At: Vedic Village
Cost: Rs 2,000Different disease processes react differently to temperatures and pressures, explains C.M. Pradyumna of Vedic Village. Depending on the ailment, the water can be warm, lukewarm, hot or cold, and pressure controlled. It is the pressure that gives relief from pain, while the water opens pores.This leads to sweating that eliminates metabolic toxins. With people staying in temperature-controlled conditions, they sweat less nowadays, adds Pradyumna. Hence, the toxins remain trapped in the body, causing damage.The solution could be hydrotherapy, with uniform distribution of water all over the body or in the specific area of pain. Peripheral circulation of blood improves as warm water expands and relaxes muscles.This could include petal or flower baths and aromatherapy with oils in water, or Dead Sea salts. Herbal decoctions including ingredients like ricinus, calatropis and nirgundi roots are also available. Treatment or leisure, hydrotherapy can be good for everyone. It should be preceded by a regular massage for best results.Tub treatment At: Sonar Spa, ITC Sonar Bangla

From the moment you immerse yourself, the water jets begin to work their magic to provide maximum relaxation of muscles and relieve pain. Other benefits include a boost in blood circulation and stimulation of the digestive system.The jets of water and air are ejected at a pressure mixed with minerals to curative effect. There is a hose for deep tissue manipulation and to force toxins out of your body, says Gurpreet Kaur of Sonar Spa.Vichy Shower At: Club Prana, The Hyatt Regency

Vichy is a Japanese concept that involves salt scrubs and mud wraps followed by jets of water sprayed across the length of the body, to help restore energy levels.The first step is to scrub the body with aromatic salts to remove dead tissue. This is followed by a wrap of sandalwood, spice or rose, depending on the skin type. Finally, jets of water at various pressures and temperatures leave the skin relaxed, glowing and pampered. The whole affair takes one-and-a-half hours, with the soft daylight and natural air kissing your face. The greens around the Vichy Shower room are sure to give you the feeling of being away from the din of city life.Jacuzzi amp; sauna At: Club Prana, Sonar Spa and Solace, Sunny Park (only for members)This is the ultimate relaxant. This could be the ideal venue for a little kitty party gossip session, lounging about in the warm water of the Jacuzzi. That can be followed by a steam or sauna for as long or as short a time as you want, before heading straight for the pool, where the chilling water is sure to be the final rejuvenating touch.Aqua exercise At: Solace

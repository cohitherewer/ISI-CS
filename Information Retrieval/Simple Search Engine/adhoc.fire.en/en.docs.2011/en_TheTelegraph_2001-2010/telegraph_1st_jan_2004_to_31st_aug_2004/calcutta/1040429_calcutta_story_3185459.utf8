 Whither headed?: A patient at a government hospital Death wish over exam pressure headlines a horrendous report on April 6 of some of the worst sufferings our students are facing. The statistics are shocking, indeed, and the intentions of the people in authority to somehow do better are to be commended. But it is hard not to be sceptical, not to say cynical.  Readers will perhaps recall three suicides in March 1998 of girls yet to reach their teens. One was Sahana Pal, whose suicide note regretting her weakness in English concluded with the heart-wrenching PS: Sorry for my bad spelling. Hers became a sort of cause celebre at the time, and the government, especially the SCERT, was galvanised into action. An NGO I work for was invited to help out, and we did. And then it was all forgotten.  Nothing worth mentioning has happened to the education system since then, except an increase in the stridency of principals and other high-up folk blaming it on parental pressure. There, that lets the system designers off the hook. But not the children: in the years since Sahanas death, the increase in student suicides nation-wide has increased by more than 100 per cent, according to the current Crime Records Bureau. And the worst city figures are, as then, in Calcutta. Aye, and even if the accusation be right, what have they done to help parents respond to this situation? Only blame? Brendan MacCarthaigh, 
Address not given  Between an inept health department and the impervious medicos, the hapless patients have no choice but to keep faith in fate like the unfortunate parents of the little Sushmita Gharami (Computer spree at hospital, life-saver defunct, March 30). It is also common knowledge that the health officials often waste public funds in an unscrupulous manner. There are hardly any checks and balances for doctors and non-doctors alike. Dr Kunal Saha,
Ohio, USA. The treatment meted out to seven-year-old Sushmita Gharami is a a crime against humanity. It is mindless to spend on installation of computers instead of taking steps to save lives. Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
Beleghata The chief minister needs to immediately set the priorities in the healthcare system right. T.R. Anand,
Budge Budge. The report Husband hired hitmen (March 26) was shocking. Women are not safe even in their own homes. Anil Kumar Sen, 
Ramchandra Chatterjee Lane Apropos the report Cal Tel dials rings of change(March 30), the decision was the urgent need of the hour since Calcutta Telephones is facing stiff competition from private players. The workforce should be streamlined and professionalism injected in the staff to face the challenge and survive in the fray. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town The report Cop hunt for daughter to crack death case on March 9 quoted me, a neighbour, as saying that Sarmistha was mentally tortured by her husband... The statement was not mine. The words were uttered by the relatives who carried the body of the deceased on March 7. Sukhendu Bhattacharya,
Address not given Metro replies: We stand by our report. There are several inaccuracies in the report Beer price constant in tariff card eyewash (March 12).  Our association is called Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India and not Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of India. Rajesh Mishra is the secretary, and not the joint secretary. He was not even contacted. The reported reason for withdrawing our case was not that the stay order was not obtainable, but that the stay order from Delhi High Court in the meanwhile had come in force in protection and in favour of all the members of the Federation of Hotel amp; Restaurant Associations of India regardless of their location and there was no need to proceed with our suit in Calcutta. Alok Chowdhury,
secretary-general, HRAEI Metro replies: We regret the error in getting the name of the association as well as Rajesh Mishras designation wrong. But it is untrue to say that Mishra was not contacted. The quote attributed to Mishra is what he had actually told us.

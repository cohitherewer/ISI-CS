The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 23, 2004  Wheels with style SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND PRIYANKA CHATTERJEE Indrani Haldar at the car accessory shop. Picture by Aranya Sen															Whats Indrani Haldar got to do with cars? Exclusivity overdrive, for one. Dropping by to inaugurate a car accessory showroom on Sarat Bose Road, the actor was all praise for the outlet  and herself! People call me exclusive. My acting, sense of dressing, everything is unique. So, wherever you get exclusive things, youll find me there, she smiled.																					We could let that pass but a closer look at Auto Station sure proved Indranis point about the outlet, at least. Helping you cover up that scratch in style, Auto Station is positioning itself as a one-stop shop for car seat, steering and dashboard covers, including floor mats. We have another shop called Auto Motion across the street that stocks all kinds of car accessories. We found there was a huge demand for various car covers, which was somehow getting lost in the clutter, says proprietor Ashish Bhattacharya.The new outlet stocks a variety of loose as well as fixed covers in cotton towels, knitted fabrics, flat jacquard, leather, velours cotton and polypropylene fabrics. Each product comes in four to five colours. The pricing, too, is flexible, ranging from Rs 1,800 to 20,000.																					Franchisee of the Delhi based Elegant autoFORM, one of the leading car cover manufacturers in India, Auto Station boasts high-profile clients like Hyundai Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra.																																														Fast favourite																					Wednesday evening was all about blazing tracks  from the former queen of athletics to the current rage of filmi music.																					Off the starting blocks first  but, of course  was golden girl P.T. Usha, the 12th recipient of the prestigious PC Chandra Purashkar 2004 at the Science City auditorium.																					Accepting the award, carrying an honorarium of Rs 1 lakh, Usha shared her trials and tribulations, successes and setbacks before describing the PC Chandra Group as a company whose products have stood the test of time by meeting customer needs successfully and promptly. The presence of her husband and son made the moment more special.																					After an extended refreshment break, the evening was taken over by emcee Sakil Ansari and his one-liners during song breaks. The sizeable audience, comprising primarily of the extended PC Chandra family and friends, first swayed to the beat of Jojo as she belted out popular Bollywood numbers, as current as Tere Naam. Then, Abhijeet Dutta came up with Kishore Kumar favourites like Ek ajnabi hasina se.																					But what really brought the auditorium to its feet was Poornima. The Bollywood playbacks pop picks ranged from the raunchy Chane ke khet mein to the mast Jhoomka gira re to the melodious Kya hua tera waada. She kept chatting with the audience and managed to strike the right chord.																					The throbbing pace set by Poornima was picked up by Vinod Rathod as he emerged from the aisles with current rage Munnabhai MBBS. If Rathods renditions of age-old favourite Yeh shaam mastani to the more recent Baazigar Baazigar were not enough, he threw in Chiro din-i tumi je aamar from good ol Tollywood.  Piu Sarkar at Tanis on Thursday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 												Cosy start																					Fashion designers are mushrooming by the minute and sometimes they have little option but to set up small. While some would think this was a disadvantage, it could be taken as a statement in cosiness as well.																					At the inauguration of Tanis, a boutique on Allenby Road on Thursday, model-turned-actor-turned-painter Piu Sarkar was charmed to bits. The boutique, a little hard to find, specialises in ethnics. The one-room boutique resembles an oversized dressing room, with only a quaint cane trial room brightening things up. 																					The designer Nikesh Solani calls his collection summery. The bright saris and sherwanis, though, go a little overboard with the embellishments.																					Fresh out of Bhawanipur Education Society, Nikeshs forte is Indian wear with a little Indo-western thrown in. Crepe and georgette are his fabrics of choice but he also experiments with tussars, jamewars and a variety of silks. Colours are essentially bright  fuchsia, orange, peacock blue, yellow, grey and black being his favourite colours. Subtlety is not Nikeshs strong point and there is a generous sprinkling of chunky motifs in sequins, embroidery, pipe work, resham and zari.

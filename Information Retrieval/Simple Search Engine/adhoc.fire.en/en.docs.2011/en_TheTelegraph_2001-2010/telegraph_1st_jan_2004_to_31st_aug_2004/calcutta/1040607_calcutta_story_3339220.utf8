The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 07, 2004 Have a ball amp; a blast

Picture by Rashbehari DasOver three weeks of hectic activity on the CC amp;FC grounds ended with a bang on Saturday night. The seventh edition of The Telegraph Merchants Cup Football Tournament, organised by the club at the popular south Calcutta address, concluded with a final night of fun for the teams and guests.A crowd of around 3,000 flocked to the arena that saw the team from Transways walk away with the Main Plate earlier on in the day. By night, the venue was ready to host a different kind of ball game.The pitch which had been the scene of bitter corporate rivalry between companies and organisations ranging from Selvel to the British Deputy High Commission, The Park to Berger Paints, was now the scene of revelry instead, dotted with party people lounging around in chairs.A snack stall kept hungry tummies (before the dinner was rolled out) happy and the bar kept thirsty party-goers quenched.An air-conditioned dance floor was constructed at one end of the ground, giving enthusiastic dancers some respite from the sultry summer night.Emcee Jimmy Tangree was in charge of the show, leading the action on stage, with DJ Meghna and crooner Avril Quadros spinning out some great foot-tapping tunes in Hindi and English, filmi and pop, rock and disco. Usha Uthup and Debasree Roy were spotted in the crowd.Prizes were given away to those who kept the floor moving, non-stop. Apart from cheering on the best couple, two girls who had been shaking a leg with a vengeance all night, one of the players who danced despite an injured leg and an elderly pair with unflagging enthusiasm were also applauded.

Picture by Rashbehari DasHeady mix Wanted: more leg space on the dance floor or, better still, more dance floors.Though Calcutta needs nothing more than an excuse to party  with or without add-ons like outstation DJs and a celebrity guest list  the night stops continue to pull out all stops, dishing out some new stuff for partygoers every weekend.Mumbai-based DJ Aqeel was the promised flavour of this Saturday night at Tantra. And by the time he took over the turntable from resident DJ Lloyd well past midnight, the disc was jam-packed, as was the stretch of Park Street leading up to Park Hotel. The prohibitive entry tag of Rs 750 did little to dampen spirits.Teenyboppers, professionals and even a few mommy-daddies made a beeline for Tantra even as bouncers struggled to keep stags at bay.The mayhem gave way to some interesting music inside with Lloyd mixing up the scratch pads. He stuck to hip-hop and R amp;B largely, leaving the remix rage to Aqeel. Early birds were treated to stuff like Yeah by Usher, Superstar by Jamelia, Turn Me On by Kevin Little, So Confused by Raghav and one of Lloyds own compilations, Logical Manoeuvres. The European bartenders, twisting and twirling their stuff while shaking up their new cocktails, stirred up as much action at the bar as on the dance floor. Their concoctions finally went to their head with the trio getting up for a merry jig on the bar-top.By the time Aqeel sauntered in, even the usually staid Bodhi Bar was choc-a-bloc with the crowd spilling over on to the staircase. Sure of a full house, he got down to turning up the heat to fever pitch with tried and tested remixes like Neele Neele Ambar Pe and Bin Tere Sanam.The DJ then dared to veer off the beaten track, mixing Hindi and Punjabi numbers with some underground progressive house and tribal beats. The cheers just got louder as the Aqeel fan brigade went into a tizzy over lethal mixes like a combination of Disco Diwane with In the Club by 50 Cent, a house mix of Nal Nachda by Rishi Rich, an underground mix of Yeah by Usher, an Indian mix of a Jennifer Lopez track called Indian Jenny, a remixed version of Enriques Not In Love and more.Seen partying till well into Sunday was actor Ayub Khan in town for the shoot of Shri Bimal Mitras Sahib Biwi Gulam. I was here yesterday and really liked the ambience, so have come back today for some more action, screamed Ayub over the thumping grooves.

Picture by Rashbehari DasTequila sunsetThere was more action in store at Cloud 9, the excuse here being the opening of a Mexican bar and a bevy of celebrities, led by cricket legend Kapil Dev, actor-anchor Mandira Bedi and gagman Cyrus Broacha.There wasnt an inch of leg space in the tiny restobar by the time we caught up with the party animals well past 1 am.Dont come here if you want freedom of movement, advised a disc-hopper to another, on her cellphone. Another half-an-hour and the entry gates were slammed shut as the place couldnt possibly pack in any more.Those who did manage to breathe inside the suffocating environs of the Astor den were treated to some spirited shots at the brand new Mexican bar, on only for weekends.Pure tequila shots and those flavoured with strawberry, orange and lime, colourful vodka-based test tube shots and, dont choke, rosogolla shots are the highlights at the new bar jazzed up with all the correct paraphernalia of cowboy hats, pistols and most wanted posters.Appropriately named the Shooters Bar, it drew in an adventurous lot eager to try the traditional way of having tequilas. Here you are supposed to down it in one shot and while you are sucking at the lime, you are to don a helmet, only for it to be hammered on by the bartender so as to shake you up a little more!Ones who wanted to play safe went for the sugary-sweet rosogolla shots  a potent mix of rosogolla syrup and vodka with two mammoth rosogollas!Those who found it less appetising but still wanted to keep up with the theme nevertheless had the option of choosing from a variety of nachos, Mexican tarts and burgers.Being a sport, however, came naturally to the clutch of celebrities seen enjoying themselves to the hilt.Its a very happy place, drawled Kaps, giving his fans a wide grin. Backing him up was Mr Golf Brandon D Souza who professed to be loving the party, while in the same breath shooting one tequila after the other. There is no tomorrow morning, laughed the sport. Guess whats the greatest passion in India right now? Its not Bollywood, nor sex, its golf! he chipped in.Cyrus was, well, Cyrus. A sound byte: We are from the left (read: Mumbai) and you are on the left (read: the government), so theres no reason why we shouldnt party together.Teetotaller Mandira, in a black halter, was having her own demure dose of fun. If I die, youll have to take me to hospital, was her crack at one of Cyrus you-must-drink-this games. We were at Dublin when we heard Cloud 9 was rocking and so we are here, she shouted, digging into a platter of vegetable kebabs, before rushing back to catch the Bypass buzz.The night was young.

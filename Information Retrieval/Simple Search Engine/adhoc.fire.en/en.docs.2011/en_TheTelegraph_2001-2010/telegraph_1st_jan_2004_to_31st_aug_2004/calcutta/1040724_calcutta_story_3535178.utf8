 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Sleuth flurry lifts veil on murky tale
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For three weeks  from July 3, when doctor Susil Pals body was fished out of a canal in Sankrail, till July 20  the cops seemed clueless. But now, suddenly, they seem to know all.																								The turning point: Pals widow Kanika meeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.																								The proof of the probe into the doctor murder shifting gears dramatically: three arrests and three detentions in 48 hours.																								After interrogating Santosh Agarwal, owner of a chemists store in Serampore, controversial Howrah businessman Rakhal Das and associate Badshah Sarkar, officials of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) said on Friday that the veil on the Pal murder was lifting.																								Das and Sarkar have officially been arrested by Howrah police for their links with another murder case, but CID sleuths interrogated them at their Bhabani Bhavan headquarters throughout Friday in connection with the doctors death.The sequence of events that the police believe unfolded on July 2 and 3 is as follows. Gynaecologist Susil Pals widow Kanika and their daughters at their Bright Street home on Friday. Kanikas meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has set off a chain of events propelling the probe into the doctors death. Picture by Amit Datta  On the morning of July 2, Pal left his Bright Street home, telling his wife that he was headed for Walsh Hospital in Serampore. But on that day, he did not have any duty in the hospital, to which he had been attached for three months. Instead, he proceeded to Bandel, possibly to perform a few abortions at a nursing home on Grand Trunk Road. The visit to Bandel was also not scheduled; he was to have been examining patients at Agarwals shop (Shankar Medical) in Serampore. 																								His absence that morning led Agarwal to call up Pal on his cell phone, as patients had queued up for him. Pal insisted that he could not make it that day. According to his cell phone call statement, at around 11.30 am, Pal left Bandel for Bally, in Howrah. No one seems to know why. Police suspect Pal was planning to open a clinic in Bally. He was there till at least 4.30 pm. After that, his cell phone was switched off. Police believe his killers took him hostage around this time and kept him somewhere in Bally till late at night. Then, under cover of darkness, they took the 20-km river route to transport him to Sankrail. Pals bag was found on Bally ghat. *Some local boatmen confirmed that a group of people had hired a mechanised boat to travel to Sankrail that night. But the boatman who ferried them across has not been traced. Then, early on July 3, Pal was killed and his body dumped in the canal. Why, is not known yet.

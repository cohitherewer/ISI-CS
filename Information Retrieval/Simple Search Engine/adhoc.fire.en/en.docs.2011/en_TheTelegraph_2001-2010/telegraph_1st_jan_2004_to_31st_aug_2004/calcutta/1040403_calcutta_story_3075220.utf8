The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 A step for shoppers, a leap for retail
 															- All-in-one Giant chain to debut on Bypass plot in Jan. 2005, twin in 2006 SUBHRO SAHA FIRST STOP: On EM Bypass, 40,000 sq ft, due in Jan. 2005

GROWTH PLAN: RPG Enterprises targets at least three
SHOPFLOOR: Each store to have over 25,000 stock-keeping units, 1,000 employeesOne step forward for the Calcutta consumer could prove a Giant leap ahead for the retail revolution in town. Sohan papdi from Patna, bhakkarbari (a variety of salted Swiss roll) from Surat or gajak from Rajasthan; clothes to white goods and music; vegetables, fish and meat to detergents; towels and upholstery to footwear																								Giant, the RPG hypermarket chain, has set its sights on a January 2005 debut on home turf. After Hyderabad and Mumbai, the citys first Giant all-in-one shoppers stop will be the 40,000-sq-ft-plus anchor store in the 500,000-sq-ft mall Mani Square, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, next to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.																								The second outlet of the chain is to open by 2006-end at South City, the mega housing complex coming up on Prince Anwar Shah Road. The 60,000 to 75,000 sq ft outlet will be a co-anchor in the residential towers 550,000-sq-ft mall, The Junction.																								Eventually, we are looking at a minimum of three, maybe even four or five Giants in Calcutta, says Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman, RPG Enterprises. Giant will bring a unique shopping experience, an international ambience, very local prices and convenience of a kind Calcuttans havent yet seen, he declares.																								Modelled on Wal-Mart, the worlds leading retail chain, the RPG stable hypermarket promises to stock everything a household needs, with the operative slogan being Bada choice, Chhota price. The Giant management feels the sheer range of products available under one roof from all over the country, with its pricing edge, will set it apart from the competition.																								With the likes of Big Bazaar, C3, Nice n Fresh and Wot Not wooing Calcuttans with their mixed-bag fare, the city has already got a taste of supermarket shopping. 																								Its just the tip of the iceberg, and what we are seeing is only the beginning of a mindset change. Theres space for all to grow together, and the more the number of players, the better it gets for the consumer, observes Goenka.																								In keeping with its standardised model, all the outlets of Giant will be housed on the ground level and have a ceiling clearance of 18 ft. Each outlet will typically employ around 1,000 personnel, directly or indirectly. The Rs 20-crore Bypass outlet, on the Bengal Chemicals plot, is expected to launch with 25,000 stock-keeping units and 32 cash tills.																								Going by the response in Mumbai, the management is eyeing a 25,000 weekend footfall. We will control the entire supply chain and hope to source a lot of stuff locally, says Goenka. Nationally, the hypermarket chain is looking at a Rs 700-crore turnover in three years.

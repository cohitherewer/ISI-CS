 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Teachers words to ward off branding blues
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Students of IIM at their graduation ceremony: Ready for the real world																								Recognising the need to give the professionals and the students in the city more opportunities to interact with experts in various disciplines of management, the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) Alumni Association is launching its Guruspeak Series with a two-day brand workshop on April 6 and 7. 																								To be conducted by Jagdish N Sheth, the Charles H Kellstadt professor of marketing at the Goizueta Business School of Emory University, the workshop will focus on relevant marketing topics like branding challenges, building winning brands, how to grow mature brands and the 4 As of branding. 																								Speakers of international repute do visit India, but in most cases Calcutta doesnt feature on their itinerary. We want to change this trend. Every year, we will invite experts from a particular discipline of management as part of the series, which we think will benefit the professionals and students in the city, said Sunil Sood, chief executive officer, Hutch, and an executive committee member of the IIMC Alumni Association. 																								Organisers expect the branding of Sheth, who taught at leading business schools like MIT, University of Southern California and penned 60 books and over 200 articles, to make the programme a success in the city. Around 200 participants are expected to log in for the programme, organised in association with Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, The Telegraph and Businessworld among others.																								The association was lying dormant for some time and so we wanted to relaunch it and thought of a workshop with Sheth. Besides being a internationally-renowned teacher, the former professor at IIM Calcutta sits on the boards of companies like Wipro and has a successful consultancy background. The workshop will indeed facilitate the process of scientific practice of management in the city, said Ashok K. Banerjee, secretary of the 150-member association. 																								And not just organising talk shows and seminars, the old boys are drawing up other plans as well. These include greater networking among the alumnus, promoting the state to potential investors and a number of social initiatives to improve the brand image of Calcutta. 																								Recently, we had a meeting with the government and now we are working on a detailed plan that we would like to submit to the state government, said Sood.

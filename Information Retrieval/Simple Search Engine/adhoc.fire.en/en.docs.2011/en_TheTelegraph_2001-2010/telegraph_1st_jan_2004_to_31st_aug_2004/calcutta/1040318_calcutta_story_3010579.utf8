The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Bill boys for phone dues
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Do not be surprised if, a few months from now, theres a knock on your door, reminding you of that unpaid telephone bill.																								Calcutta Telephones, confronted by an arrears bill that runs up to a 10-digit figure and desperate to reclaim dues, is ready to take a leaf out of the book of other corporate agencies.																								The city wing of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, which turned corporate a couple of years ago, is now drawing up plans to engage recovery agencies to crack the tough nuts  subscribers who simply refuse to pay.																								It is true that some of our subscribers owe Calcutta Telephones a huge sum of money, admitted CalTel general manager (customer relations) S.K. Bhaduri. We are now trying to determine the best method that will help us realise the arrears, he added.																								Senior Calcutta Telephones officials told Metro that a decision had been taken to engage private recovery agencies to do the job that BSNL had failed to do.																								We are in the process of finalising the modalities for the selection of the agency, one of them said. We are working towards floating a tender, inviting applications from agencies willing to be our partners in this job, he added.																								The two BSNL wings in the state (Calcutta Telephones and West Bengal Telecom) together are reeling under the effect of unpaid bills to the tune of Rs 334 crore. More than two-thirds of that figure  about Rs 225 crore  will come into the coffers of the city wing if every single errant subscriber can be made to fall in line and pay up the arrears. 																								West Bengal Telecom has arrears adding up to Rs 109 crore from its consumers.																								These figures are huge, by any standard, and it is a sign of desperation that the BSNL wings are now thinking along lines similar to that of private-sector banks, said a senior BSNL official.																								But the recovery agency selected for the purpose will have to follow a few broad guidelines that do not curb agencies working for private-sector clients, say officials. Being part of the government sector, we have to be more responsible and more careful, one of them said, explaining why the task would be more difficult for an agency working for BSNL.																								Besides, the legal restraints on the functioning of debt-recovery agencies  some were dragged to court with charges of being high-handed  would be kept in mind when the final details were worked out, officials said.

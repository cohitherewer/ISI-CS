The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 30, 2004 Atrium for the arts
make calcutta betterThe good news is that on the face of it, restoration work on Metropolitan Building at the Chowringhee-S.N. Banerjee Road crossing has visibly progressed. But the one major question is how will the 30,000 sq ft of vacant space in the building be re-used once repair work is complete.Consultant architect Dulal Mukherjee says the curved stained glass atrium (picture by Amit Datta above), one of the main attractions of the building, will be rebuilt. It had come crashing down about seven years ago.The sun-streaked atrium in this colossal structure in the heart of the city deserves to be turned into a classy platform for the best of Indian arts and crafts. Wouldnt you agree, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Wedding wows
 Models sport creations of city designers to be showcased in the Vivaha 2004 exhibitions. Picture by Rashbehari Das Marriages may be made in heaven, but the bridal outfits and accessories that jazz up a wedding are surely made on earth. 																								To ensure that the to-be brides and grooms get the best picks for their trousseaus, Vivaha, is coming up with its annual exhibition of bridal outfits, jewellery and accessories in Delhi in August and in Mumbai in October. 																								Though Calcutta has not been included in the list, designers from the city are all set to participate in the shows, which according to the organisers, generated business worth Rs 40 crore last year. 																								It is a big platform for new designers, said Smriti Lohia who is going to showcase her collection of stoles and shawls for men and women along with quilts and throws.																								Designers like Poonam Kasera, who is going to showcase her menswear line, and Vardha Goenka with her collection of jewellery, believe the Mumbai and Delhi rounds will help them sell better. Clients in both the cities love the craftsmanship of eastern India, and form a bulk of our buyers, said Poonam, who thinks that besides Lakm India Fashion Week there isnt much scope for designers to showcase their work on a national platform. 																								And even as Calcutta designers and brands buckle up, the city itself might have to wait till October 2005 before it gets its own bridal show. 																								This year, 80 designers will participate in the exhibitions. We get visitors from UK, US and Dubai at the annual exhibition and are hoping to get the same response this time as well, stressed Tarun Sarda, CEO Vivaha.						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

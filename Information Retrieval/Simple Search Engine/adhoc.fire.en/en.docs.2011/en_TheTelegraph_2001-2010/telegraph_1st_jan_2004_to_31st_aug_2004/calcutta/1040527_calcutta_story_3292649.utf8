The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 Vegging out at will 
 Foodies lap up the goodies on offer at Blossoms Square. Pictures by Rashbehari DasTheres good news for the green brigade, especially those living in Alipore. Blossoms Square, the first stand-alone vegetarian multi-cuisine restaurant at Alipore, was inaugurated by mayor Subrata Mukherjee at The Enclave on Wednesday morning. 																								More and more non-vegetarian people are switching to vegetarian food these days. But Calcutta has very few quality vegetarian restaurants to speak of, feels Alka Dalmia, the brain behind the project. 																								The dcor in the 100-seater eatery is in keeping with the theme as well. Done up by interior designer Vivek Rathore, flowers in various hues used as the main element lend the interiors a fresh outdoor feel. 																								The restaurant has been divided into sections, each one with a different look. Cream and beige walls, wooden tables, chairs with beige and brown upholstery and orange table linen define the slightly-elevated cosy family section, while the rest of the place has glass-topped wooden tables with Malaysian chairs in brown leather and wrought-iron designs on the ceiling. 																								This apart, the place has been designed to look completely different during the daytime and at night. It has a bright and fresh look with yellow lighting during the day and soon after sundown blue lights come on for a romantic effect.																								The food is a decent mix of Indian and Continental cuisines. Tandoor items top the list in the desi category with the Stuffed Tandoori Aloo, Stuffed Malai Paneer Tikka and the Blossom Mixed Platter leading the draws. For the main course, Alka recommends the Paneer Lababdar, Hariyali Kofta, Aloo Dum Khatta Mitha, Subz Miloni, Mattar Methi Malai and Dal Makhani. There are quite a few options in rice and Indian breads as well, but the Ghilafi Nan is a must-try. 																								Since we have positioned it as a family restaurant, we are expecting the Indian cuisine to be more popular, says Alka. But that doesnt take away anything from the Continental range, which has a range of pastas to start with. The Crispy Chilli Pasta and Crispy Chilli Idli are among the favourite starters. Moving on, one can try the Aubergine Steak, Cannaloni Delicasy (cannaloni sheets rolled with seasoned vegetable baked with morray sauce) and Veg Normandi. 																								Each of the dishes in the main course in both categories comes with a burner placed under the serving dish to keep the food warm.																								A helping of Fudge Cake with Vanilla Ice-cream would be the ideal ending to a meal here. In the mocktail menu Cranberry Cooler, Flamingo and Fruit Punch would be just right.Baking breadForum may be the latest eat-out, hangout hub voted by the hip brigade but there arent too many exclusive options for the sweet-toothed apart from Biscotti on the fourth floor. 																								As a result, the six-month-old bakery-cum-confectionery shop has been growing from strength to strength, the latest icing on its cake being the bread delivery facility to Alipore. 																								Our whole wheat and multi-grain breads are very popular but its not always possible for people to rush to Forum first thing in the morning to avail of our fresh produce. Thus we started the delivery system covering Alipore as a test area. If the concept clicks we plan to carry it forward to other areas as well, says Pooja Kanoi of Biscotti.																								Their produce coming from Hyatt Regency includes a variety of pastries, savouries, pizzas, puffs, sandwiches and cookies apart from healthy and innovative breads, the latest to hit the shelves being chocolate chip bread. 																								The idea behind the shop was to provide Calcutta with quality confectioneries, says Pooja, who feels the city lacks options in this segment. I have been travelling abroad and when I come to town I really have to hunt hard to sample good quality Cheese Cakes or Tiramisu, adds Pooja. She hopes to bridge the gap between the demand for quality stuff and supply with Biscotti where Black Forest, Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Truffle and Blueberry Cheese Cake are eternal favourites. 																								Coffees and shakes are thoughtful additions to wash it all down as are egg-less and sugar-free items. There are standalone seating arrangements in the shop and outside for hanger-ons. Puffs and cakes from Biscotti Inn and outIf Ibiza is out of bounds on a getaway to the greens or on a business blitz at Joka, and the other options dont quite measure up, you can now follow the middle path leading up to Hotel Aquatica Park Pvt Ltd on Diamond Harbour Road.																								About 2.5 km from IIM, Joka, the hotel is being pitched at the business traveller to the neighbouring industries, besides the stray tourist. Boasting star facilities at budget prices, the Rs 2 crore project spread over two bighas, was inaugurated on Tuesday amid some fanfare.																								Director Shyamal Basu waxed eloquent about the hotel filling a much-felt accommodation void in the hospitality arena thats witnessing frenetic industrial activity.																								Goutam Ghose, one of the guests at the inaugural function, rode down memory lane to reminisce about childhood days when he used to cycle to Diamond Harbour Road from Calcutta and back, for a breath of fresh air. The filmmaker went on to laud the entrepreneurial spirit of a fellow Bengali to come up with the hotel in the sylvan surroundings of the area, even if things arent quite the same here anymore.																								The five-storied stark white faade of the building is offset with a fountain and garden umbrellas on the surrounding lawns. The hotel houses 29 double-bedded air-conditioned rooms and two suites with their own kitchen.																								Other features include a banquet hall and conference room, indoor games facilities like billiards and table tennis, gym and health club, swimming pool, a childrens park and two multi-cuisine restaurants, including a roof-top garden eatery and a bar-cum-restaurant on the ground floor.																								The hotel has applied for star status considering its got all the jazz of health club and swimming pool in place.																								Starry airs might be on the horizon, but for now the tariff is a humble Rs 850 for double-bed rooms and Rs 1,600 for suites. Guests can avail of a 15 per cent discount on room tariffs and food and beverages upon taking membership of the East Palace Club (whose activities are yet to be defined), a unit of the hotel.Smita Roy Chowdhury, Sangita S.

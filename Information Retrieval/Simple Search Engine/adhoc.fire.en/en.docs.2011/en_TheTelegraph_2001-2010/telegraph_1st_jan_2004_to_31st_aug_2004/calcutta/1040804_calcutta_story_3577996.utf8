																								Choopkatha presents Mrs. Soriano, an adaptation of Eduardo de Filippos Filumena Marturano. It would be a myth to say that money can buy all the pleasures of the world. Sometimes one has to be tactful to win back love. When wealthy Domenico Soriano took Filumena from a brothel to his home, little did she know that for the rest of her life she would have to serve her master like a slave. For 25 long years she never showed any signs of distress, nor did she have any complaints. But old Soriano, in the meantime, was planning for a marriage with a young, attractive and more socially acceptable girl. Hearing this, Filumeno pretends to be dying and requests for a death-bed marriage. The plot takes a dramatic turn when Soriano realises that he has been tricked as Filumena jumps happily out of the bed the moment she becomes Mrs. Soriano.The significance of the play is that all throughout it shows one should have an optimistic approach towards life as it has certain meaning and love does prevail in our society. Dolly Basu, who directs the play, appears in the role of Mrs. Soriano.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Mrs. Soriano, produced by Choopkatha																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Shades of style
 A model shows off a pair of sunglasses at the fashion show on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								To pay whats above the shoulders its due, a pair of shades are the way to go  specially with the summer sun wreaking its havoc. GKB Opticals on Park Street showed off the shade styles of the season on Wednesday evening, in an eyewear fashion show. 																								The evening also marked the launch of its new collection as well as the showrooms first birthday. Calcutta was the last stop for the sunglass fiesta, which has already hit Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai. City models flaunted the Sports, Teens and Fashion ranges for both men and women. Targeting 15 to 35-year-olds, the in-house brand comes for anything between Rs 645 and Rs 1,500 a pair. Other brands like Gucci, Police, Rodenstock, Versace and Versus were also displayed.																								Wraparound and combination shades in dual tints seem to be in vogue this season. To drive home the point that different shades complement different looks, the models first appeared in saris and then in western outfits. The big red bindis they wore were definitely out of sync with the sturdy, sporty sunglasses, but the variety of shades on show was still quite impressive.																								Fashion statements may be fine and well, but the store also pays special attention to safety. Power check, anti-glare lenses and 100 per cent UV protection come with each pair.						SOMA BANERJEE

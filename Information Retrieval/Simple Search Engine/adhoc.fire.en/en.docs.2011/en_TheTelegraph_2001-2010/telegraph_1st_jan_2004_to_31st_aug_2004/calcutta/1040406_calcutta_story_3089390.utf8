The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Poetry through the lens
As a tribute to the city of Calcutta, which has always been celebrated for its style and grandeur, Oxford Bookstore, Calcutta, presents A Life of its Own, an exhibition of photographs by Leena Kejriwal. Blessed with the rare talent and unusual ability to discern beauty and mystery in objects we consider mundane, Kejriwals stills capture the essence of apparently ordinary moments, investing them with magical life and motion, making the familiar profound. Whether evoking the warmth and comfort of a roadside tea-stall, or finding poetic inspiration in a basket of eggs, her visuals possess a remarkable eloquence and dignity that leave an indelible impression on the viewers mind.																								Event: An exhibition of photographs by Leena Kejriwal																								When: Till April 7; 10 am - 9 pm																								Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

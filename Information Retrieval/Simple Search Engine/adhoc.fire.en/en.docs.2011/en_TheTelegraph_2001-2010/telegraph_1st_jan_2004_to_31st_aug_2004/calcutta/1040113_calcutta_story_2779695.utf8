The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 February date for mega car carnival
 SANJAY MANDAL 																								Geared to put Calcutta on the fast track of vehicle growth, the state government is set to host the biggest automobile fair in the city. Come February, leading vehicle manufacturers and oil companies will throng the Maidan, where the fair will be held. Sleek popular models to newly-launched ones will be displayed at the fair, along with vintage cars and non-conventional battery-run vehicles. 																								The fair will be the biggest ever in eastern India and various models, from heavy commercial vehicles to cars, two-wheelers to vintage cars, will be on display, state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty told Metro on Monday. 																								The fair, organised jointly by the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC) and The Pavilion, will be held from February 22 to March 2 at the same spot as the Calcutta Book Fair, scheduled later this month.																								Display of the vehicles, marketing and sales are on the agenda. We are discussing with the finance department whether tax concessions can be offered, the minister said.																								Officials feel the fair will be a major boost for the automobile market in the state. The demand for vehicles is growing in this part of the country and the fair will be a major push, said Dhiman Mukherjee, managing director of WBTIDC. Although there had been some fairs in the city earlier, this is the first one organised on such a massive scale, he said. 																								According to him, seven to eight major makers of cars and two-wheelers are expected to participate in the fair, along with auto auxiliary makers. 																								Officials said the fair was also aimed at raising awareness on air pollution, traffic and road safety and all other issues related to transport. 																								According to the organisers, the fair will cover 300,000 sq ft, with 30 pavilions and 40 stalls. We may extend the duration if sales demand it, said Swapan Kumar Mitra, secretary, Automobile Fair Committee. 																								The pavilions will be divided into two categories  the first will cover 250 sq m each, while the second, 144 sq m. There will be space reserved for obligatory authorities, like the transport department, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Calcutta Traffic Police, Society of India Automobile Manufacturers and others, Mitra said. There will also be a special platform for selling and buying second-hand cars and two-wheelers, he said. 																								Major tyre manufacturers and dealers of cars, two-wheelers and medium-sized vehicles will take part in the carnival. Shipping firms and the railways have also been invited.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Riflescopes easy access into airport 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								RDX, improvised machine guns and now, riflescopes.																								Calcutta airport has long been a transit stop for terrorists and their arms, headed for Delhi or further north. 																								But some recent hauls at the gateway to the east have established that it is also being used by certain quarters to despatch riflescopes to the Northeast.																								And the biggest stumbling block before the securitymen trying to arrest the trend are the laws: they do not prohibit bringing in the telescopic instruments, fitted to rifles for long-range shooting, with valid papers.																								While probing the recent arrest of three men in the airport for carrying 17 riflescopes, the sleuths have come to know of another similar incident. Early July, a middle-aged businessman from New Delhi had been held on charges of carrying 97 riflescopes. Anil Kapoor, his name according to the documents, failed to explain why he was carrying the instruments.																								Rattled, officers from the security control department held a series of meetings with airport officials last week, explaining the nitty-gritty of modern detection techniques. 																								The meeting, chaired by the deputy commissioner (security control) P.K. Chatterjee, also considered introducing a new security system in the airports core area. 																								The problem lies with the laws. Theres no ban on bringing in riflescopes with valid papers. It seems an increasing number of passengers are exploiting the loophole, said a senior Customs official.																								Following up on the security beef-up drive at the airport, police are now verifying the antecedents of those who frequently visit gun shops across the city, particularly in the central business district. Also under the scanner are riflescope buyers.																								With new terminals all set to come up at the airport, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has been asked to scan all articles being carried in or out. 																								Our primary concern is to ensure a fool-proof security ring. With more flights in the pipeline, we possibly cannot afford any slips, said airport director Rajendra Pal.																								A senior Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said: We have informed the ministry concerned and it, in turn, has told the CISF to step up vigil on anti-sabotage measures. 																								At a recent meeting, the AAI had stressed the need for top class security at Calcutta airport to lure more foreign airlines.

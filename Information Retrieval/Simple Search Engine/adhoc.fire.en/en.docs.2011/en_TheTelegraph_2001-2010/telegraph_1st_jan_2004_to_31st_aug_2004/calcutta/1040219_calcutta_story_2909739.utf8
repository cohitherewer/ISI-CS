					PICTURE BY RASHBEHARI DAS Chef Sushanta Sengupta with some of the delicacies from the ongoing food festival  Fishes of Bengal  at 6 Ballygunge Place 															Like adda, sports, culture and travel, the Bengalis love for fish is legendary, edging out even their much-vaunted passion for rosogolla, sandesh and mishti-doi. And at no time is this more indulged than in winter, when markets teem with the choicest varieties of fish and vegetables, affording gourmets a chance to go all out and binge like never before. Now, with winter on its way out, 6 Ballygunge Place, the Bengali and Continental speciality restaurant at the same address, is making the most of the last few days to host a special fish festival  Fishes of Bengal  that throws up a host of mouth-watering fish preparations, just the way thakurma made them. 																					e the usual ilish, chingri and rui specialities continue to find place on the regular menu card, the bill of fare at Fishes of Bengal lists only those unusual preparations, not to be found at most other restaurants. The recipes have been culled from both east and west Bengal, so get ready to pack it in, what with such delectable items as Pabda Macher Jhal, Doi Bhetki, Tangra Mach Peajkoli Diye and Loitya Shutki to choose from. Round these off with such ever-popular dishes as Tel Koi and Chital Macher Peti Roast and leave with a stomachful of satisfaction. Prices at the festival start at about Rs 85 and go up to a maximum of Rs 125 for the Tel Koi or Rondha Bora. The 11-day festival starting from today, will continue till February 29 and will be on everyday for lunch between 12.30 pm and 3.30 pm and for dinner, between 7.30 pm and 10.30 pm.

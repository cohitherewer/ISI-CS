																								Play-acting, specially by children, has always been associated with fun and merrymaking. Nevertheless, Prayasam, with the active support of some socially responsible business houses of the city, makes a rare endeavour to use this medium of entertainment for a serious purpose. Calling upon students from schools and madrasahs to perform plays, skits or dances, it has organized a concert that aims to make both adults and children conscious of the critical national problem of population explosion. Titled Kalker Janye Aajker Bhabna, each entry of the programme, based on popular or original musical compositions, witnesses the enthusiastic participation of more than 300 school children. It brings to the fore their creative and histrionic skills in analysing, interpreting and representing the theme of the event and, in the process, makes an important social comment. Besides this, Ahlladi, a dance theatre outfit, will perform Deyala, a dance performance that seeks to lend voice to the unfulfilled dreams and desires of underprivileged children.																								Event: Kalker Janye Aajker Bhabna, plays performed by school and madrasah students																								When: Today at 10 am																								Where: Sisir Mancha

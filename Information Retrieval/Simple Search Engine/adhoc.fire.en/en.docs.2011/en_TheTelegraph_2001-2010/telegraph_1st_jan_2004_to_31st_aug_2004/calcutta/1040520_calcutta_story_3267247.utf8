The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 First love fun
 Samir Dattani and Pooja Kanwal at the premiere of Uff Kya Jaadoo Mohabbat Hai at INOX on Wednesday. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								International collaborations for Bollywood blockbusters is one thing, getting French pianist Richard Clayderman to add a bit of magic to a Hindi film track is quite another.																								But thats precisely what Rajshri Productions has done for its 50th film, Uff Kya Jaadoo Mohabbat Hai, which will be released in 50 theatres across the country this Friday.																								Says Rajat Barjatya, one of the executive producers of the film: To get Richard Clayderman to play for the title track of Uff Kya Jaadoo is a feather in our cap. 																								Actually, I have grown up listening to his music and it was a dream to get him to play for one of our films I sent the track of the song to him and to my utter surprise I received a mail from Clayderman within a week, saying, It is one of the finest songs I have heard and I would love to play the piano for it. So, off they went to the pop piano legends studio in Paris and the song was recorded in 30 minutes flat.																								If Clayderman was a coup, the main cast for the campus love story has thrown up a novel combination: fresh-faced Samir Dattani and Pooja Kanwal. Samir is quite a popular face on the small screen (he has been doing TV commercials ever since he was six) and music videos (remember the Valentines Day video with Raima Sen?), but for Pooja Uff Kya Jaadoo is her first screen appearance.																								The character I play is called Yash. We are both of the same age, were both fun-loving and pampered, smiles Samir, in town to promote his debut dream boat at INOX. I was always a film buff and I knew I wanted to be an actor ever since I was 16.																								This is one aim he shares with his on-screen lady love, Pooja. I have wanted to be an actor ever since I can remember, says the second-year sociology student of St Xaviers College, Mumbai. To act with Aamir Khan would be a dream-come-true.																								While for Pooja this was the first visit to Calcutta, Samir has fond childhood memories of this city. My father and uncles were brought up in Calcutta and all my summer vacations were spent in Bhawanipore. I have memories of Diwali and Durga Puja here, says the national level roller skater and a student of music in Trinity College London, who hopes to make magic on the big screen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Poll panel move to take sting off graffiti
 SWATI SENGUPTA				 	 Election graffiti lampooning the BJP and the Trinamul Congress. (PTI)																								How does one know when elections are round the corner in Calcutta? By the frenzied writing on the wall.																								How does one know when elections in Calcutta are over? By the gradual wiping out of the writing on the wall.																								In between, for weeks if not months, the city streets play host to the graffiti gladiators.																								The thrust and the parry of political parleys not only clutter the Calcutta walls, but many merrily violate the model code of conduct. With tracing the author of the offending graffiti proving to be mission impossible, the election commission has decided to step in  not to keep the walls scrawl free, but to introduce some checks and balances.																								Chief electoral officer (CEO) Basudeb Banerjee will place a proposal before the election commission at a meeting on Wednesday in New Delhi, for introducing a system to keep records of all poll graffiti written during the elections.																								This problem is typical in the state, especially in Calcutta, where wall-writing is the most common means of campaigning, Banerjee said on Tuesday.																								In the just-concluded elections, Banerjees office was flooded with complaints from political parties alleging how their rivals had violated the model code of conduct in their poll graffiti. However, the cases were difficult to prove, as no one was ready to admit that they had actually written them. So offenders could not be punished even if the content of the graffiti went against the code of conduct, especially indulging in personal attacks against candidates, he added. 																								The plan is therefore to ask political parties to submit a copy of what they intend to write on a wall. The idea is that they must mention what they are writing and where  detail the exact location of the wall and address and submit it to the returning officers concerned, the CEO added. 																								The Commission, however, has to agree with Banerjees proposal if the system is to be introduced here from the next elections. 																								However, this does not include writing on walls of government buildings, which are banned in the first place. In fact, if the system of submitting detailed information on poll graffiti is introduced, Banerjees office can also prevent political parties from using walls of government buildings altogether. 																								The CEO will also discuss the issue of using post offices and postmen for electoral roll revision. People are often lethargic to go to election offices for checking whether their names are included in the voters list. But since a visit to the post office is rather common, more people can be made to check their names if the post office is the destination. Every post office is expected to carry a list of voters residing under its jurisdiction, he added. Postmen can also be used to go door-to-door and revise the electoral roll. 																								The Commission plans to introduce the system all over the country.																								Banerjee will bring up a few other issues before the Commission on Wednesday. 																								He wants to calculate a candidates expenses from the day he or she is used by the party for campaigning. At present, expenses are calculated from the day of filing nominations.																								A proposal will also be mooted to ban camp offices of political parties outside polling booths. The work done by the parties from the booths, especially distribution of voters slips, can be done by polling personnel, he suggests.

 Thursday, July 22, 2004 				 Invoking the monsoons
Indian culture, inarguably one of the richest in the world, finds its choicest expressions in such architectural splendours as the Taj Mahal, as in the arts, which broadly includes literature and music. Indian classical music has ragas for every season in the seasonal cycle, of which the monsoons are an integral part. Malhars, or the monsoon ragas, are invocations to the monsoons to bring that much- sought-after relief to the parched earth. Calcuttans are invited to a splendid evening of Malhars with vocalist Ulhas Kashalkar and Paratha Sarathy on the sarod, accompanied by Shubhankar Banerjee on the tabla and Purushottam Walawakar on the harmonium. 																								Event: An evening of Malhars																								When: Today at 6 pm 																								Where: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, 																								 Vivekananda Hall

Picture by Pabitra Das																								Singing, dancing, painting, acting, slogan-writing Not a school fest for students, but a competition for teachers. The 16 city contenders for the award took part in a range of activities, reliving their student days and generally having a wonderful time. It was just the regional semi-finals, but the teachers had a blast as they stepped into their students shoes.																								The Rustom Irani Foundation from Mumbai had instituted the Unsung Heroes... No Longer award to recognise excellence in teaching in 2003. This year, it was expanded to include the five metros  Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Calcutta. August 13 was the examination date set for Calcutta.																								The first stage was the elimination round, where the participants  one nominee per school selected according to strict guidelines  submitted a portfolio containing the resum, published works, details of social and community project involvements and three essays amongst other things. 																								Stage two was the city semi-finals with a variety of events, from painting interpretation and Turncoat (a debate in which they had to speak for and against the topic) to poster-making and sloganeering.																								It really tested the nerves, since it require a lot of quick thinking on controversial issues, like the flesh trade and sex in films, said Sarbari Saha, a history teacher of St Augustines Day School and one of the two finalists chosen to represent Calcutta in Mumbai on August 27. But I enjoyed it, she added, just after completing a rendition of a portion of her favourite play, Dolls House.																								The fact that it was fun and an enjoyable day was what everyone agreed to. It was fascinating, because in our daily lives, we dont get to do the things that we would like to, said Nandita Bir, teacher of English, history and value education in Loreto Day School, Sealdah, and the winner of the day. I am excited about going to Mumbai, but also a little nervous.																								The aim of the award, explained Chaya Rangnekar, primary section principal of Rustomjee International School, Mumbai, run by the Foundation, is because the teaching fraternity is ignored. They need to be lauded for their efforts, too. As for the fun format, Teachers are learners at every stage, so they should also get a chance to express their creativity, she added.																								However, despite the great quality of talent displayed on Friday, the response from Calcutta schools to the award itself has been lukewarm, Rangnekar pointed out.																								Our teachers themselves had gone from school to school in every city, talking to principals. In Bangalore and Chennai, we had about 100 applications. Delhi had more, while Mumbai had close to 200. Here, there were about 50, but only about 20 satisfied the criteria. I dont know the reason for this, but hopefully it will catch on the next time, she summed up.																								The winner will be announced on August 27, with Rs 20,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 10,000 going to the top three.

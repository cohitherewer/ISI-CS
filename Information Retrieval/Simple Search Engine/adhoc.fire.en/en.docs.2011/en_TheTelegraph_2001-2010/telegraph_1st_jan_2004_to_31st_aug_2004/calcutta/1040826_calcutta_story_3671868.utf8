 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 For the love of colours, hills and law 
 PURNENDU BIKASH SENGUPTA He has been fighting a battle for over 30 years of his life. Studying and practising law, working in a bank, painting and holding exhibitions, trekking up the hills, Purnendu Bikash Sengupta has done it all, so what if he has a physical handicap. 																								The year was 1972, and Sengupta had just taken his final year law exams. A prison van rammed into the two-wheeler he was driving. That incident changed the course of his life.																								I had to stay in a hospital for months after that. Hardly any bone was left in my right leg. A steel rod was used to hold the leg in place. I was bed-ridden for a long time and then had to walk with crutches for years, says Sengupta.																								But a strange inner strength seems always to have kept him afloat. 																								After his law exams, Sengupta practised his trade for a while at the high court. Then he took up a job first at Dena Bank and then with UCO Bank, from where he retired recently as deputy chief officer of law. 																								All through my professional life, I had never stopped painting. Colours and ideas propped me up in my darkest hours, says Sengupta. 																								And what merely started as a childhood dabbling with paint, has now become a full-fledged passion, though he is still loathe to take it up as a profession. After his first exihibition at the Acedemy of Fine Arts in 1986, and the next one in 1995, Sengupta is now in the middle of his third exhibition at the same venue.																								I mainly do water colours. Sometimes, I sketch as well, says the man to whom painting gave a second life beyond physical ruin.																								It was again another special force that took Sengupta up to the Himalayas last year. Walking with a limp, with a renewed infection all over his injured leg, he trekked alone for 28 hours at a stretch form Gaurikund to Kedar and back and later another 14 hours from Phoolchoti to Yamunotri and back. 																								I love the hills. They have a certain force that keeps drawing me and inspires me to keep going, without any concern for the leg, which doctors had once thought that I wont ever be able to use, he smiles bravely. In fact, that journey is the theme of my latest exhibition.																								With his daughter away in Bangalore, working as an engineer, and his wife by his side at his Howrah home providing him constant inspiration, Sengupta now wishes to take up practising law for good. 																								But that will definitely be after the exhibition, he asserts.

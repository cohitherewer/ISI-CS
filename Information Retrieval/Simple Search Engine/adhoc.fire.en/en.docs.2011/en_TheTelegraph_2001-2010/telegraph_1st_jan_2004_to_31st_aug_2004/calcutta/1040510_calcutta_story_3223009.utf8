In its maiden venture, names-AN.art features the works of Shuvaprasanna, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Prakash Karmakar, Wasim Kapoor and Subrata Gangopadhyay, whose Pallavi features above, among other contemporary artists.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings																								When: Till May 12; 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: names-AN.art, 207A Rashbehari Avenue, Calcutta 19

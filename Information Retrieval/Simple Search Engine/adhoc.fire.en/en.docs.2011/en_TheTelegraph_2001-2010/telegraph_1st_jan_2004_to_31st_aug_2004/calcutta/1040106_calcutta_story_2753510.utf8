 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 In fond memory of a mentor
																								Reverend Father Theodore Mathieson. Does the name sound familiar? Umm... not really. Rake your brains. Still drawing a blank? Quite natural. After all, how many of us have the time to spare for an organisation like Oxford Mission tucked in one corner of the city on Biren Roy Road, Behala, working for the uplift of poor orphans and destitutes? It was here that Father Theodore Mathieson worked tirelessly, undaunted by obstacles and impediments that came his way, and discovered raw talent in a little boy. He gave a direction and channelised the talent of this boy, and a star was born! Since then, Anup Biswas, his pupil, has not let him down. A minehouse of talent, this cello player has mesmerised the West with his charged performances. But fame and money have not been able to conquer his soul and Biswas has not forgotten his roots. He set up The Mathieson Music School at Thakurpukur for imparting formal education and training in music and fine arts to underprivileged children. That was 10 years ago. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of this schools foundation, a concert will be held featuring conductor/soloist Anup Kumar Biswas and members of Cosmopolitan Chamber Orchestra. Music by Bach, Boyce, Elgar, Grieg, Couperin and others including Vivaldi: cello concerts, and Biswas: Incantation.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

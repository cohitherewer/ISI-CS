The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Schoolbus amp; standing order
 SWATI SENGUPTA																								Its tough making last-minute preparations for class tests or terminal exams in the schoolbus, the 12-year-old boy keeps telling his parents. 																								The bus rattles down bumpy city roads, and the child has a tough time trying to stand straight as he shuttles back and forth from home to school in the vehicle almost every day. The boys parents have told this top government official they know about their sons daily plight but they are unwilling to make an official complaint. 																								The state transport department and the traffic police are aware of the problem schoolchildren face every day. According to transport department rules, children must not be made to stand in schoolbuses that are mostly privately-owned vehicles on contract. But, in the absence of formal complaints, it is difficult for us to punish the offenders, says officers of the traffic and transport departments. 																								However, flooded with such complaints made informally, the state transport department wants set things right before the summer vacations are over. We are going to sit down with the people concerned and ask them to take corrective measures, H. Mohan, director of the public vehicles department and joint secretary of the state transport department, said on Monday. 																								Since schools get into agreements with car-pool owners, the school authorities themselves must be told that the rules must be adhered to. We are also going to discuss the matter with owners of contract vehicles and schools that use their own vehicles as pool cars for their students, Mohan added. 																								But Himadri Ganguly, general secretary of the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners and Operators Association, claimed: I am not aware of any such rule. In any case, we do not allow children to stand in schoolbuses. At least 2,500 vehicles used as schoolbuses belong to the body. 																								But government officials take a different view of the matter. Many have told me about this. The idea is that children already burdened with books and the pressure of studies must not have to stand when they are already paying good money to avail of the facility. Moreover, rash driving on city roads could lead to a child getting injured if s/he is standing, Mohan said.																								One parent told me that his child, who studies in a reputable school, has to stand in the schoolbus very often. However, when I asked him to make a complaint, he did not get back to me, joint commissioner of police (traffic), Banibrata Basu, said on Monday. 																								School authorities, too, are aware of the problem. Rita Chatterjee, principal, Apeejay School, said: Of course, the buses do take more children than their capacity. We shall call all bus-owners, on contract with us, and tell them that this must be stopped. 																								Ishita Das, head of Patha Bhavan High School, said: We did have such a problem in our school a year ago. However, we have solved it now.

 																											- Underground lots in revamp plan for Curzon Park, BBD Bag A STAFF REPORTER																								Theres hope yet for those desperately seeking parking space in the city centre.																								If whats in the pipeline rolls out on reality street, two underground parking lots at two erstwhile showpieces  Curzon Park and BBD Bag  could ease parking woes in the central business district.																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Monday moved a step closer towards the beautification and development of Curzon Park  which includes a large car park  even as the public works department (PWD) confirmed the move towards another substantial space for cars at BBD Bag.																								The park is tipped to be transformed into a multi-utility, multi-facility hub. A memorandum of agreement to this effect has been signed between the PWD and a consortium to conduct a feasibility study and work out modalities.																								Announcing the grand project at Writers Buildings on Monday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the exhibition centre and mall in the park would showcase the best of Bengals handloom and handicraft.																								All efforts will be made to provide recreation facilities for visitors, with special emphasis on families. Hence, the restaurant and theatre, he explained.																								The basement is slated to have parking facilities for approximately 1,200 cars. It will also house a sprawling mall-cum-shopping centre, spread over 200,000 sq ft.																								PWD minister Amar Chowdhury said the feasibility study on the project would be complete in 120 days. Once the modalities are worked out and the implementing agencies selected, the project is expected to be rolled out in about 30 months, officials said.																								Chowdhury went on to reiterate plans to create an underground car park at Laldighi, opposite Writers Buildings. 																								The proposed parking lot will house approximately 450 cars, said the minister.																								He added that the government was planning to shift the chaotic Writers Buildings car park underground and beautify the plot around the lake.																								The PWD is currently awaiting clearance from the transport department on the proposed project. We will also beautify Laldighi with fountains and sculptures, stressed Chowdhury.

 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 New bus amenities: a tale of three cities
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE				 	 A private bus conforming to the governments specifications, set after a study of passenger amenities in vehicles run in Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai. Picture by Amit Datta																								The collective prayers of some bus passengers seem to have been answered. Tin boxes on wheels, into which people are packed like sardines, will be replaced in phases by private buses in sky blue with a yellow border. 																								These will have soft seats, more legroom, larger windows and piped music, styled after the vehicles that ply in Chennai, Mumbai and Bangalore. 																								Whats more, passengers will not be asked to pay higher fares for the new amenities. The 41 foam-cushion seats will have to be 3 ft by 1.5 ft, and will be at intervals of a foot each. 																								Every bus will have a music system and there will be no separate cabins for drivers. Passengers will have to climb only three steps to board them. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, along with his departmental officers, recently visited Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai to study the designs of the buses plying there and finalise specifications for private buses in Calcutta.																								The transport department has already issued the necessary notification making it mandatory for all the private buses plying in Calcutta to follow the new specifications. The government has also arranged for the purchase of about 100 buses, as per the new specifications, to serve as models for private bus operators. The new buses are now being run on routes 3B, 3D, 32, 46, 202, 230, 237 and 239.																								The government has made it clear that, henceforth, no one will be given the necessary route permit if the private bus he is willing to run does not conform to new specifications. 																								The existing old private buses plying in the city will also have to be re-modelled within a year-and-a-half, and gradually replaced by the buses of the new design. Otherwise, the bus operators will not get the mandatory certificate of fitness for their vehicles, transport department officials said.																								The transport minister said the move was aimed at providing comfort to passengers. Bus owners do not provide the basic amenities to passengers. The government, from time to time, hikes bus fares but operators never think of passengers comfort, Chakraborty said.																								The design of the private bus was last modified in 1975.																								Bus operators said they had sought some more time to remodel the old vehicles as per the new design. We do not have any objection to follow the rules but it is not possible for all the operators to remodel their vehicles overnight. We have told minister Chakraborty that the revamp will be done phase-wise, said Swarnakamal Saha, president of Bengal Bus Syndicate.

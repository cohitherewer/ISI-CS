					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Uday Kumar Chandra and Ishaa Koppikar at the unveiling of Dream Diamonds 04 at ITC Sonar Bangla															In the past, theyve roped in such beauties as Yana Gupta and Aditi Govitrikar to endorse their gems. This time around, however, jewellery giants P.C. Chandra set their sights on a young actress whos become hot property ever since her sizzling item number Khallas upped Companys profile. Ishaa Koppikar was in town recently to unveil P.C. Chandras latest offering to the city  Dream Diamonds 04, a three-day exhibition that zooms in on  what else?  a girls best friend. Organised in association with the Diamond Trading Company, the showing will kick off at all P.C. Chandra outlets in the city on February 21.																					The select briefing to announce the same, held at the ITC Sonar Bangla, was emceed by Mihir and saw the Chandra family out in full force including joint managing director, Uday Kumar Chandra and directors Prasanta and Suvro Chandra. Said Amitava Chandra, one of the other directors present, Dream Diamonds 04 is targeted exclusively at the confident and self-assured woman of today. Hence, the ornaments on display will be a mix and match of tradition and modernity, of classic style and contemporary appeal.																					The blend of the old and the new is more than evident when you take a look at the baubles on display. An exquisite diamond necklace in a classic floral design is strung with black pearls and rhodium-polished for a hint of the West. An enormous diamond pendant in a geometrical setting is teamed with large amethyst beads for a breath- taking look and gorgeous Colombian emeralds are fused with diamonds and pearls for an elegant yet trendy neckpiece.																					From sparklers of one kind to a stunner of another. Dressed in a long black gown, her hair a mass of tumbling curls, Ishaa was all smiles as she tried on some of the jewellery at the meet and even quipped about running away with some of it. Later, she admitted that although this wasnt her first trip to Calcutta, she hadnt really been able to see much of the City of Joy. I find the trams really fascinating, though, and simply love the phuchkas, doi maach and mishti-doi, she said. 																					Even as the pretty Maharashtrian prepared to dig into a bowl of mishti-doi, she expressed excitement over several of her upcoming films. I always look ahead and even though Rudraaksh has just been released, its over now. Im really looking forward to Krishna Cottage, a horror flick with Sohail Khan, Inteqaam with Manoj Bajpai and Hum Rahi, all of which have me playing the female lead.

For Adhishree, an ethnicwear boutique on Christopher Road, fashion is all about being bright, bold and in-your-face. And the ateliers spring-summer collection reflects all this and more  a melange of colours, a delightful blend of traditional embellishments and dramatic, eye-catching motifs. Powered by self-taught designer Seema Saraf, whos been in the business for the last seven years now, Adhishree recently shifted to newer and swankier digs in the Brindavan Gardens complex  well in time to unveil its latest offerings. 																					oying such flowing fabrics as georgette and crepe and to a certain extent, cotton, Seema specialises in semi- formal and formal saris and salwar-suits that can do duty at anything from a high-society luncheon to a cocktail party and even a wedding. Especially appealing are the georgette saris in solid colours with heavily-worked borders that take in multi-hued pattis, kasab-work and sequins, dual-shaded creations with intricate embroidery all over and pretty khari-printed saris. Then again, hand-printed ones with large floral motifs dusted with sequins for that extra gloss catch the eye as do the tomato-coloured saris with delicate thread-work and the lemony-greens with geometrical patterns. 																					If salwar-kameezes and kurtas are more up your street, check out Seemas line of ready-made and unstitched suits in a spectrum of colours ranging from turquoises, greens, oranges and reds to the more sedate blacks and browns. But if the colour is understated, the work is not. There are outfits with snazzy kundan and stone-work, zardosi and sparkling sequins for an all-out glam look. Sharing shelf space with all these is a range of kurtis that include casual and dressy styles. Also available at Adhishree are ghaghras and sherwanis (only on order) as well as a few bags, batuas and shoes. Prices at the boutique start at about Rs 350 for a kurti while salwar-suits come for a minimum of Rs 700. A semi-formal sari will set you back by at least Rs 1,500 and more elaborate options are tagged upwards of Rs 4,000. Adhishree remains open throughout the week, except Sundays, from 11 am to 6 pm.

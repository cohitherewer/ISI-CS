The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Windfall for civic services
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Last year, after mayor Subrata Mukherjee returned from the Mayors Asia Pacific Environmental Summit (MAPES), Anindya Karpharma, deputy chief municipal architect and town planner of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), was instructed to apply to the body for a grant.																								Today, thanks to that move, the CMC has received a windfall. 																								It is richer by $50,000, all because of the munificence of MAPES and the Environmental System Research Institute, based in the US. Included in this package is software that will help ease the CMCs work. 																								Arc Geographical Information System (GIS) Arc Info, Arc GIS 3D Analyst, Arc GIS Spatial Analyst, Arc GIS Arc IMS, and Arc GIS Arc SDE are the software on offer. The CMC staff will have to undergo training to use the software that will be made available soon. 																								This will help update the base map already developed by the CMC and incorporate in it all civic information and amenities  work that was stalled owing to lack of funds.																								This includes information on the water supply system, solid waste management system, including hazardous waste, street-lighting, road network, waterbody management, parks, garden and playground management. The transfer to the higher-end software will not take long at all, says Karpharma.																								According to the CMC proposal, the GIS will be required for effective management of the tax-collection system. It will facilitate mobilising manpower to recover taxes from pockets where collection has not been satisfactory. 																								The software allows better management of the heritage buildings of Calcutta, which have the potential of developing tourism in the city. Private operators could be roped in for partnership.																								The software may also be used for faster response to the plaints of tax-payers by clubbing together information on civic infrastructure and amenities.																								The higher-end software will make things easy when the more sophisticated CMC map is ready. Aerial survey for the new map is over. This is being done with funds meant for the uplift of the urban poor from the Department of Foreign Investment and Development of the UK. When the new map is ready, the transfer will be easier.

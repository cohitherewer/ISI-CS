 							 - After the mercy plea rejection, fur flies OUR BUREAUMeera Bhattacharjee																								Meera Bhattacharjee, the chief ministers wife, has welcomed the Presidents decision to reject Dhananjoy Chatterjees mercy petition. He (Dhananjoy) got what he deserves, she said on Wednesday. It is pointless to debate the legal and other aspects of the crime. The convict had committed a ghastly crime. He had raped and killed a child whom he was supposed to protect, pointed out Meera Bhattacharjee.																								On June 26, the chief ministers wife had surprised many by coming out in the open in favour of the killers execution. 																								In the face of persistent efforts by anti-capital punishment lobbies, she had issued an appeal as a woman, as a citizen and as the mother of a daughter to mobilise public opinion in support of the execution. 																								The chief ministers daughter Suchetana could not make it to the June 26 rally, but had sent a message, saying she was in favour of the execution. 																								CPM Politburo member and state secretary Anil Biswas asserted on Wednesday that the Presidents rejection of the mercy petition was in tune with the popular mood. The gravity of the crime could not have been overlooked, he said. 																								Ever since the debate on the issue started, Biswas had polarised himself in favour of the death sentence.

 Friday, April 30, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Kirsten Dunst. Jupiter and Mars make you creative and capable. You can be a good teacher. You have a religious frame of mind but are susceptible to influence. You need to be more focused. You like meeting people and making friends. Adversities bother you but your happy nature helps you sail through.  Kusum Bhandari

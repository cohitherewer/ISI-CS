 Friday, January 23, 2004  Bibadibag vs Dalhousie Sq
 World Monuments Watch may have included  Dalhousie Square in its list but is heritage really safe here,  wonders Soumitra Das Even the most preposterous of  personal myths seem to follow some twisted logic. That is  the only way I can explain how I have come to associate  Dalhousie Square with, of all people, Winston Churchill.  In my pre-school days while we were driving down Old Court  House Street, I distinctly remember an aunt pointing out  (or so I thought) the weather vane on a tall building and  shouting Churchill, adding thereafter that I should grow  up to be like that redoubtable British statesman who was  a household name in the Fifties. But in the blissful ignorance  of my infancy I thought she meant four kites, which is  a literal translation of the name of the ex-PM who never  thought much of Indians. And ever since, like Pavlovs dog,  say Dalhousie Square, and immediately the picture of an  avian weather vane by the name of Churchill flashes in  my minds eye. However perverse that may sound, I was not  wrong in equating the two names for they both symbolised  imperium. And in the Fifties, we were still reeling under  the after-effects of the Raj. Dalhousie Square, or Bibadibag  (it was renamed Benoy Badal Dinesh Bag in 1969 after the  revolutionaries) if you will, was and is the fulcrum of  white Calcutta. Till 1910 it was the seat of governance  and commerce of India, now only of West Bengal. Huge British  and European agency houses flourished here. Today, capital  has fled. The Squares power centre is Writers Buildings,  at the head of the large quadrangular waterbody known as  Lal Dighi created in 1709 to supply drinking water. Buildings  meant to inspire awe in the subject race cluster around  it. They seem to radiate from this tank, whose waters were  reputedly the sweetest in the young city, and where alligators  were caught in 1827 and 1848. Now its waters are heavy and  turgid. People bathe here. The bordering garden has become  a parking lot and an unsightly garage. Without Job Charnock there would  never have been Calcutta as we know it, and he first landed  at the spot that developed into Dalhousie Square on August  24, 1690. The British built their first mud citadel here  known as the old Fort William, still recalled in the name  Koilaghat (Killaghat) Street, and excavated Lal Dighi at  the same time.  In June 1756, the square witnessed  the sack of Fort William by Nawab Siraj-ud-Doulah, that  culminated in the Black Hole tragedy. It was Covent Garden  and Fleet Street rolled into one. Several theatres were  built here, notable among them being the Bengali Theatre  started in 1795 by the Russian Herasim Stepanovich Lebedeff.  This was the birthplace of Indian journalism. Here, Hickys  Gazette first rolled out of the press on January 29,  1780. In few other areas is the past so clearly present.  Little wonder that in 1987, historian Nisith Ranjan Ray  had made an impassioned plea for declaring as a heritage  zone the larger quadrangle from Esplanade East and West  up to Lower Chitpur Road, and extending to the Old Mint  at one end of Strand Road, and Metcalfe Hall at the other.  While that appeal fell on deaf ears, the World Monuments  Watch included Dalhousie Square in last years list of top  100 world heritage sites. Concern over the safety of the  heritage buildings in Dalhousie Square is certainly not  misplaced. Post-Independence, it has witnessed the most  outrageous instances of deletion of the citys heritage.  Fired by the zeal to wipe out the past, Dalhousie Institute,  whose foundation was laid in 1865 as a memorial to the heroes  of the 1857 uprising, was shifted to Beckbagan in 1948.  An old photograph with the institute in the foreground shows  how its pediment echoed the grander pediment of Writers  Buildings at the other end of the tank. The multistoreyed  Telephone Bhavan has stood here since 1954, blocking the  unimpeded view of Writers Buildings that the grand entrance  of Raj Bhavan commanded once. The lofty spire of St Andrews  Church at the confluence of Lyons Range and Brabourne Road  was once visible across the Maidan from SSKM Hospital. Now  the United Bank of India headquarters in Old Court House  Street and exhaust fumes clouds obscure the view. The Scottish  Kirk, as the church is called, is also under attack from  white ants that are eating up the woodwork and beams.  The other act of vandalism is  more recent. The grand Currency Building was abandoned to  the elements after its partial demolition. Mysterious fires  have gutted several office buildings, the most re markable  of them being McKinnon Mackenzie building at Fairlie Place.  A jungle has grown inside with as much virulence as the  saplings whose roots hold Currency Building in a deathly  embrace. Had it not been for public works  department minister Amar Choudhurys cooperation, it would  have been impossible to find ones way through the Kafkaesque  maze of corridors, past the policemen on guard. The building,  comprising 13 interconnected blocks with a courtyard has  been made over several times since 1776 when it was little  more than a huge block of masonry and was home to writers  or junior servants of the East India Company. The triangular  pediment and the columns along the corridor of power were  later additions - during the regime of lieutenant governor  Ashley Eden (1877-82). The statuary along the terrace of  Science, Agriculture, Commerce and Justice date back to  1883 and are by William Fredric Woodington. The dusty offices have shrunk  in dimension to accommodate an increasing number of ministers  and panjandrums. Files are piled on tables, and calendars  of Baba Lokenath, who has suddenly become a cult, are ubiquitous.  Knots of people kill time either gossiping or snacking.  As in the roads outside, Writers too has a thing for food  in all its awesome variety from tea-and-toast to chops and  mishti. The open space of the courtyard  is in parts used as a dump. Writers is reputed to be haunted.  But an IAS officer vouches for the fact that in 1990 this  quadrangle served as night shelter for 400-500 rickshaw-pullers  and hawkers. In the late Seventies there was  a sensation when it was discovered that then chief minister  Siddhartha Sankar Ray had done up his loo in Writers at  a phenomenal Rs 10 lakh. Nowadays, the dcor of ministers  rooms is surely inspired by catalogues of plastic furniture.  Such public displays of banality can mar the most majestic  of structures. A large bronze statue of the runner, the  sentimentalised courier, has of late, been installed under  the huge dome of the General Post Office. The GPO rotunda  has become a puja pandal. Of late, the broken arm of Minerva,  who stands on the pediment, has been mended. But the extended  arm with an owl on its palm looks as if a quack had had  a go at it after a compound fracture.

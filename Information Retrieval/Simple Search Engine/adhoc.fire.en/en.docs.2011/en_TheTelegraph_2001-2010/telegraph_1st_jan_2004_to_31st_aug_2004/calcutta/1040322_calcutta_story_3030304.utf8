The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Point-disclose decree on cablemen
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Cable clean-up while the cricket fever lasts																								If broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs) have been complaining about low subscriber declaration by cable operators, its now the governments turn to join in. But in this case, its regarding the loss of service tax revenues.																								A letter sent recently by the office of the commissioner of central excise to major operators in the CMDA area and districts asks the operators to furnish details regarding their service tax payments. It also seeks details of the sub-operators under them. 																								The letter directs the operators to intimate the office about their service tax registration number and the date from which they are registered. It further reads: In many cases, it is found that you are transmitting the signal received from the MSO to your sub-cable operators who ultimately provide service to the viewer In this connection, you are requested to please submit the list of sub-cable operators. A format is set, with items to be filled in, as name of sub-operators, address, phone number, names of authorised representatives, date of commencement of cable service and total number of points.																								It is this last item that is sure to create panic in the cable fraternity, since declaration of operators averages 15 to 20 per cent of their actual connectivity. The letter forces operators to come out with the real figures and not doing so will be a cognisable offence, liable to prosecution and even imprisonment. The letter also makes it clear that the matter be treated as urgent.																								Cable operators are required to pay eight per cent of their collection from subscribers as service tax to the government of India through the excise commission. 																								Under-declaration not only hurts broadcasters, but also the government coffers, said an operator of north Calcutta, and the government seems to be waking up to that now.

 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Fast threat by doctors in assault wake 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Junior doctors of Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital have threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike from Thursday if the culprits responsible for Tuesdays attack on them were not arrested.																								Later on Wednesday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stepped in and ordered strict action against the guilty.																								On Tuesday, more than seven doctors were assaulted by Group-D staff members, backed by SFI supporters. The doctors had allegedly been targeted for protesting a sleaze racket run by a section of the Group D staff and some outsiders.																								The assaulted doctors set the hospital authorities a deadline  2.30 pm on Thursday  after submitting a memorandum to the superintendent and principal of the college, at around 6 pm on Wednesday.																								Superintendent Basanta Khan promised his best efforts to sort out the matter and asked the doctors for more time.																								Healthcare at the hospital was, however, not affected by the fracas, as junior doctors attended to patients in various wards of the hospital on Wednesday. 																								The problem has not been resolved, and matters can flare up again, said Khan. We are doing our best to ensure the safety of all our interns and house-staff members.																								At Writers Buildings, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the culprits involved in the incident would be arrested immediately. He added that he has even intervened at a political level to see that the matter does not snowball.																								Earlier in the day, a number of Trinamul Congress leaders, including Ajit Panja and Pankaj Banerjee, met home secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers, after they visited NRS. Panja said he had handed over the names of those mentioned in the FIR to Deb, informing him about the beating up and detention of 15 interns and house-staff members in the boys hostel on Tuesday night. 																								Policemen on the NRS campus confirmed that the trouble had erupted in the mens hostel at night, after which security was beefed up.																								On Wednesday morning, more than 150 interns and house-staff members assembled under the Indian Medical Association (IMA) banner in front of the superintendents office, joining the 250 doctors already there since the previous evening, wearing black badges to protest the spate of unruly incidents.																								Late in the evening, the IMA members emerged from the superintendents office and said they had demanded the immediate release and re-allocation of all those who had been detained in the SFI-dominated hostel and the arrest of the culprits.

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Having failed to generate funds for repair and maintenance of old buses, the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has decided to involve private entrepreneurs in running its fleet.																								It has hit upon two schemes. A private entrepreneur, according to one scheme, can display advertisements on a state bus. In return, he will have to look after the non-mechanical aspect of maintenance, such as cleaning the vehicle. Plus, he will have to pay the CSTC Rs 300 a month. 																								Under the second scheme, the CSTC will lease out buses to private entrepreneurs, who will be responsible for repairs and maintenance. An entrepreneur will make a bus roadworthy and then ply it on any route. In return, he will have to pay the CSTC 10 per cent of the daily ticket sales.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said there was no harm if state buses were maintained with the help of private partners and plied in larger numbers. Involving private entrepreneurs in plying state buses does not mean privatisation of state transport. It can be called Private Public Partnership (PPP), he said.																								What else could we have done? Since we dont have funds for the upkeep of state buses, weve to rope in private partners, said Debabrata Kundu, financial adviser and chief accounts officer, CSTC.																								We are getting offers from private entrepreneurs whore willing to take over old state buses and ply them after necessary repairs. A number of state buses have been dumped because we could not repair them for want of funds. If private partners come forward to take care of these buses, whats the harm? he said.																								The CSTC, officials said, owns 1,180 buses, of which 450 need immediate and thorough repair. We are plying a few buses after minor repairs, but the vehicles will have to be grounded again if overhauling is not done shortly. We need at least Rs 7 crore for thorough repair. We used to get Rs 10 crore a year for fleet repair and maintenance, but the allotment was cancelled two years ago, an official said.																								The CSTC hopes to raise at least Rs 40 lakh a year by letting out buses as advertisement vehicles.

 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 NGO ruffles feathers of hospital union 
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government may be trying hard to end union control over state-run hospitals, but the CPM-backed coordination committee has struck again  this time at Medical College and Hospital (MCH), Calcutta. 																								The union top brass is up in arms against Swajan, a voluntary organisation working in the hospital, counselling those coming to the outpatients department (OPD) and their families, and launching an anti-tout drive.																								Last Saturday, union musclemen had a scuffle with members of Swajan, forcing them out of the OPDs. On Monday morning, a section of employees, backed by the coordination committee, forced members of the organisation out of all the OPDs and allowed them to sit only at the medicine outdoor section.																								There was a scuffle on Saturday, admitted Rabindra Nath Chatterjee, MCH superintendent. But we hope things will be sorted out soon, he added. 																								However, it looks unlikely that the war is on the wane. The organisation does not have any government order to work in the hospital. We will submit a deputation to the hospital authorities against this NGO, said a coordination committee spokesperson. 																								Swajan had submitted a proposal to the MCH three months ago, offering counsel to patients at various outdoor departments. 																								We liked the proposal and forwarded it to the state health department. Now, they are on a six-month training period, said principal Jayashree Mitra. She added that there was no need for them to seek any government permission.																								The organisation mainly coordinates between doctors and patients, she explained. A large number of patients and their relatives feel lost when they enter the big campus. After the doctor recommends some tests, members of the organisation help patients locate the department, Mitra added.																								Presently, around 10 members of Swajan provide counsel at some of the OPDs. However, hospital sources said, the organisation members, since the past two months that they have started work here, have been able to break the nexus between the touts and some members of the coordination committee. 																								They have also reported the corrupt practices adopted by a section of the employees, an MCH official said. 																								The employees, in turn, accused the Swajan members of interference. They have been provided with chairs and tables but a regular employee has to wait for these. This is disgusting, an MCH employee alleged. 																								One Swajan member said his colleagues were rudely asked to leave the ENT outdoor wing. They asked us who we were to provide counsel, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 On LPG, the rides smooth yet bumpy
 JAYANTA BASU				 	 Badiruddins LPG auto: Straight drive. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Badiruddin Haldar sticks to the straight and narrow nowadays. Having switched to the eco-friendly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the auto-driver has left his traffic-weaving days behind. Badiruddin, after all, is still getting used to a cylinder tucked away under his seat.																								The state transport department had passed an order about a year ago, making the switch mandatory for all autos to get registration. Now, West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) figures reveal that around 230 autos  mostly new, some old  are plying the roads fuelled by LPG.																								One of them is WB-04C 2510  proudly proclaiming RE (rear engine) LPG  that set out from the bustling Jadavpur 8B bus-stand and headed for the Rabindra Sarobar Metro station three km away. Driving gingerly through the traffic, Badiruddin confessed to being more careful since he changed over three months ago. I dont allow passengers to smoke either, he said, pointing to the no cigarette smoking, LPG auto sign on the back of his seat.																								This caution is little price to pay for the increased margins, of Rs 100 a day, he is now taking home from four LPG autos he has purchased in the past few months. The fuel is about 40 per cent cheaper and the mileage is competitive. Maintenance costs are also not much and you dont have to bother about a pollution test, he smiled.																								But that goes hand in hand with the primary no-fuel fear. I just heard there would be no supply of LPG for the couple of days, he fretted. Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary, PCB, admitted that irregular supply of LPG might cause some problems.																								If supply is sporadic, pumps are few. There are only four functioning LPG outlets in the city  one in south Calcutta and the rest up north. While another six are ready with dispensers, the petroleum companies are yet to start supply.																								Fresh supplies normally come once a week, but it is inconsistent, confirmed employees at the Prince LPG filling station, on Prince Anwar Shah Road. With this pump as epicentre, most autos shuttle in the Behala, Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Gol Park, Hazra and Garia for easy access to LPG, explained Yash Khare of Euro II Services, distributor of LPG kits from Italy-based Lovato.																								But safety concerns  that have prompted Badiruddin to mend his winding ways  are all in the mind, said Khare. The technology used prevents explosion of the cylinders in case of an accident.																								In north Calcutta, the LPG autos cover Shyambazar, Kankurgachhi and Dunlop. These vehicles are expected to release nearly 40 per cent less nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons than petrol or diesel vehicles, observed Siddhartha Dutta of Jadavpur University. 																								With a total of 35,000 autos  legal and illegal  on the streets, theres a distance to go before the air starts clearing.

 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Trade feelers, spring rolls Trade talk amp; jasmine tea
 															- Market-study team ends day with mall crawl, home food A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Members of the Chinese delegation from Yunnan tuck into a slice of home food on Friday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Business by day, pleasure by night. After focused bouts of trade talks with the chief minister, government officials and captains of industry, it was time for the Chinese team to unwind. If shopping for music and meditation CDs among sundry other items at Forum provided the right aperitif, late evening was spent on familiar taste-bud terrain, with a fine-dining spread at Mainland China.																								Forty-three among the 76-member Chinese delegation from Yunnan, in town to attend the India-China Business Conclave hosted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), chose to pay a visit to the Elgin Road lifestyle mall before heading for the popular Oriental eatery on Gurusaday Road, for a slice of home food.																								At Mainland China, the focus was on perennial favourites, with a blend of Hunan and Canton. Chicken spring rolls, prawn Siumai, crackling spinach and tofu Hunan kicked off the meal, followed by chicken coriander soup.																								The main course for the special guests comprised steamed crab claw in exotic wine sauce, fish Chachoy, woodear mushroom, Sapo chicken, Mapo tofu, pan-fried vegetables, vegetable hakka noodles, steamed rice and egg-wrapped fried rice, while jasmine team flowed like water.																								The Sapo chicken, Mapo tofu and pan-fried Chinese greens were smash hits and they kept asking for more. Egg-wrapped fried rice, too, was a winner, and it was a huge honour for us when they bowed in unison in appreciation of the evenings fare, smiled the restaurants senior manager Debashish Ghosh.																								Earlier, at Forum, it was some real-time market research, as members of the trade delegation were seen sniffing exotic knick-knacks, like pot pourries and incense sticks.																								We are primarily here to study the market, smiled Chen Min. And a real shopping spree didnt make too much sense in the first place, considering Min and his associates found a lot of overlap between products, brands and even prices.																								Still, the true shopaholics in the group couldnt help stocking up an odd item or two  that included everything from leather bags to home linen. Audio CDs on yoga and meditation from MusicWorld were a hit.																								Saturday has more shopping and sight-seeing in store for the delegation in town to promote trade and people-to-people ties. 																								Apart from a visit to the Victoria Memorial and the Indian Museum, a drive through Vidyasagar Setu and the riverfront and a stopover at China Town are on the cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Dither over leader arrest
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 CONSTABLE COURAGE: Partha Banerjee proceeds for duty from the Jorabagan Traffic Guard on Thursday morning. He has complained of being heckled by former MLA Sanjay Bakshi and his henchmen. Picture by Amit Datta																								Sanjay Bakshi has not been traced or touched even 48 hours after he allegedly abused and assaulted a constable for doing his duty  hauling up the Trinamul Congress leaders vehicle for jumping traffic lights.																								If confusion (bail or no bail) was the byword from the cop corridors on Wednesday, the noise emerging from the law-keepers lair on Thursday may have sounded more convincing, but proved far from threatening.																								The Calcutta Police brass claimed on Thursday that Bakshi would be arrested for physically assaulting an on-duty traffic police constable  provided they could accomplish the mammoth task of tracking him down.																								We will definitely arrest him, but he is absconding, claimed deputy commissioner of police (central division) Rajiv Kumar. We had kept a watch on his residence from 1 pm to 11.30 pm on Wednesday but he had not returned home. We did not go and pick him up in the middle of the night as its not a crime that demands a midnight raid, he added.																								Metro spoke to the absconding Bakshi at his Girish Park residence on Thursday evening. I am certainly not absconding. You can find out for yourself that right now I am at home. Let the police come and arrest me if they so wish, said the ex-MLA, preparing to leave for a Subrata Mukherjee campaign meeting.																								I am being framed and punished because I am a Trinamul Congress worker. The police are politically biased and are out to malign my name. They are contradicting their own statements first they said I was travelling in a black Qualis and then changed it to a Santro, alleged Bakshi.																								On Tuesday afternoon, former MLA Bakshis car had jumped a traffic signal at the busy Chittaranjan Avenue-Girish Park crossing. He was pulled up by Partha Banerjee.																								 The 50-year-old constable of the Jorabagan Traffic Guard asked Bakshis driver to produce his papers, only to be heckled by Bakshi and his henchmen, according to the complaint lodged by Banerjee with his superiors.																								Thursday found Banerjee back in action at yet another critical intersection in north Calcutta, but there was no sign of police action against the man who had allegedly abused and even slapped him two days ago and the following day organised a roadblock on the same spot to protest his persecution.																								DC Kumar, though, promised that no one would be spared, irrespective of political leanings or pressures. We have failed to locate him since the incident took place. I had heard that he would be surrendering in court on Thursday, but if he does not do so, we will have to go ahead and arrest him on Friday, he said.																								Bakshi called the cops bluff: I have not done anything that would prompt me to surrender in court and it is rather surprising that police are saying they cant find me.

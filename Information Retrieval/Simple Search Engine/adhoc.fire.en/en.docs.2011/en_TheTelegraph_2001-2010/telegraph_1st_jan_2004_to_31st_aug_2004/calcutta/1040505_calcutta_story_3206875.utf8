The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Daughter returns for relics 47 yrs on
 NISHA LAHIRI																								He was born and brought up in Calcutta. She was born in Baghdad and came to the city as a toddler. They met, fell in love and married, only for him to die young, when she was only 27.																								Forty-seven years to the day he died, one of Elijah David Daniels daughters will be at the Jewish cemetery on Narkeldanga Main Road to take her fathers remains back to Israel, so her 74-year-old mother can have her wish of being buried next to her husband.																								Elizabeth Yirimiyahus father was a foreman in the Gun and Shell Factory, when he died on May 5, 1957, leaving her mother to bring up five children, the youngest only six months old. In 1970, the entire family moved to Rehovot, in Israel, to start a new life. Elizabeth was 15.																								On May 5, 2004, Elijah David Daniels remains will be dug up from the 45, Narkeldanga Main Road cemetery. So that he can be buried once again in a plot where the family now lives in Israel, so that my mother can be placed next to him when its her turn, Elizabeth told Metro on Tuesday.																								The retrieval process had begun five years ago, only to be stalled when her only brother, Isaac, died. He, too, had wanted our father to be buried in Israel, recalls Elizabeth, who has been in Calcutta since April, for the first time in 34 years. I dont remember my father much, but we all want this to happen.																								A year ago, she dashed off a letter to the Indian embassy in Israel, requesting permission, which was forwarded to the Israeli embassy in Delhi, and then to the consulate in Calcutta. After a series of letters seeking permission from the ministry of external affairs, the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the roadblocks were removed, said an official from the Calcutta consulate.																								My sister Lily was supposed to come, too, but she is undergoing treatment for breast cancer, sighs Elizabeth. My husband David is here with me.																								Together, they visited her former home at 81, Metcalfe Street, the Jewish Girls School, where she was a student, Bethel synagogue (where her father used to pray), Maghen David synagogue and even her favourite old haunt as a teenager  Nahoums.																								On Wednesday morning, a familys journey will end with Elijah David Daniels remains being dug up, placed in a wooden box and taken back home. 																								Everyones so excited, that they will be at the airport when we arrive at 3.30 am on May 11, she laughs.

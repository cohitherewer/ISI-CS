 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Ray, Dutt cast tailor bags heritage honour
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY				 	 The shop that dressed celebrities. Picture by Aranya Sen																								A small tailoring shop in Esplanade has shot into the limelight. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to bestow on it a heritage tag, because it has dressed some actors in the films of Satyajit Ray and Utpal Dutt.																								Sumon Tailors and Company, which also sells dress material, has clothed the characters of Rays Hirak Rajar Deshey and Shatranj ke Khiladi, as also the cast of Dutts Jhar, Baisakhi Megh, Kallol and Angaar. The costumes were all tailored by Harun-al-Rashid.																								Measuring less than 200 sq ft, the shop at 45, Moti Sil Street, off the SN Banerjee Road intersection, has little to offer to customers by way of comfort. In fact, there arent even any pictures on the walls of the celebrities who once frequented its interiors. 																								Well have to think of a special status for the establishment, since it is hardly 50 years old and heritage rules do not permit anything less than 100 years old to qualify for consideration, saidmayor Mukherjee. Honour for the shop will be the civic authorities homage to Satyajit Ray and Utpal Dutt, he added. 																								The maestros son, Sandip Ray, a film-maker in his own right, welcomed the mayors decision. The shop has tailored costumes for so many of my fathers films that it is difficult for me to single out the best. It deserves the recognition, he said.																								Earlier, the shop used to be located on Wellesley Street (now renamed Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road), Sandip Ray pointed out. 																								Actress Sova Sen recalled: Harun-al-Rashid was really a master craftsman in recreating western outfits and police uniforms of the Raj days. The recognition is fully warranted.																								Abdur Rashid, who took over the reins after father Haruns death in 1993, remembers the days when Ray would come in the afternoon to instruct Rashid senior on the designs of the costumes he wanted. 																								He always helped us with colourful sketches of the costumes, specifying the exact details in the design, recalled Abdur. 																								Most of the designs were so unusual that his father had to hire senior master-tailors to satisfy the whims of the maestro. He was fastidious. I still remember we had to work three times over for the costumes in Hirak Rajar Deshe. He was a good paymaster, though, Abdur added.																								Producers would pay the bills for Utpalbabu and I remember two or three occasions when he had deferred shooting to pressure the producer to square up our dues, Abdur pointed out. 																								For Utpalbabu, we had to work harder. He would specify the period of the costumes he wanted, and left the research to us. Wed have to rush to Victoria Memorial or the museum for an idea, he said. 																								The shop maintains an antique charm in its prices, too. The charge for stitching a shirt: Rs 65. A pair of trousers is tailored for Rs 125.

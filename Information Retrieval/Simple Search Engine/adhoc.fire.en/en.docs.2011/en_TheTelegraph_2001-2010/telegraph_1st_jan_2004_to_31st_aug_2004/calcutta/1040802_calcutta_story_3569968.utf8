 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Power tariff arrears order
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Nearly 1.8 million domestic consumers in Calcutta, Howrah and the adjoining areas will have to pay a raised power tariff from August. The arrears for the past four years, however, will be spread over 60 instalments (five years) instead of the 24 announced earlier. 																								The revised tariff was ordered by the the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission  the sole authority to fix power tariff  two months ago. It had asked the CESC to recover the arrears in 24 instalments.																								CESC sources said in a fresh order last week, the commission asked the power utility to recover the arrears in 60 instalments. So, 1.8 million domestic consumers will have to pay their arrears for the past four years in 60 instalments for five years from this month, an official said.																								The government recently used its special powers under the Electricity Act, 2003, and asked the commission to stagger the arrear payment. 																								When the commission revised tariff in the CESC-supplied areas two months ago, it hiked rates for small consumers but provided substantial relief to bulk consumers. The government reacted sharply, saying that the poor would be affected by the revised rates. Power minister Mrinal Banerjee had suggested that the arrears be recovered over a prolonged period.

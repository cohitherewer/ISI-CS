The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Hospital assault over illicit activity
 A STAFF REPORTERAt least seven junior doctors were assaulted on the Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital campus by armed goons for protesting against an alleged sleaze racket being run by a section of group-D staff members, in collusion with outsiders .																								The attackers, allegedly under the patronage of the local SFI unit in the hospital, stormed principal Purnima Shau Mondols office, and singled out a few house-staff members and started raining blows on them for daring to take up the issue with the college authorities.																								Around 250 doctors, declaring an indefinite ceasework, gheraoed the hospital superintendents office from 7 pm, demanding immediate action against the culprits.																								Tuesdays fracas can be traced back to last week, when some of the doctors spotted Sasthi, an associate of a group-D staff member, sneaking into a mens hostel at night, accompanied by a few women.																								We immediately lodged a complaint with the college authorities and Sasthi was evicted. Before he left, he warned us that he knew some SFI leaders and would be back to take revenge, recounted a doctor on Tuesday.																								Metro had recently reported how alcohol was being supplied freely to hostel inmates and outsiders inside the mess area that Sasthi had sneaked into.																								The authorities, at the behest of C.R. Maiti, director of medical education, had then ordered a joint police-hospital probe and the free flow of liquor sales had been checked for a while.																								Flashpoint was reached on Monday evening, when a few junior doctors who had gone to the mess for dinner were challenged by an SFI leader and his accomplices for daring to ask for a change in the menu at the canteen. A heated exchange led to a scuffle between the rival members and trouble continued till late into the night.																								On Tuesday afternoon, college principal Shau Mondol summoned both sections for a meeting. It was precisely then that a mob of 50-odd stormed the principals room, bolted the door and started beating up the doctors. The doctors were finally rescued by a police team.																								Both Writers Buildings and Swasthya Bhavan were informed about the incident. C.R. Maiti has asked the college authorities to submit a detailed probe report. We are investigating the case, said the director of medical education.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Animal haven evolves into campus address
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Students on a trip to Ashari meet a camel that was brought down from Rajasthan for a Durga puja pandal and later abandoned by the organisers. A Telegraph picture																								Recognising its potential as a new resource consortium to connect animal scientists, veterinarians and other components of animal healthcare and animal resource management, the West Bengal University of Animal amp; Fishery Sciences (WBUAFS) has made Ashari, the animal shelter-hospital off the Bypass, an internship address for its degree students.																								Its not possible for us to provide all the infrastructure the students need to hone their skills on the campus itself and we have to depend on other centres to complement our set-up. We are quite happy with the facilities at Ashari, which becomes an important venue for our interns from this year, quot; says N.R. Pradhan, in charge of the universitys internship programme. The hospital, at Kalikapur, on the citys south-eastern fringes, is run by animal welfare NGO People for Animals (PFA).																								The degree course of study in veterinary sciences  BVSc amp; AH (Bachelor of Veterinary Sciences amp; Animal Husbandry) is regulated by the Veterinary Council of India. The course is spread over five academic years, including compulsory internship of six months undertaken after successful completion of all credit hours provided in the syllabus.																								The council stipulates that during the course of the study, there shall be training in a teaching veterinary hospital  livestock (including birds) farm  and field training in a veterinary institution. But the university, the second oldest of its kind in India (the original Bengal Veterinary College was established in 1893), is scarcely equipped to take up adequately the applied and practical aspects of the science, feel experts.																								P.K. Samanta, former head of the department, veterinary surgery amp; radiology, WBUAFS, puts the situation in perspective: The university teaching hospital at Belgachhia, or for that matter none of the 14 other centres chosen for internship training, has proper infrastructure like emergency, in-patient department, diagnostics, etc. The university authorities are fully conscious of their inability to create minimum facilities at Belgachhia or elsewhere, and are making all sorts of compromise at the cost of education standards.																								Dean B.B. Ghosh feels the internship tie-up with the multi-functional Ashari will benefit the students of the university, which was set up with the objective of imparting education through the three faculties  veterinary and animal sciences, dairy technology and fishery sciences.																								Veterinarians in advanced countries choose their profession because they are animal-lovers. In India, however, hardly any veterinarian has any real love for the patients. To them, animals are just instruments of their profession. We hope by interacting with these bright youngsters (the interns), we may be able to develop their innate sensitivity, observes PFA trustee Purnima Toolsidass.																								The NGOs managing trustee Debasis Chakrabarti feels animal welfare is a concept, not only from the ethical point of view, but also from the viewpoint of optimising animal resources, and their long-term, judicious and positive exploitation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Alyson Hannigan, actress. Superiors and people of high rank will bail you out. Financial bumps ahead, but you have the knack of making both ends meet quite comfortably. You are lucky in speculation. Take guard on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. A spendthrift by nature, you never repent a splurge.  Kusum Bhandari

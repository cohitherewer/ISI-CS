 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 DNA tests for inmate
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After a gap of two years, Howrah police on Wednesday collected samples for DNA tests of a deaf- mute inmate of Liluah Home for Destitute Women, her baby and an employee of the home, believed to be its biological father. The samples have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.																								Two years ago, the inmate was found pregnant and shifted to Sukanya, a home in Salt Lake, as the Liluah centre authorities did not want the accused employee to hamper investigations. Initially, the police were in a spot because the victim could neither speak nor hear the questions put to her. Later, experts helped her reveal that home employee Subrata Panth had fathered her baby. Panth had free access to the inmates cells.

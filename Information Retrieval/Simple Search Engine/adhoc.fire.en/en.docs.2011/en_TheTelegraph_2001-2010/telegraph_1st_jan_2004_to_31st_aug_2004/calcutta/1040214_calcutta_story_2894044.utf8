 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Hospital getaway as guards keep vigil
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For a week, he lay writhing in pain on his hospital bed, convincing the guards that he was in no shape to attempt a getaway. Early on Friday, he picked his moment, got out of bed, walked past the dozing sentinels and out of hospital, leaving a clutch of cops looking quite silly.																								Two Reserve Force constables, Akshay Dhar and Jogendra Kumar Raut Roy, were suspended on Friday after a criminal they were guarding gave them the slip at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.																								Shahnawaz Alam, 22, was arrested on January 12, when a routine patrol from Muchipara police station spotted a group of youths and gave chase. The rest of the gang escaped, but Alam tried to hurl a bomb at the police vehicle, only for it to explode in his hand.																								Alam was picked up and admitted to the casualty block of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. Hospital staff said he had suffered severe burn injuries and had even lost a few fingers on his right hand.																								At around 5 am on Friday, the two Reserve Force constables posted on guard outside Alams ward noticed that the bed (no. 192) he had been occupying for over a month, was empty. There was no sign of Alam. With both arms bandaged, he had simply walked out of the second-floor ward, leaving around eight police personnel in his wake.																								Hospital staff later said Alam had been writhing in pain for the past week and not leaving his bed at all. After his Friday morning getaway, it was apparent that last weeks show of pain was a pre-planned performance to set up his slip-out.																								Even if we assume that he was able to walk out, a man leaving a hospital ward with both arms bandaged must be an unusual sight. It is surprising that no one seems to have noticed Alam leaving the hospital premises, said a guard posted at the hospital outpost on College Street.																								Apart from the two constables posted outside the ward gate, there were six other personnel from Muchipara police station on duty at the hospital when Alam escaped. Two of them were posted outside the casualty ward main entrance on the ground floor and another four deployed at the outpost outside the hospital entrance on College Street.																								Calcutta Medical College and Hospital principal Jayshree Mitra said: A criminal walked out of the hospital right under the noses of eight police personnel. This only goes to show the negligence on the part of the police. We are, however, carrying out an inquiry about the conduct of our own hospital guards.

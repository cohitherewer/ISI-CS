 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Three HS scripts go missing from venue
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The mathematics answer-scripts of three Higher Secondary (HS) examinees  all students of St Lawrence School  disappeared mysteriously from an examination venue at Tiljala on Monday, sparking tension and prompting a probe.																								The three students, along with 17 others who appeared for the exams at Tiljala High School, were detained at the centre for several hours after the mathematics Paper II had ended.																								Authorities of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education said the scripts could not be traced till late on Monday. A missing complaint was lodged with Tiljala police station by the school authorities.																								Council secretary Dibyendu Chakraborty said an in-depth investigation would be conducted.																								Around 5.05 pm on Monday, within five minutes of the examination ending, invigilators at Tiljala High School found three answer-scripts missing.																								The three examinees whose papers could not be traced had been the first to submit their papers. The invigilators detained the trio for questioning and alerted the police, as well as officials of the HS council.																								The students were allowed to leave at night, with police and council officials failing to make much headway.																								We are shocked at the manner in which three scripts disappeared from the exam hall in our school. Such an incident has never happened here before, said Prabir Shankar Sengupta, Tiljala High School headmaster.																								According to sources in the school, the three answer-scripts were detected missing when the invigilators were busy collecting the scripts after the examination ended at 5 pm.																								Just 10 minutes before the mathematics Paper II was to give over, two candidates submitted their papers and walked out of the examination hall. After another five minutes, the third candidate submitted his papers, said an official in the council.																								While the invigilator was collecting the scripts from the other examinees, the answer-scripts submitted by the first three were apparently still lying on his table.																								It was only when he came back to the table with the other scripts that he found the first three missing. A final count of the scripts confirmed this, said Sengupta.																								Father Thottam, vice-principal, St Lawrence School, on Ballygunge Circular Road, was also called to the examination centre. 																								The answer-scripts of three of our students who were writing the papers at Tiljala High School are missing, he confirmed.

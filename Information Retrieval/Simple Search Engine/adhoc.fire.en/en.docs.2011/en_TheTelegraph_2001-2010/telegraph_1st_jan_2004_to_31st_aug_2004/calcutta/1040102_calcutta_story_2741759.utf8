The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Carrot and stick for two-wheeler tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Less than a week away from the deadline, about 70 per cent of the two-wheeler owners in the city are yet to cough up the lifetime tax on their vehicles.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, however, made it clear on Thursday that penal action would be taken against those who will miss the January 7 deadline. The rap would start with a doubling of the tax due and end with the vehicle being impounded.																								To facilitate the payment of the 15-year tax within the stipulated date, the public vehicles department (PVD) has decided to keep its office open on Saturday and Sunday. A special counter has also been opened.																								But given the pay-up trend till New Years Day, transport department officials felt that no more than 50 per cent of two-wheeler owners would manage to meet the tax deadline.																								PVD officials said nearly 1.3 lakh two-wheelers ply in the city, of which only 40,000 owners have paid their tax. The response is definitely poor, even though we had not expected all owners to pay taxes within the due date. But we do hope that more than half of those who have not paid yet, will do so by next Wednesday, said PVD director H. Mohan.																								He added that the PVD would wait for a couple of months to allow two-wheeler owners to pay the tax, plus the penalty. If the tax is not paid even after that, then we will have to seize the vehicles, Mohan warned.																								Minister Chakraborty claimed on Tuesday that there was a tendency among a section of citizens to evade taxes.																								Some vehicle-owners demand good roads, flyovers and illumination but hate to pay taxes that allow the government to provide such facilities. I have already made an appeal to two-wheeler owners to pay the lifetime tax. Those who havent yet, have six more days. I appeal to them to pay the tax or keep their two-wheelers parked at home, said Chakraborty.																								The government had slapped the 15-year tax on all kinds of two-wheelers in September 2003. For new two-wheelers, the tax would be charged at the time of registration, while the existing ones would have to pay up by December 31. The threat of doubling the tax amount post-deadline was also sounded.																								The transport department extended the deadline by seven days after Calcutta High Court allowed five petitioners an additional week to pay the lifetime tax on their two-wheelers.																								The Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI), meanwhile, has pledged not to give in without a fight. Spokesperson Tapan Debnath said the AAEI would oppose the lifetime tax for two-wheelers and the five-year tax for cars. We are waiting for the court verdict on January 7 before announcing our next course of action, he said.

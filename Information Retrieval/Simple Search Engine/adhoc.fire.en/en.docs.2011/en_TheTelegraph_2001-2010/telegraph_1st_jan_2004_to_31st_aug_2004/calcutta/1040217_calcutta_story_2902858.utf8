The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004  Realty bites  AN EYE ON CALCUTTA  / DOLLY ROY Things are happening; even in a city that, following Arthur D. Littles celebrated prescription for change, won the description Calcutta changes little by little. That was nearly a decade ago. Suddenly, everything is happening at breathtaking pace for the somnolent city and its easy-paced way of life. Trees are being cut remorselessly, the skyline is assuming an entirely different dimension; the banks are opening up their coffers to anyone wanting to own one of those dream houses coming up in what is being called the real estate supermarket of Calcutta  very few questions asked; cell phone companies come running to you with cheaper and cheaper connections and instruments; roads, alas, continue to surpass themselves with deeper and deadlier craters. And of course, Ganguram yields place to Haldiram. 																																																				Everything is neatly packaged  buy a home and get a school, launderette, dispensary, departmental store, parking space, swimming pool and gym all packed into one. After all, the 20th century marketing mantra of the West was in its packaging and 21st century Calcutta  once chance directed, chance erected  is having the middle-class dream served to it on a silver platter, or having it shoved down its throat, depending on how you look at it. 																																																				Whether its the hitherto downmarket Behala (now glamourised with the ascendancy of Sourav Ganguly) and the high-rises along James Long Sarani, the once-remote Ultadanga, the almost-unaffordable Alipore, the distant Moore Avenue, the Eastern Bypass and the rest of suburbia  everything is being networked by the realtor connection.  While all this has bypassed the  poorer section of society, not only the home, but entertainment  has also assumed fancy proportions. The biggest thing to  happen in recent times is INOX, which, thanks to its screening  of Bengali films is attracting families from even North  Calcutta. Escalator rides, a whiff of Singapore shopping,  the choicest of foods and of course, sweets and chocolates  make up the day at Forum while the Westside complex now  promises, apart from shopping, the Shisha Bar (a hookah  joint) adjacent to the popular multi-cuisine restaurant  Grain of Salt. 																																																				The spurt in eating out has led to eateries springing up in practically every corner of the city while for those who still like to cook at home, there is the inviting new Food Court at Alipore, Greenwoods at Mandeville Gardens while Wot Not at Ballygunge and a host of tiny departmental stores continue to find favour in many a neighbourhood. 																																																				Medical treatment is also becoming big business. The state-run hospitals are pictures of chaos, confusion, squalor and neglect but on the bright side, newer hospitals are coming up in and around the E.M. Bypass, which already had Peerless, Ruby and the Rabindranath Tagore Heart Hospital. The latest to open its portals are Suraksha and Apollo, with its state-of-the-art facilities. It seems that the epicentre of medicare for the well-heeled is shifting from Alipore (Woodlands, CMRI, Kothari and B.M. Birla) eastwards in an effort to boost what is known as medical tourism since more private hospitals are on the cards. Sadly enough, there are no proposals for a new government hospital. 		 Medical treatment is becoming big business  and the epicentre of medicare for the well-heeled is  shifting from Alipore eastwards with such hospitals  as  Apollo Gleneagles coming up on the EM Bypass Picture  by Rashbehari DasThe world around me is also changing fast. Since I came to live in the area more than 20 years ago, Prince Anwar Shah Road has been my major exit route for travelling to office, to the Tollygunge Club and to my shop in Dakshinapan. There used to be a number of slums on the Tollygunge side, the biggest being Borobagan, apart from which, the only places of note were the Navina Cinema and my favourite Chinese restaurant Dim Sum opposite the Tipu Sultan Mosque. On the Dhakuria side, there was the huge Jay Engineering works manufacturing Usha sewing machines and the multi- storeyed CSIR Housing Complex.  All that has been changing in  the last few years; first the Usha factory closed down and  now four new apartment complexes have come up beside and  in front of the Navina Cinema, complete with swimming pools  and health clubs. Now, the biggest apartment complex, the  South City project, will come up where the Usha factory  was. According to advertisements, the project boasts of  four 35-storey towers, the biggest swimming pool in India,  a park larger than Eden Gardens and the largest shopping  mall. Who will be able to afford the flats, priced upwards  of Rs 25 lakhs, is a matter of speculation. 																																																				Economists and politicians may argue that the closing down of factories and the coming up of high-rise apartment blocks in their place is not good for the economy; that such apartments will constitute an island of wealth in an otherwise lower-middle-class area but what foxes me is the preference of realtors for Prince Anwar Shah Road  it is possibly to do with the expected improved connectivity of the road, the much-awaited Lake Gardens flyover and the EM Bypass connector to be completed in the next three months. 																																																				Soon Anwar Shah Road will become the major conduit to the EM Bypass from south Calcutta and developers are possibly taking advantage of the infrastructure developed by the government for their profit. Development and change in these days of market economy are profit-driven  one can only hope that some of the benefits trickle down to the lower rungs of society.

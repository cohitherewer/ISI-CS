 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Cop scan on girls death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police on Thursday started a probe into the death of Indrani Ukil, 13, who had disappeared with two classmates from their Regent Park school on Saturday. Her body was found by the tracks near Canning station on Wednesday night. 																								We believe she had been run over by a train. There was a gaping wound in the head, said an officer. Two youths have been detained.																								Indrani, Kanka Biswas and Mausumi Sardar, all students of Ramakrishna Sishu Vihar and residents of Thakurpukur, had sneaked out of school after the morning prayer. They were not present in class during the roll call. Some time later, a local resident told us she had seen the three walk out of school, said teacher Meera Chakraborty. 																								Kanka returned home the same day. She, however, gave conflicting statements to police. She first told us Indrani and Mausumi had married two youths from Karunamoyee and that the couples had gone to Jamtala, in Kultali (South 24-Parganas). Soon after, she came up with another version, a police officer said.																								Mausumi returned home on Wednesday, but failed to disclose Indranis whereabouts. She told police on Thursday that Indrani and Kanka were seeing local youths Biswajit Chakraborty and Suman Purkayat. The boys had joined the girls after they skipped school. While Kanka and Suman returned home from Dhakuria, the rest went to Canning, the officer added.

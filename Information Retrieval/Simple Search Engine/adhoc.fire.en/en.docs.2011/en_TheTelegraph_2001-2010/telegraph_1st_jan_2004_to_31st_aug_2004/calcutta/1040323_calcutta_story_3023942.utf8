 															- ANNUAL VISITORS LOCAL HOME UNDER THREAT				 	 EVICTION BLOCK: A migratory bird family at its Maniktala address. Picture by Amit Datta 																								Hundreds of migratory birds of at least six rare species have had a curious address  a cluster of trees around the Parasnath temple on Raja Dinendra Street, in congested north Calcutta  since 1997. This year, they came perilously close to being rendered homeless.																								The West Bengal Pollution Control Board, however, has moved swiftly to help these feathered friends of Maniktala retain their adopted home, where they breed and be from February to November.																								Recently, Srideswar Shib Samaj Sangha, a charitable organisation, got hold of the premises of an abandoned oil mill and allegedly tried to smoke out the birds and even felled some of the trees that nest them.																								Enter, resident nature lover Abhijit Dutta, who has been fighting for the birds from the very outset. I noticed in early February that some people had started clearing the abandoned oil mill. They initially claimed that the trees would not be cut but then, towards late February, they started chopping down the trees, said Dutta.																								A complaint was lodged with the local police station  which had earlier declared the place a silence zone to safeguard the birds  and then with the public grievance cell of the state pollution control board. Acting on Duttas complaint, a team inspected the area and found trees partly trimmed of leaves.																								The inspection report also remarked that as these migratory birds utilise these trees as their local home, the trees in the concerned premises/area should not be allowed to be cut off (or) trimming of leaves (be allowed).																								On the basis of the boards own findings, senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee directed the secretary of Srideswar Shib Samaj Sangha not to cut any trees or not make any attempt in any manner whatsoever by which migratory birds feel disturbed.																								Referring to the event as  a rare scenario in Calcutta and urging that the same needs to be protected, Mukherjee requested the local Burtola police station to take care of the situation.																								The police station, when contacted by Metro, did not seem to have a clue regarding the development. We dont know anything, came the terse reply from the officer on duty, who refused to be identified.																								The offices of the chief conservator of forests and the police commissioner are also being kept posted about the developments by the pollution control board.																								There have been at least six varieties of birds in the area. Though the black crown night heron is the dominant variety, there have been other varieties as well, like the pond heron, little egret, little cormorant, shag and the cattle egret, observed Shakti Ranjan Banerjee, state director of World Wide Fund for Nature.																								Mithailal Jaiswal, a member of Srideswar Shib Samaj Sangha, who was found supervising the construction work on the premises, told Metro that no trees had been disturbed. He, however, had no idea why no one on the organisations behalf had attended last weeks hearing on the matter at Paribesh Bhavan, Salt Lake.																								These birds have lent a unique dimension to this part of the city and I will do all I can to keep them here, said lone-ranger Dutta, fearing a backlash from the building lobby eyeing the verdant plot.

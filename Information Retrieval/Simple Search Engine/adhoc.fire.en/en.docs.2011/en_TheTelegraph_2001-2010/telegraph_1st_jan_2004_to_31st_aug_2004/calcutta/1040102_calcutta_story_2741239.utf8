 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Perspectives of a musician
																								A n exhibition of paintings by eminent sitarist Kalyani Roy brings into focus the hitherto hidden facets of this musical genius. Inspired by the celebrated litterateur and artist, Subbo Thakur, and her maternal uncle, renowned artist Asit Halder, she initially took to painting as a pastime which soon turned into an enduring passion for the naturally-gifted Roy. Her talent as a painter was first commended at an art exhibition in Japan by Sandeep Tagore, president of the Indo-Japan Cultural Association. She also captured the attention of art connoisseurs at a very early age. The present collection of paintings reflects the varied moods and melodies that have touched the life of this critically acclaimed painter and musician.																								When: Till January 8; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery

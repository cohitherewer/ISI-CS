The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 No parking for your pets Park bar on pets
 															- Mayors clean-up drive debars dogs from 136 green zones DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								It is truly a dogs life for dogs wanting to walk the walk in style on city streets. And Calcuttas pooches have someone to growl at for their imminent morning and evening woes  Mr Mayor, no less.																								Subrata Mukherjee has decided to slam the gates of the city parks on pets. We are not here to serve rich people who use our parks as toilets for their pets. Who will take responsibility to clean parks littered with faeces? demanded the mayor, after the recent monthly civic body meeting.																								The ban was imposed without so much as a bark of dissent. The restriction has been included in the rulebook for management, control and restriction of use of the 136 parks in the city. The rule states: No one shall be permitted to enter the park with dogs or any other pets.																								The cruella act (even Cruella de Vil granted the spotted doggies the fundamental right in 101 Dalmatians) will affect an estimated 10,000 families in the city that own dogs.																								The restriction takes effect next month, but nobody knows how the mayor will prevent strays from entering parks.																								Mukherjee is not the first to take umbrage at dogs relieving themselves in public. 																								Many US cities have a pooper-scooper law, where owners and walkers of pets have to clean up after their animals. Plastic bags are at hand to help animal lovers care for pet and environment.																								But here, one presumes, it is not possible to teach an old dog new tricks.																								Owners are at a loss. Dogs have no space to run around in flats. Unless they are allowed into parks, they will be completely restricted, complained Sushmita Roy of Love-N-Care for Animals, an NGO.																								Where will owners and dogs go? To the pavements? asked Rhett Wynne Peters of New Park Street. Niresh Das of CIT Road, who owns a Daschund and an Alsatian, was equally upset. Animals, too, need exercise, he said.																								By the CMC Act of 1980, a licence is required for all pets. But, claims the mayor, the rule is not adhered to. 																								There are only 550 registered pet dogs out of the estimated 10,000, he stressed. Licences are mandatory for dogs, horses, sheep, goats and hens. The yearly tax is Rs 60.																								Not all park-goers are unhappy at dogs being chased out of public spaces. I used to be a regular visitor to Rabindra Sarobar, but had to stop because of the rush of dogs there, said S. Sinha Roy of the Charu Market area.																								For now, the mans best friend seems to have run out of pals  in the park, at least.

 OUR BUREAU																								Around the same time of the year, in 1997, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education was confronted with allegations similar to what it is having to confront now  charges of a leak in the mathematics paper.																								Board officials trekked up the path of 97 on Monday to fix the route ahead. Even as board president Dibyendu Hota dismissed Mondays turn of events as a conspiracy to malign the state, board officials admitted that they might be faced with mounting evidence of a leak. 																								So, they were planning ahead by going back seven years.																								Officials shared with Metro their findings of the past. Midway into the examinations, the board had been confronted with allegations of leaks of substantial portions of the maths, English and geography papers.																								Initially, the board denied a leak. But a teacher from a school in South 24-Parganas  also secretary of the local committee of the All-Bengal Teachers Association  put paid to all cover-up efforts. He turned up at the boards Park Street office to hand over a question paper to the secretary. The mathematics examination was postponed.																								An employee of the boards confidential section was found guilty of engineering the leak and dismissed from service.

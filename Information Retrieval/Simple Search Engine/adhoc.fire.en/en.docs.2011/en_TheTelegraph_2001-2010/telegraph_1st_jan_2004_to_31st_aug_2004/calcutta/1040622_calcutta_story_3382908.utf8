He began his education in a Corporation school and then moved to a local private school. But when a teacher caned him one day in Class VII for coming in late, he decided never to go back.																									This state-level chess champ was not. After home schooling without tutors  he passed his board exams, joined another school in Class XI and topped the school in the HS exams. Guddu is now a second-year English honours student in college. Although the self-taught chess enthusiast represented Alekhine Chess Club at the state level, he gave it up for his true calling  acting.

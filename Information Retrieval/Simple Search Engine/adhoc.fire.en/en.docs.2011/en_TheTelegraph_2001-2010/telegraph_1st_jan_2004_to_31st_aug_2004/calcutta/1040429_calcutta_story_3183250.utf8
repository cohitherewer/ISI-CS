Pictures by Rashbehari DasHouse-full is the sign that may as well be hanging outside the ITC Sonar Bangla banquets on Wednesday night, because Godrej Renew Hair Colour Cream Sananda Tilottama was clearly the place to be.																								We were inundated with so many requests that it was difficult to keep track, smiled Aparna Sen, editor, Sananda, on the eve of the show.																								From a small endeavour in 1995, the beauty pageant has been growing every year. This year, over a 1,000 entries poured in from young aspirants hoping to tread the path of ex-Tilottamas like Bipasha Basu, Celina Jaitley and Jyoti Brahmin. 																								Earlier the profile of the contestants was mostly local but of late weve not only been receiving applications from other cities but abroad as well, said Aparna. The entries from the US have not been accommodated due to technicalities, but next year, the organisers hope to include international aspirants as well. After all, Sananda is one of the favourite publications of NRI Bengalis.																								The not-just-a-beauty-pageant image is one the Tilottama sorority is eager to reinforce. Like Jyoti Brahmin, reigning Tilottama who is making it big nationally, put it: Tilottama groomed the shy girl in me into a confident woman who can hold her own at any social gathering. The pageant not only helped add weight to my CV and increased my stakes at the Miss India contest, but changed my entire persona. Her views were seconded by ex-Tilottama Kimberline: Tilottama was great fun. In fact, I had heard so much about their grooming regimen that I enrolled just to benefit from it.																								The whole effort, stressed Aparna, is more along the lines of an empowerment programme. 																								Tilottama has come out of the closet of being just a beauty contest when it was called Saradsundari to being a platform for young women for overall personality development, she stressed. 																								Each year we transform a bunch of gawky young girls into poised women ready to take on the world. They go through a gamut of experiences at the hands of our experts, starting from beauty treatment to lessons on dressing and etiquette, which helps them conduct themselves confidently in the contest, as well as sail through the trickiest interviews in life, added Aparna.																								This has helped even the most conservative Bengali banish inhibitions. Earlier, the average Bengali bhadrolok was averse to allowing his daughter to participate in a beauty pageant. But the credibility associated with Sananda has helped the pageant take off in a big way, said the editor of the 18-year-old magazine.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

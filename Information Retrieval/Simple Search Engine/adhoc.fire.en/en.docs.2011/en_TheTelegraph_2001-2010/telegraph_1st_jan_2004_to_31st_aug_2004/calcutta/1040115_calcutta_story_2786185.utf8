The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 15, 2004 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... You seem to have captured  the secret of eternal youth, but try to relax and be more  broad-minded. You have a tendency to restrict yourself in  life. Your serious appearance makes people think you are  stand-offish. You are very sincere in your work, and if  the need arises, can slog round the clock. A year for shouldering  added responsibility.  Kusum Bhandari

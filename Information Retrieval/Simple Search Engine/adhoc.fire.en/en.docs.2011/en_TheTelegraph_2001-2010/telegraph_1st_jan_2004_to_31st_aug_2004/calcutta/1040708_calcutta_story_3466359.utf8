The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Channels, TV sets play cradle-snatch
 A STAFF REPORTER Astroboy: Driving force 																								Kids rule, okay? Not just in coaxing the parents to cough up for the latest video games, toys or bikes. The little ones are big decision-makers on the small screen. Proof of their pester power: entertainment biggies are launching and revamping channels just for them and a second TV set invading cable and satellite (C amp;S) homes.																								Animax, Japans most watched channel across all genres, saw its Calcutta launch on Wednesday, and became the fourth kids channel in our skies after Cartoon Network, Pogo and Nick. Cartoon Network, currently the most popular childrens channel in India, and Pogo belong to the Zee Turner stable, while Animax joins a new-look Nick in One Alliance  the bouquet of Sony and Discovery channels.																								More catch-them-young fare is also lined up in the form of UTVs soon-to-be-launched Hungama, and three channels from Disney slated for later this year.																								All this is to expand the kids channels segment, clearly pegged as C amp;S market driver for the moment. We are expecting a growth of at least 35 to 40 per cent this year, says Shantonu Aditya, president, SET Discovery, bringing the Astroboys and Cyborgs into city homes. In the metros, the number of second television sets is growing rapidly, he explains, and in most cases, the remote of the second set is in the hands of the child.																								With so much on offer, its the Power Puff power that channels and television manufacturers are banking on. The concept of a second television set is fast catching on in Calcutta, says Jiten Chawla of Cams Corner. Almost 35 per cent of our TV sales constitutes a second set and the demand is certainly from the child, though the model is chosen by the adult.																								Prices coming down, easy instalments and combo-offers help the kid cause, so much so that 14-inch sets, once the preferred second set, is not an option any more. Nothing below 21 inches will do, Chawla observes from his Camac Street store.																								There is also a shift, Aditya feels, from the kiddy-kiddy programmes to more mature ones, due largely to the increasing exposure of kids to the Internet, video games and the like. Scooby Doo: Pop watch 																								The market is certainly growing, agrees Zee Turners Sidharth Jain. But there must be content and distribution to drive that, he adds. The first Harry Potter movie, debuting on Pogo in May, was the most-watched programme of that period, beating soaps and sports, he points out.																								Getting the mix right for kids is tough, agree all, as also is selecting the target age-group. Animax is aiming at ages 15-24, a departure from the usual 8-14 years for other children channels.																								The young, too, are learning to enjoy their freedom responsibly. I love cartoons but I watch it only for an hour a day and for two hours on weekends, since I have to study, says Medha Chowdhury, a Class V student and a Pokemon fan.																								More channels also means more competition. Its not just ground events or new content that the channels are relying heavily on, but also complete makeovers, like the one Nick is undergoing, including appointing youth icon Saif Ali Khan as brand ambassador.

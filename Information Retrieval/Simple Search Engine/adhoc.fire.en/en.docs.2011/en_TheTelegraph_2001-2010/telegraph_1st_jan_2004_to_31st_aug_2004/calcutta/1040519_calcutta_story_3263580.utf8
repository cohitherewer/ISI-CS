 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Diarrhoea rampage in Howrah pockets
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Diarrhoea killed four adults and three children, and seriously affected 1,080 others in the past month in different pockets of Howrah, particularly in the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) area. 																								According to HMC officers, the slums of the different wards of the corporation area are the worst hit. Although the HMC supplies drinking water here, it is contaminated by drain water, as the pipes have developed leaks. So, people are forced to drink pond water without using disinfectants. 																								About 300 to 400 people have been admitted to various hospitals of Howrah in a serious condition over the past few weeks, admitted Howrahs deputy mayor Monika Biswas.																								About 100 health workers of the HMC have been sent to the areas worst affected. We are distributing free oral rehydration solution, and Halogen and Metrogyl tablets to residents of these areas. Free health check-up camps have been organised to increase awareness about the disease, Biswas added. The seven HMC wards worst affected are 10, 13,16, 20, 29, 30 and 35. 																								The preliminary cause of the outbreak, it is suspected, is impure drinking water. The people in these wards use pond water, which is highly contaminated, to wash their clothes, clean their utensils, and bathe. They even drink the same water, without using disinfectants, Biswas added. 																								About 100 people died and thousands of others suffered from this disease in 2002, after the HMCs drinking waterpipe sprung a leak and was contaminated by drain water. 																								Residents of the affected areas have become panicky. We dont know what to do because the drinking waterpipes have not been repaired yet and the HMC officials seldom visit the areas to check them, complained Abdul Nabi Haque, a resident of Garpha.

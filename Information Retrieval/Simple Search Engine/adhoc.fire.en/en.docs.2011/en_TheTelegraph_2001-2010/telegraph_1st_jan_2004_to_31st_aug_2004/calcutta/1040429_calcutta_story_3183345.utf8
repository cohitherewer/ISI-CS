The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Murder rage blocks road at peak hour
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The cause: to protest a murder in the locality.																								The victims: the mother of a four-month-old, who had an appointment with a doctor; patients in ambulances; air passengers on their way to catch a flight; daily commuters. Also, some celebrities  filmstars-turned-campaigners Poonam Dhillon and Chunky Pandey, in town to canvas for Trinamul Congress candidate Subrata Mukherjee.																								Peak-hour traffic ground to a halt for more than an hour on Wednesday morning on the one-km Teghoria-Keshtopur stretch of VIP Road, as nearly 500 Trinamul workers, led by Rajarhat MLA Tanmoy Mondal, hit the streets. They were demanding the arrest of the killers of a local trader, shot dead last Saturday.																								The demonstrators refused to budge despite appeals by police. We told them deputy prime minister L.K. Advani was on his way and the road should be cleared immediately. That dispersed them, said an officer. 																								This is a show of protest. I dont care if people cannot reach their destination on time. Suffering is a way of life and one has to accept it, MLA Mondal shouted. 																								Trader-turned-promoter Pradip Roy was shot dead on Saturday at his Baguiati residence, allegedly by CPM-backed goons. The police are not ready to net Roys killers because they are backed by the ruling party, Mondal alleged.																								However, the protest drew flak from the MLAs own partymen. Trinamul leader of the Opposition in the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, Sukhen Chakraborty, said: I am not happy. It was just not necessary.

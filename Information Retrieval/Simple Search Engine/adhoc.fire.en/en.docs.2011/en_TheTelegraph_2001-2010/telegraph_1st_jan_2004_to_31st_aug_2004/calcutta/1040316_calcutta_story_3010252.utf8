The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 16, 2004  Global or local, as they like it An Eye on Calcutta Bary O' Brain Ustad Amjad Ali Khan performing on Saturday at Calcutta Club, the first club to allow Indian members. Picture by Rashbehari DasJaat marlo teen Seney was a 19th Century proverb, meaning Caste divisions have been destroyed by the three Sens. The reference: Keshab Sen, the Brahmo Samaj leader; Wilsons Hotel (now Great Eastern), where rich westernised babus and Indian princes feasted on forbidden food; and the railway station, as strictures of caste could not be adhered to on train journeys.																																																				Over the years, the second culprit lost relevance as most people followed their doctors dictates rather than their priests prohibitions. The other two, however, need to be lauded, as they helped break down many a barrier and cocked a snook at many an undesirable practice.																																																				At the turn of the 20th Century, the saying could well have been altered to read: Jaat marlo Calcutta Club-ey! Heres why: European clubs in the city did not accept Indians as members, not even those of the stature of Sir R.. Mukherjee and Sir Nripendra Narayan, the Maharaja of Cooch Behar. These gentlemen had European friends who too felt strongly about this whites only policy.																																																				So, they solved the problem by setting up their own club  the Calcutta Club  in a rented premises at Elysium Row, with the Maharaja as president and Sir R.. Mukherjee and Sir Darcy Lindsay as the honorary secretaries.																																																				The club later moved to 13 Russell Street, before the current clubhouse was inaugurated on February 13, 1915, by Lord Carmichael, Governor of Bengal. Besides being the first club where people of all communities were welcomed, what set it apart was the norm of electing an Indian and a European president on alternate years.																																																				As I ambled down the stairs of the club, it is fascinating to see the photographs of past presidents that alternated between Rooney and Maharaja of Burdwan, Baker and Basu, Maitland and Singh Roy. Amazing!																																																				The Europeans are long gone  the last European president was more than 30 years ago  but the delightful Ingo-Bongo mix of culture remains. I have visited the club no more than half-a-dozen times, but each time, I have been fascinated by its stoic, though laid back, reverence to hold on to what was good and value what is.																																																				My most recent visit to this historic landmark was on Sunday for The Telegraph Calcutta Club Debate. Once again I was bowled over by its uniqueness  very Bangali bhodroloky, yet a trifle shaeybee! So beautifully have the two been living together, without actually tying the knot, that you cant put your finger on where one ends and the other begins. It does what it does  clings to tradition and sets its own pace  out of choice, not compulsion. This certainly has something to do with its century-old heritage building and classic wooden interiors; but its got more to do with its people! Members of this club, like other mixed  by choice Calcuttans, think in Bengali when they speak in Bengali and in English when they speak in English.																																																				I met three shining  cant get away from that word these days  examples that night of Bengali, bhadro and bada saabs in their professions. Amal Dutta, Pradipta Banerjee and Bhaskar Sen are all active Calcutta Clubbers who believe that tradition and progress could live together. A retired senior police officer, ITCs top finance man and one of the citys leading legal luminaries, Messrs Dutta, Banerjee and Sen, act local when they want to, and global when they need to. Not surprising then that all three have two sons each, some doing well locally, some globally  all shining. Dont tell me it has nothing to do with thinking in the language you speak in and being able to decide which one to think in, when!																																																				Of course, some things have changed at the Calcutta Club. As recently as 50 years ago Mrs Dutta, Banerjee and Sen would have been expected to enter the premises not through the main door but through the tradesmens entrance around the corner. Now, not only do the ladies of Calcutta Club enter through the main door, they make sure that their husbands leave through it too, and sober enough to drive home. In fact, now that chheleyra boro hoey gachhey, they back their husbands up either via silent support or vocal tonic. 																																																				At the debate they were there in all their finery, alternating between silent support and vocal tonic. In fact, in a crowd of 3,000, they outnumbered the men and outdid them for style. The men too, held their own, with one bhadralok commenting in a clipped British accent, That bounder Mahesh kintu bhaat bakey nee!																																																				Without stepping on the toes of all the other clubs, I am convinced Calcutta Club is the most appropriate venue for such an event. I thought such crowds nowadays only turned up when they have to pay to get wet in the rain or, worse still, have Daler Mahendi rub-rub rubbing you up the wrong way. Its heartening to know Calcuttans still flock in big numbers to a war of words and a meeting of minds.

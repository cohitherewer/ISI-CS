 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Avtar seeks, Avtar gets
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Avtar Singhs Opel Astra, whose windscreen was shattered on Tuesday by neighbours protesting his illegal activities. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Avtar Singhs roller-coaster ride was going at breakneck speed, till the law slammed the brakes on Sunday.																								The dictum for the past few years was: Avtar gets what he wants from the system, no questions asked. Sample this for what Avtar asked of the government and was given: A plot of land in Salt Lake for residential purpose A government flat in Salt Lake at a nominal rentAnother plot to open a hotel at Nayapatti, in Salt LakeTwo long-distance bus permitsLicence for a petrol pumpBar licence.																								There was one exception to the rule of toeing the Avtar line  that he be given a registration number for his new car, an Opel Astra, that ended with the numbers 0001.																								The government turned down this audacious demand on the grounds that car registration numbers from 0001 to 0025 are kept reserved for government vehicles and the number 0001 is the preserve of ministers alone.																								But everything else was Avtars for the asking, thanks allegedly to the patronage of ministers Asok Bhattacharya and Subhas Chakraborty.																								The turning point for the athlete from a humble background was wife Jyotirmoyee Sikdars golden rush in the Asian Games. The government was all too eager to pander to the star couple, and Avtar stepped on the demand pedal.																								Before that, we remember Avtar visiting Subhas Chakrabortys house regularly and seeking financial help and favours. The minister had provided him financial assistance and other facilities, said an aide of the sports minister.																								It is my habit to help poor sportsmen and I have helped a number of such persons, countered Chakraborty.																								Avtar wanted some favour from me as a sportsman. As I could not provide him with a suitable job, I favoured him by providing bus permits. But after that, he set up a hotel-cum-restaurant. I do not have any objection if a person runs a number of businesses. But if he violates the law, I will not stand by him, he added.																								A few months ago, Avtar got a licence from Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to operate a petrol pump at Chakda, in Nadia district, from where Jyotirmoyee is an MP (her constituency is Krishnagar).																								The company was supposed to construct the outlet, but after Avtars arrest on Sunday, we have stopped construction. We will not proceed until the case is resolved, said S.K. Tripathi, IOC public relations manager.

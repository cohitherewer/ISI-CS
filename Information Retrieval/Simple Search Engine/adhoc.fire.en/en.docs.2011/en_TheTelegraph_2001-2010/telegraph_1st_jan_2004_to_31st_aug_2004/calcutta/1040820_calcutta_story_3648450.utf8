The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 The reason, Bengali season 
 															- Tours: Rajasthan, Uttaranchal vie with Malaysia, Norway A STAFF REPORTER																								Higher footfall (25,000 versus 15,000) than Mumbai or Delhi; higher ticket prices (Rs 25 versus Rs 20 in Mumbai and free passage in Delhi) Calcuttans are going places and the proof lies in the numbers thrown up by the Travel and Tourism Fair (TTF) trundling through six metros.																								Few are more convinced of the Calcuttans wanderlust than the two partner states  Rajasthan and Uttaranchal  of TTF 2004 at Netaji Indoor Stadium. Manoj Kumar Sharma, additional director, Rajasthan Tourism, is confident that last Augusts figure of Rs 40-lakh bookings during the four-day fair will be doubled between Thursday and Sunday. A figure borne out by fact  Calcuttans are the second largest group of tourists to the desert state.																								Rajasthan is popular for two reasons, the most obvious being that the Marwari community here likes to go back to its roots. Also, middle-class Bengalis (most tourists from here fall in the budget category) are still in love with Satyajit Rays Sonar Kela. For them, its an emotional tie, said Sharma. 																								Budget holidays are also why Uttaranchal is wooing Calcutta travellers. Anil Kumar Sharma, MD, Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd, Uttaranchal Tourism, said: We refer to the September-October period as the Bengali season, when about 85 per cent of tourists at our guesthouses are from here.																								But that does not mean foreign shores are going unexplored. We expect to beat last years 47 or 48 bookings, said Bhupesh Kumar, manager (marketing), Tourism Malaysia. For one, people are more aware. Also, Malaysia Airlines will be here by the year-end and we are tying up with airlines and agencies to provide package tours.																								The budget barrier was not stopping the curious Calcuttan from making a beeline for the brochures dished out by new-entrant Norway. Although there were no bookings on Thursday, the interest level was high, observed Rajeev Koul of the Norwegian embassy.																								Another tourism movement, from being guests to hosts, was flagged off by state tourism minister Dinesh Dakua on Thursday, who announced that a West Bengal tourism office would be set up in Mumbai soon.

 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Roadside orchards to woo back birds
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, in a brave attempt to woo back the fleeing bird population, has ordered the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to plant only fruit-bearing trees by the roads.																								Fruit trees are eye-catching. Let us also not forget that some localities are named after fruits, like Amtala, Jamtala, Beltala, Lebutala, Pearabagan and Kalabagan, though the trees no longer exist there, he pointed out. Besides, asserted the mayor, the fruit trees will fetch the birds.																								As part of the plan to line the citys roads with fruit trees, the civic parks and squares wing has decided to plant, in the next six weeks, 5,000 saplings that will in future bear mangoes, blackberries, custard apples, guavas, litchis, papayas, chikus and pumloes. Some saplings have already been planted. 																								The CMC is in talks with various nurseries for supply of the saplings. Another set of saplings will be planted in the grounds of schools belonging to the CMC.																								We have planted fruit trees on the campuses of more than 20 CMC-run schools. We are ready to supply free saplings to people who have space to plant them in their gardens, said mayoral council member (parks and squares) Hridayanand Gupta.																								The CMCs senior horticulturist Tridib Talukdar said fruit tree saplings had been planted along 30 roads across the city, including CIT Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road, Deodar Street, Purna Das Road, Hazra Road, AJC Bose Road, Amherst Street, Rabindra Sarani, Dum Dum Road, Canal East Road, Bidhan Sarani and Vivekananda Road. 																								We will plant fruit trees on the Maidan between Rabindra Sadan and Victoria Memorial, on Cathedral Road, as part of our Rs 7-crore beautification scheme for that particular stretch, Mukherjee signed off.

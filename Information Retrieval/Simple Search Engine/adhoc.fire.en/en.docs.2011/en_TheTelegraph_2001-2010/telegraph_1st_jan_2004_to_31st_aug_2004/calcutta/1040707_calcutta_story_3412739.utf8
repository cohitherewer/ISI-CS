The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Vulnerable members of a lost generation
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Usha Uthup singing along with children from CRY projects. A Telegraph file picture																								There are 21 childrens homes in Bengal, and many of the kids living in them have not committed any offence or have one or both parents alive. The most important reasons that push these youngsters to such such institutions is a breakdown of the family and community structure and poverty.																								They are the lost generation, children in conflict with the law or in need of care and protection, drifting through life usually without love, affection and the stability of home life.																								It is for them that CRY (Child Relief and You) began the quality care and alternatives to children project last year, in 10 states in the country, with Praajak as the implementing NGO in Calcutta.																								At a recent conference in the city, the two organisations summed up their efforts, progress and future plans at a day-long workshop, attended by NGOs, police officials and lawyers. While Justice Shyamal Sen, chairperson of the state human rights commission, spoke on child rights, joint commissioner Banibrata Basu talked about the role of the police and member of Parliament Mohd Salim elaborated on the governments duty.																								The issues highlighted included adoption, foster care, special juvenile police units and quality parameters within institutions. An NGOs role is to help the government in a pro-active manner, not to do its job, explained Satya Gopal Dey, manager, development support, CRY.																								The states attitude here has become more open, Dey added. 																								Acoording to him, things are visibly improving. In Kisalaya, for instance, a home for boys, food is now cooked in a gas oven, a water filter has been installed and a childrens council instituted to increase their participation. Five years ago, there was one gamchha for every 15 boys. Now, the ratio is 1:4, said Protik Banerjee of Praajak.																								The incidence of skin infection has reduced drastically, and art is now part of their curriculum, as a means of expression. Besides, we have repatriated a number of children to Bangladesh, who were being kept in the homes here, he added.																								The convention also focused on the childs right to a family, and by extension, the existing adoption laws and the lack of foster care models.																								The current laws are biased in terms of religion. Our cultural heritage is based on the concept of unity in diversity. All we ask for is a special act for adoptions, says Dey. CRY has already prepared a draft, which will be submitted to the Assembly. 																								In the meantime, what is required is foster care, the best option apart from adoption. But in West Bengal, most people are unaware of the concept. 																								Dey says there is no scope for immediate improvement in this regard, but things are moving in the right direction. Nina Nayak of the Karnataka State Council for Child Welfare had been brought in to check out the Karnataka governments programme as a model. But we have to be careful about the environment, so that rehabilitation after the age of 18 doesnt become difficult for the children, sums up Banerjee.

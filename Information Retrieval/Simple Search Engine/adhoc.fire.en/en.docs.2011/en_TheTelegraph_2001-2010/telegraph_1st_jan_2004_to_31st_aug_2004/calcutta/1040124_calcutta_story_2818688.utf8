				 Futile drill, wayward drivers

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Drivers are careless and cops are callous. And the tale told by the blood on the streets of the city can be recounted with cold statistics  in 2002, 357 of 442 road mishap victims fell to reckless driving; in 2001, the toll was 338 out of 457.
																								So, whats being done to slam the brakes on drivers steering chariots of death? Next to nothing.
																								Several measures to curb reckless drivers have been taken in the chambers of Lalbazar, but some didnt ever hit the streets and those that did, achieved precious little.
																								Last year, for instance, there was this grand plan to post plainclothes men from the traffic department on private and government buses as ordinary passengers.
																								Then deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M.K. Singh had explained how they would travel the entire distance and take note of each traffic violation  jumping traffic lights, rash driving, stopping in the middle of the road  and submit a full report against the driver for appropriate action to be taken.
																								Around two years ago, an orientation course on traffic manners was organised for bus drivers. Cops recorded the offences and replayed them to discipline rogue drivers. But that is history now.
																								Three years ago, a yellow line was drawn on the left flank of thoroughfares like CR Avenue and AJC Bose Road to create bus ways. Buses were meant to stick to this passage, especially near stops, not to overtake and not to impede the rest of the traffic. The yellow line of no control faded fast.
																								More recently, traffic police cracked down on buses, both private and government, plying with faults like defective tyres and broken mirrors. That, too, proved a brief attempt at making the streets safer.
																								Controlling speeding vehicles is the job of the traffic police, declares Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic). And for this, we have a batch of traffic sergeants to book all drivers who violate the Motor Vehicles Act.
																								At full strength, the force has 250 traffic sergeants, with 150 of them deployed on city streets to keep traffic movement under control.
																								A sergeant is given six litres of fuel for his motorcycle every day to patrol the streets. But most can invariably be spotted idling on a stationary bike, said an official of the traffic department. This has caught the eye of police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty, who has urged the traffic wing to be more mobile.
																								Joint commissioner Basu, meanwhile, claimed that a massive drive had been initiated against reckless drivers. This drive will be intensified, he threatened. But for how long?

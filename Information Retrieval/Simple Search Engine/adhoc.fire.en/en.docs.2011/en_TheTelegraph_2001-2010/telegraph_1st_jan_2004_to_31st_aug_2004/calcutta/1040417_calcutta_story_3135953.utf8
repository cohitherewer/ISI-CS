 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Army revives Maidan claim
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The army on Friday filed a petition in Calcutta High Court, seeking to be empowered to grant permission to political parties to hold rallies or organisations to stage events on the Maidan, including the Brigade Parade Grounds.																								In the six-page petition, the army argued that it be allowed absolute control over the administration of the Maidan.																								Moving the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee, the army also sought modification of an earlier order that empowered the state government and its departments to look after the affairs of the Maidan. The order was passed in December in response to a petition filed by environment activist Subhas Dutta, demanding preservation of the Maidan.																								The petitioner also urged the court to direct the political parties and others to seek approval from it before holding rallies and fairs on the Maidan.																								Chief Justice Mathur and Justice Banerjee observed that the army position appeared to contain certain points of merit and asked the state government to file an affidavit on its stand, vis-a-vis the army demand.																								Activist Dutta told the court that the army was best equipped to look after the Maidan and its preservation. The Maidan is the citys lungs. The army, undoubtedly, will look after it far better than our politicians, he said.																								Appearing for the ministry of defence, advocate Uttam Majumdar informed the court that his client was unhappy with the order passed on December 12. In that order, there was no directive to the state government to seek permission from the local military authorities before allowing anybody to use the Maidan, he alleged.																								Majumdar said: The land and property rights of the Maidan belong to the Union ministry of defence. In its judgment, the court has also admitted the fact. The custodian of the Maidan is the local military authority. So, it will be unwise to empower the government to allow political parties and others to hold rallies and fairs there without prior approval of the local military authority. 																								Government pleader Rabilal Moitra opposed the prayer and told the court it had justly allowed the state to grant permission to the Maidan users.																								The court, however, thought the army had enough grounds to stake its claim. The chief justice then asked the government pleader why his client was not accepting the army proposal.																								Moitra replied that there was some controversy over control of the Maidan. The government feels it has a legal right to oversee the affairs of greens. The court then asked the government to file an affidavit. The matter will come up for hearing after four weeks.																								Earlier, the same bench had issued certain directives to rid the Maidan of pollution and had instructed the public works department, police and other state departments to work for beautification of the Maidan.

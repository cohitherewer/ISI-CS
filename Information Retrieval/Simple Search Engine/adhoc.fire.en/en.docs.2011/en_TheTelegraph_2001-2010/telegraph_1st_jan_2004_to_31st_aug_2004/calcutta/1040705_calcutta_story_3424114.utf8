 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 An ear for public complaints
 JAYANTA BASU The German consulate recently complained to the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) against the developers of a housing estate in Alipore about the unbearable noise during construction. Prompt action was taken at the public grievance cell hearing after an inquiry. A couple of years ago, residents of Narkeldanga complained against a local galvanising unit for causing both air and water pollution. A probe followed by a hearing settled the murky matter. A bird-lover from Maniktala complained against a trust for illegally felling large trees near the Parashwanath temple, said to be the abode of hundreds of migratory birds. The board found the allegation true and ordered police to stop the felling of trees.																								These are only a few of the thousands of complaints pouring into the public grievance cell of the state PCB. According to a recent board report, it has received more than 13,000 complaints since the cell opened a decade ago and disposed nearly 90 per cent in quick time.																								The cell carries out public hearings by a team comprising the boards legal officer, a retired judge and technical experts in the Salt Lake office four days a week, including Saturday. The board has also organised periodic hearings at its Siliguri office in the past few months.																								Besides lending an ear to public grievances, the cell also has to admit a number of complaints being referred by various government agencies, including municipalities, the judiciary and even the human rights commission.																								The board report (2002-03) reveals why the quasi-judicial cell, the one of its kind in the state, is so popular: four of every five complaints are settled within three months, whereas petitioners wait years for a verdict in court.																								We receive all kinds of environment-related complaints at our grievance cell and try to settle most of them as soon as possible in the hearing attended by both parties, after conducting an inquiry, if required. There is no cost involved and you dont need a lawyer to plead your case, explains Biswajit Mukherjee, the boards senior law officer.																								More than half the complaints come from Calcutta and the report identifies the key environmental issues at hand. Air is clearly problem no. one (52 per cent complaints being exclusively air-related and about 23 per cent also involving noise), followed by decibel disputes (about 17 per cent).																								The red industries (potentially the most polluting) drawing the maximum flak include chemical, bleaching and dyeing, electroplating, acid lead battery and rubber. The board slaps erring parties with bank guarantees, disconnection of electricity notices and even closure orders.																								Though it was made mandatory in 1998-99 for all government departments with public interface to have functional public grievance cells, the state pollution control board might be the only one carrying out the order in its true spirit, says a senior government official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, January 17, 2004  Body-watch Sandeep Vyas, Priyanjana  and chief dietician Doel (left to right) at the Health  and Wellness Cookery Show at Body Care				 															Even as all that festive bingeing took its toll on Calcuttans, Body Care, the beauty and health clinic on Park Street, did its bit to make things better. The agenda as usual, was health and wellness and this time around, it took the shape of a special cookery show and workshop designed to educate the fitness-conscious about what to eat and how to make it.																																																				According to director Sanjivani Grover, the idea of the Health and Wellness Cookery Show, as the event was billed, came to her when most clients would eat health-food yet pile on the kilos as they didnt know how to cook it in a healthy manner. And that was exactly what the audience got to see first-hand at the programme as Body Care chief dietician Doel demonstrated the making of three delicious yet low-cal dishes  Chicken with Vegetables, Vegetable Fried Rice and Mixed Fruit Custard, all pegged between 41 K.Cal and 186 K.Cal per serving  even as popular singer Sandeep Vyas, a fitness freak himself, rustled up a light and tasty paneer preparation.																																																				There was more on the cards though in the form of a health quiz where more than 50 diet myths were clarified with the audience, with model and emcee Priyanjana giving out surprise packages while a session of free diet-counselling for all the guests rounded off the interactive meet.

Lipsticks are available in three ranges namely Plastic Shine, the creamy Diorific and the light- reflecting Addict and cost anything between Rs 1,075 and Rs 1,225. To give your peepers a whole new look, check out all the eye-shadows, kohl pencils and the Maximeyes mascara.

Here, you could nose through the Iod range (for young skin), Capture R60/80 (with wrinkle-busting properties), the No-Age range and a luxury line, Dior Science.																																																				If nothing else, at least give the latest fragrances from the house of Dior a sniff especially the Jadore EDT, a deliciously-light perfume for women and Higher Energy, a citrusy-fresh splash-on for men.

With the month of Poush upon us, the didimas and radhunis in almost every Bengali home are busy labouring in the ranna-ghar, churning out pithe puli  mishtis that are synonymous with the season. Equally, if not more fired-up, are the chefs at Oh! Calcutta as the gourmet restaurant on the fourth floor of the Forum mall is also making way for the sweeter things in life.																																																				led Poush Parban, the festival at Oh! Calcutta on till January 22, offers a smorgasbord of sweet temptations  all flavoured with the best natun gur available. Heading the luscious list are the many pithes, plump with sweet fillings and dunked either in honeyed syrup or cream. The more exotic comes by way of Daaber Payesh, a mind-blowing blend of tender kernel and sweetened milk, Dudhpuli, Patishapta and Nolen Gurer Rabri  each more devastating than the other. Also available is the Rangalur Pantua, a delectable sweet potato and cottage-cheese dessert and of course, the Kachagolla, served sizzling-hot straight from the kadhai. Also part of the line-up are the crispy Sor Bhaja and Sor Puria.																																																				The price of indulging your sweet tooth isnt all that high what with the desserts on offer coming for anything between Rs 40 and Rs 80. For a stab at the sweetmeats, contact 2283 7161.

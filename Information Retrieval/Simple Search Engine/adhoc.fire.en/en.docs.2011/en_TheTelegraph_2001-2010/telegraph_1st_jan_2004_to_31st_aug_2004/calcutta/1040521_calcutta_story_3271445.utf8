The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 After-dark landfill for Dum Dum stadium
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Residents of Dum Dum met fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda at Writers Buildings last Monday to protest the filling up of a waterbody in the Surer Math area. They submitted a memorandum with 500 signatories, urging the minister to prevent the landfill.																								The residents also complained that the waterbody was being filled up at night. Hundreds of trucks are dumping earth into it every night, after we retire for the day, they told the minister.																								Swapnamoy Chakraborty, who is spearheading the movement to protect the waterbody, said some unknown persons were behind the landfill. 																								There is no notice-board on the spot displaying the name and address of the developer or promoter engaged in filling up the pond, Chakraborty told Nanda at the meeting. He pointed out to the minister the landfill threat to the environment and the green patch around the waterbody. 																								Nanda told Metro on Thursday that he had collected reports from the residents and referred the matter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								The chief minister insists on keeping tabs on vanishing waterbodies, said Nanda.																								I am not sure about who is behind the landfill. But the local civic body tells me that a stadium is to come up on the spot, for which the waterbody must be filled. I have, therefore, referred the matter to the chief minister, the fisheries minister said.																								Chairman of South Dum Dum Municipality Sreehir Bhattacharjee, when contacted, said the state sports council was planning to construct a stadium and a football training camp on the spot. A cultural complex is also likely to come up.																								He alleged, however, that a group of promoters had erected a number of multi-storeyed buildings around Surer Math. During construction, the promoters had dug up earth from the sides of the waterbody. As a result, the waterbody has become larger, the civic chief claimed.																								Bhattacharjee asserted that the waterbody was not under any threat. The sports council is only filling up its sides, where soil had been removed by the promoters. The waterbody itself will be converted into a modern swimming pool.

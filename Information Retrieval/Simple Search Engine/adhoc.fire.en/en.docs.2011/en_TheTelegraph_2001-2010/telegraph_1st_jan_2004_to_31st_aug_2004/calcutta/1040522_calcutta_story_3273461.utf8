 Saturday, May 22, 2004 Just for the jamai 
 The Kewpies spread for the son-in-law. Picture by Rashbehari DasNo food, no festivities. No festivities, no fun. No fun, no Jamai Sashthi.																								That is the drift these days as eateries dish it out to turn personal celebrations into public bashes. For food merchants, it makes perfect business sense and for foodies, being spoilt for choice is never a complaint.																								The latest excuse on the calendar for the culinary circuit to gorge on is here  the countdown to Jamai Sashthi, a within-four-walls affair till the other year and now thrown wide open.																								The day of the son-in-law will not dawn till May 25, but that isnt stopping hotels and restaurants from going overboard with jumbo-sized true-blue Bengali offerings.																								Legend has it that Jamai Shasthi originated ages ago to remind women of their duties. Today, however, the whole idea of the wifes family honouring the son-in-law is nothing but an excuse to troop out with the entire family to dig into a sumptuous a-la-carte or buffet spread at a Bengali restaurant. And dont be surprised if the jamai ends up footing the bill for the jamai ador!																								The reason the special spreads on such occasions is a success is that women refuse to spend hours slogging in the kitchen anymore, but the family wants to celebrate in style and just needs an occasion to splurge, observes Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies.SON SHINE Sonargaon (The Taj Bengal): Non-veg and veg thalis at Rs 650 and Rs 525
 The Eden Pavilion: (ITC Sonar Bangla): Special Bengali buffet at Rs 600
 Aaheli: Non-veg thali, Rs 400
 Kewpies: A-la-carte menu and three kinds of thalis, between Rs 265 and 340
 6 Ballygunge Place: Special buffet at Rs 400 450
 Bhojohari Manna: Jamai Sashthi Bhoj at Rs 225While the Elgin Lane eaterys USP is the traditional recipe in homely environs, theres five-star chic on offer at Sonargaon in The Taj Bengal where huge silver thali spreads are laced with an unlimited supply of Fosters beer.																								The menu is essentially the same at most places with Ghee Bhat, Luchi, Chholar Dal, Shukto, Chingri Machher Malaikari, Topse Machh Bhaja, Ilish Machher Paturi, Kosha Mangsho, Khejur Aamsatta Chatni, Mishti Doi and Paan on offer, with a few improvisations here and there.																								If chef Surinder Singh at The Taj prefers to make Shukto the milky way, Rakhi adds a special touch to recipes like Ilish Machher Paturi Boneless, which is cooked more like a smoked hilsa.																								Kewpies is quick off the Jamai Sashthi blocks, with the festive feast spread over a week and most other eateries serving it up only on Tuesday. This is for jamais who are going to be tied up that day, smiles Rakhi.																								Aaheli, the Bengali speciality restaurant at The Peerless Inn will be offering discounts and gifts. Guests with a jamai in tow running up a bill of Rs 1,000 and above get an offer letter for a discount of 10 per cent on their next visit, while people who manage to make the Rs 3,000 mark get a 15 per cent benefit. Surprise gifts for the star attraction are on the cards as well.So, is it time for you bachelor boys to dress up in traditional finery, to take on the airs of a jamai and just have fun? The Hawaiian fest at Polo Club.

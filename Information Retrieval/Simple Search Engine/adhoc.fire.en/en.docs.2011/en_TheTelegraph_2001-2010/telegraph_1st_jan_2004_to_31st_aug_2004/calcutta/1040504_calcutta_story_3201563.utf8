 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Heist kingpin poll ire victim
 PRONAB MONDAL																								Fortune favoured him in Calcutta, but not in Bihar.																								The mastermind of the biggest bank heist in the recent past  Rs 85 lakh from the Kidderpore branch of Central Bank  had given the city police the slip. He couldnt finally make it, though. He died in a gunbattle that marked the poll violence in Bihar on April 20. Thirty-nine others lost their lives with him. 																								This revelation was made by the city police after a team of six officers returned empty-handed from Asansol a few days ago. The gang involved in the bank heist was scheduled to reach Bengal on April 19, a day before the first phase of the polls.																								A group of six, armed with revolvers and bhojalis, had stormed the bank around 11 am and cleaned out its locker room. They walked out with Rs 85 lakh, after locking the employees in a room. The detective department was asked to conduct a probe. After a month, the sleuths came up with a single-line information  the gang was the one that had robbed Punjab National Banks Gariahat bank two years ago. But there was no information about its whereabouts.																								Officers of a city police station, who had no links with the probe, received a tip-off from Bihar that the kingpin and others planned to sneak into Bengal before the election. We were told that the robbers would enter through Asansol and stay in Calcutta till the election frenzy in Bihar died down, said an officer, adding: The goons decided to seek shelter here because the city is considered a suitable refuge for out-of-state criminals.																								The team rented a room in a roadside hotel in Asansol on April 18. We were waiting there, too. There was a tip-off that the mastermind and his accomplices would take GT Road and head for Calcutta. A round-the-clock vigil was kept on the national highway, said the officer.																								As neither the leader nor his aides turned up even after two of the polls, the officers decided to return. We came back here on April 23. Till, then, we had no information about the death, said an officer.																								The team then contacted its Bihar sources, who conveyed the news. We dont know what circumstances he died under. The others of the gang changed their plan after their leader died, said the officer.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department) had no idea about this development. I have no idea about the kingpins death and havent heard anything of the sort, Mitra shrugged his shoulders to say. The deputy commissioner is overseeing the bank robbery probe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 23, 2004 Mantra is work hard, party harder
 Wear																								For herMore is a bore, the less the better. But try and convince the buttoned-up Calcutta nightbird about it, groan the guys. Though there is no dress code, low-waist jeans and asymmetrical skirts for the lowers, paired with lycra spaghettis, halters or off-shoulder midriff-showing tops are in. Or asymmetrical kurti teamed with jeans. For footwear, dressy slip-ons with block heels and the glass look.																								I prefer denims with a nice top. If I am in the right mood, I even wear one of my chiffons with a strappy blouse. I think Calcutta is really improving these days, fashionwise. Previously, it was pretty sad, says actor June Maliah.																								For himThe second sex has to toe the dress line to be allowed in. No shorts or cut-sleeve vests at Big Ben, shorts on Saturdays only at Winning Streak, no open footwear, no bare bodies at the door, please. So, just a sea of denims with T-shirts with an occasional see-through lycra shirt.																								Mens style in the discs here is stereotypical and monotonous. I wear denims and a figure-hugging sleeveless vest; a Jamaican hat called Rastafara and really flashy footwear, maybe red, says singer Shayne Hyrapiet.Carry A cool attitude is the most important accessory on the night trail.Next come the mobile phone to keep you connected to the circuit and plastic cash.Know Entry age: 21 (at least look it, dude) No entry: for men-only groups Free entry: for women-only groups Entry fee: for couples ranges from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 (normal nights to high-profile events) Dont dare: Chew paan/paan masala at the disco door, smoke or sip on the dance floor, make an ass of yourself and be bounced out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Banking on GeneratioNext
 With todays splurging teens signing in with cheques and swiping out with cards, classrooms are where banks find their customers, says Sudeshna Banerjee Finance-friendly: A gang heads for a hangout on Park Street. Picture by Aranya SenScene I: Saturday night in Park Street. A bike breezes out of The Park and hits Jawaharlal Nehru Road, turns left and slows down a few paces from Chatterjee International. The pillion-rider hops off, races to an ATM counter near the tallest commercial building in town. His pocket replenished, the two, barely out of their teens, head back for the disc to join the rest of the gang																								scene II: The Indian Museum auditorium is packed in the afternoon, last Sunday. The general manager of Central Bank of India is hardselling the loan schemes that his bank offers, in the presence of a director on the banks board who has flown down from Mumbai expressly for this purpose. 																								The audience is a hall full of students.																								Today banking begins early, with the age bar for customers dipping with every academic session. And these youngsters have enough money in hand to make them a target sector.																								The days are gone when parents used to open accounts and put in their childrens name as a joint holder. A survey has revealed that students hold the maximum number of ATM cards in the country. So they are prospective clients that we must reach out to, explains R.C. Agarwal, director on the board of the third largest nationalised bank in the country. The bank is going all-out in its marketing drive to catch them young, meeting teachers and students at similar interactive sessions at 75 centres across the country. 																								Students these days start earning early, be it by working at call centres, as share brokers, or as sales agents. Tuitions are no longer the only source of income. And usually it is their own money that they spend, not their parents, points out Deepak Sarkar, principal, Bhawanipur Gujarati Educational Society.																								Jayant Lalwani, a commerce student awaiting his graduation results, has had his own account since he was in Class XI. I used to earn my pocket money doing event management with a friend. In college, I shifted to supplying stationery to departmental stores and seminars. In his first year, Jayant went for a second bank account and now he holds a debit card as well. My savings come handy to pay for my tuitions, while the card is of use in discs, restaurants and shopping malls, says the resident of Jodhpur Park.																								Agrees Gunjan Buvaria of South City College, who worked for Taj Bengal in her final year but quit recently to prepare for her exams: My debit card is a great help during shopping. These days, even the small clothes shops accept plastic payment, says the girl who started banking transactions on her fathers behalf when she was 15.																								Other banks have also got a whiff of the emerging young market. The add-on cards which come with our credit cards are usually passed on by the parents to their teenaged children. So they are getting a taste of plastic money before they start earning, points out Sumanta Bose, regional marketing manager, HDFC Bank.																								Adds an official from the banks Mumbai office: As much as 32 per cent of our debit card customers are in the age group of 18-25 (four per cent of this base is from Calcutta). And 35 per cent of the most active users of the debit cards are in the same age group. Shops and restaurants top their list of spending spots. But they are saving as well. Over 12 per cent of our customers are in the 18-25 age category, the official sums up.			ICICI Bank started a student account scheme to rope in the volumes, according to Souma Sen, customer service manager. The bank allowed hefty relaxations to attract Gen-X customers. While the minimum quarterly balance for an ordinary account-holder is Rs 5,000, students maintain an account with as little as Rs 500. An ID card from the school or college and an age-proof sufficed to start off. The best part of this account is it comes with a debit card, smiles a student. Having achieved its goal, the bank has suspended the scheme recently.																								It is not just to jive up the relaxation route that students are strutting to banks. With higher studies becoming costly, students need money not just to study abroad but also to sign up for plum courses, explains principal of Asutosh College, Debabrata Chowdhury, who addressed Sundays seminar. While Central Bank of India has introduced educational loans for both school and college students, aid is also offered for buying a personal computer. We will go to campuses and interact with students, adds Agarwal of Central Bank.																								Allahabad Bank has had a good response to its on-line educational loan scheme. Restricted to applicants to blue-ribbon institutions like the IITs and IIMs, the loan is processed within 48 hours and the student is alerted over e-mail. We give them a one year moratorium period with a total payback time of seven years. This way it is the students who pay us back after they pass out, not their parents, an official at the banks Dalhousie headquarters says.																								As Jayants father O.P. Lalwani puts it: Money had value in our youth. Now money is all about convenience. And new-age banks with their pro-youth focus and fast transactions are in sync with Gen-X and are too happy to let em live it up.

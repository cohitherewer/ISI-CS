Feng Shui Pinky KapoorFree flow of positive chi can counter the negative energy floating around hospitals and nursing homes. The recovery of patients can be speeded up if the atmosphere is neat and clean and caregivers are sympathetic and helpful.																								All external and internal centres of negative energy should be removed, as they can slow down the healing process. Stagnant ponds, open drains and tree clumps should be removed from the premises. Clutter, sharp edges, withering plants can be negative sources of energy. Healthy green plants, fresh air, fish swimming in ponds or aquariums, waterfalls, bright lights and clean surroundings help raise positive energy levels.																								Fresh plants are one of the best sources of chi and hospitals would do well to place them strategically. They play a vital role in absorbing negative energy. East is the direction associated with health, and water features placed here ensure that the purifying aspects of water act as recycling zones for stagnant energy. The plot will be favourable if the east is open. The rooms should be regular in shape and the eastern side should not be missing. A square building is best as this represents earth energy, lending stability, followed by a rectangular one, where the length does not exceed double the width.																								The centre of the building is the tai chi (health area). This should be kept clear of any heavy structure. In fact, it should be kept open for natural light to pour in, as energy from here radiates in all directions. Having a temple here or in the northeast sector is good for the ailing. Newborns at a city hospital: Surrounded by negative energy?The reception should be in the east and the emergency ward should be very close to it. The administrators and doctors offices should be in the southwest or southern sector of the building. Sitting diagonal to the entrance, facing the auspicious direction, is advisable. A bowl of salt filled to the brim, to be changed every morning, should be kept on doctors tables to absorb negativity.																								Operation theatres are best located in the northeast sector, which is connected with the mind and wisdom. The conference room with closed-circuit TV to watch live operations should be located here, as well as the pharmacy, as medicines kept here are believed to be blessed with extra healing properties. This is also the best place to have nurse and staff stations. The cash counter should be in the southeast.Critical care patients are best kept in the northwest sector. The fast moving energy in this area can help patients recover faster. If kept in the southwest, the stable energy may not leave them fast, delaying recovery. The walls should be painted white, off-white or pastel shades of blue and green. The corridors and the rooms should have pictures or paintings of nature. Religious images should be placed on the eastern wall on the patients side. Often, they are hung on the wall opposite the patients bed, but this is inauspicious as they sleep with their feet pointing towards them. Mirrors placed near the patient may disturb the healing process, leaving them exhausted in the mornings.																								Tip of the week: Rooms should be space cleared of negative energies before a new patient occupies it, by sprinkling water, burning incense and placing flowers around the room.

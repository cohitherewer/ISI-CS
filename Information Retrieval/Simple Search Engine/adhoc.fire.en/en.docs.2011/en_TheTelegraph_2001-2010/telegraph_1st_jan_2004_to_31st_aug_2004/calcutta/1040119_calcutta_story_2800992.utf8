																																																		Two persons died and six sustained injuries in two accidents in the city on Sunday. Chimai Naskar, 34, was run over on Gariahat Road around 3 pm by a minibus on the Garia-BBD Bag route. Police said Naskar, an Indian Bank employee, was crossing the road when the speeding bus crushed him under its wheels. Bystanders beat up the driver before the police reached the spot. He was arrested on a charge of reckless driving. Around 5 am, Nitai Saha,40, died when the Matador van he was travelling in overturned at the Taratala crossing. Police said Saha, a resident of Maheshtala, was sitting on a pile of vegetables stacked on the van. Six other vendors sitting with him were injured. 																																																		A WBSEB sub-station was unveiled at Jagatballavpur, in Howrah, on Sunday. According to Pratyush Mukherjee, minister of state for health services, it will benefit more than five lakh residents of Jagatballavpur, who used to draw power from the Domjur plant. They will now get their electricity directly from the sub-station.																																																		The city civic health department has decided to do away with the system of allotting areas to animal welfare NGOs, thereby allowing any NGO to respond to distress calls from any neighbourhood in the city.																																																		Mausumi Naskar, a 17-year-old student of S.B.Girls High School in Garia, was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital after she tried to commit suicide by consuming poison. Police said that the suicide attempt may have been triggered by her failure in the school selection tests. Hospital sources said on Sunday that her condition was serious.

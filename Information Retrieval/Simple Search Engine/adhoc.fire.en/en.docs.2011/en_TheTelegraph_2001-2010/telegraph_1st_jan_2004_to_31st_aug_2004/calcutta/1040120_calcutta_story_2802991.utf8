				 VARUN JAIN VARUN JAIN																									Asked to speak for 30 seconds each on tricky topics like Iraq, Afghanistan and education, he landed the third prize for his efforts.																									Another feather in his cap was being declared the Best Peace Ambassador in the Calcutta group by the teachers and team leader Barry OBrien. Although modesty stops him from crowing about his achievements, Varun admits his speech on the final day might have had something to do with it. A lasting memory is being invited to spend the  night with some of his new friends, despite a lack of space,  after being locked out of his own room.				 FATEMA MARFATIA 																									FATEMA MARFATIA																									Getting rid of preconceived notions of conservative attitudes prevalent in Pakistan, right down to her female cousins wearing burkhas, was not easy. However, the friendly reception from the family made the experience unforgettable for Fatema. 																									All reservations fled out the window, when, choked with emotion, the words started flowing freely. Breaking the ice was no big deal for the young peace ambassador, and shes determined to do it again.

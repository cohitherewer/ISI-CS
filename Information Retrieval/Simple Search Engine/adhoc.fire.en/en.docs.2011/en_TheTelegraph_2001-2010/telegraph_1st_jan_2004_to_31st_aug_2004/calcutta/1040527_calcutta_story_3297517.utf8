																																																		The Medical Council of India (MCI) is in favour of opening more medical colleges in the districts rather than in the city. Ketan Desai, the immediate past president of the MCI, met senior health department officials in the city on Wednesday and conveyed the MCIs wishes. A final decision on the fate of SSKM Hospital, which has applied for an undergraduate medical course, will be taken in June this year. Desai reportedly told the state government that plans to approve the proposed private medical college in Jadavpur had been postponed. Instead the MCI would help the government set up five new medical colleges in rural Bengal. He held talks on research work at the newly-formed West Bengal University for Health Sciences, in co-ordination with the Indian Council for Medical Research.																																																		A 32-year-old undertrial prisoner, Kanai Santra, succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday night at MR Bangur Hospital in south Calcutta. He had allegedly suffered serious injuries during a fight with other inmates of Alipore sub-divisional judicial court lockup. Following his death, his relatives demonstrated at the hospital alleging negligence. According to police, Santra, a resident of Nodakhali Chowk in Daulatpur, was arrested on charges of theft a few days ago and was remanded in judicial custody. He was lodged in the court lockup and was involved in the fight the same afternoon. A murder case was registered at Alipore police station on Tuesday but no one was named in the FIR, said deputy superintendent of police (town) of South 24-Parganas, Humayun Kabir.																																																		An employee of Mother Teresa TB Hospital in Regent Park was allegedly molested by a group D staffer of the hospital on Tuesday night. A complaint has been lodged with the local police station against the man who is absconding.																																																		A 25-year-old youth Ramesh Samanta was shot dead in Falta on the southern fringes of the city on Tuesday night while he was returning home. Police said that Samanta might have been murdered as a consequence of intergang rivalry. No one was arrested. 																																																		Two persons, Samir Bhowmick and Kishore Bhowmick, were arrested at Belur in the Bally police station area in Howrah on Wednesday night. A pipegun and a dagger were recovered from them.

The Left Front and the Congress councillors in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation felicitated Sudhansu Sil, newly-elected CPM MP from Calcutta Northwest constituency, at a function at the Councillors Club on Wednesday.

The felicitation was organised at the Councillors Club as Mukherjee had turned down the Left Fronts proposal to accord Sil an official reception.																																																		The state government has appointed a committee to fix the prices of milk for producers in the city and elsewhere in the districts. The committee will determine the minimum price to be paid to milk producers so that they are not cheated by middlemen. The committee will also try to match the price paid to producers with that of milk powder procured from outside, to encourage producers to produce more milk. This way we can avoid buying milk powder from outside the state paying higher rates than what we pay our producers, state animal resources minister Anisur Rahman said at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.

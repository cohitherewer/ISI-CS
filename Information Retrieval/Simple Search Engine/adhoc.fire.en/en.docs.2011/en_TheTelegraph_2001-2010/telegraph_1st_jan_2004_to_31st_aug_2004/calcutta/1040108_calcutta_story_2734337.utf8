 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 A boogie that earned screen space
 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 Some of the winning members. Picture by Aranya Sen																								They all have many pursuits in life, from sports to dance, without giving academics a miss, since most of them are in higher classes in their schools. Juggling them all can be tough at times, but succeeding is a rush they know all about. Winning the group dance category in Sonys Boogie Woogie, from among thousands of hopefuls, was no mean task, but one these seven youngsters, all students of Nupur Dance Academy in Sodepur, handled with elan.																								Fourteen-year-old Roshni Bhattacharya, from St Xaviers Institution in Panihati, has been learning creative dance for close to a decade, besides being proficient in kathak and also training in Bharatanatyam. Shes also a table tennis champ, at the district and state levels, and is currently the All Bengal Inter-School number one. Performing on television and getting the top honours, however, was more than just another feather in her crowded cap. It was a wonderful experience, and I am very proud she smiles.																								After getting into the top 35 from over 2,000 contestants in the eastern region alone, it was the semi-finals and finals last April, that was telecast on TV, where the list was brought down to eight. Then came the mega finals in December, in Mumbai, where they emerged winners, with a creative dance choreographed to Lata Mangeshkars Vande Mataram, by the husband-wife duo Montu and Somdutta Debnath, former members of Ananda and Tanushree Shankars troupe, who now run the Sodepur academy.																								Pompy Mondal, 13, a Class VII student from Birati, near Dum Dum, swept the under-14 solo dance category, with a performance to the song Maar gayo re. Although this was her first television appearance, she is already a veteran prize-winner. I did go through a lot of tension at first, but as I went through each stage, my confidence grew, she asserts.																								Atindriya Das, 15, is in Class XI, and had to rush off for the show right after sitting for only a few exams, from Barrackpore Girls High School, before taking the principals permission to take the rest later. She was satisfied with 88 per cent in her Madhyamik exams, and despite having more than one dance form to pursue, with four to five hours of practice a day at times, shes determined to maintain her marks.																								As is Nabanita Santra, 17, who scored 88 per cent in her ICSE and 83 per cent in Class XII, from St Xaviers Institution, Panihati, and is now studying commerce. She, too, learns Bharatanatyam and kathak, besides creative dance. Her motto: When you love something, you make the time. Fourteen-year-old Monobina Roy, too, believes in doing what she loves, because a hobby is essential.																								Arindam Chowdhury, 23, is a recent graduate of commerce, and apart from dancing, is taking various competitive exams. For him, meeting people from different parts of the country and learning something from everyone was the high point. 																								There was competition, but also friendship, he adds. For Debraj Sen, 22, also the make-up man of the troupe, it was not just another contest, but an experience of a lifetime.																								The city auditions were coordinated by Gurpreet Kaur Sethi of RGV Events and Consultancy for R amp;N Television. 																								As the prize, the dancing prodigies will get to train for a month under choreographer Ganesh Acharya, and the chance to perform in a Sony album this year.

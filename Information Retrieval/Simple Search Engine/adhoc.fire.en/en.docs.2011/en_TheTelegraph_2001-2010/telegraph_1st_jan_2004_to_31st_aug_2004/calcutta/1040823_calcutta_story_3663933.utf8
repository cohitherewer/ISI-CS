The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 23, 2004 Life You cant get through this week without.Blue-boy bashingWhat a bunch of losers, man Pathetic team of overpaid, over-hyped under-performers, yaar This is worse than the Olympic fiasco Get that vitriol going in your vocabulary as you tear into Team India. A fashionable flick: No Sachin, No Sourav; No Tendulkar, No Team. A hook that hurts: If they get such absurd bonuses when they win, they must be docked their match fees when they lose like they did against Pakistan. A silly point: Be ready to hide those thorns and shower those roses (I had told you, na, these boys are fighters!) if the team still manages to beat Australia and make the finals of the Holland Cup!Rockin and rollinWarm up for a walk down memory lane, with Elvis, Morrison and Doors for company  at Someplace Else. The revival route will be taken by singer Gary Lawyer accompanied by Hip Pocket, adding a retro flavour to the 10th anniversary celebrations at the Park Street pub. Funky merchandise up for grabs enhances the act. So what if the good ol days of free entry to the rock-on-the-rocks hole are all but over (at least for the time being). Rs 250 is all you will need to make a trip to the mecca of live music. Single women, of course, continue to enjoy free reign!Blasting with a buzzLet it ring loud and clear, with the latest tune announcing talk time. Cell phone etiquette is a thing of the past. Those in-built muted, boring ring tones may be approved in polite society, but blaring Fida and Murder numbers each time your phone beeps  or sings  is the way to win instant entry into the party-hop brigade. Con a few geeks in the gang to tank up on tarty tunes like Lets do balle balle, Bheege honth tere , at Rs 7 a piece and then coax the poor fellas to pass the buzz around!Fleshing it outKnow all there is to know  about the making of Dhoom and making your own plans to catch it post-Friday. Men and motorcycles, hot bods and hot beats, Sanjay Gadhvis second directorial venture promises it all. With three of Bollywoods most eligible bachelors (Abhishek, John and Uday) going zip zap zoom, Rimii and Esha going bump and grind and Thai singer Tata Young going from mud-wrestle pit to the bathtub, its time to start wondering whether Dhoom would go the way of all flesh.

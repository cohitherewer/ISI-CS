 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Govt allays fowl fears over flu
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government on Thursday geared up to stop the spread of unnecessary panic over bird flu and said stringent measures were being contemplated against those who panicked and killed fowl. 																								State animal husbandry minister Anisur Rehman on Thursday said there was not a single case of bird flu in the state and exaggerated reports were causing panic. 																								The ongoing panic is severely affecting the poultry industry in the state. Small farmers, poultry owners and their families are facing difficult times due to this, Rehman told a press conference organised by the East India Association of Poultry Industries and Farmers. No case of bird flu has been detected in either India or Bangladesh and there is no reason to panic, he added.																								Rehman said a three-member high-level committee was formed to probe the burial of 12,000 live fowl at Tung. The report was being awaited.																								Director of animal husbandry and veterinary services S.K. Dasgupta later said the government was considering implementation of the Cruelty Against Animals Act against anyone found guilty of killing fowls as a precautionary measure. We are expecting the report within a week and shall then think about implementing the Act in this case as well as any such cases in future, Dasgupta said.																								In Nadia, where it was reported that a number of fowl had died, no case of bird flu was reported. Our officers made spot inquiries and found that only 10 fowl had died due to Ranikhet disease, he said.

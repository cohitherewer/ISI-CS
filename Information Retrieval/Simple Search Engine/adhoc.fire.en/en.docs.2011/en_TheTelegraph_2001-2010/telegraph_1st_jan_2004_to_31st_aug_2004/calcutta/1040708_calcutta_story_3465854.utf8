 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Pregnant woman set ablaze by in-laws
 							 - Married for love, killed for dowry A STAFF REPORTER																								The brutes murdered my daughter. They didnt even spare her unborn child, wailed Murari Ghosh on Wednesday. 																								Mousumi Deb, 23, was nine months pregnant when she was doused in petrol around 10 pm on Tuesday and set ablaze in husband Pradips family residence at Mirpur, near Bata More, in the Mahestala police station area. 																								On a first information report filed by father Murari, police rounded up Mousumis husband Pradip from home on Wednesday afternoon, and also his married sister, Rupa Roy, from her Ultadanga residence. 																								A hunt is on for Mousumis absconding parents-in-law, Dharani and Manju. 																								Neighbours realised something was amiss when they heard screams from the Deb residence. Rushing across, they saw Mousumi, heavy with child, transformed into a human torch. 																								After a moment of indecision, they rolled the screaming woman on the ground and put out the flames with water and blankets. She was rushed to a local hospital, where she was declared dead.																								Mousumi married Pradip in August 2003 after a whirlwind romance. The couple had known each other for some time, and when love blossomed, neither family had objected to the match. Murari had even sent his daughter off to her in-laws with the dowry that had been demanded. 																								The honeymoon had hardly ended when the jibes started. Initially, husband Pradip, a small-time salesman, was not a part of the verbal torture. 																								When the words turned unkinder, Mousumi complained to him, and was shocked when he sided with his parents and sister.																								After that, blows accompanied the jibes and threats. 																								Mousumi would often weep during her visits to our house. She told me a number of times about the torture, physical and mental, meted out by her husband and in-laws, hungry for more dowry, and how it was getting worse by the day, recalled her tearful father. 																								I was not in a position to pay up. I had thought the situation would change once the child was born, he added. 																								An officer of Mahestala police station revealed that Dharani, Pradips father, was a leader of the Citu-backed Bata Mazdoor Union, and a well-known figure in the locality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Identity veil lifts on Maidan victim
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sabitas sister Uma. Picture by Pabitra Das																								The murder: A young woman is strangled to death on May 30 in Eliot Park, on the Maidan. Her ribs are broken, her kidneys and liver are damaged; her mouth is stuffed with mud; she is strangled.																								The mystery: The victim is unidentified; there is no missing diary resembling her description in any police station till July 27.																								Two months after she was brutally murdered, the victim has been identified as Sabita Roy, 29. She was a widow with two minor children and worked as a domestic help at 6A, Nandalal Jiu Road.																								Sabita had been living on Nandalal Jiu Road, in Bhowanipore, since childhood. But no one from the locality had come forward to lodge a missing diary.																								Late on May 30, Sabita was last seen entering the deserted Eliot Park with a middle-aged man. A security guard at the adjacent Metro Railway cooling station followed the couple for a while and watched them vanish behind a thick undergrowth.																								Sujoy, tumi amar songe erokom korte parona, (Sujoy, you cannot do this to me), were the last words the guard heard the woman shout out. Around midnight, the womans brutalised body was recovered from the spot. There was no trace of the mysterious Sujoy and there was not a clue about the victims identity.																								The case was also handed over to the detective department, that drew a blank. The woman was not identified, nor was the killer, until Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south), who was also working on the case separately, received a tip-off about a woman having gone missing from Nandalal Jiu Road.																								We initiated a probe and tracked down Sabitas sister, Uma Mahapatra, who later identified the victim, said Sharma.																								Uma went to Maidan police station and also identified her sisters clothes. I told them that the photograph and the clothes matched my sisters. All this while, I thought she had gone back home to Bankrahat, in South 24-Parganas, Uma told Metro on Tuesday.																								A police team has been despatched to Bihar to try and track down Sujoy. He has been identified as a driver residing on Manoharpukur Road, who went missing from May 31.																								It is sad that at a time when we are stressing the need for neighbourhood watch and community policing, no one from the locality came forward. I am shocked that not even a missing diary was lodged, said police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty.																								Sabita had been employed by Anjali Sen who, too, did not lodge a police complaint. Lodging a complaint never crossed my mind because she never stayed with me permanently, said Sen.																								Uma, however, claimed that her sister had been working and living in Sens house for the past three years.

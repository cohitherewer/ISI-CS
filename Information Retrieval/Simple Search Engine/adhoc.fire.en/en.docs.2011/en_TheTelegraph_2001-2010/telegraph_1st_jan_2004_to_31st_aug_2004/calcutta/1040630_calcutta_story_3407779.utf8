The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Foreign tourists flock to Package Calcutta
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The number of foreign tourists to Calcutta has broken all records, with an increase of about 120,000 in a year. According to a tourism department report, 650,000 foreigners have visited Calcutta in 2003-2004 (till March).																								The flow of domestic tourists to the city has also set a new record during the Left Front governments regime by crossing the one-crore mark. Nearly 1.30 crore tourists from different states visited the city last year, an increase of about 40 lakh. 																								All figures are based on occupancy rates in the state-run lodges and guest houses, the report clarified. Officials said the number of tourists should be much more, but the tourism department does not have the mechanism to keep tabs on the movement of all of them.																								The increase in the number of foreign tourists in the city has broken all records and the growth rate is probably the second highest in the country, after Delhi, said Sourin Bhattacharya, managing director of the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC). 																								We think that we have been successful in projecting Bengal before foreigners and attracting them to Bengals capital, Bhattacharya added. Tourism officials said they had not noticed such a sudden jump in tourist flow in the past two decades. 																								The normal increase in foreign tourist flow was between 5,000 and 10,000 and that of domestic tourists between two and three lakh per year till 2001. The situation started changing from 2002. It was owing to our efforts to turn the state into the ultimate destination, they said.																								Some foreigners move from the city to the Sunderbans, Darjeeling, Sikkim and some towards the Northeast. Tourism officials are overjoyed because the WBTDC is going to make a profit in its tourism and hotel businesses after several years.																								All the government guest houses and tourist lodges in the city are overbooked. There is not a single room available in any of the 32 tourist lodges in the state and there is a long queue before the WBTDC booking counter in the city every day, the WBTDC managing director said.																								This apart, the corporation has been getting an overwhelming response to the 40 package tours organised by it. No seats remain vacant on two WBTDC long-distance tourist buses. 																								Besides, the corporation has received a large number of proposals from private parties interested in plying tourist buses. We have not witnessed this earlier, tourism officials said.																								Describing the reasons behind the development, Bhattacharya said there had been a steady development in the tourism infrastructure during the past few years. Three big hotels and over a dozen medium hotels have come up in the city in recent times. Moreover, we have been able to provide certain amenities to the tourists. The package tours are a major draw, too he said.

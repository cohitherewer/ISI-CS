				 Small screen tale of trauma 

 							 - Experts trace spats and splits to TV excess
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR
 *A senior IPS officer of Calcutta Police beats up his wife following repeated quarrels over the choice of channel on television. The 40-year-old woman spends five days at a south Calcutta hospital for treatment.
																								*Sushma Mohan, 22, a certified couch potato, is depressed and does not want to marry. The reason for her reluctance: the string of TV serials showing marriages ending in extra-marital affairs and divorces. She is undergoing counselling at the behest of her traumatised parents
																								Frequent quarrels at home, splits in marriages and psychosomatic disorders are on the rise, and some of the blame for the social trauma, say doctors, lies with the small screen.
																								Not just the psychologists couch, even the neurological outpatients departments in major hospitals are apparently receiving 16 to 20 patients a day with some problem or the other related to excessive television viewing.
																								The origin of a domestic spat has often been linked to the idiot box. Picking the programme of choice is turning out to be a serious bone of contention in families these days, observes Tapas Banerjee, senior neurologist at the National Neurosciences Centre, Peerless Hospital.
																								Subesh Sarkar, 45, is a classic case of social trauma. The resident of Swinhoe Lane, employed with a rubber-product manufacturing company, spends long hours watching soaps on TV. For the past six months, Subesh has shut out family and friends. His wife has turned to a psychologist in despair.
																								The neurosurgeon at a south Calcutta hospital who treated the IPS officers wife a few days ago, found it hard to believe that TV trouble could eventually turn violent.
																								I was stunned that a police officer could do this to his wife, over watching TV every evening, he observed. The IPS officer, apparently, learnt his lesson and the couple promised not to allow the TV to become such a huge issue between them.
																								But for others, like Alokesh and Rima Lahiri of Bhowanipore, the small screen has sparked big trouble. What started as petty quarrels over television viewing snowballed into regular quarrels. Last week, they decided to part ways. On hindsight, I can say that we should have thrown out the television set, but its no point talking about it now, says Alokesh.
																								Or take 45-year-old Suresh Thakur, who refuses to catch a flight, fearing a crash. He told me that television news reporting plane crashes from all over the world has caused this, says R. Ghosh Roy, his psychiatrist.
																								City-based psychologists feel increasingly more families these days prefer separate television sets  one for the drawing room and one for the bedroom, or even one for each member of a small household. What they forget is that more TV sets do not solve any problem, they just multiply it, says psychologist Uma Sarkar.
 Anxiety disorders caused by TV 
 excesses are giving rise to hyper-ventilation, stress, head 
 and body aches and even non-epileptic hysterical attacks 
 , warn doctors.

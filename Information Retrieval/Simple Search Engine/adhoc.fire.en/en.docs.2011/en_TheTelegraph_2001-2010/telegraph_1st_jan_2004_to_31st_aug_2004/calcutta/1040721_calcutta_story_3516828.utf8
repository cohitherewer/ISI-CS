	Some shops in College Street are selling photocopied books instead of the original ones. This way they end up not paying a penny to the publishers and pocketing the total price of the book. The books are so cleverly duplicated that general customers fail to distinguish between the fakes and the originals. Recently, I was duped in a similar manner, but the bookseller later refused to exchange the book. Buyers should be constantly on their guard against these cheats. Publishers should also take action as they lose a lot of revenue because of this illegal practice.Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town. 
	The Kidderpore post office has been under repairs for nearly a year now. As a result, residents of the area find it difficult to purchase stationery. We request the postal authorities to look into the matter and hasten the repair work. Since postal communication is indispensable, the postal department should deal with the problem on a priority basis. Der Mandi, Kidderpore.

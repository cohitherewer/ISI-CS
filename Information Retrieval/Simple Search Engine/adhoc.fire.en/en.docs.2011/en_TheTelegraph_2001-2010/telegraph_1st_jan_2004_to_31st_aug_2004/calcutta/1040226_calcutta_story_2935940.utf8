 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Rebelling against oblivion
																								There are artists who display their art with aplomb and get due recognition for their talent, and there are artists who are equally devoted to their muse yet go largely unnoticed in their devotion. Madhusudan Chaudhuri is one of the exceptional breed of sculptors who has stayed away from the limelight while constantly journeying on to perfect his art and venturing into newer avenues. Primarily a sculptor, he is gifted with a unique vision that amalgamates modern techniques of stylisation and abstraction while retaining a contagious zest for life. And it is this warmth that transpires through his work. The exhibition on display is Chaudhuris maiden attempt at serious painting which is presumably an extension of his first love, that of sculpting. In his paintings, he distributes his interests between human figures and landscapes to create an endearing picture of our world and its diverse life forms.																								Event: Sculptures amp; paintings by Madhusudan Chaudhuri																								When: Till February 26; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Gaganendra Pradarshashala

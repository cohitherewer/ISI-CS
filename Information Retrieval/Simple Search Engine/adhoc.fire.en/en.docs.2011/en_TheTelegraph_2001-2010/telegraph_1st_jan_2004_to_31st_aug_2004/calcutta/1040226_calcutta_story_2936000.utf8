The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Worth more than a vote for Bush
 Man Mohan Maheshwari Man Mohan Maheshwari Hi, my name is Maheshwari and I am a Republican.																								A 66-year-old Calcutta-based Marwari businessman-turned naturalised American, campaigning for the Republican Party? Before Bobby Jindal came close to becoming governor of Louisiana, this combination may have raised a few eyebrows. But it is still a curiosity, though Maheshwari, an energetic and passionate follower of George W. Bush, sees no contradiction between his past and his politics.																								Dressed in crisp, spotless white, Maheshwari, who shuttles between homes in New York, Pennsylvania and Alipore, seems an unlikely proponent of all things Bush. But the framed and signed picture of the US President and his wife Laura hanging on one wall of his Calcutta flat, and a certificate from the Eisenhower Commission occupying hallowed space on the opposite wall, tell a different tale.																								Receiving the lifetime achievement award from the Commission  otherwise known as the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence  was a defining moment for the man who made his living selling used industrial machinery. I received it at a presidential gala in Washington from Ed Gillespie (Republican National Committee chairperson). George W. Bush was there, too, beams the father of two. The award in recognition of a lifetime of dedication and unstinting support of the National Republican Party bears the signatures of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. It was anti-terrorism activities that won this honour, feels Maheshwari.																								A database of around 120,000 Indians based in the US is the tool to target the key constituency, in his attempt to mobilise support for Bush. During the Iraq crisis for example, he sent out a mailer asking people to voice their support for the war to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as the Indian governments ambivalent position, felt Maheshwari, was not representative of the Indian-American communitys sentiments. I got a lot of angry replies as well as positive ones, admits the man gearing up for the aggressive campaigning ahead of the US elections later this year.																								Thank you for your early commitment and dedication as a charter member of the campaign in Pennsylvania. Grassroots leaders like you are the key to building a winning team, Best wishes signed Laura Bush and George W. Bush. This picture and a pen with Bushs signature are prized possessions. But Maheshwari, who predicts Bush will be back for another four years, has no intention of running for office himself. I have achieved everything I have ever wanted, smiles the contented grandfather.

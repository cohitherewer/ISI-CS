 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary (HS) Education is in the process of drawing up a few more stress-relief measures, apart from a rise in the number of working days, to make the new and vaster syllabus more friendly for teachers and students.																								Worried about student adaptation to the English syllabus, the council has planned an orientation programme for Plus II teachers. Also on the anvil is a tutorial system for students.																								Our aim is to make the transition from the old syllabus to the new as smooth as possible for both student and teacher, council president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee said on Thursday. We understand that they may face some teething problems, he added.																								The new syllabus will be introduced this year for students who pass the Madhyamik examinations, to be conducted by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. So, the first HS exams under the new syllabus will come off in 2006. Officials say that the Joint Entrance Examination also stands automatically modified, as it follows the HS syllabus for the science subjects (physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology).																								The changes introduced in the syllabus  for the first time in more than two decades  will affect these four subjects and English, feel HS council officials. Special attention, therefore, is being paid to these subjects in our efforts to make things easier for students, one of them said.																								Though there are so many working days in the academic year (a little over 180), our calculations tell us that it is possible to hold full classes on around 200 days in the entire Plus II section, covering Classes XI and XII, council president Mukherjee said. We will emphasise the importance of taking the figure to around 250, he added.																								The tutorials we will introduce this year will also be very helpful, particularly to those found to lag behind in the classroom, explained Mukherjee. 																								Officials said the council would try to start the teacher-orientation programme  to explain to teachers how to fit the vaster syllabus in the academic year  before the onset of the Puja vacations. We have already got the go-ahead from the state government and have spoken to the National Council for Educational Research and Training on this, Mukherjee said.																								Last, but not the least, the HS council wants the government to keep in mind the extra burden on students and teachers when it schedules elections. We do not want any disturbance to the academic calendar, as even a small deviation may upset our plans, Mukherjee said.

 															- NO Pollution curbs, no trade licences  TAMAL SENGUPTA																								About 15,000 units in the city, engaged in manufacturing gold ornaments, function without a trade licence from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). None of these units has obtained a clearance certificate from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB), either. A PCB certificate is mandatory for getting a trade licence issued by the CMC. 																								There are about 90,000 gold ornament-making units across Calcutta. Most of them are located in Bowbazar, Baranagar, Sinthee, Cossipore and Shyambazar. We have stopped issuing trade licences to units that have failed to submit certificates from the PCB, said CMC mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh on Friday. He added that many of the goldsmiths had not renewed their trade licences as they had failed to obtain a clearance certificate from the PCB.																								A PCB official, on condition of anonymity, said the board had conducted a survey on these units and found that most of them had implemented the pollution control norms prescribed by it. But none of them are coming forward for a clearance certificate. Once they apply, the certificate will be issued without delay, he added.																								Pollution check officials held a meeting with the CMC to sort out the problems faced by these goldsmiths in central Calcutta. We have issued a specific guideline to the CMC on how to check air pollution by these units. The CMC has played a positive role in diminishing pollution in Bowbazar and other areas in the north. We appreciate the CMCs decision not to renew the trade licences of units that have not obtained certificates from us, the PCB official said. 																								Concentrated nitric acid and sulphuric acid are used in these manufacturing units to melt gold. Heavy use of acids causes air pollution. Initially, most of these units were located in Bowbazar. But over the past five years, many have shifted to Baranagar, Cossipore and Sinthee, in the north, as the density of population in these areas is comparatively lower than in Bowbazar.																								Mayoral council member Ghosh, however, said that the CMCs denying a trade licence will not solve the pollution problem. Everyone knows that many such units function without a trade licence but the CMC is not equipped with adequate laws to down their shutters, he added.																								Ghosh said he had taken up the issue with the state government, as about 1.30 crore people in West Bengal are involved in the trade. These goldsmiths units are not confined to Calcutta alone, but spread over districts like Hooghly, Howrah and Burdwan. I feel the goldsmiths in the districts face the same problem as those in Calcutta.																								PCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar said on Friday that the board has convened a meeting with an association of these units. We will initiate several measures to help them run their business, Sarkar added.

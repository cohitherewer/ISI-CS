 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 South belt cracks traffic whip
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Traffic bottlenecks in south Calcutta have always been cause for concern, thanks to the density of slow-moving vehicles. These, compounded with rash driving, have resulted in many accidents. 																								The situation has, however, been scrutinised by the police to sort out snarls for good. As of now, South 24-Parganas police plan to phase out the cycle-rickshaws that ply in the Garia-Jadavpur and Behala-Thakurpukur belts. The idea is to ease the pressure on Raja SC Mullick Road, NSC Bose Road and Diamond Harbour Road.																								Furthermore, autorickshaws have been targeted as the bane of the roads, responsible for rash driving and exhibiting rampant disregard for traffic rules and pedestrian safety. Auto operators will be checked for proper documents and licences, as well as the hologram sticker on the windshields. Errant operators will be chastened promptly  the police will seize the three-wheeler.																								According to deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir on Wednesday: The process is being initiated on an experimental basis. If there is reasonable success in solving the root problem, we will go on a full-scale operation after the elections.																								In spite of the recent widening of the Garia crossroad by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), a traffic hazard persists because of the autos that are parked in a haphazard manner there, Kabir said. Though the space has increased by two-and-a-half times, the three-wheelers clog the area and cause massive traffic snarls. 																								Most of these auto operators dont even have licences and relevant documents. We have already warned them to park their three-wheelers in a single queue. Any operator found violating this order will lose his licence as well as his vehicle, the deputy superintendent warned.

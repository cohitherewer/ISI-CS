 A STAFF REPORTER																								Its a disease that makes a person swing between the two extremes of the emotional pendulum  manic high to depressive low  or in a state where irritability goes hand-in-hand with depression. The individual could spend hours contemplating suicide. 																								This is not a mental illness, but of the genetic and chemical imbalance kind, where the symptoms are manifest in the behavioural patterns of a person. But the stigma of madness often prevents patients of bipolar disorder from seeking help.																								Coupled with the fact that it is very difficult to diagnose and often confused with other illnesses like schizophrenia, the number of people living with bipolar disorder is impossible to calculate. The rate of misdiagnosis is high, and it could be years before a person even realises that he is suffering from the disorder. 																								This was the subject of a seminar last week. The speakers were Prof Alan C. Swann, vice-chair for research, department of psychiatry and behavioural sciences, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, and Prof A.N. Chowdhury, head, Institute of Psychiatry, Calcutta.																								The treatment when I started working 25 years ago was only lithium. Although it is still important, there has been a lot of advances, observed Swann. 																								Now, there are anti-convulsants and anti-psychotics. Improvements began in the 1990s, when research proved that a combination of genes and family history were often responsible for the illness. It is made worse by the fact that substance abuse (drugs, alcohol) is common and it often ends in suicide, where a mix of the manic and depressive stages is more dangerous than the two separately.																								The time between the onset of the disease (usually childhood or early adulthood) and diagnosis is about eight to 10 years. Men suffer more manic episodes, while women are more prone to the depressive and mixed stages. People with bipolar disorder are two-and-a-half times more likely to die of heart ailments, and 20-25 times more likely to commit suicide, added Swann.																								In our institute, research on suicide and mood stabilisers is ongoing. Psycho-social intervention is most important. While drugs are good, they lack the human touch, explained Chowdhury. Social stigma remains the biggest deterrent. Patients will visit several doctors before going to a psychiatrist. Some are treated by neurologists. They dont want to go to a paglader daktar.

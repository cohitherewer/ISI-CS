Sabya Speak Sabyasachi Mukherjee Models walk the ramp in Sabyasachis creations at Fashion Week of the Americas, Miami Three days after his return from a month-long trip to the US meeting buyers in New York, checking the latest styles and hitting the ramp at Fashion Week of the Americas in Miami, Sabyasachi Mukherjee clears the confusion about what the international design market wants from India:The line between India-inspired and Indian clothes is very thin. We have a tendency to take our Indian-ness too far and too literally. In the international market, the moment we wear our Indian-ness on our sleeves, it spells our doom. We need outfits that can cross boundaries. Otherwise, we will get labelled as costume designers.But we cant  and shouldnt  shake off where we are from. Somewhere, the Indian touch will have to come in, and that is where we will score in terms of sensitivity. There is plenty of space for our designers in the international market. But if Browns or Saks finally do keep my clothes, they will not label me as an Indian designer. We are filling a little groove, and I think my clothes clicked with a healthy dose of Indian-ness along with a crossover sensibility.If you come up with a good product with logic, reasoning and soul, you will find a market. The alternative international market is looking for good clothes with intelligence. The Made in India tag is no longer a taboo. Most designers here are knocking at the world market and it will just take one to open the door for the rest to tumble through. On my trip I realised that we are not lagging behind, we just dont have the money to package ourselves.I find the term Indo-western gross and offensive. It is like eunuch clothing. Like a hangover from the Raj. It is passe and tacky clothing, done mainly to appease the Indian market  to psychologically satisfy those who want to wear western clothes but dont have the bodies for it. It is aspirational stuff. The mid-path always stems out of a compromise.The domestic market mostly plays it safe. The silhouettes never change, so you basically can play around with colour and embroidery. This is bound to get repetitive. Designers let the market dictate to them, rather than dictating to the market. There is a tendency to over-squeeze the lemon, after finding a winning formula.I took a big career gamble. I was not sure what kind of international buyers would be there at India Fashion Week. My collection was not received well domestically and was before its time in presentation of this kind of alternative glamour. It was a reaction to the picture-perfect clothes I saw everywhere. Suddenly, everything has become so artificial  from food, to cosmetics, to movie posters to art. Clothes are plastic, picture perfect.When you go to a fashion week, you can look for more publicity, which adds value to your label. Or, you can look at the growth and expansion of business. This year, I was not looking at more stores. I didnt want to super-saturate the market, because at some point, people stop buying. And that was the warning signal I was getting.So there was only one option: to expand into other markets. The western audience is more receptive to quirkier clothes and to making a complete 180 degree change, season to season. I wanted to get into a space where I could do clothes that I want to do. I cringe at the thought of some of the work I have done so far I never like what I do after 10 days. I never take the hype seriously because you are only as good as your last collection.

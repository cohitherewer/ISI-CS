 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Automatic air monitors at key crossings
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a move to monitor air quality in the city, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) has decided to introduce an automatic atmosphere-monitoring system from this month.																								We shall instal air-monitoring machines at some key intersections in the city to ascertain auto emission and dust pollution. Steps will be taken accordingly to maintain normalcy. Besides, a mobile van carrying a sophisticated machine will roam the city to record air pollution on a regular basis. We shall send the findings to departments like transport, public works and environment so they can take corrective measures, WBPCB chairman Hirak Ghosh said on Friday.																								The board has imported a sophisticated machine, worth Rs 1 crore, the first of its kind in eastern India, with financial assistance from the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC).																								According to WBPCB scientists, the machine will record air quality, quantity of dust, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, solar radiation and smoke content in the air. We have our machines and gadgets, which we use to ascertain air quality, but they do not serve all purposes. Besides, it takes time to get the findings. The new machine will give us all the findings instantly. Moreover, it will help us take corrective measures, the WBPCB chairman said.																								The new air-monitoring machines have had a successful trial run at Santiniketan during Pous Mela. Some employees of the WBPCB had been given special training to handle the units.																								The WBPCB plans to instal a unit in a mobile van at every fair held on the Maidan and later, at 10 important road crossings, like Shyambazar, Maniktala, Gariahat, Maidan, Howrah station, Jadavpur, Garia, the EM Bypass, Salt Lake and Dum Dum.																								Officials said their plan was to place the units at least once every month to compare the data and monitor the progress. This apart, a unit, they said, would also be sent to the Sunderbans to check the environment																								The officials said they had already installed five pollution-control units at five major zones, including Victoria Memorial, Rabindra Bharati University, Alipore zoo, Haldia and Durgapur, and the findings were expected soon.																								Our move is aimed at giving a major thrust to the environment sector. We want to make 2004 an environment-friendly year and to achieve it, we seek cooperation from all concerned, the WBPCB chairman said.

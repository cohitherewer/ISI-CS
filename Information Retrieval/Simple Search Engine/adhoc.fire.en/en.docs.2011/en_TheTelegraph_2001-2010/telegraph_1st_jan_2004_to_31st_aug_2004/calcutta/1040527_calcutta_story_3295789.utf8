 Aruna BasuAruna BasuThe daughter-in-law can come to much use. Or so Dasghara, Hooghly, has found. The bouma who came on occasional outings to her in-laws rural family seat has, in less than a decade, turned into a didi for the villagers, who provides care, cure and a classroom to send their children to.																								I used to see the village boys running around with skin disease and other ailments. There was neither doctor nor medication for miles around, recalls Dr Aruna Basu. 																								This moved the general physician to start a free clinic on Sundays. I would distribute the samples that the medical representatives left at my chamber. Seeing her enthusiasm, the local pastor, Nemai Chandra Das, requested her to travel further interior to Srikrishnapur. The situation there was even worse. I started holding clinics in two sessions through the day, the resident of Kasba recalls. 																								The local boys came forward, offering their club room. It also turned out that the children who came to me for treatment did not have any contact with studies. Ki re, porbi? (Do you want to study) I asked them, and they readily agreed. So Basu brought slate and pencil on her next visit and the village kids, with hair combed and shirt tucked in, appeared for their introduction to the alphabets. 																								The twin responsibility was getting too much for Basu and she asked the club members to look around. Thus Sampa, our first teacher, joined the school which then had about 25 kids.																								Once a hand was available, help started coming in the form of books from the Assembly of God Church School (Basu is associated with the organisations hospital on Park Street). The headmistresses passed on the sample books and worksheets. Though each kid got a different book, the purpose was served, she says. As the number of students increased, the pastor again came to the rescue, offering the church verandah.																								Now the student count has gone up to 75, and the long verandah is falling short of space. Basus organisation, Chesta, is looking to set up its own address. A lady has donated five cottahs and financial help has come from alumni associations of South Point and St Xaviers College, the La Martiniere School Interact Club and the Hash Group. Yet the contributions are not adding up to the construction bill. Something will come up, smiles the good doctor.																								If her heart is set on a school building, her dream centres around a mobile medical van. That would help me cover a bigger area and take specialists from Calcutta for health camps. Not many would agree to undertake a two-and-a-half hour journey in bus, train and rickshaw in this heat. Unless they consider far-away Dasghara their second home.

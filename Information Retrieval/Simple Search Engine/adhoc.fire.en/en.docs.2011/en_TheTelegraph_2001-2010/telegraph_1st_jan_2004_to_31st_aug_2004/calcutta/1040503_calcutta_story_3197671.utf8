The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Alien tag bar to help offer
 PRONAB MONDAL																								There is a home waiting for him and a hand eager to nurse him back to health. But neither can he step into the house, nor can he hold the proffered hand  because of the Indian Foreigners Act.																								What happens next to 13-year-old Sahil Mollah is something that the police are struggling to find an answer to.																								The boy left his village in Bangladesh early last month to escape the horrors at home and ended up first in Jorasankos Falpatti, and then at NRS Medical College and Hospital.																								The asthma patient was picked up and hospitalised by local policemen after they found him alone and ailing. He had been dumped in front of the hospital by his companions of the Falpatti wholesale market.																								Now, a well-wisher from Bangalore has come forward to help Sahil.																								D.K. Bhattacharya has conveyed to us his wish to take care of the boy, at least for a few months, and help him recover. But our hands are tied as, according to the law, he is an infiltrator, said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division.																								A letter written by Bhattacharya reached Entally police station a few days, soon after Metro carried a report on Sahils plight.																								It was clearly explained in the letter why the boy should stay in Bangalore. Now, the matter is being handled by the Special Branch. I have sent the letter to senior officials, said A. B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Entally police station.																								Bhattacharya said in his proposal that his wife, a doctor, was also an acute asthma patient.																								I used to stay on Raja Rammohun Roy Road in Calcutta. Even after prolonged treatment, there was no sign of improvement. As evident from the experience of my wifes treatment, I think Calcuttas climate is not conducive to an asthma patient.																								I decided to shift to Bangalore because of the dry climate. Now, I am staying here for nearly two years and my wifes condition is far better. I think Sahil will also get well if he is allowed to stay here, at least for a few months, wrote Bhattacharya.																								Police, meanwhile, are handling the matter with kid gloves. If anyone is interested in taking the responsibility of the boy, he or she will have to move court. It is not in our hands, said deputy commissioner Kumar.

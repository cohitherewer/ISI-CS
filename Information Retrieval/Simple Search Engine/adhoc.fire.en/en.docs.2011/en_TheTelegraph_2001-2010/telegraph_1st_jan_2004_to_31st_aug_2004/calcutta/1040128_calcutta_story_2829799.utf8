 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Landgrab bar to save vanishing greens
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The few green patches left in the city may at last elude landsharks who have long been eyeing them for profitable ventures. 																								Realising that open spaces are shrinking in size at an alarming pace, the civic authorities have decided to ban construction of any permanent structures by a club or an agency in the citys parks. 																								During a discussion between mayor Subrata Mukherjee and municipal commissioner Debashis Som last week, it was decided that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will remove all junk dumped in parks like Park Circus, Triangular Park, Raja Subodh Mullick Square and Deshbandhu Park. 																								This apart, the CMC has fixed the maximum allowable covered areas according to the size of parks: Three per cent of the total  area in case of small parks Five per cent of the total  area in case of medium-sized parks  Not more than 10 per cent  of the total area of a big park For parks less than a bigha,  the structure cannot cover more than one per cent of the  area. 																								Admitting that the citys parks are now the most vulnerable open spaces, mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Hridayanand Gupta said: A section of influential people with money power and political clout are out to grab the parks to construct highrises for business.																								Almost all the 193 parks in the city have encroachments in the form of club houses, puja committee rooms, gyms, CMC pumphouses, booster stations or dumped vehicles.																								The sprawling Maidan would have shrunk to a small football ground by now, had the army not restricted permanent structures on the grounds, pointed out mayor Mukherjee.																								A similar prohibition on construction of permanent structures in the city parks can only stem the back-door grabbing of public property, he added.																								Grabbing public land on the pretext of constructing stadiums, club houses and puja-committee rooms has received a fresh boost, with the MPs providing financial help to the clubs and puja committees from their local area development (LAD) fund, the mayor explained.																								Citing an instance, an official of the civic parks and gardens wing said a chunk of land on the Park Circus Maidan had been converted into a fenced badminton stadium in December-end. Trinamul Congress leader Ajit Panja had allotted cash for the construction of the stadium from his LAD fund.

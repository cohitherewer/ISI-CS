 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Rs 50-lakh book spree for National Library 
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Suddenly, the National Library has become one of the big shoppers in town. Over the past week, it has bought up 12,000 titles, for a bill of Rs 50 lakh. The motive behind the spree: preventing the money from flowing back into the Central coffers. 																								According to library officials, it was detected during a scrutiny last week that about one-third of the Rs 1.5-crore budgetary grant for the current financial year had remained unutilised. The authorities realised that if the unspent funds were returned to Delhi, the allocation would decrease next year. 																								Officer on special duty of the National Library Ramanuj Bhattacharjee said on Wednesday that the officials and employees had been working virtually round-the-clock, drawing up lists of books and placing orders for them to spend up the funds. 																								 We suddenly realised last week that about Rs 50 lakh had been lying idle and we have to spend the money by March 31  the last day of the financial year. I immediately called a meeting with the employees representatives and explained the situation to them. Realising the urgency of the situation, they promised to cooperate, Bhattacharjee said.																								Library officials said that every year, the library gets funds  ranging between Rs 1 and Rs 2 crore  from the Union government to buy books. It is the duty of library information assistants to draw up lists of books to be purchased every year. There are seven posts of library information assistants, of which six have been lying vacant for over a decade.																								It is a Herculean task for a single employee to draw up a list of books worth Rs 1.5 crore. Last year, we could not prevent some funds returning to the Central coffers due to a dearth of library information assistants. But this time, we are determined to utilise the funds, officials said. 																								So, the library placed orders for about 12,000 books in English on various subjects.																								The library receives thousands of books as donations and gifts from the national libraries of 72 countries. Also, it receives nearly 25,000 books every year, as per the provisions of the Delivery of Books Act. These books are mostly in various Indian and foreign languages. So, we decided to buy books in English this time, an official said.																								Leader of the National Library Staff Association Saibal Chakraborty said more than 15 employees had worked day and night, including over the weekends, to help the library authorities draw up a list of books and place orders with publishers. Mind you, we are not charging a paisa of overtime for this extra workload. Our objective is to ensure that the funds do not go back to Delhi, he said.																								According to Chakraborty, about 265 posts are lying vacant in the library for a decade and the Centre was not taking any steps to fill them. As a result, day-to-day functioning of the library is affected, he said.

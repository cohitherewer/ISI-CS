 Sunday, June 27, 2004 Plug in to play it right
- HARRY TO HENRY, ALL IN THE GAME Tech TalkIts not about discovering the child in you anymore. Video games have given rise to a breed of hardcore gamers across the globe. With everything from Harry Potter and Matrix to Euro 2004 making successful crossovers, gaming is serious business worth billions. The ubiquity of the personal computer makes PC-based games the most popular variety. Exclusive made-for-gaming-only hardware is also available, including Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Game Cube. Game developers (like Electronic Arts with hits like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Need for Speed and World Cup cricket in its kitty) take advantage of the high graphics capabilities of these to release the same game in different mediums. Multi-platform ensures more moolah, too. Die-hard gamers, though, still have to rely on relatives and friends abroad to lay their hands on the game-gear. Mercifully, the PC titles are readily available almost as soon as they are released world-wide.Booster drive A good video card with at least 32 megabytes memory for tackling the heavy-duty graphics in most new games The more random access memory (RAM) the merrier; 128 megabytes is a must, but nothings too much for hardcore gamers A joystick, game pad or sidewinder will help you manoeuvre controls better and even allow you to feel the impact through vibrations Broadband Internet connection to pit yourself against Tarun across the street or Tom across the continent UEFA Euro 2004 Yes, the same as the ongoing tournament. Imagine watching the matches live on screen and then reliving the magic on your PC, only with you in control. This regular soccer offering from EA games includes several improvements over the last version. TV-style replays, national anthems, penalty shootouts (no Beckham, please!), and trophy celebrations add to the fun, with realistic graphics bringing the stadium, crowds and players alive. Dodge, tackle and shoot in the boots of Zidane, Figo, Raul or Rooney. The multiplayer option lets you challenge friends in Home, Away, Situation and Fantasy game modes.Price: Rs 1,299Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban If youve played the two earlier Potters, this one promises even more fun. Roam previously unseen areas of Hogwarts Castle, solve puzzles and learn spells (freeze creatures, control flame-breathing dragons and conjure a Patronus), collecting Bertie Botts all-flavour beans and Wizard Cards along the way for points. In the third instalment you can also play as Ron or Hermione. Flying on Buckbeak the Hippogriff is another plus.Price: Rs 1,299Need for Speed: UndergroundIf racing fast cars gets your adrenaline going, the latest instalment of Need for Speed is the game for you. A spin-off from Fast amp; Furious, the game lets you select from 20 fully customised licensed cars from Mitsubishi Motors, Subaru, Toyota, and more. Winning races help you earn cash to pay for custom body kits and other power boosters. An Oscar-nominated Hollywood visual effects expert has helped create amazing graphics, including vehicle motion blur. The game soundtrack stands out, too.Price: Rs 1,299Commandos 3: Destination BerlinPerhaps one of the more difficult games to play and win in this lot. Set in the Nazi era, you have to guide a group of elite commandos to break the German stronghold, controlling each of the characters individually. Thats easier said than done, with merciless soldiers on the prowl. This third instalment has three campaigns  Stalingrad, Central Europe and Normandy  each encompassing a different tactical situation, and is more intense than the earlier editions. Great graphic detail brings history alive on your screen.Price: Rs 1,299Unreal Tournament 2004 If you loved Quake and every other shoot-at-sight game, youll simply adore this one. The game combines the kill-or-be-killed experience of gladiatorial combat with cutting-edge technology. Ten game modes include team-based and every man for himself. Improvements over the previous version include new maps, characters, play modes, vehicles, weapons, technology and more than twice the amount of content as its predecessor. The online mode allows you to pit your skills against up to 32 players.Price: Rs 1,499

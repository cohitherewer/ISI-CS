 																											- Property tax without water levy rule dies 10 days after birth A STAFF REPORTER																								Theres bad news on the water tax front. The Election Commission has asked the commissioner of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to withdraw his circular, issued 10 days ago, exempting citizens from paying water tax if they drew supply through 10-mm or 15-mm ferrules.																								In his circular (No 31), municipal commissioner Debashis Som had directed the collection department to accept property tax without the water levy.																								The circular also hinted at the withdrawal of the newly-introduced water tax based on the rental value of a landed property and tax exemption for the supply of piped water through 10-mm and 15-mm ferrules. 																								The CMC controls the supply of filtered water through four sizes of ferrules  10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm  and would charge for supply only through 20-mm and 25-mm ferrules.																								In the old system, the annual valuation of a building was taken as the yardstick in considering the demand for a higher ferrule size by a house-owner. 																								So, 10-mm ferrules were limited to an annual valuation of up to Rs 1,199. The 15-mm ferrule was for the annual valuation slab of Rs 1,200-Rs 4,999 and a house-owner in the annual valuation range of Rs 5,000-Rs 8,999 was eligible for water supply through a 20-mm ferrule.																								What mayor Subrata Mukherjee did in the budget for fiscal 2003-2004 was to delink water tax from ferrule size. The CMC started collecting a minimum of Rs 50 monthly as water tax from house-owners who paid annual property tax not less than Rs 2,000.																								The computers in the civic assessment and collection department were programmed accordingly, so that the amount of water tax would be automatically printed on a property tax bill as soon as the annual valuation crossed the Rs 4,999-mark.																								Besides, the software was prepared in such a way that the collection department computers would not accept a payment of property tax unless the water tax in the bill was coughed up. 																								The new tax arrangement ruffled the feathers of Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, as it brought in the net more than 80 per cent of house-owners in Calcutta proper, though they got their water through 10-mm and 15-mm ferrules.																								Mamata forced the mayor to withdraw the value-based tax. A resolution had to be passed in the mayor-in-council three months ago withdrawing the tax and commissioner Soms circular followed, directing the collection department to accept property tax without water tax.

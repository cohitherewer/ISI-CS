Make Calcutta Better - Taxi refusal Every time the deadline depends on taking a taxi, the man at the wheel seems to have a different direction to take in life. Kothaye jaaben (Where to)? he demands. You have a meeting in the south and, of course, that is where you want to go. Airport chhara jabo na (Nowhere but the airport), barks the driver, refusing to budge. You have no choice but to fend for yourself and curse yet another cabbie in vain.Looking for a solution, Metro on Sunday talked to Madan Mitra, president of the Progressive Taximens Union. Mitra said: If refused by a taxi driver, the distressed commuter can call up our control room in Bhowanipore (number given below). Since we have just one control room, it is not possible to take steps right then (especially if the incident occurs far away from Bhowanipore). But if the harassed commuter leaves the taxis number, we promise redressal of the problem within 72 hours.The errant taxi is traced through the number. Then the driver as well as the owner are called to the control room. For the next seven days, the taxi is not allowed to ply. During the past couple of years, we have terminated the licences of over 1,200 taximen over this refusal problem, claimed Mitra.Word of mouth is the way ahead. So if one cabbie is penalised for refusal, others will be warned. Fearing action against them, they will think twice before refusing passengers. But thats easier said than done. As a recalcitrant taxi driver on Central Avenue reacted to threats of being hauled up: Ja icchey korun (Do what you want). This is my car, itll go where I want it to. So, the next time you are refused by a taxi anywhere in the city, make sure you jot down the number on the plate and call 24854040 or 24855050 for redress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Aye for agriculture n amity
 While the country stayed glued to the telly for the final updates on Lok Sabha 2004, a Young Metro team got together to dissect the results The seven lock horns over the parliamentary mandate. Pictures by Pabitra Das They might not have all voted  some of them found their names missing from the electoral register  but most were first-time voters. And although the seven youngsters vehemently oppose any involvement in politics, they followed the 2004 elections closely, because whos in power affects all of us. In between classes and tuitions, drama rehearsals and fests, they took time off to discuss and debate the elections and its effect on the future of India.																								And on Thursday they followed the big fight  Sonia Gandhis team versus Atal Bihari Vajpayees brigade, Manmohan Singh, Jairam Ramesh, Jaipal Reddy and Mani Shankar Aiyar against L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Arun Jaitley  in between all the hectic activity that makes up the life of todays young and restless.																								I was very excited, since it was my first voting experience, says Sejuti Das Gupta, a third year student, who has just given her exams. Pushing the poll button was particularly significant for the Xaverian as she is majoring in political science. So, for the first time, I could relate theory to actual events, she told her debate mates. The entire process was a learning experience for her, from the journey to the polling station (there were two booths  one for the slum-dwellers and another for us) to the off-the-mark exit polls and the surprise results.																								For die-hard Congress supporter Yousuf Rangoonwala, 21, who just finished his graduation in mass communications and is now a trainee in a city company, the mandate came as a pleasant surprise. I read and watched all that was available about the elections, because who is running the country is important in terms of the policies, programmes and the status of the country, ideologically, sociologically, culturally and economically. It is our responsibility to participate in the process and be aware.Vidhi Saharia
' Sonia Gandhi cant even speak Hindi properly. Shes not fluent in the language, and she still has to pause before she speaks. How can she be our PM? Shes just not Indian, even if she has an Indian passport ' Yousuf Rangoonwala
' Its secular ideology counted in favour of the Congress party, and the Gujarat riots definitely affected the BJP vote. In a way, today was a sort of divine justice for the victims of the riots 'Tribute to democracy																								While some of the youngsters were all sympathy for the BJP and others soaked in the victory of the Congress, all unanimously agreed on one thing  one partys routing and the others runaway success brought out Indian democracy at its best. It was the peoples way of letting politicians know that they cant be taken for granted, neither will they be taken in by superficial reforms. A few had mixed feelings, and most would have preferred the BJP, and although Tathagata Chowdhury, a law school pass-out, was one of the few to pronounce I am so happy the Congress won, all seven agreed that the change was for the better because the people had deemed it fit.																								The rural poor were ignored by the reforms brought in by the BJP, and they expressed their opinion through their vote, says Sangeet Shirodkar, a Class XII student of Apeejay School and a BJP fan. Something has to be done for them, feels Vidhi Saharia, a first-year student of business management from JD Birla College, who couldnt go back home to Assam to vote, but nonetheless, kept an eye on the political goings-on.																								What that something is, not all were sure but agriculture, they agreed, had to be a priority in order to ensure that the whole country could go forward, instead of just looking after the interests of the urban well-to-do. The working-class cannot be ignored is the warning from the young. The urban population often do not care about the country, and is more keen on going abroad and seeking opportunities elsewhere. The system needs to be changed, and everyone, educated or not, should have a hand in it, is the verdict from Sejuti.Support for GenX stars																								When Priyanka Gandhi stands for Prime Minister, I will be ecstatic, says Yousuf. While most are not particularly pleased with that idea, the infusion of young blood is definitely a bonus, they feel. There are too many lethargic, old and frankly unpresentable people in politics right now, and we need more young people, to attract the youth, is Sejutis opinion. Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi just echo Nehrus western values.																								So what if it involves dynastic politics. Its the same in Bollywood. They failed us, and if the politicians do the same, then they will not be elected again. But at least some young people are interested, adds Shilpa Dhanothia, a 19-year-old student of JD Birla College.																								They would prefer Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister, but Rahul and Priyanka entering politics is good for the party and the country, as well. My father sees Indira Gandhis charisma in Priyanka. Although I dont think of Sonia Gandhi as an Indian  she still cant speak Hindi properly  her children are, feels Vidhi. But Vajpayee is possibly the best leader this country has had, even if he sometimes sleeps through meetings. And the rest agree.																								Presidency College sociology student Sukanchi Gooptu has no such language bias against Sonia, but she would rather not have her heading the country. But her children, from the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, are different. They have their own personalities, too, which adds to their family background. But Sangeet feels that it is not enough for the Congress to come to power. Lets see what alliances they form to get into government																								As for the important issues now, they are stability, agriculture, education and employment. And, of course, continued friendship with Pakistan.

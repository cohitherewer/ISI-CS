The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Boom time promise for the business of sound
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 On song at ITC Sonar Banglas pub Dublin, courtesy Bose audio																								Bose has finally found a local address to boom from. Nearly a decade and hundreds of satisfied customers in Calcutta later, Bose Corporation has set up an office here. Although not a retail outlet, Camac Street now boasts a Bose professional systems office and service centre, the fifth in the country.																								In our home-audio sales section, from the retail outlets in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, Calcutta scores number one, explains Ratish Pandey, general manager of Boses India operations. People here are partial to Bose, because they are very music-oriented, and have good ears. You dont have to be tech savvy to appreciate good quality sound. We came to this city three times last year with road shows, which received very good responses.																								Thus far, however, the Calcutta consumer has had to take a trip out of town to buy Bose  a company set up by half-Bengali, MIT graduate Dr Amar G. Bose in 1964. Now, the new office will provide audio-video and control system solutions for public spaces and businesses, like hotels, restaurants, shops, auditoriums, cineplexes, offices, stadiums and even private homes, in the eastern region. The direct to customer centre will mean customised systems for Calcuttans.																								The reason, explains Pandey, is simple  a rising demand. After doing the audio, and sometimes visual, systems in a few stores and star hotels, like MusicWorld and ITC Sonar Bangla, an increasing number of inquiries has come in from professional organisations in the past few months for sound solutions, forcing Bose Corporation to open a city office. There was too much travelling for comfort, and it was not viable.																								But business is booming, and the expectations are of a further rise with a local office. Calcuttans either buy the lower-end products, or the high-end stuff. And there are plenty who are willing to pay for good sound, adds Pandey. Besides, for businesses, it enhances the atmosphere, and is an investment.																								Waiting in store is a retail outlet in Calcutta, although not immediately. We want to open a shop here, but as any retail guru will tell you, location is everything. We need to find the right spot first. We havent started looking yet, but we do have plans for one, says the general manager, adding that the company is definitely in expansion mode, with another office lined up for Chennai in the next eight months.

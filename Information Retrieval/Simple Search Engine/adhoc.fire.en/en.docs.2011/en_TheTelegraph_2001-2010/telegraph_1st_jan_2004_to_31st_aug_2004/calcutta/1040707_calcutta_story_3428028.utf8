 SANGITA S. GUHA ROY																								If neuroscientist Avijit Chaudhuri suffers from tunnel vision these days, one cant hold it against him. For, hes striving to create an artificial eye for the blind to give the visually-impaired just that  tunnel vision.																								The 45-year-old Montreal-based scientist, now spending time with family in the city of his birth, is part of a team working on a prosthetic (artificial) device that he hopes will actually enable blind people to see.																								It wouldnt be the kind of vision you and I are used to, but a very grainy, black-and-white sort of tunnel vision, says Chaudhuri. This device will only generate low-resolution images. As opposed to a real eyeball that delivers about one million nerve fibres to the brain, the artificial eye will only have 1,000 fibres.																								But then, adds Chaudhuri, this will only be a first-generation device and its success will pave the way for future improvements.																								Having got his doctorate at Berkeley under Nobel laureate Donald Glaser, Chaudhuri is presently full professor in neuroscience and holds the James McGill chair at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. The passion for researching the brain and its relationship with visual behaviour has led him to grapple with a technology that is fraught with a host of complexities.																								The concept, though, is straightforward  a miniature video camera that will send real-time video images to the brain. The device will first transform the optical images into electrical signals to be then converted into a code that the brain responds to. 																								These coded signals will be sent through an array of fine needles (electrodes) directly into the part of the brain that processes visual information, bypassing the normal eye-to-brain circuit through a video device.																								The results of this study have appeared in the journal Brain, with another paper ready to go into Neurology, says Chaudhuri, heading the biological team and working on the interface between the digital device and the brain.																								We are hoping to develop a prototype in the next three years and then proceed to the testing phase, says Chaudhuri. We stand to gain most by the success of our project as India has the maximum number of blind people in the world, he sums up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Doi gets a label
																								Mishti doi with an international label is what Calcutta can spoon its way through this Poila Baisakh, with Nestl launching its yoghurt range in the city on Tuesday.																								Having made a mark in other metros, the largest dairy company in the world is trying to change the way the Calcutta kitchen works, too. It has started out with two products  Set Dahi and Mishti  while flavoured varieties like mango and strawberry will soon follow. 																								While mishti doi and a few flavoured variants are currently being made by Mother Dairy, the organised segment has so far steered clear of what has been seen as the housewifes preserve  plain doi.																								The pricing and brand positioning is such that the Set Dahi is a product that you would pick up for a family meal, explains Prashant Jalan, of Bengal Nestors Industries, east India manufacturing partner of Nestl. The first two flavours will be in store fridges by Wednesday.																								Stirred yoghurt with fresh fruit  also a first for the city  will join the portfolio as soon as the FPO green signal comes through. With three per cent fat, the flavoured range has taken on ice creams as a healthy option in other cities, adds Jalan. But made with imported fruit, these are likely to be slightly more expensive. 																								This also marks the beginning of Nestls manufacturing activities in the east. Nestls milk tetrapacks will soon become more affordable, with local packaging to start shortly. This is expected to bring the prices down from the current Rs 26 per litre.																								The Set Dahi comes in 200 ml packets for Rs 10. Throw in another Rs 5 for a pack of Mishti of the same size, while the single serving of 85 ml will cost Rs 6.50.																								The company also promises a more hygienic product than what is currently available on the market. The whey found on the surface of packaged mishti doi now, explains Jalan, will not be found in the new brand, decreasing chance of spoilage and sourness.

 Ankita SanchetiAnkita Sancheti																									Might well be her nickname, for Ankita sure has a reason for it. The ex-Modern High School student is famous for her prowess in athletics, in track and field events, be it 100 and 200 m sprints, hurdles or high jump. In fact, in the final sports day of her school career this January, the 18-year-old was given the athlete of the year award.																									The house captain and prefect is, in truth, for Baby Rani is all set to carry the Olympic flame in Delhi in June. The best all-rounder of Modern High in the 2003-04 batch has represented her school in athletics meets like the one organised by the YMCA where she struck gold and silver for herself and the team.																									Shes equally comfortable. The member of the school basketball team has taken part in several inter-school tournaments. And while being a member of the Bengal Rowing Club swimming team led her to the Saturday Club sports carnival, she has participated in other competitions, too. 																									Sweet Jaw is, too (her passion for sweets prompted that alias). Initially trained in classical dances like kathak and Manipuri, she later took up contemporary dance at Padatik. Has always been a part of the annual stage shows. She could often be found on the inter-school fest stage, making the right moves in the western dance category.																									Is another of Frustys talents  as she is known to her friends. Flower arrangement is a hobby she has honed into skill, through numerous workshops and participation in school and Agri Horticulture Society of India competitions, unfailingly winning either first or second place, especially with her favourite western style arrangements. 																									Is Ankita. Sketching and painting are a mode of relaxation. The hobby might take a more serious turn though, if she decides to take up fine arts as a subject at University of Pennsylvania, USA, where shes headed in September this year, to study maths and economics. Sketching shes determined to continue with. But a lawyer is what she wants to become.

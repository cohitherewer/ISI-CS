The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Directive and deadline bite the dust
 JAYANTA BASU raquo; New pollution under control (PUC) checking system for all categories of vehicles to be put in place by April 1, 2004 raquo; Finalisation of plans by the state government for augmentation of city public transport system, not later than April 1, 2004																								This was the time-line set by the national auto fuel policy for in-use vehicles in 10 cities, including Calcutta, in October 2003. And there was everything official about it  formulated by the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas and approved by the Cabinet.																								But the Bengal government has hardly moved a muscle to meet the two April 04 deadlines. And those partially responsible for cleaning the Calcutta air remain clueless about both directive and deadline.																								I have absolutely no idea about any such deadlines fixed for Calcutta by the central government, said Asim Banerjee, secretary, auto emission testing centres, on Tuesday. The state government has not conveyed anything to me, added the head of the private nodal body.																								As per the auto fuel policy strictures, the PUC centres must be fully computerised, have multi-gas analysers, a webcam, be connected online with the regional transport authority and the public vehicles department, and be equipped with revolution per minute (RPM) meters.																								Cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore have started upgrading their PUC centres on the lines of the auto fuel policy directives, but Calcutta is conspicuous by its absence of effort.																								With the calendar reading April 6, 2004, the 80-odd PUC units in the city are nowhere close to meeting the norms. Most do not even have the basics in place, like a qualified motor mechanic, as laid down by the state transport department norms.																								A state pollution control board (PCB) study last year had put all 38 PUC units surveyed in the D category for want of adequate machine and manpower. A February 2004 upgrade date had been set by the PCB for the units, which came and went without any visible action.																								In 1997, we had studied the PUCs. There has hardly been any upgrade since, said S.M. Ghosh of SMG Hai.																								Public vehicles department director H. Mohan, however, blamed the non-availability of multi-gas analysers for the failure to upgrade.																								As for plans to augment the city public transport system by April 1, the less said the better. Case in point: a seminar on Bharat Stage II last Saturday found transport minister Subhas Chakraborty holding forth on everything, from Sputnik to September 11, except for any concrete plan for Calcuttas transport system.

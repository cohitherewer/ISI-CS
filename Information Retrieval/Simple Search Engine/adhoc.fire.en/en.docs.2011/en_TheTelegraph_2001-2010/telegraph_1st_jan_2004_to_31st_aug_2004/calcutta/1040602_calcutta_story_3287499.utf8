The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Bulging brawn is in
				 	 Salman sando Khan: less is more																								Weather forecast for men: lots of sweat with or without the summer sun beating down. The result: scantily clad hunks turning up the heat in slinky singlets and sandos. Yes, more boys are doing a Salman Khan or Hrithik Roshan, showing off those bulging biceps.																								Women have been making fashion statements every summer in a variety of cuts and shapes, but for men its been pretty much straight-jacketed, says Jaya Mathur, a shopkeeper in Sreeram Arcade, stocking up on singlets featuring embossed, painted and appliqud motifs, mostly the sporty kind.																								This year has seen great demand in this section as men tried to equal their female counterparts with a display of fashion consciousness, she adds.																								The trend is global, says designer Shantanu Goenka, whose own creations for the mens segment are largely restricted to kurtis and sherwanis.																								Trends in mens wear are dictated by established brands in the west. Indian labels are yet to make a breakthrough in this segment. Since brands like Prada, Armani and Gucci are churning out trendy singlets, the Indian market has no option but to catch on, he observes.																								What started out essentially as a sports wear item, with basketball, soccer and tennis singlets in a variety of cuts and fits, has gone on to acquire casual-wear status. 																								Thus cotton and dri-fit singlets from Adidas, Speedo, Puma, Reebok and Nike are not just being lapped by the Bhaichung Bhutias and Rohan Gavaskars of the city.																								I like the macho yet trendy look of a singlet and have virtually started living in them, says 19-year-old Rajiv, seen cooling off at a popular caf in a Nike tee.																								Those looking for interesting designs can turn to Shoppers Stop, Weekender, Pepe, Spykar, Benetton, Levis and Dockers for a variety of finishes and motifs. The Combat series from Pepe packs in a rugged look with sleeveless collared shirts and frayed trims in dirty colours separating the men from the boys. Brands like Weekender and Spykar present a peppy look in dual shades of white and blue as well as the brightest of reds in loose stretch knits.																								There are cheaper options of unbranded singlets available in shops and on pavements for as little as Rs 50, which make for use-and-throw wear.																								If you drop into my house unannounced, chances are youll find me lounging about in singlets and three-quarters or pyjamas, says actor Jeet, also can be seen sporting the same look in a number of scenes in his forthcoming film Shakti.

 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Sujoy still scot-free
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The hunt for Sujoy, prime suspect in the Maidan murder case, has drawn a blank. 																								After laying a month-long trap at the alleged killers village in Bihar, the sleuths have returned empty-handed. 																								Sujoy had a providential escape. He fled hours before we raided his home, said an officer of the team that had been to Bihar.																								Late on May 30, the mutilated body of 29-year-old Sabita Roy, identified two months after the murder, was found on the Maidan  a few metres from a Metro Railway cooling station. She was strangled with her dupatta. 																								The post-mortem revealed that Sabita had her ribs broken, kidneys damaged and mud stuffed into the mouth to prevent her from screaming.																								She was seen entering the deserted Maidan with a man. A guard at the cooling station heard her cry out: Sujoy, amaar saathe tumi erokom korte paro na (Sujoy, you cannot do this to me).																								These words gave us the killers name. And it was the only clue we had at the initial stage of the probe, said an investigating officer. 																								The detective department, which had been working on the case, failed to make any further breakthrough. Neither could the woman be identified, nor could the killer be tracked down. 																								It was Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south), who received a tip-off about the victims identity. Sabita was a widow and a mother of two. She worked as a domestic help at 6A, Nandalal Jiu Road.																								Soon after, a police team left for Madhubani, in Bihar. Our probe revealed that Sujoy was a driver and a resident of Manoharpukur Road. We also came to know that he had been missing since May 31, a day after Sabita was killed, said an officer.																								On reaching Sujoys village, the sleuths learnt that he had visited his home on the night of May 31. He left early on June 1. We didnt find anything wrong in his behaviour, Sujoys relatives told the sleuths. 																								We reached there three hours after Sujoy had left. We searched the nearest bus stop and the railway station. But he couldnt be spotted, said a sleuth. The team decided to stay put in a nearby town. Sujoys home was under vigil around the clock and all his relatives homes were raided. But we failed to net him, the officer lamented.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Tainted water reports trigger tests around town
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Reports of contamination in drinking water in different parts of Calcutta have led the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to scurry to test the water being supplied to all 141 wards of the city.																								According to the action plan, the WBPCB will send out teams across the city; they will collect water samples, test them and submit the findings to the CMC. Under special focus will be schools, colleges, hospitals and housing complexes, say senior pollution control board officials. Apart from the bacteriological test, other tests (to ascertain the percentage of arsenic and other contaminants) will also be conducted.																								The CMC has welcomed the move, with mayor Subrata Mukherjee promising to take corrective steps after getting the reports from the WBPCB labs.																								We have a state-of-the-art laboratory to test the quality of water, WBPCB chairman Hirak Ghosh said, adding that the reports would be submitted to the CMC as soon as possible. A regular check on the quality of water and the contaminants entering the CMC pipelines would help the civic authorities fight the spread of enteric and other water-borne diseases, he felt.																								Referring to earlier tests conducted in areas within the CMC jurisdiction, Ghosh admitted that faecal contamination had been found in some samples. In some areas like Garden Reach, Behala and Jadavpur, we found harmful bacteria in the samples, he added. Reports had been submitted to the CMC then as well, WBPCB officials said.																								The boards move to collaborate with the Corporation comes in the wake of adverse reports from several areas (like Behala, Jadavpur, Kasba, Tangra and Burrabazar) where people are found to suffer from enteric disease and other ailments affecting the stomach.																								An initial probe by the CMC found that leaking pipelines transporting potable water to homes were to blame. Often, potable water was found to have come in contact with sewer-lines, officials said, adding that it was this situation that led the CMC to contact the pollution control board.																								We have information that underground pipelines have cracked in several areas, resulting in contamination, the mayor said. The areas have been identified and repairs were being ordered. If the board provides us the reports regularly, we shall be able to take faster action, he said.																								Chief engineer, water supply, Dibyendu Roychowdhury said the CMC was also planning to test the water of different swimming pools, artificial lakes and amusement parks. We have already prepared a list of such pools and parks, and talks are on with the WBPCB on how to go about the job, he added. Hurt in resisting heist:  Two men were injured when they tried to resist five robbers  from looting a shop in Posta on Saturday afternoon. Both  the injured were admitted to a city hospital. Their condition  is critical. According to police, five youths, carrying  revolvers and choppers, raided the shop. But when the employees  raised an alarm, they cleared out with just Rs 2,000, a  police officer said. On being chased, one of the robbers  opened fire.

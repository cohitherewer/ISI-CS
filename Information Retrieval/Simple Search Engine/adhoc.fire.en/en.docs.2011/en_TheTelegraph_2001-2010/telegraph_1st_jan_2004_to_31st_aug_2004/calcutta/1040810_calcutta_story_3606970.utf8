 Tara Deshpande in a still from the film Bada Din
	After Farah Khans comic-book version of St Pauls (school, not college, as many viewers of Main Hoon Na assumed) an alumnus-cum-film-maker is keen on capturing his cradle as it was some three decades ago. With Bow Barracks Forever set for a December release, Anjan Dutt is making the most of his spare time scripting his third feature film set in the Darjeeling school.
	 I was very annoyed to see my school premises being turned into a dancing ground by Shah Rukh Khan and his team in Main Hoon Na, grumbles Dutt, now working out the formalities to start shooting next year when the sky clears over Darjeeling. The film, in Hindi and English, will rake up memories of his good ol boarding school days in the hill station, and allow him to revisit Darjeeling cinematically after Bada Din.
	With four devilishly naughty high school boys  hailing from Christian, Bengali, Punjabi and Muslim families  Dutt is weaving a tale on the transition from adolescence to adulthood. There arent too many good teenage films in our country perhaps Bobby was, a little bit. This story had germinated even before I started work on Bada Din, but I didnt get a producer then, adds the film-maker.
	 Casting the four boys will be the biggest challenge. I will need very expressive and strong actors, feels Dutt, scouting for fresh faces, mostly among high school pass-outs with some theatre background. 
	The Punjabi boy is the protagonist and the film is set in the Darjeeling of Seventies, is all Dutt is willing to reveal at the moment.  Cameron Diaz: Animated presence
	After a torrid time on the personal front (with too much of her on the Net and all that), Cameron Diaz returns as Princess Fiona in Shrek 2 this September, at the city multiplexes. The first part of Shrek was, of course, a big success and went on to grab the Oscar for best animated feature in 2001.
	 In the sequel, Fiona along with her ogre husband Shrek (Mike Myers) travels to Far Far Away Land to meet her parents, the king and queen (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Theres donkey (Eddie Murphy) who comes along for the ride, and a couple of new characters in the form of the fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and her son, the Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). And then theres the big surprise in Puss In Boots (todays birthday boy Antonio Banderas, if you please) who is assigned to slay Shrek. 
	Diaz, who has slowed to a crawl in this stage of her career, has got just another big project lined up  the 2005 Curtis Hanson film In Her Shoes, where she plays a fun-loving wild girl, not ready to accept any responsibility. In real life though, Diazs friends feel that Theres Something (wrong) About Mary. She is no longer the fun-loving girl she always was, they lament. So, if you are Diaz devotee do keep your audio date with Princess Fiona next month. 
	The king of kungfu is no more, but his admirers have stayed loyal to him and his craft on screen. If Bruce Lees steely sinew, threatening stare and faster than lightning moves in Enter the Dragon are perennial favourites on beam, martial arts itself is becoming a major draw on the small screen.  Bruce Lee: Trend-setter, on the telly
	Even as Bollywood action-man Akshay Kumar is giving viewers lessons in the Seven Deadly Arts on National Geographic Channel, Zee English is launching a martial art series, called Kung Fu. The Emmy Award-winning series is a collection of ancient as well as modern types of fighting techniques or martial arts practised all over China. Kung Fu is set in the 1870s west American wilderness and follows the travails of a half-American, half-Chinese Buddhist monk, who after avenging the death of his teacher, crisscrosses the wild terrains, fighting intolerance and injustice with his mastery of the ancient form of high combat. The action hots up as bounty hunters pursue him for the price declared on his head. 
	Speaking at the launch of the show, Abhijit Saxena, the channels business head, said: Zee English has received a lot of success in screening action drama. The launch of the new series is our response to this positive audience feedback. quot; 
	Todays youth, according to Saxena, are ardent fans of action films and we are sure that this show will have them hooked with unlimited action and adventure. 
	The spin-kicks and flying leaps come our way from Tuesday at 8 pm. 
	With big sporting events come big contests and with big contests come big prizes. So even as you watch Anju Bobby George, Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi and the rest trying to keep Indian sporting hopes alive at Athens, you can actually take home Samsung home theatres, mobile phones, camcorders and some really cool Discovery merchandise. As part of the build-up to the forthcoming Athens Olympic Games, Discovery Channel is organising Back2Athens, an SMS-based contest, for all mobile subscribers from across the country.
	 The contest will give viewers an opportunity to win mega prizes that will add to the excitement. In keeping with the season, we are also running a special series The Athens Games Specials, said Aditya Tripathi, director, marketing, Discovery Communications India. To take part, one can tune into the channel or visit www.discoverysamsung.com online. This 10-day interactive contest starts from August 6 and ends on August 15. 
	Our partnership with Discovery is in sync with our sports marketing strategy which will revolve around the Athens Olympic Games 2004, said Shubhodip Pal, senior manager, marketing, Samsung India. The contest is also an opportunity to strengthen our brand saliency, reach out to our target consumers and get viewer interest for the Games going. 
	And it doesnt even matter if you do not win -- after all, participation is the thing about the Olympics. Right? 
	Did you know? For every ball bowled in every cricket broadcast, there is a senior person in the production team who calls the shots literally. He has his eye on every camera beaming the images (and theyre usually as many as 16) and constantly calls out which one should go on air  all in real time. He and his team (the cue directors) sit in a specially designed container that resembles a small room and must be shipped to every venue. 
	The toughest part  there are no breaks allowed. From the first ball to the last in every inning, the whole crew cant look away from the monitor even for a moment. Imagine the concentration level required, not to mention the willpower to wish away the wash room.

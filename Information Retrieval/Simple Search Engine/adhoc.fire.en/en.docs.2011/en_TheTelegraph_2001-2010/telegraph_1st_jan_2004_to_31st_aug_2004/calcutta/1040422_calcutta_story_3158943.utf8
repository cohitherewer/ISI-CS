The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Power tunes, pop beat 
				 	 A night to rave about at Tantra, where electronica is catching on. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								A thumping groove to gyrate to after a hard days grind. Thats the mantra the work hard, party hard brigade swings by, preferably to soothing, repetitive noises, synthesised to put a person into a relaxed trance. No, we arent talking Goa, theres much to rave about right here in Calcutta.																								Underground may never go above ground, but there are plenty of party people who go overboard about it. Stress-busting electronica has woven its synthetic web about town, even if it is largely limited to a niche crowd. While it may yet have a way to go before giving Bollywood remixes a run for their rage (if it ever can), the beat has broken more than a few musical barriers.																								Case in party point: The Smirnoff Submerge party held at Tantra recently, with MTV VJ Nikhil Chinappa and British DJ Lee Coffey mixing it up. The nightclub is looking to host a similar party every month and resident DJ Lloyd has done his best to introduce Calcutta to the new sounds on lean days.																								The younger crowd here takes very well to electronic sounds, but for the older generation the taste is still retro, explains Lloyd. Reason enough to play it safe on weekends, when a mixed crowd takes over.																								House and techno may be a religion the world over today, but 90 per cent of music sales in India is dominated by Hindi film music, stresses Nikhil.																								A Smirnoff Experience party that invites electro gurus like DJs Paul Van Dyke and Nasha does draw in a huge crowd of 5,000 to 6,000 in Mumbai and Bangalore, but thats still a very small number in the context of the popularity of Hindi music.																								Anywhere else in the world, such a huge turnout would deem a party popular rather than underground. Not here, says Nikhil. Mainstream Indian music (especially Hindi remixes) does, however, reflect traces of electronica-influenced sounds. Electronic music has a lot of energy and when combined with old tunes and rhythms, works its magic not only with the young but with the older crowd as well, says Lloyd.																								R.D. Burman was one of the first to plug into the power of such sounds and a lot of his hits featured powerful, synthetically-induced beats. They are being reinvented today with new-age digital studio samples and rap interludes for GenX to rock to the high-octane energy of RD remixed.																								Going with the electro mood are energy drinks like Red Bull and Shock, targeting the young guns, big time. And only a 130 to 140 bmp sound sequence will get a party going, which is what genres like trance, techno, tribal house, funky house, progressive house and the brand new trip hop are all about.																								Sing-along tracks are there to stay, but if you really want to sweat it out, theres nothing like electronica, Lloyd recommends.			Taking computer-induced synth sounds with or without acoustic samples to another extreme is lounge music, dominating airports and multiplexes. French DJ Le Tone, in town recently to release French Touch, a lounge compilation produced especially for India, terms lounge the sound of the future.																								Lounge will rule closed spaces like bars, airports, restaurants, malls and multiplexes, completely changing the ambience and experience of our existence as a result of spending a huge amount of time at such places, prophesied the blue-eyed Frenchman. 																								The future is yet to unfold, but the tone is clearly set. Technology is constantly pushing the parameters of music and the sheer energy of electronica has the gang hooked. The electro sounds, say those tuned in, will become mainstream in about five years when the future becomes the present.																								Raise an energy drink to that!						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

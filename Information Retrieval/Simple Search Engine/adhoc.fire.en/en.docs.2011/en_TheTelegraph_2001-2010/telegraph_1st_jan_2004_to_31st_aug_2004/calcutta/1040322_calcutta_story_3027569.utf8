 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Film-maker Goutam Ghose readies former chief minister Jyoti Basu for a shot. Picture by Aranya Sen																								He is ready, please come in, Joykrishna Ghosh says softly, throwing open the door to a cool, spacious but fusty room. Filmmaker Goutam Ghose troops in, with Arriflex camera, reflectors and crew in tow.																								As Ghose shouts silence, the camera inches up from the edge of the bed to the man a few months from his 91st birthday, in a pin-striped white shirt and lungi, immersed in a book with reading glasses on.																								A few minutes into the shot, Jyoti Basu gazes up and says: Aar na, anek hoyechhe (Thats enough, not any more). The air of authority is unmistakable.The next moment, he breaks into half a smile: Amake to tomra actor baniye chharley (You people have turned me into an actor).																								A sultry Saturday noon found the former chief minister of Bengal in a languid mood  flipping through the pages of Joseph Stiglitzs Globalization and its Discontents in his quiet bedroom. So quiet, that the feeble sound from the streets melted into the whirring of the ceiling fan.																								It was just the mood film-maker Ghose wanted to capture in his documentary on the countrys longest-serving chief minister, during the last daylong shoot at Indira Bhavan, Salt Lake.																								It has been a bit taxing for him at this age, but Jyotibabu is full of life and has a very sharp memory, says Ghose, who has conceived the documentary as a chronicle of the political evolution in the Indian sub-continent through the leaders experiences.																								With a few more frames of Basu relaxing on the verandah in the late afternoon  when the veteran leader talked about his loneliness: Onek priyojon chole gechhe (So many of my loved ones are gone)  Ghose all but wrapped up the seven-year-long project.																								These days, Basu prefers to stay indoors, spending most of his time with the printed word  from current affairs to fiction. 																								Thrillers are what he likes best and Jeffrey Archer is a favourite. He keeps exchanging books with my elder sister and has recently passed on a few of APJ Abdul Kalams books, says Lucy, the 15-year-old daughter of Joykrishna Ghosh.																								A peek into Indira Bhavan reveals just how simple and solitary a life the charismatic leader leads now. There is no battery of domestic helps to fuss around Basu. He is a very small eater, with lunch being a simple menu of fish, rice and vegetables.																								The large white building surrounded by manicured lawns seems to swallow in its lone celebrity inhabitant, who is cocooned among books, newspapers, old but ornate wooden furniture and the sepia-tinted photographs in his ground-floor room. 																								The bedside table is stacked with phials of medicine, beside which stands a photograph of wife Kamal Basu.																								Sir (Basu) has become very lonely ever since boudi passed away. His outings are limited to party meetings and private gatherings, like weddings. He isnt even fond of watching TV, says Joykrishna Ghosh.																								But with the Lok Sabha polls closing in, wont Basu inch closer to the action? He will campaign, but not too far, maybe around Howrah, Hooghly or Nadia, reveals Basus Man Everyday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Mall mania: Yesterday, today and tomorrow
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Hes in his 30s but looks younger. He appears to be a fitness freak, lean and thin, with possibly a mean streak that remains hidden under a ready smile and twinkling eyes. But unlike Shakespeares Cassius, he is not dangerous. On the contrary, he is actually pleasant, suave, articulate and has a sense of humour. Explaining how he had to take over the mantle of family business and marry at an early age, he adds that he did go back to college but dropped out after finding his friends still busy whistling at girls. Meet Rahul Saraf, who promoted Forum, the mall and the multiplex on Elgin Road.																								Forum has been a runaway success, but for the parking nightmares. Saraf apologetically acknowledges the problem. Provision, he says, was made for parking 270 cars, but the arrangement turned out to be inadequate. He is looking for adjacent plots on which he can put up a hydraulic parking lot. The complex, he claims, has been attracting 75,000 footfalls every week and barring a few shops, others are more than happy. Ground-floor outlets in shopping malls, he points out, are generally prized and come at a premium. But thanks to the multiplex and the restaurant, Oh Calcutta, it is Forums fourth floor that attracts the majority of visitors, leaving outlets on other floors a little high and dry.																								Parking nightmares do remind Saraf of his original American consultants. The mall and the multiplex that he dreamt of putting up, they bluntly told him, would require no less than 150 acres of land. This was the late 90s and on several occasions, the state government, he recalls, offered him 25 to 30-acre plots on the Bypass. Each time, the consultants would throw up their arms and reject the sites. After waiting for several years, Saraf finally lost his patience and decided to put up something on the five acres that the family owned on Elgin Road.																								The plot was deemed suitable for an office complex. Saraf initially planned to have a rooftop club, gym, sauna, swimming pool, etc, where executives and their guests could retire after a hard days work. It was after the construction of the building had progressed considerably that the plans were altered. The retail bug and his old dream of putting up a multiplex re-surfaced and for a change, the new consultants agreed to translate the idea on the relatively small plot. But the multiplex required depth for the screens and even the consultants were at a loss, till the area demarcated for the swimming pool came in handy, Saraf recalls with a chuckle.																								Those who have not been to the multiplex during the past few weeks would have missed out on the food court on the fifth floor  open to only those who have purchased tickets to watch one of the films. Its open till late at night and provides a variety of food at reasonable prices. But the best part is that you pay at just one counter and obtain a smart card that keeps on debiting amounts as you flit from one stall to another, trying out dishes. For large groups, it holds out the advantage of allowing each one to opt for a different dish from a different counter. It saves the stall-owners the bother of handling cash.																								Rahul is gung-ho about the future of the city and explains why. In Mumbai, he points out, people may have disposable income but spend so much time on commuting that but for weekends, its difficult for huge malls to ensure a steady stream of visitors. New Delhi, on the other hand, is getting restricted into self-sufficient residential colonies, like Noida, Gurgaon or Ghaziabad, limiting in the process the number of visitors.																								In Calcutta, on the other hand, he said with his tongue in cheek, people have much more time to spare. The city is also relatively small and hence, commuting time is short. People live in old, ancestral houses or pay very little as rent here; the number of double-income families is rising and so is the aspiration level. Thats why, he feels, Calcutta has a better chance to see a retail boom. He is already planning his next mall.																								If the visitor has the time and the inclination, Saraf wastes little time in making a presentation on his laptop. Fifty of the Fortune 500 companies, he claims, are retail companies and the worlds largest company, Walmart, is a retail company, last valued at Rs 1,091,250 crore whew! McDonalds, his presentation states, captures one out of every six restaurant visits in the United States, is the largest employer (sic) of high-school students and is deemed to be the nations largest job training organisation  bigger than the US Army  in inculcating work routine, job discipline and teamwork.																								There is a mall mania sweeping the country, says Saraf. Announcements for more than 250 malls had been made in the country till last year. But then, the Indian consumer, he warns, is a difficult customer. Right pricing, right product-mix, changes and good management will be required to retain his loyalty.

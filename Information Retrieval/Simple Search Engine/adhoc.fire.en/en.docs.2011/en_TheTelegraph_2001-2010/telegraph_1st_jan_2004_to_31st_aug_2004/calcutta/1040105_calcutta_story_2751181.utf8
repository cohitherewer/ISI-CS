 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Cablemen cry rate hike strike
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Cable TV operators in Howrah have decided to observe a days token strike on January 7 to protest unreasonable hikes in pay channel rates by broadcasters in the New Year. As a result, cable homes in the twin-city will be blacked out for a day.																								Last-mile operators feeding cable homes across Calcutta are expected to follow in the footsteps of their Howrah counterparts soon, observing a days token strike to demonstrate their displeasure at the rate hikes by pay channels.																								The entire exercise is to make the viewers aware of the situation. We will first run a ticker on our network, spelling out the new rates of all the pay channels and also the monthly amount the viewer pays, before switching off for a day in protest, said an operator.																								Cablemen hoped this awareness drive would prepare the ground for the substantial hike in subscription they were planning to cope with soaring pay-channel rates. Even as uneven tariffs would prevent any consensus on the quantum of increase, the monthly bill for cable homes is expected to rise by Rs 50 on an average.																								Consumer forums have flayed the token strike call and opposed any hike in cable rates before CAS is rolled out. We wont accept any added burden to the consumer at this juncture and if rates are hiked, we will file a public interest litigation against all the parties involved in stalling CAS, said Federation of Consumer Associations of West Bengal president Mala Banerjee.

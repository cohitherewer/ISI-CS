 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Civic rule shift ahead for rainwater strategy
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								A major change is imminent in the civic building rules to make rainwater harvesting mandatory for buildings having a covered area more than 1,000 sq m and treatment plant for all centrally air-conditioned buildings.																								All centrally air-conditioned buildings should have their own waste-water treatment plants, too, and they will use the treated water for cooling.																								On a directive from mayor Subrata Mukherjee, municipal commissioner Debashis Som has directed engineers in the civic building and water supply departments to draw up a draft report on the necessity and possibility of harvesting rainwater in Calcutta.																								The civic body is drawing up encouraging packages for landlords to harvest rainwater, said Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer on special duty to the mayor. 																								In new constructions, more floor area ratio will be allowed to a plot-owner if he includes rainwater harvesting schemes in his building plans.																								Since water is scarce in Mumbai, the local civic body has already included rainwater harvesting in its building rules. It is mandatory in Mumbai to keep a provision for rainwater harvesting while developing plots with an area not less than 1,000 sq m, Ghosh pointed out.																								The state public health engineering (PHE) department, too, has started working out schemes for rainwater harvesting in the urban and the rural areas and to recycle the water for use.																								A joint meeting will be held between engineers of the PHE department and the civic body after the election to work out a practical solution for the preservation of rainwater.																								According to civic engineers, Calcutta receives 17,396 million gallons of rainwater a year, which works out to an average daily supply of 47 million gallons.																								Harvesting 50 per cent of the rain in the city would also mean 50 per cent less waterlogging after a heavy shower, they added. 																								The time is ripe for harvesting rainwater at the micro and macro levels and we have started thinking seriously on this score, said PHE department secretary Asim Barman.																								According to him, apart from using the rainwater directly after necessary treatment, it can be used to recharge the aquifers of the defunct tubewells and dry wells. We plan to try and recharge the aquifers of some defunct deep tubewells with rainwater, said chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury.																								A typical rooftop rainwater harvesting system, pointed out Roychaudhury, comprises a roof catchment, gutters, a down pipe, rainwater or stormwater drain, a filter chamber and a ground-water recharge structure, like a pit, trench and tubewell. The storage tank may be on the roof or underground. Proper chlorination ensures that the stored water is fit for drinking.																								Rainwater is acidic in nature and one tablespoon of baking soda to 100 gallons of rainwater collected make it fit for use, Roychaudhury elaborated.

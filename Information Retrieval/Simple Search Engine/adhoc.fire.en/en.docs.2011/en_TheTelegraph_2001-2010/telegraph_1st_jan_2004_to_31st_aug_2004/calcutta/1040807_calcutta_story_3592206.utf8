 															- TOWNSHIP TAKES UP CUDGELS AGAINST BILLBOARD BLITZ AT CROSSROADS SANJAY MANDAL				 	 Some of the billboards, big and small, that have sprung up along Salt Lakes crossroads and rotaries. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Salt Lake may be a planned township, but its billboards, besides being a source of visual pollution, are posing a major threat to traffic movement.																								Realising its error, Bidhannagar Municipality has decided not to renew the licences of the billboards at crossroads and rotaries. The civic body, simultaneously, will launch a drive against illegal billboards, quite a few of which have sprung up around City Centre. 																								We will not renew the licences of hoardings that have come up at rotaries and crossroads. They are distracting the attention of drivers, resulting in accidents, said Dilip Gupta, Bidhannagar Municipality chairman. 																								Gupta admitted that the civic body had not applied its mind to issuing licences for these billboards. The companies, he asserted, will be asked to shift the signboards. As for obscene billboards, there will no renewal of licence. 																								Salt Lake, Gupta is convinced, is turning into a billboard jungle. After City Centre was commissioned, a host of illegal billboards had sprung up around the pocket, considered to be a prime spot in the township. 																								Karunamoyee, too, is not lagging far behind. The situation has become alarming and we have to act tough. These hoardings have not been licensed and are causing visual pollution, Gupta said. 																								The civic body had recently brought down several illegal billboards around City Centre. People were erecting the billboards without any valid work order. We had handed over the errant advertisers to the police, the chairman said. 																								Chandan Ghosh, chairman of the civic bodys resource mobilising committee, said the authorities had also planned to speed up the collection of licence fee arrears. We will send demand notices to the companies, asking them to pay up their dues, as well as the current licence fees. 																								To identify illegal billboards, the municipality has decided to issue holograms to sponsors against payment. The holograms will have to be displayed on the billboards, Ghosh added. 																								There are around 300 billboards in the township, sponsored by 40 companies. For each billboard, the licence fee is Rs 209 per square foot. 																								Last year, after a massive collection drive, the municipality had earned around Rs 1 crore in licence fees and dues. This year, we are expecting to earn around Rs 75 lakh, Ghosh said.

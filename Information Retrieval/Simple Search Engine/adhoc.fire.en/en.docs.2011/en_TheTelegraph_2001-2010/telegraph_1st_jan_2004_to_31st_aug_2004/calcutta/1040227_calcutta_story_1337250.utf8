The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 File a suit online, Delhi model, from August
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Litigants from Calcutta and anywhere else in the state will soon be able to file cases online and obtain certified copies of the orders through a website, on payment by credit card.																								Calcutta High Court will be the second in the country to implement the system, after Delhi High Court, which will accept cases filed on e-mail from August. 																								The same software programme will be followed by both high courts, according to an official in the Union law ministry.																								Filing of cases online is part of the ministrys plans to modernise the legal system through the use of information technology. An initial sum of Rs 1.17 crore has already been sanctioned by the Centre for development of communication technology for Calcutta High Court. 																								The court authorities, in conjunction with the state government, have started implementing programmes under the new scheme.																								The law ministry official said Calcutta High Court, while hearing a case recently, put its seal of approval to technology upgradation in the judiciary system. In a recent case, the court allowed video-conferencing, as demanded by the litigant, a US-based doctor, an officer in the chief justices secretariat said.																								The innovation is part of the Rs 14.91-crore plan to use infotech in the judiciary of the four metros. The scheme includes electronic filing of documents and plaints, including affidavits to the courts and retrieval of certified copies of court orders, on payment through credit cards. Provision has also been made for video-conference links with jails, to do away with the need for transporting undertrials from the jails to court merely for the remand.																								This facility is intended at plugging security loopholes and effecting considerable savings in expenditure on transporting undertrials, said Uttam Majumder, executive chairman of the state Bar Council. Welcoming the tech upgradation, he said: We have to embrace new technology.																								A sitting judge of Calcutta High Court admitted that in the present system, there were a number of hazards, the litigants had to face to obtain a certified copy from the court. But I think filing cases online is not possible with this infrastructure, quot; he said.																								Justice B.P. Banerjee, former judge of Calcutta High Court, welcomed the move. 																								We are very much in favour of the developmental programme. While performing my duties in the high court, I had faced various problems for want of adequate infrastructure. Suppose an 80-year-old man wanted to depose before the court in a certain case. If video-conferencing is allowed, he doesnt need to be brought to court and can be interrogated on video, Justice Banerjee argued.

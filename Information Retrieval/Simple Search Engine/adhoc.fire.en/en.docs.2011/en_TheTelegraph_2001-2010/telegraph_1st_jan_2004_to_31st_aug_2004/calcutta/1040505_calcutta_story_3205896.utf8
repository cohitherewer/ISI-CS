	Traffic policemen find it difficult to jot down the licence numbers of some private cars as the plates also display the manufacturers logo and advertisement. The letters and digits of the licence number are therefore not displayed prominently. They also distract other drivers. About a decade ago, authorities intervened and stopped cars from displaying advertisements on number plates. Traffic police should take up the matter seriously. Tapan Pal, Batanagar 
	On April 20, certain pockets of Tollygunge suffered a power cut at around 12.30 pm. CESC inspectors revealed at around 2.30 pm that a cable fault had occurred. Local residents tried to contact the nearest CESC office many times over phone at around 4 pm. When they finally got through, the CESC staff disconnected the call without giving a reply. The CESC team arrived at 8 pm and carried on the work into the wee hours of the morning so as to avail of an overtime pay. Saumya Datta, Haji Mohsin Road

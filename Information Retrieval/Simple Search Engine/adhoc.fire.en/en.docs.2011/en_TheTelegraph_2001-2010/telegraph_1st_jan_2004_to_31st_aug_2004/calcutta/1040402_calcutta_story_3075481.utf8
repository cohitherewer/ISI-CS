The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Sri Lanka summer, Egypt autumn
 A STAFF REPORTER			The rupee has appreciated in value against the dollar, and the government is crowing about the latest GDP figures. In Calcutta, the Malaysian tourism board and Malaysia Airlines  although its touchdown at Dum Dum has been delayed  are opening up offices this month. The annual Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) meet is almost set for a September date in the city. And if Sri Lanka beckons in summer, Egypt could be the dream autumn destination.																								In short, the travel industry here is looking ahead to a busy season this summer, after last years poor show, plagued by SARS and shell-shocked by the Iraq war. To jumpstart the holiday hunt, Budget Tours, the conglomerate of four Calcutta-based travel companies, has organised a vacation sale and a roadshow.																								The occasion is the launch of its summer package tours (see box). Europe is going great guns, second only to Thailand and Malaysia, followed closely by Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. The new additions are Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Also available at the vacation sale will be Taj Holidays and Jet Escape trips to domestic destinations by popular demand.																								The aim of the sale, at The Park on April 3 and 4, is to get spot bookings. And the reward is a discount of 10 to 25 per cent. For instance, Rs 7,000 off on the Rs-50,000, 19-day trip to Europe. The roadshow, currently on at Forum, on Elgin Road, is getting a good response, according to the organisers.																								The idea is to give potential customers the opportunity to do some window-shopping, so that even if they dont buy now, they know whats available when they want to go on a holiday in the future, explains Prashant Binnany of Discovery Tours amp; Travels.																								Were very aggressive about selling, because there are enough customers buying, says Manoj Saraf of Gainwell Travel amp; Leisure. Thai Airways has increased frequency from three to five flights a week, and its going full up, as are the Indian Airlines daily departures to Bangkok. British Airways second flight, too, is doing well, as is Gulf Air. In fact, the only constraint to travel at the moment is a lack of enough flights.																								Saraf, also secretary of TAAI, adds that Calcutta is emerging as the hub of eastern India for travellers from the entire region. The dollar weakening might be bad for the tech industry, but its good for travel. Customers will get the packages at around seven per cent less than the original value.																								One year and 1,400 customers  despite one bad season  later, the feeling is of optimism. Egypt has been very popular, and we will launch it in the Puja package. With about 1,700 national and international professionals in the travel and hospitality industries gathering in Calcutta for the TAAI meet, the eastern region will definitely be the focus, signs off Saraf.

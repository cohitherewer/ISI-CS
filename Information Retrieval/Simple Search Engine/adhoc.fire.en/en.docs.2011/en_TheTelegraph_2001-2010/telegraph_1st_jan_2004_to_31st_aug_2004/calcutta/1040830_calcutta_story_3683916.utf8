 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Art for hearts sake
It is indeed commendable when artists of the young generation make an effort to revive lost and dying folk art traditions. Gallery Kanishkas exhibition of patachitras by Anwar Chitrakar is thus an attempt to recognize the commitment of this young artist for an art form, which though once popular, was slowly on its way to extinction. Chitrakarer Chitrakala, featuring works on all three forms of patachitra, including Midnapore pat, Kalighat pat and Santhal pat, reveals the amazing dexterity of the artist in visually narrating mythological episodes, village vignettes, religious rituals, folk tales, and much more. Defining various facets of life, the simple lines of his drawings make each figure speak a language that is typical to this art form, while his lilting voice, singing out the story of his paintings, mark his sincere efforts in keeping alive the oral traditions of the chitrakars.																								Event: An exhibition of patachitras																								When: Till August 31; 11am - 7.30 pm																								Where: Gallery Kanishkas 2/1 Hindustan Road

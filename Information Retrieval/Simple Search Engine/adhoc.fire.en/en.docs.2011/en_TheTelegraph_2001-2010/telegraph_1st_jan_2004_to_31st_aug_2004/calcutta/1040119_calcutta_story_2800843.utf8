 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Law slap for cop on duty
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								A traffic inspector on VIP Road is facing a departmental probe  a probable prelude to disciplinary action  for allegedly trying to prevent a central finance ministry official from blocking a part of the thoroughfare.																								The face-off dates back to last Monday, with traffic inspector Manik Ganguly and debt recovery tribunal additional judicial magistrate Arup Chakraborty narrating very different versions. Chakraborty shot off letters to senior North 24-Parganas police officials, demanding action against Ganguly for what he termed audacious behaviour. 																								Ganguly, who has been asked to offer a verbal explanation, claims he was just doing his duty, but the additional judicial magistrate turned on him with a vengeance.																								On Monday, Chakraborty was waiting for a bus at Baguiati, on VIP Road, at a spot that had been designated a no-stop point for public vehicles. Ganguly, who was directing everyone to the bus stop nearby, said: I asked him (Chakraborty) to go with the rest, but he started yelling at me. He said he was a judicial magistrate and asked me how dare I ask him to move. He was holding up the rush-hour traffic and so I told him to move on and stop bothering me, Ganguly later said.																								Chakraborty, who said he was waiting for his office car to pick him up, accused the traffic inspector of not only being rude in the manner he shooed him off but also of making offensive remarks about his clothes.																								On reaching his Salt Lake office, Chakraborty shot off a letter to superintendent of police Basudeb Bag. Deputy superintendent of police (traffic) Z. Rahman was entrusted with the case. Rahman has assured me that action will be taken. I am going to wait for a week, but if nothing happens, I am moving court, Chakraborty threatened.

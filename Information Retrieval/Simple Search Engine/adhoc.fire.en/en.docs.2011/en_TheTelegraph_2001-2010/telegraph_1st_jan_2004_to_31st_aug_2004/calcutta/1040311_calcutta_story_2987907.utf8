 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Same man held twice for same case in Howrah
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A district court has ordered an inquiry into the double arrest of a man by officers of two different police stations on the basis of a single first information report. The report cited his name, as well as his nickname.																								Howrah district judge H.P. Chattopadhyay has sought a report from Howrahs chief judicial magistrate on a complaint filed by a local social welfare organisation about the arrest. 																								The magistrate has also been asked to explain the unauthorised amendments to the certified copy of the chargesheet (no:27/2003, GR no. 649 of 2003) at Jagatballavpur police station. 																								Pashupati Mondal, alias Shankar, was arrested twice by Jagatballavpur police and Amta police. The officers-in-charge of two police stations did not take into consideration the fact that Pashupati and Shankar were the same individual.																								A spokesperson for the organisation said the arrest was made on the basis of a complaint filed by the owner of a factory and the charge was of looting the factory.																								The original case was filed by the factory-owner on May 2 and Mondal was arrested by Jagatballavpur police the same day. He was freed on bail on May 22. Thereafter, he was arrested by Amta police on June 19, on the same charge and on the basis of the same FIR.																								According to the organisation, Pashupati was released on bail but Amta police recorded him as absconding. 																								Asked what led to officials of the two police stations arresting Pashupati twice on the same charge, the spokesperson said the factory that had been raided was located in an area under Jagatballavpur police station jurisdiction, while Pashupati lived in the Amta police station area. 																								The spokesperson said Jagatballavpur police station investigating officer Shyamapada Mondal had made illegal corrections in red ink on the certified copy of the chargesheet to rectify the errors he had made in the original. 																								These anomalies, as well as the illegal corrections, which do not figure in the original chargesheet filed in court after Mondals first arrest, made the Howrah district judge order a probe. He has ordered that the report be submitted to him within March 16.

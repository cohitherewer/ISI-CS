The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 From the melting pot, a few murmurs of alienation
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Guests at Great Eastern Hotel shuffled uneasily and even the redoubtable Somnath Chatterjee, rarely at a loss for words, appeared stumped.																								The veteran parliamentarian was attending an interactive session with small businessmen. Organised by Prabha Khaitan Foundation, the session was conducted in the rashtra bhasha and Somnathbabu delivered his address in Hindi with aplomb. Businessmen fell over each other in praising his command over the language. Soon thereafter, a question-and-answer session got underway and that is when the unpredictable happened.																								A participant, clad in white, stood up and spoke with a studied deliberation. He claimed to have been offended by a statement made by the chief minister. When Bal Thackeray says something provocative, you always react. But why are you quiet when the West Bengal chief minister says something offensive ? he asked, before pointing out that several newspapers had quoted the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as saying that people from other states were destabilising conditions in West Bengal. Several heads nodded in agreement, as the speaker went on to describe how anguished Hindi-speaking people are at the comment.																								Chatterjee rose to the occasion and declared: Buddha cannot insult anyone. There must be some misunderstanding. I will look into it, but I can assure you that we are all proud of you and the contributions you have made. There is no question of accusing any community																								The hosts also came to the rescue by claiming that what the chief minister had in mind were refugees from Bangladesh, and not Marwaris from Burrabazar. They were probably right, especially since people like Arun Poddar, Kamal Gandhi, Harsh Neotia, Sanjeev Goenka and Sanjay Budhia have been the Left Fronts partners in progress. The chief minister probably had in mind the poorer migrant labourers pouring in from the neighbouring states.																								But participants made no secret of their feeling that they were being discriminated. Despite several requests and a meeting with Biman Bose, the government has done nothing to ensure question papers in Hindi at the Madhyamik or Uchcha Madhyamik stage, complained another participant. Somnath Chatterjee tried to deflect it by pointing out that Bose happens to be the Left Front chairman, and not the chief minister.																								A chorus of voices stopped him, as participants insisted that it was Bose who would take the decision, not the chief minister. Chatterjee looked around the hall and decided that a strategic retreat was a better idea. He would take up the matter with the Front chairman, he assured.																								Though the number of Hindi-speaking people in West Bengal, interjected a participant,  is much higher than those who speak Nepali, we continue to have questions in Nepali but not in Hindi. Others were quick to point out that Doordarshan Calcutta, too, had a Nepali news bulletin, but not one in Hindi.																								When a participant added that the state ought to have taken Hindi far more seriously, the parliamentarian sought to make light of the situation and declared that it was because Hindi-speaking people had picked up Bengali so well that Bengalis seldom felt the urge to learn Hindi.																								But the heart of the matter is that a large section of the people does feel alienated and seems to have little access to the powers that be. Metros are generally melting pots, drawing and then absorbing different races, languages and culture. Is it possible that the city has secretly harboured considerable contempt for Hindi-speaking people, especially people with little or no money?																								A more stringent criticism that Chatterjee faced related to the state governments seeming obsession with big business, disregarding in the process the contributions made by small units. One of the printers present described how small printing presses had not been paid their dues for publishing text-books. To add insult to injury, he added, the state government has now decided to get the books printed at Saraswati Press and at a higher cost. The decision will rob scores of small printing establishments of business and both skilled and unskilled workers of their jobs, he rued.																								This lot of businessmen appeared to be meeting Chatterjee for the first time. Obviously, there are segments in the city with which the government does not appear to be familiar.																								 Send me the details in writing, possibly through the Prabha Khaitan Foundation, and I will look into your complaints, declared Chatterjee. A secretary, had he accompanied the WBIDC chairman, could have taken notes and later kept the foundation posted about the action taken. The whiff of alienation was evident.

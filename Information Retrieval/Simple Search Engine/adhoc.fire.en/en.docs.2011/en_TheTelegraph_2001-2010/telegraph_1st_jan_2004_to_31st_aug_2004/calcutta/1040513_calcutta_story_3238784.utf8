 Amalin DattaIt was the end-80s. He had just finished his graduation from St Xaviers College. The job scene was pretty bad and I had nothing to do. An uncle brought news of a course in resort development at Illinois, Chicago. So I went over for six months, recalls Amalin Datta. 																								The course brought him in contact with the soil and its secrets. The exposure made me conscious of the poison that pesticides and chemical fertilizers spread in eatables. It is not enough to take food. One must have healthy food, reasons the 38-year-old bespectacled man, in his Broad Street office. 																								When he came back, it was natural that nature would beckon. The Datta family owned a plot of land in Ahmednagar, two stations from Bolpur. So Datta set off for a Spartan life at the Birbhum address.																								It was typical Birbhum terrain  dry and ragged but fertile. I did not want a fashionable farmhouse. It had to be the real thing. So the first months went in creating unplanned growth. Shrubs and undergrowth are vital for vixen to take shelter in or for migratory birds to choose as a landing pad. Soon, Dattas domain was shared by four-legged and feathered friends  wildcats, mongoose and ducks.																								But the real job was the farming. Here farmers are encouraged to buy chemical fertilizers. I had to tell my boys that I do not want bumper growth but a healthy yield.  Organic farming meant keeping watch over even the kind of grass the cattle grazed on. 																								The report of the soil test was encouraging. It was virgin soil crying for water. So we set up a shallow pump. Soon the labour started yielding fruits (and vegetables). Wheat, mustard, maze, tomato, potato we grew everything except cabbage and cauliflower, the satisfaction is evident at the memory on Dattas face.																								A space craft consultant today by profession, he proudly states how he learnt to do a farmers job, from preparing the land to reaping the harvest. I may not be an expert but I can do the job, he says. For three years, he earned Rs 2,000 a month and much happiness from the rural adventure.																								But being Sharbari Dattas son meant also having the aesthetic eye. In 1991, my mother and wife Kanaklata started the boutique Sharbari. It was an instant hit. So I had to come back to help ma. 																								Son of pioneer mural-maker Alokemoy, Datta had also picked up modelling early in life. I grew up in the midst of ceramic and clay and metal, he smiles. In 2002, he got his own space in Salt Lake. Thus was born LAtelier Amalin. This is where his dream is rooted today. I want to satisfy peoples interior and exterior decoration needs, is how he outlines his futurescape.

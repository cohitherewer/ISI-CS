The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Set to make a splash with a tune to hum
 SUDESHNA BANERJEEPritam chills out on home turf. Picture by Aranya Sen (Above) Tata Young on her visit to Mumbai in May																								Pritam Chakraborty has clocked many more miles in the musical marathon since he left his Entally home to study sound engineering at FTII, Pune, telling his father that it was an engineering course in a government college. Since he became part of the Jeet-Pritam duo and started the fight for a foothold in Bollywood. Since he tasted success with the Asha Bhosle-hit Sharara Sharara in Meri Yaar Ki Shaadi Hain.																								The music directors latest scalp: recording with the Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy Tata Young for Dhoom macha le (the English version of the song now on beam) from his upcoming film Dhoom.																								It was Adis (producer Aditya Chopra) idea to invite the pop star on board. The song she sings is in English with just the first line in Hindi. She was so quick in picking up the tune that we were out of the studio in two hours, he recalls.																								In town for a breather before the launch of the music of the Yashraj Films production, starring Abhishek Bachchan, Rimi Sen and Esha Deol, Pritam did his best to juggle the personal and the professional  queuing up at Kalighat to offer puja for the album, having lunch with old friends at new hotspots, going live on FM radio and rooting for Figo at his para club at night.																								Working with Yashraj is a unique experience. On one hand, there is the pressure of having to live up to the musical standards of films like Chandni and Lamhe. On the other you know you are in safe hands. Adi has the best musical ear among todays producers and gives great suggestions. As Dhoom is an action-comedy, Pritams brief was to make it catchy and hum-able. Thats exactly how the music is, he says, with Dhoom macha le by Sunidhi Chauhan and Dilbar by Abhijeet being touted as sure winners.																								Yet Pritam cannot rest easy. You never know how the music does till the film is released these days, he laments. The former bass guitarist with Chandrabindoo should know, having already burnt fingers with low-profile projects like Agnipankh and Fun2sh. Though Dhuan dhuan sa from one and Ishq ishq mein from the other still receive high rotation on radio, the films went down, taking all prospects of album sales with them. 																								Working for TV serials is better in that the songs at least get heard regularly by a lot of people, reasons the winner of Indian Television academy Award winner for best title song in 2003 (for the controversial Kashmir). Now I sign only films with big banners, good directors and big music companies.																								Though returning home after a year was fun, he hardly had the time to put his feet up. I have to rush back for the video shoot of Youngs Dhoom macha le, he smiles.

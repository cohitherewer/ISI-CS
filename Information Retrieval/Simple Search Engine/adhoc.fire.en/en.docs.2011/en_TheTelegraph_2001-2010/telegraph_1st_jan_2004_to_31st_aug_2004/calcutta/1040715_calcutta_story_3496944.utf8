 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Pal wife seeks to meet Buddha
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The wife of gynaecologist Sushil Pal, found murdered on the banks of Saraswati canal in Howrahs Sankrail, wrote a letter on Wednesday to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seeking an appointment. 																								Pals wife Kanika told Bhattacharjee in her letter that she wanted to meet him personally. The chief ministers office, however, is yet to give her the appointment.																								In another development, sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) ruled out any professional rivalry behind the death of the doctor attached to Serampores Walsh Hospital. It appears that the killing was a sequel to a long standing personal grudge, said an official at the CIDs Bhabani Bhavan headquarters. 																								The sleuths are now digging up details of Pals one-and-a- half-decade tenure in Jalpaiguri. He came here only two months ago. We dont think there was any Serampore link that might have triggered the killing, said the official.																								Sleuths on the case claimed on Wednesday that a breakthrough is expected soon. If everything goes well, the killers will be tracked down within a few days, said another official. 																								He added: We are confident that the assassins were not professionals. The nature of the injury marks on the victims body suggests that whoever the killers are, they are conversant with the human anatomy. They struck at the sensitive parts of Pals body. 																								The CIDs Jalpaiguri wing was asked on Wednesday to start a full-fledged probe into Pals tenure there. We asked them to submit a detailed report within two days, said an official.																								The sleuths on Monday disclosed that there was an abortion twist to the doctors murder. Pal had set off from his Bright Street home on Friday to Bandel, where he was to carry out two abortions at a private clinic. He was found murdered on the banks of a canal the next day. But we are still not sure about the reasons that prompted him to come to Bally, said the official.

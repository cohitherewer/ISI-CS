The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 The power puff, easy and exclusive
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE																								If Tintins Cigars of the Pharaoh is the closest youve come to over-the-counter sales of cigars in recent times, heres something for you to drag hard on.																								Godfrey Phillips is poised to push the power puff, and Calcutta, with its current retail boom, figures in its plans in a big way.																								By the end of this month, Calcuttans would be able to taste imported cigars the legal way, claims Arun Joshi, general manager (cigars) of the No. 2 tobacco company in the country. The cigars available currently are all smuggled in from various countries and availability is also low, but with our presence now, thats set to change.																								Godfrey Phillips is approaching city retailers, clubs, restaurants and hotels for exclusive stocking of its cigars. The response has been fantastic, exclaims Joshi.																								Among the hotels, Hyatt Regency and Taj Bengal have welcomed the proposition, while Bengal Club has shown a keen interest.																								According to a spokesperson in Hyatt  which did boast of a small selection of Cuban cigars till recently  talks are on to stock the Godfrey Phillips range.																								But is there space on the citys shelves for such a premium lifestyle product? Calcutta is changing, asserts Joshi, who, like most people returning to the city after a long gap, sees a lot of change all around, mostly for the better. The roads have improved, so has the power situation, and the lifestyle of the people has undergone a major change, he explains.																								It is this change that the company plans to cash in on. In a market that currently has a negligible presence of cigars, it plans to sell 400,000 in the first year itself.																								But cigars dont come cheap. Godfrey Phillips entire range is priced between Rs 15 and Rs 550 (for a single cigar), but Calcutta would have only those up to Rs 350 now, with the rest gradually added on in the coming months. No plans either for a standalone cigar-shop in the city, but one is set to come up soon in the Capital.																								All three kinds of cigars  machine-made, hand-made and hand-rolled  would be available in Calcutta. Godfrey Phillips tie-up with US-based Altadis Cigars would ensure that the big brands coming in would include Don Diego, Hav-A-Tampa, Phillies and Santa Damiana, the last one having been around for 100 years. Altadis has a 40 per cent share of the US cigar market, along with a 30 per cent worldwide share, reveals Joshi.																								Smokers, however, need to be educated about cigars first, feels Godfrey Phillips. As part of the launch, the company would have cigar samplings at bars, nightclubs and discotheques. The F amp;B staff at the hotels stocking the cigars would also be trained to help customers puff the proper way. And with the government clampdown on advertising tobacco products  including surrogate advertising  word of mouth is something that the company is looking at as an effective promotional tool.																								Godfrey Phillips currently has a presence in Mumbai, Delhi (its two biggest markets), Hyderabad, Pune and Chandigarh. Along with Calcutta, it has plans of expanding to other cities like Chennai and Bangalore and in Rajasthan.

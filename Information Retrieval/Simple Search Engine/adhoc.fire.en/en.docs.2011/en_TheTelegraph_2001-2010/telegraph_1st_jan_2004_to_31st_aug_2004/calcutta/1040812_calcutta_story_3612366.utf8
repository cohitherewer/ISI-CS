BENGALI BEAM - The top five Suhasini Mulay and Koushik Sen: Timely guests  If you still rely on neighbours and friends to know how popular a programme on TV is, its time you got the real thing. Television Audience Measurement (TAM) is what advertisers and media watchers rely on for TV viewership data. Here are the top programmes on the Bengali channels for the week July 25-31 in Calcutta according to TAM data. Tara Bangla: Boro Eka Lagey  The struggle of a young widow to create an identity of her own in societyETV Bangla: Tithir Atithi  Soap about the inhabitants of a guest house of the same name  blood, sweat, tears and all (picture above)DD 7: Pratikkha  The usual complexities plaguing a big joint familyAlpha Bangla: Thakumar Jhuli  Dakhsinaranjans classic on the small screen and in animationAkash Bangla: Police Files  Khonj Khabors successor that re-enacts actual police cases Success story That soaps rule the Calcutta viewers heart, there is no doubt. Three out of five Bengali channels have a soap heading the fave-list. But the surprise is from the Alpha topper  an animation show about age-old tot tales. The animation quality may not be worth talking about and in need of significant improvement, but the popularity is sure to boost local animation talent. The reality show on Akash Bangla is also a change from the soap story, but following the success of Khonj Khabor on the same channel, hardly a surprise.

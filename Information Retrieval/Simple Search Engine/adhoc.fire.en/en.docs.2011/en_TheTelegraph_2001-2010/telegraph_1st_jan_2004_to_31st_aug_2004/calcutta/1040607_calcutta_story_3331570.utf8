 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Wanted, road lifeline for garment trade
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								About a lakh tailors of the Garden Reach-Metiabruz-Mahestala belt have decided to go on a massive movement to protest the loss they are suffering for want of a proper transportation system. 																								Their appeal to the chief minister has evoked no response, though a month has elapsed. The main demand of the tailors is for a flyover at the intersection of Hazi Ratan More and Ramnagar for the smooth flow of traffic.																								The tailors, who are directly or indirectly employed, produce garments worth more than Rs 1 crore a month. These are sold not only in the domestic markets but also exported. Usually, the garments are sent to Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh and other Muslim countries. 																								There are three main markets  Battala, Bangali and Mudiali  where dress material for men, women and children are sold. Usually, the markets are held thrice a week  Saturday, Sunday and Monday  and on these days, buyers come from different parts of the country. 																								Owing to heavy traffic congestion, buyers have to walk all the three-km distance from the market to Akra Phatak railway station with their purchases. 																								Sometimes, they have to spend the night at the station with their goods, because they cannot reach the station on time. It takes at least two to three hours to cross this distance of three km by any vehicle. 																								At least a month ago, we had appealed to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in writing, demanding that a flyover be constructed, but till today, there has been no response from his office, complained Mansoor Rahaman Mollah, president, Metiabruz Nagarik Committee. 																								We have decided to collect a million signatures and send them to the President and the Prime Minister, he said. 																								The trade involves not only the tailors but also the ostagors (wholesalers of readymade garments), who are not less than 10,000 in number. 																								Rahaman said that earlier, they had put up roadblocks and organised protest rallies, but now, the Nagarik Committee has decided to launch a continuous movement. 																								If the government does not take any action, the entire trade will be hard hit, he said. 																								Already, we have informed our local CPM parliamentarian Samik Lahiri about our programme and he has assured us that he will take up the matter with both the state and central governments, Rahaman said.																								The traffic congestion has not only affected the traders but also local residents. 																								To make matters worse, there are several schools and colleges in the pocket, whose students, for no fault of their own, face a daily ordeal when confronted with the traffic snarls. 																								So, to get rid of this sorry state of affairs, we are fighting under the banner of the Nagarik Committee, as all of us are affected, Rahaman said.

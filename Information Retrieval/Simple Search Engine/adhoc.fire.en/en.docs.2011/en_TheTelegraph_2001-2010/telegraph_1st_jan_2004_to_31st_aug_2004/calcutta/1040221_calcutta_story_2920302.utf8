The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 21, 2004  The City Diary
																																																		A businessman of Madhyamgram, Sujit Roy, was looted after being offered pan masala laced with sedatives on Friday. According to Roy, a medicine-seller, when he was waiting at a bus terminus near the local rail station, a young man engaged him in conversation and offered him pan masala. After consuming that he felt dizzy and lost consciousness. On regaining his senses, he found himself lying on a berth of Saraighat Express and poorer by two gold rings and nearly Rs 50,000 which he was carrying to purchase medicine from Calcutta. He complained to the Government Railway Police but no one has been arrested yet.																																																		The city and its adjoining areas experienced intermittent power cuts on Friday evening as the state electricity board (SEB) imposed restrictions on its supply to the CESC grid. Power department sources said the shortfall in the CESC-supplied areas shot up to around 100 mw around 6.30 pm. The SEB supplied only 100 mw to the CESC system which is about 150 mw less than the usual evening contribution. SEB sources said that the power crisis stemmed from a drop in generation at the state-run Kolaghat power plant where two 210-mw units were rendered inoperative over the past two days following mechanical snags.																																																		Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)s declaration on Thursday that the ceiling announced by it earlier applies to charges per subscriber and not to the subscriber base, has hit local cable operators. The apprehension is that broadcasters will use this order to seek higher declaration levels. Broadcasters charge operators on a formula combining subscriber base and rate. TRAIs declaration leaves a broadcaster free to ask for a higher subscriber base (effectively a greater declaration) from operators even if rates are frozen. Operators under three city multi-system-operators (MSOs) met on Friday to discuss the situation and decided to send a letter of protest to TRAI. In January, broadcasters had hiked rates, which were later suspended following TRAIs rate-freeze orders. 																																																		Timings of Singapore Airlines flights between Singapore and Calcutta, operating on Tuesdays and Fridays, have been changed with effect from February 17. Flight SQ415 will leave Calcutta at 11.50 pm while SQ416 will arrive in the city at 10.35 pm on both the days.																																																		The results of entrance examinations for admissions to various post-graduate medical courses of West Bengal University of Health Sciences were announced on Friday. Nearly 3,700 examinees had appeared in the examinations. Officials in the university said 1,252 candidates passed the examination. Counselling of students will be held in mid-April, the officials said. 																																																		A private bus on route 12A/B ran over Bablu Khan, a 25-year-old resident of Sikh Basti in the Calcutta dock area, on Circular Garden Reach Road, under the West Port police station, on Friday. The driver sped away with the bus. Khan was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.																																																		Justice S.K. Mukherjee of Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas to refund Rs 67,000 to the Birla Planetarium authorities. The order was passed on the basis of a petition by the planetarium authorities, alleging that representatives sent by the district magistrate forced them to hand over a cheque for Rs 2.72 lakh for payment of allowances to an ex-employee of the planetarium. The employee, B.K. Das, was sacked in 1982. He had filed a petition seeking an order from the labour welfare board to direct the planetarium authorities to pay his substantial allowances. The board had directed the magistrate to collect the amount from the planetarium and hand it over. The planetarium authorities filed a petition before the high court that the magistrate had collected an excess of Rs 67,000.

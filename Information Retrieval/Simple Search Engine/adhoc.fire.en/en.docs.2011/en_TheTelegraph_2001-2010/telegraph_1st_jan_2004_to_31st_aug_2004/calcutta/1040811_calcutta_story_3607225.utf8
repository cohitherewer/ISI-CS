The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 Funk junk for cool dudes
Men in Calcutta are spoilt for choice when it comes to trendy trinkets. From finger-rings, bracelets and wristbands to ear studs and neckpieces, Himika Chaudhuri hunts them all downOver a decade ago, Shah Rukh Khan wore a single bullet around his neck in the film Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. It became an instant rage among with guys across the country, and soon even roadside junk-jewellery shops were selling cheap replicas of the Shah Rukh bullet.Now, shops in Calcutta are flooded with accessories for men. The trinkets begin with finger-rings, moving on to bracelets and wristbands and go all the way to ear studs and neck-bands. Metrosexual men in the city have happily begun to deck themselves up for those special occasions. With funky pieces being flown in by shop owners from hip Bangkok and cool Hong Kong, there isnt half a reason why the adventurous man shouldnt try his hand at these. Mens accessories, especially things like metal bracelets, rings and wristbands in beads, are a hot rage among the disco hopping crowd, said Kushal Sonthalia of Cash, a chain of outlets that sell mens clothes and accessories in Sreeram Arcade and Metro Plaza.Wristbands and neckbands in leather, beads and cloth are highly in vogue now, chimes in Chetan of DesiBoyz, a shop in Metro Plaza selling outfits and accessories for men. You could also pick up some antique-look knick-knacks from Chamba Lama in New Market, which stocks finger-rings and neckpieces for men. We take a look at whats the in thing in guy fashion.NeckpiecesOptions range from leather, beads, cloth or the original favourite  metal. Both the bead and cloth bands are meant to make a more subtle style statement. A colourful piece is just enough to add an edge to a pair of denims and a T-shirt. As you don the evening look, either stylish leather or shiny metal should take over the neck space. Metal neckbands with metal embellishments would be just right for the glam look, especially with a light, translucent linen shirt. Metal neckpieces remain the eternal favourite for the fashion conscious with an expanding range of designs now available. Check out the chained look and the flat beaten look, which would gel well with a classy combo of denims and a crisp white cotton shirt.Price range: Rs 85 to Rs 295. Oxidised metal neckpieces are available for Rs 495.WristbandsAgain the options are leather, metal, cloth and wooden beads. Spiked leather wristbands are commonly spotted on the racks, to give the slightly medieval look. Dont even try it for a formal occasion, but if you are completely casual, give it a shot. Other less daring styles can be pulled off on semi-formal occasions, too. Metal wristbands are extremely popular with the young crowd, specially the flat ones with a beaten look. Wooden beads have a more grungy appeal, but while they are okay for college, they are best avoided for a night out. Learn the golden rules first, though: Ensure the wristband fits snugly around the wrist and never wear one with a formal shirt.Price range: Rs 75 to Rs 295RingsHere the options are in either metal or cloth. Metal rings come in various motifs and designs. The flat engraved kind are subdued, while for a louder look, the star-sign ring seem quite popular. The macho alpha males may rather opt for the ever-popular skeleton motif. But avoid a hand cluttered with rings on all formal occasions. Cloth rings, to be worn on the thumb and available in lovely bright colours, are just right for the high school and college crowd.Price range: Rs 75 to Rs 95Ear studsBut to be truly trendy, the ultimate commitment must be made: go forth and get your ear pierced. Ear studs for men come mainly in metal, with designs ranging from a stark metallic ball to more intricate patterns. Lots of stars, from Suniel Shetty to Sandeep Vyas closer home sport them. But in all honesty, the ear lobe is now the tamest part of the body to be pierced. Well, its a place to start.Price range: Rs 95 eachPictures by Pabitra Das

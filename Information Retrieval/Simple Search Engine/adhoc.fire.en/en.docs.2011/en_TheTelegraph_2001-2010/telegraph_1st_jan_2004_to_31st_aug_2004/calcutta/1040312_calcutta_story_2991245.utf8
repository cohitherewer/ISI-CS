																								The Red Curtain returns to the stage after a brief hiatus with The Importance of Being Stoppard, a double bill of social comedies: Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being Ernest and Tom Stoppards Travesties. The evening promises to bring with it a considerable dose of fun and laughter; paving the way for a social message wittily conveyed through the carefree revelry of the young men and women that have peopled society down the ages. The Red Curtain has as its motto Good Theatre for a Good Cause and it is with this motive that it presents The Importance of Being Stoppard. The proceeds from the stage production will be devoted to the cause of Animal Relief and Care.

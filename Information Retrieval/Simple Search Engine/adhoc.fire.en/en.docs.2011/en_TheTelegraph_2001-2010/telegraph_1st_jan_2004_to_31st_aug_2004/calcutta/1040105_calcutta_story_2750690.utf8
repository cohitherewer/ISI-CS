The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Wet streets and dry pipes
				 	 Swapan SamadDAr, Trinamul Congress councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ward no. 30, and mayoral council member (building) met residents of the area to answer their queries. Participants included Madhusudan Agarwal, Harendranath Sarkar, Sumit Roychowdhury, Birendranath Das, Biswaranjan Roy, Nemai Banerjee, Anjali Nag, Amiruzzaman, Sibapada Das, Somnath Biswas, Bapi Saha, Pradip Das, Paritosh Kar, Sankar Bhattacharjee and Sasanka Ghosal				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Harendranath Sarkar: Will the funds earmarked cover the cost of the park? 																																																			No, but mayor Subrata Mukherjee has assured me that money will not be a problem. In fact, both the mayor and the municipal commissioner had discussed the project and gave me the go-ahead. So, I feel, the park will not face a cash problem.																																																									

Harendranath Sarkar: Pockets of Dhanadevi Khanna Road get waterlogged even after a brief shower.																																																			Though the problem of waterlogging has reduced considerably in the past few years, I notice that it persists in some pockets. This is due to the partial failure of a pumping station in Dhapa. Moreover, Maniktala and Narkeldanga, which lie adjacent, flood out during the rains and a spillover flows into our area, which is a little low-lying. Earlier, there used to be a big pond in the locality, which was filled up. That is also a reason for water settling on the streets after a brief shower. To prevent this, heavy pumping is necessary but I dont think such a system will be viable, as the volume of water that stands is too small to merit the setting up of a pumping station.																																																									

Sumit Roychowdhury: The pressure of piped water is low. 																																																			Thats not right. The pressure is not any less than in other parts of the city. Sometimes, the pressure does dip in the main supply line from Tallah. In that case, pressure drops in the pipes. We have installed a 10-inch supply line near Maniktala to boost the pressure of water. A proposal is in the offing for another six-inch line.																																																									

Sumit Roychowdhury: Why doesnt the CMC instal tubewells in parts of the ward that suffer from a water crisis? 																																																			We are ready, the residents are not. Nobody wants a tubewell near his house. Show us a spot, and youll have a tubewell. 																																																									

Sasanka Ghosal: Water scarcity is acute on Mahesh Barik Road. A few roads in the locality need immediate repairs. 																																																			The problem of water is not unique to this ward. It is similar in every other ward and borough. As for road repairs, the money has been sanctioned and work will start soon, maybe by the month-end. 																																																									

Somnath Biswas: Roads that are repaired often develop large potholes due to vehicular wear and tear. But in some parts of our ward, like the main roads, a special type of covering has been used which lasts longer.																																																			The main roads are repaired with special type of asphalt, known as mastic asphalt. But according to CMC rules, only main roads can be repaired with that type of asphalt. It cannot be used in lanes and bylanes. Nemai Banerjee: The markets are  not maintained. One has even sprung up next to the railway  tracks. 																																																			That market is illegal and has come up on railway land. So the CMC has no jurisdiction to dismantle it. Residents are also to be blamed. They should avoid vendors. We are trying to develop and maintain the scheduled marketplaces, but still there is a tendency among them to shop in these roadside markets.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Court buoys rabies-free city initiative
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Pressure groups in Athens have accused the city authorities of poisoning and burning more than 3,000 stray dogs and an equal number of cats to keep the Greek capital clean and beautiful for the Olympics. The consequences  an alarming spiral in the citys rat population. Remember Surat? 																								The Bangkok governor had ordered eviction of street dogs from the central historical district last year, an order, if enforced, would have seen more rats, crows, feral cats, feral pigs and monkeys running amok on the city streets.																								By contrast, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) stopped killing strays since March 1996, when the animal birth-control and anti-rabies (ABC/AR) programme was launched, in conjunction with People for Animals (PFA). 																								The joint initiative to make Calcutta the second rabies-free city in Asia after Singapore got a shot in the arm after the high court recently dismissed a public interest litigation against the CMC and PFA, filed by a clutch of animal welfare organisations.																								Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee disposed of the PIL, which had accused the civic body and PFA of cruel treatment to street dogs and sought free access to the CMC dog pound at Hatgachhia to prevent arbitrariness and abuse of authority. The court order, while ignoring allegations of a nexus between the civic authorities and PFA, directed the CMC to adopt a proper humane approach in catching strays.																								Ever since we kicked off the spay-neuter programme as supplementary to the existing ABC/AR campaign, we have faced resistance from various quarters and vested-interest groups. But, the high court order is vindication enough of our total commitment to the cause and we can now go full steam ahead with the rabies eradication programme, observed PFA managing trustee Debasis Chakrabarti.																								The NGO, entrusted with the task of controlling stray dog and cat populations in wards 1 to 90 in collaboration with the CMC, aims to achieve a stray dog density of two per sq km of road space in the city by acceleration of the spay/neuter programme. It will simultaneously reduce and gradually eliminate rabies, which is preventable, not curable, stressed Chakrabarti.

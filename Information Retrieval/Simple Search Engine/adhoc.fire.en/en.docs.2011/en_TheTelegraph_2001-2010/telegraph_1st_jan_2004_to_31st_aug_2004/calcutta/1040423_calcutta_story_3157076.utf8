 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Girls rescue sends CID on kingpin hunt
 AMIT UKIL																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Thursday sent a team to the Sandeshkhali area of the Sunderbans to trace a woman, said to be the kingpin of a widespread racket in the trafficking of minor girls.																								A breakthrough in curbing the racket was achieved when CID investigators, accompanied by the staff of a non-government organisation (NGO), raided the Delhi-Kalka Mail just before it was scheduled to leave Howrah station on Tuesday night.																								Eight minor girls being lured to the Capital on promises of jobs were rescued. They were all between 10 and 14 years old. Three adults, including two women, who were escorting them, were arrested.																								Sanlaap, the NGO involved in the raid, had received a tip-off that as many as 19 girls under the age of 15 were being taken from several villages in the Sunderbans to work in New Delhi.																								The NGO got the tip around 3.30 pm on Tuesday. We immediately contacted Howrah police, including additional superintendent (town) L.N. Meena, for intervention, said a spokesperson of the NGO.																								But the response they got was lukewarm. So the organisation contacted special superintendent of police (CID) Ramphal Pawar who immediately arranged a 10-member force to carry out the raid at Howrah station.																								Dressed in plainclothes and led by deputy superintendent (CID) Krishnakali Lahiri, police, along with four Sanlaap members, reached the station at 6.40 pm. 																								The Delhi Express, too, was to leave at the same time. We rushed to the platform and checked as many compartments as we could, but failed to find the girls, recalled Tapati Bhowmik, senior member of the NGO.																								We then went to the platform from which the Kalka Mail was to depart. There, we saw several young girls in the queue of passengers waiting to board the general compartment, she said.																								They appeared scared and lost, Bhowmik said. By this time, Howrah police personnel, too, had turned up.																								Police and the NGO members encircled the girls so that they could not be spirited away by their adult escorts. They were asked where they hailed from, and when the information matched the tip-off, the girls were asked to point out the adults with them. Three escorts were identified and questioned. They revealed that the girls were being taken to Delhi for jobs.																								CID officials said two women, Lakshmi Mondal and Basanti Sardar, along with brother Shaktipada Sardar, were arrested. They all hail from the Sandeshkhali area of the Sunderbans. The girls came from Gosaba, Basanti, Hingalgunj and Hasnabad.																								All of them, including the minors, were produced in the court of the Howrah sub-divisional judicial magistrate court on Wednesday. The minors were directed to be sent to the Liluah home for destitute women, while the three traffickers were remanded in CID custody till April 28.																								Interrogation of the accused revealed that the kingpin, Maya Sardar, ran the racket from Sandeshkhali. We have sent a team to find her, said Pawar.

This time, six kilometres away from Narendrapur. 																								Small yellow cottages with shining red roofs, a manicured lawn in front and a tiny kitchen garden at the back. All nicely fitted into three-cottah plots.																								A fishing pond, a play area for children, badminton courts and club for the grown-ups, amidst huge trees spread over 138 cottahs of land, makes Wild Grass a suitable setting for a weekend getaway.																								On Sunday morning, the project being developed by B. Ghosh and Associates was flagged off and the first of the 21 proposed cottages thrown open for inspection by prospective buyers.																								It was a field day for most of those who drove all the way down the Bypass and beyond on a holiday. 																								A lavish breakfast spread, music to keep the spirits lively and lots of colourful beach umbrellas dotting the garden made for a novel Sunday setting.																								 We are looking at 21 cottages, each priced between Rs 12 and Rs 15 lakh, said Shampa Ghose on behalf of the builders. Construction of the 20 other cottages will begin as soon as clients begin to book the plots.																								The cottages will consist of a drawing-cum-dining room, a bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a storeroom.																								The lawn will be lined with fruit trees, while the kitchen garden can be used to grow the seasonal tomato or the 12-month green chilli. For those with a special love for the greens, the personal kitchen garden offers the chance to do a bit of farming.																								In fact, its the natural land-scaping of the place and the surrounding greenery that Wild Grass touts as its USP. 																								We do not want to spoil the environmental balance of the place. We want to use the trees as a natural border while marking the plots, explained Shampa.																								That is apparently the reason why they are calling the destination, close to Kodalia, Wild Grass Bagan Bari, instead of a resort or a complex.																								The drive takes about 30 minutes from Science City, past Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission, on an easy-traffic day. But the roads to Wild Grass are smooth and the mood is most Bagan Bari.																								The occasion: Music launch of Shudhu Tumi, Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guhas joint debut foray in feature film-making.																								The venue: Calcutta Swimming Club, Saturday evening.																								The show-stealers: The star cast of Prosenjit, Koel Mullick and Gargi Roychoudhury. Also spotted in the crowded do was Ranjit Mullick.																								The mood: Upbeat after a slow start. Screen projections of the song sequences  which included a fast track and a romantic number, with Koel cycling down the hilly terrains of Arunachal Pradesh  pepped up the evening.																								I am very excited. Everybody in the crew helped me so much during the shoot, smiled Koel, who is pitted against Gargi for Prosenjits attentions in Shudhu Tumi.The music: By Guwahati-based music director Zubin Garg. Trained on the tabla and percussion, Zubin will soon be debuting in Bollywood with Sanjay Jhas Strings, starring Adam Bedi and Sandhya Mridul. In Shudhu Tumi, Zubin has woven folk tunes from the Northeast and Bengal, apart from lending his voice to two tracks out of the eight.GRASSROOTS Place: Wild Grass Bagan Bari is situated 6 km from Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission

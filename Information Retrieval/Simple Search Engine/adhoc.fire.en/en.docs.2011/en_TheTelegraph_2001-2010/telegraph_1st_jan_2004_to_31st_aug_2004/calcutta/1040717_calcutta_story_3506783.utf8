 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Hope in wake of heartbreak
 SANJAY MANDAL																								A breakthrough, nine long years after tragedy struck, has left the Dhar family hoping against hope. The younger daughter of the Kudghat house went missing in May 1995 from Chandipur, where she had gone with a group of friends.																								On Friday, Sushmitas elder sister Arpita (Dutta) had gone to Bhabani Bhavan to meet a Criminal Investigation Department (CID) official in connection with the probe, when she came to know about the arrest.																								The last thing Arpita was prepared for was what she heard  news of the four arrests, including three of her sisters friends. It was a coincidence that I went there today and the officials told me about the arrests, admitted Arpita, still not sure what to make of the dramatic developments in the long-dormant case.																								It was also a coincidence that we approached the same private detective agency that had been appointed by the father of Suparna (a friend of Sushmitas) at Chandipur to track down my sister, a fact that he had suppressed, she added.																								For father Shyamal Dhar, the news of the arrests has come as a glimmer of hope after years of heartbreak.																								I feel there will be some information about my daughter now. The friends who went with her must be knowing something they have not revealed so far, he said.																								The arrest of Debanjan Das, Rajiv Chowdhury, Suparna Banerjee and her father S.C. Banerjee has given the Dhars something to cling to.																								People are known to have come back after 12 years My daughter has been missing for only nine We have not lost hope, asserted Shyamal Dhar.																								We do not seek revenge, we only want to know her (Sushmitas) whereabouts, he stressed.																								But theres no hiding the hurt that the Dhars have borne for years, with Sushmitas friends and their families not keeping in touch with them and refusing to reply to their repeated queries about what had gone wrong at the Chandipur hotel in 1995.																								After Sushmita was reported missing on the morning of May 16, 1995, the parents had rushed to Chandipur.																								I asked Debanjan and Rajiv to tell me the truth and I promised to bury the matter then and there. But they kept quiet, recalled Shyamal Dhar.																								For mother Sandhya Dhar, living with the memories of her younger daughter has become a way of life. She would plant trees here She was very particular about what should be where, she said, wiping away the tears.

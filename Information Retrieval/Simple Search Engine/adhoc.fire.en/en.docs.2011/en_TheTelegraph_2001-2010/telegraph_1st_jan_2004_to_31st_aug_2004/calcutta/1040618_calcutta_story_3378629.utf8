Open since October last, this all-vegetarian restaurant is now holding its first sizzler festival. Meat may be missing from the special menu, but between vegetables and paneer, executive chef James Rozario has come up with as many as 15 different kinds of sizzlers.																								Our menu has just two sizzler items which are a big hit with our regular diners. That is why we decided to have this festival, explained James.																								Spaciously sprawled across 3,000 sq ft of floor area, this 100- cover restaurant is tastefully decorated with light wooden furniture. 																								The essentially Indian dcor includes family corners done up with comfortable cushions and gaddas.																								For those who would like to dig into a sizzling dinner, options range from Chinese, Continental to Indian. Pick the pan-fried cottage cheese with Szechwan sauce on a bed of noodles or feast on Texas Nachos or go desi with Lajawab Paneer Tikka. 																								Each dish is a meal in itself, and we are offering rice or bread with all the sizzlers so that guests can just order one plate and be over with their meal, said Navin Dugar, director, The Social.																								If you want a more silent start to your meal, go for some starters from the usual menu, including Hariyali Paneer Kebab, Saundhe Aloo and Subz Tiltikki.																								All the sizzlers are priced between Rs 130 and Rs 145.Smita Roy Chowdhury, Himika Chaudhuri

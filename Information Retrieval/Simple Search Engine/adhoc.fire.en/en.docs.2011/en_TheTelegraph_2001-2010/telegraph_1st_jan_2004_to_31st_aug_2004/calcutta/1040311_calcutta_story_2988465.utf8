 For a breath of fresh air: Walkers at Victoria Memorial Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra thinks the lowering of rates for diagnostic tests by a group of private hospitals in the city is a landmark decision (Hospitals eye IT sops, February 14). Why did this landmark decision have to wait all this while to be a reality for hapless patients? Obviously, private hospitals would still be reaping a profit from medical tests even after providing them at a subsidised rate. This only proves that private hospitals and diagnostic centres were overcharging their customers, the defence-less patients, for decades. The existence of a nexus between the diagnostic centres and medicos is common knowledge.  Doctors often get a kickback (commission) from the diagnostic centres and hospitals for referring pa-tients. Rather than patting their backs, the health minister would be better advised to probe the unscrupulous activities that these laboratories have been indulging in from time immemorial.  Unless the crooked elements in the health sector are identified and punished, there is little hope that the abysmal healthcare standards in West Bengal would improve. Dr. Kunal Saha,
Ohio, USA. The findings of the Shyamal Sarkar committee does not address the real issues, like the running of vehicles near Victoria Memorial or idlers using the premises as a picnic spot or immoral activities (Keep off, morning walkers, Feb. 12). All these happen after 10 am. Would shutting out the morning-walkers stop these? Rather, we were collecting funds to ensure better upkeep of the monument. P.D. Khaitan,
Camac Street. A regular morning walker at Victoria Memorial, I was shocked to read the observations of the committee. Those who visit the premises later in the day are responsible for the condition. I hope a whimsical few will not be allowed to play with our health.Virendra Shah,
Amratolla Lane. If the gates of Victoria Memorial can be left open through the evening, why should the morning walkers be deprived? If their talk is deafening, is there silence during the day? At the Taj Mahal, an entry fee is charged as it is Indias greatest tourist spot. The Memorial brooks no comparison.Santosh Chakravarty,
Santoshpur. Ban the fairs adjacent to the grounds, check vehicular pollution around the monument and increase security to prevent littering, if Victoria Memorial is to be preserved. Banning morning walkers is no solution.Sunil Garodia,
Sushil Sen Road. It is nice to know that Suchetana Bhattacharjee, daughter of our chief minister, has bid adieu to politics and is devoting her spare time to wildlife awareness (Bye politics, hi wildlife, Feb. 12). Nature is in need of such young crusaders. Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
Rakhal Ghosh Lane. Apropos the photograph of Indicab, on Feb. 12, while an air-conditioned taxi is most welcome, its stained glass windows are a matter of concern. In case of any crime inside the cab, the victims call for help will not reach the world outside. Md. Moinuddin, 
Ballygunge. Let teachers have the freedom to wear sari or salwar-kameez (Drop sari code, cry teachers, Feb. 13). Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum. It is distressing how people continue to deposit their savings in chit funds lured by abnormally high interest rates (Six held for chit fund fraud, Feb. 10). The Reserve Bank of India should undertake an awareness campaign. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty Road. The news of the CPM-controlled lobby calling for the evaluation of teachers filled us with hope (Teachers face reality check, Feb. 14). With Bengals education system going downhill, such a survey is very much called for. T.R. Anand,
Budge Budge.

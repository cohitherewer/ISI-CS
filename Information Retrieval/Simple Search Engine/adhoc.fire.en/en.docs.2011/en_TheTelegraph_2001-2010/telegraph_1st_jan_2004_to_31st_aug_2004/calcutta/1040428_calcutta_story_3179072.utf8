 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Odyssey with a peace missive
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE Colours of amity: Bakshi en route to Trashiganj in Bhutan 																								Thrumshing La, the highest motorable pass in Bhutan. A convoy of five Mahindra Armadas was threading its way up the mountains at a height of about 12,375 feet when a white-out took place. The road was treacherous and visibility low. So the convoy, carrying team leader Akhil Bakshi and MP Sunil Dutt among others, ground to a halt in the snow. 																								Suddenly this shaggy black dog appeared from nowhere and started walking in front of us, recounts Bakshi, in Calcutta on a short trip. The dog guided the team to safety through the army of clouds, waiting when the vehicles slowed down. The Bhutanese believe that the dog guides the soul in afterlife, muses the man who went on to complete the motoring expedition, covering 18,000 km. 																								If spiritual forces guided the course, it was the twin nuclear tests undertaken by the then-hostile neighbours in 1999 that had flagged off the journey, under the banner of the Delhi-based forum Yuva Shakti. Fourteen members were carrying the message of peace and development across Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and 16 states of India. All of south Asia is one huge family. We have a joint destiny. Yet the ghost of Partition prods us to fight each other. The members would be out by 8 am and stagger in at 1 or 2 pm. We must have addressed around 1,000 meetings in the three months.																								Bakshi has mapped the memories and the miles clocked in the expedition as well as his peace missive in a book Between Heaven and Hell, released recently. It tells the story of our journey in a tongue-in-cheek manner, questioning attitudes imposed from the top and satirising divisive policies like the arms race while millions suffer in poverty and ignorance.																								The former officer on special duty to ex-Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao fondly recounts the warm reception from people. On a highway in Bhutan, kids travelled from as far as four km away to greet us with hand-painted flags, he says.																								Though Pakistan was the most obvious destination to take the peace message to, circumstances kept the country out of the itinerary. The Kargil war had intensified. So both Dutt saab and the embassy suggested that we give it a miss.																								Bakshi, who describes himself as a tramp, is no stranger to long-distance missions. In 1994, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, he had trekked up the famed Silk Road, to revive cultural ties with the people of Central Asia.																								But it was the Azad Hind Expedition in 1995-96 that threw up more enduring moments. With veterans of the Indian National Army, we traced Netajis route from Singapore. In Malaysia, where he had recruited his men, they met former colleagues and wept like children.																								Bakshi is already charting the course for his next mission  to Africa. Some 265 million years ago, before the shift of the continents took place, India was part of the African mainland. The journey will have a scientific motive this time, with a team of seismologists and geologists accompanying Bakshi.

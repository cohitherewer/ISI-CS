The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 16, 2004  And the mirror cracked...
 Even if Bedi Bhavan in Gol Park ceases  to exist in reality it will gain permanence as a work of art  in Georges Rousses photograph, says Soumitra Das Some buildings stand out of real  time and space. It is so easy to believe that they are shrouded  in mystery, and that their magic casements and enchanted  portals could lead us astray into a realm where our imagination  will run wild. Such a house was the derelict Bedi Bhavan  that stood for years wedged between the Ramakrishna Mission  Institute of Culture, Golpark, and Southern Avenue. Rumours,  whispers and hearsay had swathed the building in a House-of-Ushers  aura, though there was nothing remotely romantic about its  origin or about the people who lived in it pre- or post-World  War II. But it certainly had a presence,  an element that it would not be an exaggeration to call  gothic. This indefinable quality stood the test of broad  daylight and the crowds milling around Golpark. It was in  recognition of this element that in 1992 a French artist  of international repute had chosen Bedi Bhavan as the site  of an enchanting and ephemeral project.  Although the Calcutta Municipal  Corporations records never acknowledged its existence,  Bedi Bhavans mailing address was 5 Southend Park. The road  has of late been diverted, and it bulldozes through the  building itself. Before it was liberated it was  practically inaccessible. Now it is walled in. A pillar  abuts on the pavement facing the new annexe of the Ramakrishna  Mission under construction. The fragment of an arch grows  out of the pillar. Recently bricked-in Moorish arches surrounding  the emptiness that was once a room are still the picture  of grace. A Neem toothpaste signboard hangs from the ceiling. A hasty attempt has been made  at turning the grounds facing Southern Avenue into a garden.  Behind it is a wilderness, a perfect setting for the house  of cards that Bedi Bhavan has turned into. The three wings of the house are  there and airy bridges span them. But the walls have become  transparent. The sky filters through them. Flights of stairs  lead into nothingness. The Atlas on the terrace is gone.  Do the stucco nymphs still wait for the breath of life,  and do crouching marble lions still keep guard inside? Or  have vandals removed them too?  The story that Bedi Bhavan has  to tell is disappointingly prosaic. Before they were evicted  on October 25, 1998, and Mamata Banerjee and her cohorts  came to their rescue, squatters had built shanties around  it. They were refugees who had poured into Calcutta after  the Partition. They moved into the vacant mansion and stripped  it bare of its valuable marble flooring and banisters. With  time, however, they prospered and if one had the temerity  to sneak in, one could catch a glimpse of cooking ranges  behind bamboo tatties. They enjoyed the luxuries of electricity  and tap water, too, though officially no connection existed. One heard the occupants were employed.  But one also heard that the house was a den of vice where  anything from drugs, hooch and women were available. It  was absolutely true that outsiders were debarred from entering  what many thought was an ill-fated palace. About 14 years  ago, when I went to take some photographs, I was chased  out. At that time, elderly neighbours  used to say that Bedi Bhavan was constructed in the Thirties  after its owners got a windfall in a sweepstake. Handsome  chargers cantered around the grounds. During Diwali, bouquets  and posies of fireflowers would light up the sky. Films  were occasionally shot there. Artist Paritosh Sen remembers  Southern Avenue in the Forties. Houses were few and far  between. The ones that were there were south-facing low-rises  with gardens that belonged to Bengalis. Then World War II  happened and Calcutta became the headquarters of the Allied  forces in the East. Eighty thousand Allied forces descended  on the city.  The black soldiers drove mammoth  trucks that carried tanks to Barrackpore or Dum Dum. Occasionally  the trucks would run over pedestrians and Bengali mobs would  set fire to the trucks along with their driver. The soldiers  went to fight in the Burmese border and the convalescents  were sent to Calcutta to recuperate. Large tiled cottages  were built along the lake where they were treated. When  they left, refugees occupied them. It is only of late that  they have been removed. Then the other day I read an article  which mentioned the fact that the Bedis used to live at  12 Mandeville Gardens. That happened to be the house of  Supriya Banerjee of Galerie 88 fame. A few phone calls later,  I was able to track down Tejinder Kaur, who was born in  Bedi Bhavan in 1938, and her husband, Jogindar Singh Bedi.  Their grandfathers were brothers. Most of the supposed half-truths  were actually facts, the Bedis confirmed. Tejinders grandfather,  Ladha Singh Bedi, had constructed his folly in 1934. He  was in the construction business and he started it only  after winning Rs 16 lakh in the Derby in 1925. He had three  sons, of whom Tejinders father was the youngest. They were  a musical family. The eldest son was into Rabindrasangeet  and swadeshi, while the youngest took lessons from Pankaj  Mallik. K.L. Saigal was a family friend. Tejinder Kaur says: My grandfather  loved the good life. He made millions and blew up millions  in his lifetime. Pointing out a jardiniere in their off-white  living room, she says without regret: This is all we have  from there. In the early Forties, after the  progenitor died, the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) demanded  a wing of Bedi Bhavan and acquired it. World War II broke  out. So CIT could not take it over. Refugees from East Bengal  occupied the vacuum. The Bedis moved into 12 Mandeville  Gardens in 1943. Thereby hangs a tale. But Bedi Bhavan exists in another  dimension too. In 1992 French artist Georges Rousse had  brought to light the secret life of Bedi Bhavan. Google  helped me find out that Rousse is Known for his interventions  made in empty warehouses and abandoned buildingsRousse  alters interior spaces through dramatic geometric forms  and structures made by drawing, painting and cutting through  walls. He had done the same in Bedi Bhavan.  Like Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the 18th century architect  and engraver who was fascinated by Roman ruins, Rousse used  the clean lines of the staircase and the papered opening  of the terrace to carve out his sculpture of light.  Rousse cleaned and whitewashed  the massive stairwell. All sources of light were sealed  save an opening on top to focus and diffuse natural light.  The entire surface was painted with laundering blue to represent  night. The top half that was papered was painted a glowing  yellow. The sharp angles of the golden  polygon and blue stairs created an illusion of volume with  something as insubstantial as light. The effect was so theatrical  one could hear an aria being sung. But the illusion existed  only for Rousse to photograph it. Like all spells, it was  broken soon after. Perhaps Bedi Bhavan will only exist in  Rousses work.

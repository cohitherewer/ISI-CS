 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 David Gere: Lessons of life. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Artistes, as master communicators, may be the best people to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. David Gere, professor at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), who has been in Bangalore for the past six months as a Fulbright scholar, has, with this message, brought together activists from across the world in Calcutta.																								Make Art/Stop AIDS is a four-day workshop to explore the use of art  not as fluff, not as an ancillary activity, stresses Gere  to fight the global epidemic. And while Davids brother Richard (yes, the Hollywood star), whose Gere Foundation is one of the main supporters of the project, is giving Calcutta a miss, he will be in Delhi for a conference with 100 key decision makers in fighting AIDS on July 6.																								From city NGOs to campaigners from Surinam and South Africa, people and organisations using the arts as a weapon against HIV/AIDS have assembled for the meet, which is also supported by the American Center, Calcutta.																								I found the highest concentration of artistes dealing with HIV in Calcutta, explains Gere on Thursday morning. The teacher of dance studies, culture and performance has been interviewing thoughtful people using art in a socially responsive manner across the country, and thought the meet would bring people together to strengthen existing programmes.																								In many ways, a lot of the things needed to stop AIDS  like awareness about the disease and information on condom use and protection  can be achieved best through the arts, feels Gere, the author of a number of AIDS-related books.																								The 46-year-old populist professor, as he calls himself, will return to California on July 8. He admits to having earlier lives, like that of world traveller who has studied the connection between anthropology and music. He has also worked for 10 years as arts critic and learnt Indian singing and dance. Having entered academia in the 1980s, he taught in a Madurai university for two years.																								In the mid-1980s, on moving to San Francisco and coming out as a gay man, he found that the first signs of the epidemic were surfacing. At that time, some of my dearest friends did contract the HIV virus and did die. I now call them my ghosts Often, great personal loss motivates you, reminisces the father of two adopted children, Christopher, now five years old, and Isadora, just three.																								Coming back to India when the epidemic is taking off seemed to have some applicability to Gere. I had a really great love for the people and the place, smiles the blond, bespectacled man. And while the main hurdles to working with the subject in India, feels the teacher, is the inability to talk about the means of transmission openly and the very high levels of stigma, his idealistic vision, he hopes, might help save some lives.

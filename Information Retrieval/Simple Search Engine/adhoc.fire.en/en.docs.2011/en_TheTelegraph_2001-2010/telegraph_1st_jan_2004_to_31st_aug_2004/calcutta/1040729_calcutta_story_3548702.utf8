Total annual collection: Rs 2.5 croreMayor Subrata Mukherjee plans to go down in history in several ways, one of them by letting tenants have exclusive water connections after obtaining a one-time clearance from their house- owners																								We have built up an enviable capacity to supply filtered water to more people, said Mukherjee on Wednesday. If we cannot fully distribute the water, the investments we have made in supply-augmentation programmes will become meaningless.																								Mukherjees plans envisage allowing a few lakh tenants in the city to have separate ferrules after obtaining a no-objection certificate from their landlords, over laying separate water pipelines on their premises. For the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), it is imperative to find more takers of filtered water because the current investments in the augmentation programme have led to the availability of 30 million gallons, in addition to the daily supply of 240 million gallons from different waterworks.																								Civic officials say the availability will go up shortly by another 30 million gallons, following Thursdays commissioning of a 20-million-gallon treatment plant at the Palta waterworks. 																								Governor Viren J. Shah will commission the new plant. 																								All told, we will have to cope with an extra 60 million gallons in our system, said an official. 																								What do we do with it? True, the city is expanding fast, population concentrations are turning dense, but such growths are not enough for our objective. We must be able to identify more takers of water, he added.																								The stipulated capacity of the old plant at Palta was 180 million gallons a day. Subsequently, two new treatment plants (each with a capacity of 20 million gallons a day) were set up between 1997 and 2002 at Palta, without new pumping stations.																								As a result, when the 40 million gallons of filtered water from the new plants were channelised through the old pumping station, it failed to deliver more than 180. 																								In a departure from the past, a separate pumping station, too, has been built to complement the new treatment plant, slated to be commissioned on Thursday. The engineers at Palta noticed that even after delinking the new plants from the old pumping station, delivery of filtered water to Calcutta remained the same  at 180 million gallons a day. 																								However, this is the first time the CMC has invested Rs 100 crore from its own coffers to improve the citys water supply. The last major investment on this count had been in 1968, by raising finances from the market.

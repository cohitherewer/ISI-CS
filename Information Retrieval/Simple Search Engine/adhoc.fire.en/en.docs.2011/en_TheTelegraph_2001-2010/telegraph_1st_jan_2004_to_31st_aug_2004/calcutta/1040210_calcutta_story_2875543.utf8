The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Trauma care centre ahead on Bypass
 SUBHRO SAHA																								Every year, more than 70,000 people are killed and another 250,000 injured in road accidents in the country  a majority of them in the prime of productive life, between 25 and 35. This year, in Calcutta alone, even as we are barely into the second week of the second month, the road-accident death count has crossed 55.																								A significant percentage of accident victims succumb to injuries even as they are shunted from one hospital to another in search of the right treatment  be it emergency brain surgery for internal haemorrhage or war-footing dialysis to address kidney failure. Some of that is set to change. In keeping with its mission of marrying social empathy with medical efficiency, the Asia Heart Foundation (AHF) is setting up eastern Indias first integrated trauma care centre off the EM Bypass.																								Started with seed capital from the Armenian Church, the Rs 20-crore first phase of the Armenian Church Trauma Centre (ACTC)  with around 150 beds  will be launched in May. Housed on the campus of the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences  also a venture of AHF  the trauma centre will have 250 beds by the year-end and 414 when all nine floors are complete in two years.																								The centre will provide a mix of emergency and elective care, offering an entire bouquet of specialised services under one roof, something which the city badly needs, with road accidents on the rise every year, says AHF chairman Devi Prasad Shetty.																								Specialised neurology and neurosurgery, orthopaedics and orthopaedic surgery, vascular surgery, urology, nephrology and plastic surgery wings will work in tandem to extend immediate medical help to accident victims. 																								The centre will have 72 intensive care beds, nine operating theatres, a 20-bed dialysis unit, kidney transplantation facility, complete diagnostics, 24-hour imaging, including CT scan, MRI and MRCP (magnetic resonance colangio pancreatography), besides a dedicated blood bank.																								The total built-up area, once complete, will be 154,386 sq ft, also housing 17 consultation rooms and 16 diagnostic rooms. Besides, we will have a separate bay with eight special beds that could be used to provide aggressive treatment to extremely critical patients, with a fast bailing system to quickly transport them to the theatres if the need arises, says cardiac surgeon Shetty.																								Special emphasis has been laid to make the centres neurology department an advanced neuro-care centre on a par with the best in the world, equipped to address an entire spectrum of neurological ailments. For the first time in this part of the country, we will integrate the entire department, bringing together neurology, neurosurgery, neurochemistry and neurophysiology under one roof, says Alok Roy, vice-chairman of the foundation.																								ACTC will have a fleet of trauma ambulances connected to the base station in the casualty department through wireless communication system with a dedicated frequency. Through a toll-free helpline, anyone witness to an accident can send a message to the hospital and the ambulance parked closest to the accident site will reach the spot at the earliest, says Roy.																								Every ambulance will be equipped with a full-fledged first-aid kit, a spinal board and other life-saving equipment and will be manned by specially trained personnel. At a later date, we might be in a position to airlift victims from the accident site to the hospital. We hope ACTC will prevent many needless accident deaths in the city by saving precious time during the golden critical period after the trauma, says Shetty.																								Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Peeyush Pandey feels anything which saves lives is welcome.

 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Soiree insight for cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A day after two persons were killed at a soiree in Salt Lakes Nayapatti, police on Tuesday raised the hope of a breakthrough within a day or two.																								The main culprits of Sunday nights killings will be arrested very soon. We have got some vital information that will help us achieve a breakthrough, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, on Tuesday.																								Violence broke out at the pumphouse ground of Nayapattis Purbapara colony late on Sunday. Anil Pramanik, a local resident, and another person were killed after a group of anti-socials opened fire indiscriminately. 																								The quarrel broke out after a singer stepped off the stage and started dancing with some young men. The soiree was the concluding event of the week-long Ulta Rath celebration. A 75-year-old woman also died on Monday of a heart attack she suffered after the shock.																								We are also looking for the woman, Swapna, who was hired by some goons of the area, a senior police officer of Salt Lake said. Swapna, a resident of Baisakhi, in the township, was yet to be traced, the official said.																								Police have already arrested several persons in connection with the case. However, the main organisers of the function, Saheb and Anup, close associates of one-armed Dilip, a known criminal operating in the Lake Town area, were absconding. Police ransacked Sahebs building construction material shop at Nayapatti and confiscated the goods.																								According to sources, raids were conducted on Anups house and some of his relatives were picked up by the police. Local CPM leaders, meanwhile, washed their hands of the affair. There was a free book-distribution ceremony in the evening at the function, where many party leaders were present, a local CPM leader said. After they left, the sleaze show began, he added.

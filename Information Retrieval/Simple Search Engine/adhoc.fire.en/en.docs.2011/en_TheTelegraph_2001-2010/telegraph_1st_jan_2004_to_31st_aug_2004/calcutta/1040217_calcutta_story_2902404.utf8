 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Cricket camaraderie spills on to cable TV
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After the resolution of the crisis over Team Indias tour of Pakistan, the Indo-Pak camaraderie seems to be spilling over into other arenas. A team of two media regulators from Islamabad will visit the city exclusively for the annual cable TV show, being organised by the Cable Television Equipment Traders amp; Manufacturers Association (CTMA) at Netaji Indoor Stadium (February 19-21).																								Sardar Irfan Ashraf and Shahzad Munawar Khan, general manager and assistant general manager, respectively, of Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) will visit the show. Ashraf and Khan, both Islamabad-based, have been authorised by the Pakistan government to attend the city fair.																								After PEMRA expressed interest in the exhibition, we sent them the invitation letter and requested the Indian high commission in Islamabad to help us in the matter, said Binod Sancheti, CTMA president. 																								The duo has confirmed participation and finalised the itinerary, he added. The PEMRA representatives see the trip as a great opportunity to learn from Indias experience in cable TV.																								PEMRA was established in March 2002 through an ordinance to induct the private sector into the field of electronic media in Pakistan. Cable TV was introduced in the country in 2000 under licence from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). After the establishment of PEMRA, all cable TV operations in the country were formally handed over to the body in May 2002.																								In its seventh year, the annual Cable TV Show in Calcutta will have broadcasters, multi-system operators, cable operators and cable equipment manufacturers participating and showcasing new products and technologies.																								CTMA representatives are also planning to approach the Centre on issues like interoperability of set-top boxes, formulation of a legal framework and guidelines to prevent television entertainment from becoming more expensive, and making it mandatory for MNCs to set up manufacturing bases in India.																								Other neighbours are set to participate, too. Like previous years, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal are expected to send delegates to the show, said CTMA chairman Pawan Jajodia. Nearly 300 operators are expected from Bangladesh alone.

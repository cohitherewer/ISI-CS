The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 Bratya Basu								Actor and director, Ganakrishti																																							Cell phones ring at every performance we put up these days. This is a way of life. There is nothing that can be done to prevent this habit. Thankfully, our new production Sateroi July is so loud that it is easy to miss the ring of a phone. I am not sure what they do elsewhere to check this problem. I did not face interruptions at Broadway or in Delhi. But Hyderabad suffers from the same malaise. It is not a good idea to penalise people if their cell phones ring, by way of either a fine or turning them out. Nor can we ask them to leave the phones behind. In that case, we risk losing spectators, which theatre can ill afford. People lack the right attitude. So many visitors come to the green room before a performance and try to chat us up. They do not understand that acting requires concentration. Todays lifestyle is such that one is on the run. Even if he wants to take a break and sit in peace, the device in his pocket will not allow him to.

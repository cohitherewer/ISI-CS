 Monday, February 09, 2004 				 Of myriad moods
 A number of young artists are currently exhibiting their works together and the remarkable aspect of the show is that each of them has an individual approach to the subjects  stylistically, choice of mediums, canvas division, themes  every aspect differs from one artist to another. Aninda Mukherjees paintings depict child labour, pain and deprivation written large on the countenance of the children. Kallol Boses colourful canvases capture the pristine beauty in nature. Atin Mitra has some wonderful compositions in tempera. Nikhil Biswas portrays the symbiotic relationship between man and nature (painting above). Munmun Das small-sized canvases, done mostly in monochrome with a hint of colour, create a dramatic effect. Ranjit Adhikarys charcoal drawings are a gallery of human emotions. Chandan Das abstract paintings have a soothing effect. Shyamasish Ghoshs multi-coloured collages are throbbing with life. Sujata Bhattacharjees watercolours show nature in her pristine glory.																								When: Till today; 2 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Artists Circle, 46 Circus Avenue

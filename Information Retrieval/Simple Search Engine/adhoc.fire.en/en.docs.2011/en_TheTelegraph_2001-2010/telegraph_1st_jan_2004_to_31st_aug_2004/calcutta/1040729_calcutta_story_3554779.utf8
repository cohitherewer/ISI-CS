 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Rights bar on blood evidence
 															- Judge allows rape accused to refuse DNA test, but with a rider OUR LEGAL REPORTERThe judgment is in accordance with the law... Nobody can be compelled to give evidence against himself  Justice (retd) Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee A pound of flesh is one thing, a drop of blood quite another. Calcutta High Court on Wednesday held that no one could be forced to shed blood for medical  including DNA  tests.																								To give blood is a fundamental right that is protected under Section 21 of the Indian Constitution. No court has the right to allow any authority to curb the fundamental rights of people, observed Justice D.P. Sengupta.																								The order could have far-reaching effects and could even compel the administration to amend the Evidence Act enforced to crack cases by conducting DNA tests, court watchers observed. 																								Justice D.P. Sengupta, in his judgment, however, added that the court had the liberty to suspect that an accused was guilty if he was reluctant to give his blood for a DNA test. The unwillingness of the accused can be presumed as his guilty mind, the judge said.We get a consent letter from the accused before collecting blood for a DNA test. And if he does not allow it, the court can presume he is guilty  Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of policeThese observations were made while disposing of a petition filed by Raju Das, 25-year-old resident of Jugpur village, in the Nakashipara area of Nadia. Raju was arrested on April 19 for allegedly raping a 19-year-old girl of his village, but later granted bail. The victim later gave birth to a male child.																								Officers investigating the case moved the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM), Krishnagar, seeking permission to collect blood from Raju to match it with the baby. The SDJM gave the go-ahead but Raju refused to give blood for the tests. It is my blood. It is my body. It is my wish whether I will allow you to take my blood from my body. No court can force me to give blood, he announced and later moved a petition in the high court. After hearing lawyer Uttam Majumdar, who based his argument on Rajus fundamental right, Justice Sengupta set aside the SDJMS order.

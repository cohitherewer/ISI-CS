 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Sari or salwar-kameez? When it comes to the great sartorial split for schoolteachers, convention is the cry from one corner, comfort the clamour from the other.																								With the managing committees of city schools refusing to relax the dress code, and younger teachers straining at the six-yard leash, its confrontation time on campus.																								Things have come to such a pass that the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) has pleaded with the state government to urge the school managing committees to be more realistic and not take so rigid a stand on the sari.																								But to little avail. We understand the problems being faced by the new recruits who are much more comfortable in the salwar-kameez, said WBSSC chairman Arun Kiran Chakraborty. That is why we have written to the state school education department to give this genuine grievance a sympathetic hearing, he added.																								The WBSSCs role, Chakraborty explained, ended with the appointment of teachers. We do not have any role in the day-to-day administration of schools, he said, explaining why the WBSSC was helpless.																								Teachers, however, are in no mood to listen. Most of the managing committees of the 6,500-odd secondary schools still follow rules framed decades ago and teachers say they have had enough.																								Beltala Girls School, for example, forbade its teachers from wearing salwar-kameez during the schools annual sports meet that came off recently. Even those who were assigned the task of managing the meet were compelled to wear saris.																								The West Bengal Headmasters Association, too, receives regular complaints. Only a few days ago, a teacher from Surendranath Girls Collegiate School complained to us that she was not being allowed to wear the salwar-kameez, said association general secretary Ashok Maiti.																								In an institution in Maheshtala, a teacher wrote to the authorities to allow her to wear the salwar-kameez. After the initial refusal, she was allowed to come to school in a salwar-kameez but had to slip into a sari before entering the classroom. Now she goes to school in a sari. But she has complained to the WBSSC. And it is this letter that has forced the WBSSC to try and petition the government.																								There are two women members in the six-member WBSSC and they naturally feel strongly about the issue. One of them, Sikha Sengupta, said: There is no reason why teachers should not be allowed to wear salwar-kameez. We have already taken up the matter with the state government and will continue to put pressure on it till it is able to persuade the managing committees to do away with this.																								Maiti, meanwhile, has said that the government will be urged to intervene if so many teachers feel so strongly against the sari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Security cover under threat
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Are women in Calcutta less safe than in other cities? Stalked by stares: A common sight on city streets Manasi Chakrabarti, 
																		Behala																																																														Women cannot go out in the streets of Calcutta late at night for lack of security. Our police have failed miserably in curbing violence against women. Sukayna Saha,
Lake Town 																																																														We still belong to a male-dominated society. A womans safety has always been dependant on a mans whims and desires. Calcutta suffers more in comparison to other cities due to less job opportunities here that lead to frustration in men and sometimes, women on the streets have to bear the brunt of teasing by such frustrated unemployed youth. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore																																																														If the crime rate in the city is not checked immediately, all tall talks of empowerment of women and equality in gender status will be futile. 									

Saadia Sitwat, 
																		Linton Street																																																														In this city of bhadraloks, the concept of a womans honour is on the decline. No one knows where soceity is headed with such a dip in moral values, but surely safety of women here is on its way out.									

Udayan Banerjee, 
																		Bhadrakali																																																														The effects of so-called progress, callousness of the administration and lack of awareness among people have been spoiling the reputation of Calcutta regarding the safety of women. 									

Bina Chopra,
																		Address not given																																																														Modesty in both dress code as well as conduct, alertness and practical sense can definitely go a long way in assuring womens safety in the city.									

Sujoy Roy,
																		Sodepur																																																														Calcutta is losing its culture and the characteristics of the population are also changing. Police help is rarely available. If the offender has connections in high places, he goes unscathed. 									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane																																																														Making the city safe for women should be the prime responsibility of the authorities. In Calcutta, policemen often misuse their power to harass women under the pretext of upholding the Immoral Traffic Act.																																																														Rounak Pal, 																																																														Due to the apathy of our lawmen, crimes like rape, abduction, dowry death, sexual harassment and molestation have been on the rise in the city. Scarcity of women police personnel has added to the woes of the victims of violence against women. 									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,
																		Entally																																																														Calcutta used to be safe for women. At present, however, the crime situation has worsened and more and more cases of eve-teasing, homicide, rape, molestation and trafficking are being reported. But the situation can be bettered with proper measures.									

Puja Agarwal, 
																		Beleghata																																																														Women are safer in Calcutta than in other cities because of the cooperative and helpful denizens here. Occasional incidents cannot be completely avoided. 									

Biman Saha,
																		Lake Town																																																														Though all crimes against women do not get reported, Calcutta appears to be a safer place for women compared to other cities in our country. This is chiefly due to the culture of respecting women. However, there is still no room for compla-cency. 									

A.K. Mitra,
																		Paddapukur Road																																																														Calcutta is the safest city in India for women (may be in Asia). Even the Opposition political party in West Bengal cannot disagree. A few incidents that happen are exceptions. 									

NirmalYa Biswas, 
																		Hridaypur Station Road																																																														Doesnt it make a farce of the administrative scenario when statements of ministers claiming Calcutta to be an oasis of peace is reported on the same page carrying the news of the gruesome murder of a housewife in her apartment? Hostility towards women is nothing new, it has always been a part of urban life. 									

RonitA Datta,
																		Jadavpur																																																														Once Calcutta led by example when it came to ensuring safety of women in the city. But those days are gone when women could move on the road or watch a night show without fear. 									

Satyen Biswas, 
																		Behala																																																														Definitely, women in Calcutta are safer than in other cities. A stray incident may happen anytime, anywhere. So women should be careful when they go out. In case of eve-teasing, they should seek police help immediately. 									

Chandan Ray,
																		Sarsuna																																																														Crime against women here is increasing. Women are being teased in parks, roads, buses or trams. Those who raise voices of protest are beaten or even killed. Calcutta is certainly no oasis of peace.									

Raffhat Mir, 
																		Mcleod Street																																																														Statistics show that women residing in Calcutta are safer than those in Delhi. However, after reading the incident of a mentally challenged girl being raped in a train shatters my idea of women being safe in Calcutta. 									

Asef Nadeem, 
																		Serampore																																																														It is really difficult to say that Calcutta is safer than other cities in terms of womens security. Almost every day newspapers carry reports of sexual harassment in one form or another. 									

K.L. Ghosh, 
																		Kalindi																																																														The subject is a sore point in a ciivilised society. Both men and women share responsibility in this regard. 									

Sachindra Nath Mitra,
																		Beleghata																																																														All over India crime against women is growing. The same is also happening in Calcutta.									

Tapash Chakraborty,
																		Hooghly																																																														Women in Calcutta are safer than in the other metros, though incidents like molestation or eve-teasing are on the rise. Provocative Bollywood movies and indecent dresses trigger these happenings. There is no idealism in our next generation.									

Rohinimohan Palmazumdar, 
																		Shyamnagar																																																														Women in Calcutta are safe.									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge																																																														Due to political patronage given to criminals, violence against women has increased manifold.

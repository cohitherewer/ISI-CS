The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 New brew at Lalbazar
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Cops in Calcutta are  finally, some would say  beginning to bother about their health. Proof of this keep-fit pudding is in the drinking  a steaming cup of Horlicks, instead of tea or coffee.																								Senior officers (all of the IPS cadre) at Lalbazar have all but abandoned their customary beverage diet and switched to the health drink that comes streaming out of the vending machine.																								Set up six months ago at one end of the corridor of the police headquarters central building that houses the offices of nine IPS officers, including commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty, it has climbed steadily on the preference chart.																								Not only are the men in uniform opting for the new-found health tonic, but even guests are being served the schoolboys breakfast drink.																								And if the tea order was restricted to black or normal, the health drink comes in four kinds  plain, chocolate, vanilla and boost. Chocolate, it is learnt, is the favoured flavour.																								Among the strongest advocates of the health drink are deputy commissioner (headquarters) Sanjay Mukherjee and joint commissioner of traffic Banibrata Basu. 																								I used to drink tea and, sometimes, coffee. But now, I prefer the new drink. I love it, said Basu. Mukherjee makes it a point to treat his guests to this cup that cheers.																								And many visitors to Lalbazar are now hooked on to a Rs-4 cup of Horlicks.

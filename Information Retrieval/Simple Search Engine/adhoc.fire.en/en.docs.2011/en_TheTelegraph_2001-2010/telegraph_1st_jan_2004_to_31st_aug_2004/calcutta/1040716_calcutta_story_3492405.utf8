The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Hospitality success recipe: reception, Bengal style
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Gurpal Pali Singh Kalra: The Calcutta cradle. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								His salmon steak, to be grilled and served on a lemon artichoke slaw, comes from Norway. The succulent lamb chops are flown in from New Zealand and Australia. The trout for the flambe with white wine is ferried from Manali But the khatir (hospitality) is khash Kolkatar (specially Calcuttan).																								Gurpal Singh Kalra  Pali to friends and foodies  caters to some of the biggest dos upcountry with the most lavish of live designer-cuisine counters and boasts an annual turnover touching Rs 7 crore.																								But when it comes to picking his personnel, the 56-year-old recipe czar drives down all the way from Chandigarh to Alipore every year. Calcutta is where he was born and educated, Calcutta is where he scouts for hospitality with a smile.																								No one can match Calcuttans in the warm art of reception, declares the Bangali Sardarji, who savours his shorshey ilish as much as his palak gosht.																								So, every year, Kalra camps in town for a month or more to grill local candidates and select around 150 youngsters to tend to his unique presentation style (UPS) parties. These young men and women (in the age group of 25-28) rustle up and serve food, look after guests and add zing to the live, interactive counters with assorted party pyrotechnics during the extended carnival season from August to May.																								I give them a week-long orientation once they land up, so that they know how to serve grilled prawns flambe and white wine with basil and cream sauce at site. Or how to display the lobsters and red snappers and man the live pasta station adroitly, explains the catering king of the north, who has been making this annual recruitment pilgrimage to his birthplace for the past decade.																								Kalra, whose father used to supply rice to Amber, Sky Room and Trincas among other places, laments the lack of exposure for local youth in Calcutta keen to make a mark in the catering trade. In Punjab and Delhi, they get to serve at special theme dos, including Hawaiian, Arabian, Egyptian and Mughal, and often save up quite a neat amount. Some have returned to town to build houses, while others have stayed back and settled down up north, he observes.																								Through Palis Cater to Cater, Kalra has come a long way from his early forays into hoteliering in Kashmir (Natraj) and Ladakh (Kang-Lha-Chhen). Today, his guests roll of honour reads like a hall of fame roster up north  from the Maharaja of Patiala to Sukhbir Singh Badal, the Raja of Nalagarhs daughters wedding to Giani Zail Singhs farewell dinner.																								Now, even on a casual morning stroll at the Victoria Memorial, I meet people who have been to my big-bang bashes, smiles the sprightly Sardar, who is behind the wheel when hes not behind the counter. (I even drove down in a Volkswagen from Germany in 1973).																								Kalra, who had flown out singer Amrik Singh Arora and crack chef Albert Gomes (thanks to good ol Joshua from Trincas) to get his Pahalgam hotel rocking, went to Mittenwalt, near the Austrian Alps, for a formal course in catering ethics after winding up operations in Kashmir. But todays magic marriage between glamour and gastronomy, he insists, is all about instinct and adaptability.

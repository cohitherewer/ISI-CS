	Jetties on the Hooghly are in a deplorable condition. The wooden planks and metal structures need urgent repairs and a fresh coat of paint. Some planks have developed scary cracks. Thousands of office-goers use these jetties every day. 
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 
	A new restaurant off Free School Street has become a nuisance for local residents. The outlet runs a noisy generator from morning till late in the night. It also keeps open till the wee hours. Police should take steps to restore the calm in the area. 
	Mustaq Khan, MA Ahmed Road.

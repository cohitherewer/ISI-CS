An exhibition of art works by Vishnu Das marks the celebration of the 30th anniversary of Gorky Sadan and also pays a tribute to Helena Ivanova Roerich, who dedicated her lifes work to India. Rediscovering the energies of the wash in several variations, extending from austerely-treated traditional mountainscapes to the more ornately decorated works bearing influences of Persian miniatures, Das paintings are predominantly in oil pastels. The diffused magical shapes and forms, conjured by the artist, tease the viewers imagination, transporting them to a realm beyond the real and substantial, giving his work a cosmic dimension, cleverly blended with traces of the surreal. Organised by the Cultural Department of the Russian Federation Consulate General in Calcutta, the exhibition brings to focus the creative genius of one of the most gifted artists of our time.

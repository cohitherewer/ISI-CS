 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Life for killing classmate
 																											- Schoolboy pays for muzzling protest against teacher molest A STAFF REPORTER																								Out on bail for the past two years, Pawan Jaiswal, accused of murdering his classmate who protested his molesting their classteacher, had enrolled himself in a B.Com course, believing that the case would fall through for want of evidence. 																								On Thursday, his past caught up with him when fast-track court judge C.L. Sinha read out the life sentence for murder. His face ashen and eyes shut, Jaiswal stood trembling in the dock. 																								You are punishing an innocent man, screamed relative Nirmal Maity, adding: We will appeal before the high court and get you out.																								Pawan, 21, had murdered classmate Tinku on May 28, 2002, when he was a student of Class XII in an English-medium school in Howrah. 																								According to assistant public prosecutor Nandalal Chatterjee, Tinku had tried to dissuade Pawan from molesting their teacher on her way back from school.																								Pawan had threatened Tinku with dire consequences. A couple of days later, when Tinku was waiting at a local sweet shop on Bellilious Road, Pawan dragged him out onto the street and stabbed him several times with a dagger, the public prosecutor recounted.																								Tinku was moved to National Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta, where he succumbed to his injuries later in the day, he added.																								Tinkus parents lodged a complaint against Pawan at Howrah police station and he was arrested the same evening on charges of murder. 																								He was kept in the central lock-up in Howrah and produced in court the following day. His bail was rejected and he was remanded to a seven-day judicial custody. Later, Pawan was granted bail and he was brought to the court on Thursday morning, the public prosecutor said.																								The post-mortem report confirmed that Tinkus death was caused by injuries inflicted with a sharp weapon, said investigating officer Shibnath Kanjilal. 																								The murder weapon was recovered from the spot and later proved to be one of the strongest evidences in the case. The fingerprint report confirmed that it was Pawan who killed Tinku  his fingerprints and the ones on the dagger handle matched perfectly, Kanjilal told the court.																								The men who had witnessed the murder appeared before the court. Their statements went against Pawan and his fate was sealed. Judge Sinha observed that Pawan was guilty and punished him with a life sentence and a fine of Rs 1,000. 																								He is innocent and has been framed. We will appeal before the high court, said Maity.

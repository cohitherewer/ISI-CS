The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Data entry in grand design
ALAPAN BANDYOPADHYAY				 	 ALAPAN BANDYOPADHYAY, chief executive officer of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), met readers of The Telegraph in his office last week to answer their queries. Participants included Archak Bhaduri, Mihir Dutta, Sudhanshu Dutta, Amrita Mukherjee, Jitendranath Das, Swarupa Mukherjee, Santashree Guha, P. Bhattacharjee, Biswajit Mitra, Rajnarayan Gupta and Nirmalendu Dutta				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Rajnarayan Gupta: You are using the Geographical Information System (GIS) to plan your projects. Do these surveys have any serious applications?																																																			The GIS is a very ambitious project of the CMDA. Under this scheme, we have collected geographical data of different areas of Howrah and assembled them according to the number of wards in the town. By taking a quick look at the data, we will have at hand the water level, power supply and other such information necessary for our projects.We have surveyed 38 municipalities and prepared an exhaustive database. We will soon hand over to them these structured database systems, from which, at the click of a mouse, people can get all the information they need. To coordinate matters and make the system user-friendly, we have opened a cell in the Howrah municipality building.																																																									

P. Bhattacharjee: Is your agency planning new roads in Howrah to ease traffic chaos?																																																			I have been part of the Howrah administration for quite some time. My experience says that the towns traffic management needs to be overhauled. Central Howrah has had a haphazard growth, so traffic congestion will continue unless roadspace is increased. To compound matters, a number of bus termini have sprung up in the area. Our newly-laid Grand Foreshore Road, though, has helped ease congestion on the approach road to the bridge. 																																																									

P. Bhattacharjee: Can new roads help in pockets like Mandirtala and Bankra?																																																			I feel immediate increase of roadspace is absolutely necessary. But at the same time, central Howrah is an old zone and thickly populated. The buildings came up in a most unplanned manner. The only solution is to vacate some of the residential plots and widen the road. That is a major and time-consuming project. Moreover, there are funds constraints holding up the implementation.																																																									

Rajnarayan Gupta: The Kona Expressway is well-maintained. But the link to Kadamtala or Bankra needs attention. Is there a plan to extend the Metro Railway there or to build a flyover?																																																			Some major townships are coming up in the western end of Howrah, along the Kona Expressway. Moreover, the road forms an essential part of the east-west bypass connecting the area with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass via Vidyasagar Setu. We have paid special attention to this stretch of road as it will handle a very large volume of traffic once the projects are completed. We do not have any concrete plan for a Metro extension to the expressway or a flyover in Bankra or Kadamtala.																																																									

Swarupa Mukherjee: The apartments in Saurav Abasan Phase I and II and Purva Abasan are highly priced. Is the CMDA giving any financial assistance?																																																			Our role is that of a seller. We do not have any financial assistance scheme but buyers can opt for housing loans offered by private and nationalised banks. 																																																									

Santashree Guha: Do social welfare groups or ladies groups get a concession? 																																																			As far as Sourav Abasan I and II and Purva are concerned, we will not provide any subsidy or concession to any buyer.																																																									

Santashree Guha: The CMDA brochure on Purva is incomplete. For example, there is no information about which agency will supply water and electricity. 																																																			The electricity will be supplied by the CESC and water by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. If you still want more information, our office will help.																																																									

Biswajit Mitra: Are there any projects for the middle class?																																																			We are making some low-cost housing estates under the Ambedkar Awas Yojana. There, too, the quality factor will push up the price. However, a subsidy from the Centre will help cut the sale price of the flats.(Concluded)

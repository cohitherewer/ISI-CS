The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 Life - Party Hopping				 Its the time to disco
 FEMME POWER: Revellers rock the floor at the ladies bar night at the Hyatt Regency on Friday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 They are the people who make some of the most sizzling parties in town happen. But they themselves choose to remain behind the scenes at any bash. So, when the Hyatt Regency threw a party for all event managers of the city last Wednesday, the show-makers took a while to open up and let their hair down on the dance floor.																								The hotel had ensured that the fun menu of the evening was entertainment-packed, but the guest gang chose to be a silent audience for the first part of the evening. So much so that some peppy numbers from Fifth Dimension like Euphorias Dhoom Pichak Dhoom and Aana Tu Meri Gali failed to drag a single footfall to the floor. Sandeep Vyas tried hard with some popular Hindi numbers and remixes like Its the Time to Disco and Bin Tere Sanam, and succeeded in drawing two or three couples out of the shell.																								Two Russian dancers  Alixia and Lyana  whom the hotel had imported for the event, managed to inspire the audience with some phoren jhatkas. This, along with a couple of prizes announced for dancers on the floor, finally broke barriers and got the crowd going.																								With the feeling of them being the event, the managers finally let loose. So, when Daisy Dee  a two-member band by Diti and Renee  took over, the crowd was rocking to the same popular Hindi numbers like Mahee Ve and Its the Time to Disco all over again. 																								DJ Sanjeev Vyas ensured that the crowd had enough music masti to groove for the rest of the night.																								The effort by the hotel was, however, greatly appreciated by the invitees. Sanchita Kushary Bose, for one, was overwhelmed by the gesture as this was the first time someone has thrown a party for those who are always organising parties.																								Hyatt was the hotspot on Friday night, as well. But this bash was aimed at a much bigger group doing the night rounds  the ladies of the city. The men, however, were not denied entry, provided they had a lady by their side.																								Y-Fling Fridays, a ladies bar night to be held on Fridays throughout June and July, kicked off this week. The response to the first night was rocking, with regular party hoppers and some models thronging The Bar.																								Music from DJ Pari made it a fun nite of and for the ladies. The crowd rocked the dance floor well into the night and complimentary drinks for the ladies from Fling made sure that the spirits were soaring. DJ Ryan at Dublin 																								Rocking to retro and RyanWhoever thought old is just old ought to have checked out the rocking retro nights at the Dublin this weekend. Flying in DJ Ryan Beck from Mumbai, who inaugurated Anticlock in the city some 10 years back, official sponsor Smirnoff added to the high spirits with free drinks for the most volatile souls on the floor.																								For those too engrossed tapping to the tunes of evergreen tracks by Beegees, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton and Sting, to pay the DJ console any mind, Ryan is the celebrated DJ from Enigma, one of the hottest discs in Mumbai. 																								Ryan is no stranger to the city and its ways even though he cant come here as often as hed want to because the sponsors find the flight tickets between the two cities rather expensive!																								The DJ nevertheless has kicked in enough parties in town to know what the crowd digs. Retro rocks here, declared Ryan, before going on to endear himself to the crowd by churning out a couple of hits from Yuva as well, simply because it was shot in the city. 																								Though the guest DJ got off to a rather late start a little before Friday midnight, resident DJ Harish played along with the theme, throwing up a club mix of Buffalo Soldier, Going Gets Tough, Thats All, Uptown Girl, paving the way for Ryan to take off smoothly.																								One wouldnt say the consideration was aptly reciprocated as Ryan thinks one of the reasons the night scene in the city doesnt measure up to Mumbai is because the DJs here dont apply themselves. 																								Creatures of the night, however, couldnt care less about the war of the DJs  or the tale of two cities  as long as they got their usual dose of party numbers.																								Knowing that the crowd is king (or should we say pretty princess) Ryan churned out the usual Paul Van Dyke, Infected Mushrooms tracks, along with house-mix numbers by Beyonce Knowles, during in the electro hour.																								All this was strictly for the teenyboppers, with the retro loving older crowd having run out of steam with hours to go for daybreak.																								The cool KatShe is among the most sought-after party people in the loop, simply because she is out of it. So, when she does step into public space  even briefly  she does it with a bang.																								Boom may have gone bust, but Katrina Kaif (below) sure is booming. If proof of popularity is in the mobbing, Katrina is queen bee. 																								The 10 minutes that the model-cum-actor-cum-Salman-obsession spent at the Khadims showroom in City Centre on Saturday proved Katrinas draw beyond a doubt.																								Dressed in white satin dress with tresses kissing shapely shoulders, as Katrina stepped out of a black Mercedes, the rush to get a glimpse of her was maddening.																								Protected by a human shield of securitymen, she made a quick recce of the showroom before slipping back into the car and heading straight back to the airport.																								I love the old look of Calcutta, but I have frankly not had the chance to see the city at all, she said.																								An absolutely private person, dropping into a nightclub is also something of a no-no, she claimed, before dishing out her favourite pastime: I dont party at all and I hate to socialise. I am happy at home watching TV or even cooking.																								So whats cooking between her and the Khan? Right now you can only say that we are co-stars, she smiled.																								Katrina is all set to work for David Dhawans next comedy flick that has Salman in the lead.																								Drawing the professional line even further she drawled: We still havent started working so I am yet to find out what kind of a person he is on the sets. Point taken.																								Monsoon mouthful																								Josh guy Sharad Kapoor refrained from the usual monsoon grind with his screen ladies to dig into some special fare at Tangerine, served up especially for the rainy days. Keeping him company were bawling babies to curious kids who kept the actor enthralled at his restaurant on Wednesday.

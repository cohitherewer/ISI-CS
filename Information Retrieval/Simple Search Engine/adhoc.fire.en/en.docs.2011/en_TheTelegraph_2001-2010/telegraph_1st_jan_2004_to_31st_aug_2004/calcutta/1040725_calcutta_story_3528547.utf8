 Sunday, July 25, 2004 To neuter or not to neuter
Pet Passion Nelanjana BhowmickThere is no doubt that neutering has an enormous impact on reducing the number of unwanted puppies, kittens, dogs and cats. Neutering is a simple surgical procedure which prevents pets from reproducing by removing their reproductive organs. In females, the surgery is called a spay and in males, a neuter. Benefits of neutering your pet:  Prevention of unwanted litters and the reduction of pet overpopulation. Debashish Chakraborty of PFA, Calcutta, says: Unlike strays, pedigree dogs are artificially bred and lack the expertise of delivering puppies by themselves. They need help from an experienced owner or vet, failing which complications in pregnancy can occur. Neutering increases your pets chances for a longer, healthier life. It greatly reduces the risk of many cancers, tumours and other deadly diseases. Their urge to mate leads to roaming, fighting, aggression and excessive barking. Neutered pets are relieved of this urge, making them calmer and more content. If you have more than one pet, youll find that your neutered pets get along much better with each other.Misconceptions about neutered pets:  Neutering will not make pets fat and lazy; overeating and lack of exercise cause that. Sterilising your pet will not cause a personality change in the pet. An exuberant, active pet will remain that way.Make sure your pet has been neutered. Dont think that by finding a home for each of your pets puppies or kittens you avoid adding to the number of homeless pets. Actually, youve kept other dogs and cats waiting in animal shelters from getting a home.

 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Doll-up disaster in hangout zone
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND JULIUS GOMES				 	 Vardaan Market on Camac Street, now going through travails of unplanned beautification																								Calcuttas civic authorities have set themselves a goal: doll up Camac Street. 																								Simply put, its a daunting task. For, the civic authorities face several obstacles in their endeavour to beautify Camac Street: food vendors who wash vegetables and utensils or even cook rice on kerosene stoves on the freshly-laid pavements; an aerial jungle of billboards; kiosks that break the flow of human traffic...																								Camac Street is also where most of the action is: large malls, fashionable boutiques, a string of restaurants, business establishments, banks and airline offices, as well as several residential buildings. 																								Enter, mayor Subrata Mukherjee. Hes convened an emergency meeting this week to devise methods to curb the madness on Camac Street.																								A sum of Rs 50 lakh has already gone into a facelift for the stretch between Park Street and AJC Bose Road, under mayor Mukherjees Rs 4-crore pavement beautification scheme, amid much dissent. 																								It is an aimless beautification, grumbled senior civic engineers, smarting for being ignored in the planning process before the work began.																								They claim the endeavour is a zero-benefit investment scheme for the civic authorities, since it benefits neither the motorist nor the pedestrian. It also restricts entry to residences, restaurants, malls, business establishments and hangout hotspots.																								The pavement beautification has left 50 per cent of it unusable, with hawkers jostling for space with milk booths, telephone boxes and low billboards. Pedestrians are forced to step on to the carriageway, where cars are parked. 																								The vendors earn a livelihood off the pavements, and cater to the staff of the offices on Camac Street and its vicinity. It is not possible to evict them, explained borough VII executive engineer Chinmoy Bhattacharjee, who supervised work on the stretch.																								From AJC Bose Road to Park Street, there are 22 haphazardly erected and low billboards, bang on the pavements of Camac Street, which look like half-pulled-down shutters, following their trimming prescribed by the facelift scheme. 																								We spent Rs 400 to pave each square metre of the footpaths with blocks, pointed out director-general (civil) Udayshankar Sengupta. 																								I have taken up the matter of removing and relocating the billboards with Calcutta Municipal Corporation secretary Sajal Bhowmik. 																								Sengupta said the beautification carried out successfully on Park Street, Russel Street and Southern Avenue is not working out on Camac Street because of the food vendors.																								He feels the beautification should have included plantation of greenery and setting up of parking bays to accommodate at least 200 cars on either side of the road.																								Engineers in the civic roads department disclosed that there had been a proposal under the AJC Bose Road flyover scheme that the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners widen Camac Street between AJC Bose Road and Shakespeare Sarani. The proposal was, however, scrapped without their knowledge.																								It would have been better if Camac Street was widened by trimming the pavements, as has been done on CIT Road, they reasoned.

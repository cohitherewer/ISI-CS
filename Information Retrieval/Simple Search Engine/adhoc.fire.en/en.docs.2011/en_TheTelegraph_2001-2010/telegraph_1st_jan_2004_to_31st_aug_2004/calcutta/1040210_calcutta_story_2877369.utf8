The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Happy head-hunt on Joka campus
 															- Fee-slash slugfest sparks no fear among recruiters at management school A STAFF REPORTER																								Recruiters  both national and international  have renewed their faith in the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, even as the ministry of human resource development and the countrys six premier B-schools enter the showdown ring.																								The signs are all positive on the Joka campus in this years summer placements, with 93 firms  up from 77 last year  lining up for the recruitment race and making 290 offers for the 250 first-year students. Twenty students have received overseas offers.																								Coming at a time when the Calcutta campus  and the five others around the country  is caught up in the slugfest over fees between Murli Manohar Joshis ministry and the individual IIMs, this is a reaffirmation of the value that brand IIM enjoys in the elite corporate club. As we enter the home stretch for permanent placements 2004, our performance in the summer and the upturn in the economy give us a sense of quiet optimism about what we can expect, said Prof Mritiunjoy Mohanty, chairperson, placement cell, IIMC. The final placements for second-year students will start on March 14.																								From investment bankers to NGOs and automobile companies to consulting majors, there is around a 20 per cent increase in the number of companies on campus this year, said Abhishek Sharman of the placement cell. We expect this trend to continue for the final placement as well, he added.																								The sectoral break-up of the summer internships offered to the B-school boys and girls once again reiterated the traditional strength of the countrys oldest IIM, with finance jobs accounting for over 34 per cent of the offers.																								The boom in the fast-moving consumer goods and the IT and IT-enabled services sectors continued, with both accounting for 17 per cent of the offers. Over 12 per cent of the internships offered came from operations and supply chain management, while consulting had a six per cent share.																								The list of head-hunters in Joka included ABN Amro, Accenture, American Express, AV Birla Group, Bank of America, Cadbury, Citibank, Coca-Cola, Cognizant Technology Solutions, CRISIL, DSP Merrill Lynch, Gillette, Glaxo SmithKline, HSBC, H amp;R Johnson, IBM, Infosys, Indian Oil, JM Morgan Stanley, Johnson amp; Johnson, National Kidney Foundation (Singapore), Hewlett Packard and ISRO.																								Sectors making a strong comeback, after a relatively quiet couple of years, included investment banking, automobile, IT consulting and manufacturing, observed Mohanty.																								The participation of global investment banks saw a significant rise over last year, with the return of JP Morgan Chase and the first foray of International Finance Corporation into campus recruitment at IIM Calcutta. This was in addition to Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Lehman Brothers, regular shoppers for B-school brains at Joka over the past few years.

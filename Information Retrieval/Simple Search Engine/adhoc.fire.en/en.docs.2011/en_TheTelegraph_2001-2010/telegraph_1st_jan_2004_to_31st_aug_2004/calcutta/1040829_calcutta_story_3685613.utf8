The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 29, 2004 All about awareness
Nelanjana BhowmickThe dog is a mans best friend  every child grows up learning this. I did too, but only to realise how little we actually believe in it.This has been an eye-opener of a week! On the one hand, a film which presented the peaceful co-existence of tigers and monks in a monastery in Thailand. On the other, educated, affluent residents of Golf Garden desperate to do away with the strays of their locality.So where do you propose the stray dogs of Calcutta go? Relocate them to areas with a lower dog population? But relocating a stray complicates things further, with territorial dog fights. Put them away in an animal shelter? But shelters are for injured animals and sterilisation programmes. None of this works. The simplest things to do are:Undertake sterilisation in your area. This would entail getting a letter from your local counsellor, assigning an NGO to sterilise and vaccinate the strays and ensuring their safe return.Report diseased or mangy dogs immediately. These dogs are sent back after treatment, only if they are not prone to spreading diseases.If a stray in your area goes missing, report it to an NGO. A couple of contacts: People For Animals (24647030, 24239100) and Love n Care (24881222, 9831275719).During the entire Golf Green episode, I got overwhelming support from the ground, rather than the highrises. The only concern among the so-called common people seemed the safe return of their para dogs! I realised they are better informed and more compassionate about mans best friend than the so-called people like us.

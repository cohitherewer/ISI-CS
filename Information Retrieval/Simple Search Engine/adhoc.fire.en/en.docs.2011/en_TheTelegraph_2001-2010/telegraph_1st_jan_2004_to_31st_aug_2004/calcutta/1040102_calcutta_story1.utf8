The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 02, 2004  Ringing in 2004
 On December 31, as wine flowed, spirits  ran high and people partied, partied and then partied some  more, The Telegraph bashes were without any doubt, the hottest  tickets in town. Beat-busting music, some of the best spin-doctors  in the country, great food and entertainers by the dozen  the action was fast, furious and absolutely non-stop. The  Goodlife team was there of course, making the rounds, so for  those who missed out on the good times, heres a run-down  on what were some of the best closing moments of 2003 Music was in the air at the DI  as popular band Blue Mist held court, though the biggest  crowd-pullers were Don and Sonia Saigal and of course, Calcuttas  singing sensation from the Swinging Sixties Pam Craine.  Belting out a plethora of hits down the decades, the husky-voiced  Pam proved once again, that she still has that old magic. It was a lethal combination of  music and mayhem that kept revellers at The Taj Bengal rocking  into the wee hours of the morning. Even as DJ Poison scratched  out the latest re-mixes backed by a live band and sultry  dancers at the Crystal Room, at Incognito, DJ Amit ensured  that merry-makers at the nightclub had a whale of a time. Great music and a whole lot of  entertainment that was the scene at the Saturday  Club. While fire stunts and Prince Sils exciting magic  show provided some off-beat action, there was plenty of  the usual fare lined up by way of some hot and heavy belly-dancing  courtesy the Hong-Kong based Belinda and a foot-tapping  performance by singer Mou, all backed by the 
 addictive beats of DJ Feroze. The sparkling-blue waters of the  swimming pool, twinkling lights and candlelit tables  romance was in the air at the poolside of The Oberoi Grand.  And with the dulcet-toned Gary Lawyer regaling all and sundry  with a host of golden oldies, a headier combination you  couldnt ask for. At the Calcutta Swimming Club,  local lad Shayne Hyrapiet did what he does best hitting  it live and loud while a bevy of Australian flirt models  provided the requisite eye-candy. Although crackling bonfires on  the lawns of the CC amp;FC did their bit to ease the chill  in the air, it was Mumbai-based band Fahrenheit that really  heated things up. With DJs Ankur and Jonky also in the house  to add some spice, 2004 was ushered in on a high note. Turning up the volume at the Calcutta  Club was veteran rock act Shiva who managed to hit all the  right buttons with a pleasing mix of hits both old  and new that kept party-goers on their toes all night long  For many, the Space Circle was  where it was at especially as Shaan was shining down  on one and all. The always-charming singer was at his energetic  best as he whipped up a storm with all his chart-busting  songs Tanha Dil and Bhool Jaa among others  that had the crowd screaming for more. The rolling greens of the Tollygunge  Club came alive to the sound of music, Skinny Alley and  Hip Pocket style. An added incentive to stay on the floor  and groove to the music came in the form of young musician  Geno Banks, son of jazz maestro Louis Banks who proved that  for him, it was all in the genes.

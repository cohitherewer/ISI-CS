The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Stress and tension, stigma and support
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For those of us who have been associated with Turning Point, and continue to be so, we know what it means and how it has changed our lives, were the poignant words from Anirban Bhadra.																								It wasnt a big event, but the cause itself was. Monday morning saw the launch of the National Alliance for Mentally Ill (NAMI), Calcutta chapter, headed by Ishita Sanyal, founder-member of the support group for the mentally ill, Turning Point. 																								Instituted in 1979, NAMI helps at every step, treatment to rehabilitation, including counselling, housing and vocational training.																								It was an opportunity for most people present to exchange true stories of their own experiences, in order to create awareness. 																								Speaking on the occasion, Kalyan Dasgupta, former IAS officer and president of Turning Point, said: Everyone has passion, so we are all a little mad, he felt. While today we are not bound to send the mentally ill to jail, even the way the law is worded is prejudiced.																								Chief guest Rupa Ganguly came in support of a cause, and stole hearts and minds with her honesty. Although there for barely 15 minutes, she spoke about the stigma attached to mental illness, even going to see a psychiatrist. 																								When I ask my mother to go to my psychiatrist, who is also a friend, she says no to the paglar doctor. Unfortunately, I even have a few friends who think I have problems because I go to a psychiatrist. But, it helps with the stress and tension. The stigma has to be dealt with, she added.																								Psychiatrist Subir Hazra Chowdhury said that the good thing about Indian culture is that families rarely forsake their relatives when they have mental illnesses, unlike the West. But it is true that the domestic help is more prone to mental illness than the employer, he clarified.																								The programme included a seminar on the side-effects of medication and success stories, during which one young man spoke of his personal journey from the depths of mental illness and hallucinations to a job in a multinational company. 																								That was inspiration for everyone, added Sanyal.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 For sleuths, DNA key to nail a killer
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								A suspects sweat will now help city sleuths crack a crime.																								For the first time in the history of Calcutta Police, a batch of six officers has been trained in using DNA test findings to track a culprit. The six are part of a group of 24 from across the country, who attended for the past three months a scientific investigation session at the central detective training school, at Park Circus. The session, with both theoretical and practical aspects of investigation, ended last week.																								The advanced procedure of investigation will open a new avenue for us, said Shantanu Majumdar, one of the officers. For example, a man may have committed the almost perfect murder, hardly leaving behind any clues. But we find a half-burnt cigarette. That is enough for us to gather the DNA identification of the killer, because the cigarette will yield the murderers saliva sample, Majumdar explained. 																								During investigation, a touch of the suspects arm will yield his sweat, which can be matched with the DNA identification we already have of the murderer, the officer added. To date, police find it difficult to prove a suspect guilty if there is no witness to the crime. Now, the DNA report itself can be treated as prime evidence to prove the suspect guilty, said Majumdar.																								During the training session, the officers were shown films on sensational investigations carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in recent times. The films showed how the science was helping the FBI crack crime and nail the guilty in a courtroom, said an official at the detective training school. The officers under training were taken to the forensic science laboratories to explain to them how scientific tests are conducted.																								Hi-tech apart, the officers were also taught how to tackle advocates in a courtroom. A make-believe courtroom was set up in the institution, in which high court public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah played judge. We had to produce evidence and interrogate witnesses. The suspects lawyers countered our charges. A mock trial was fought, before the judge passed his verdict, said another officer of the batch.																								Also on the agenda was how the sleuths must conduct themselves on the spot of a crime. Criminology says there must be some clue at the site. Sometimes, we declare that a murder was clueless. It means we have failed to pick up any leads from the spot, said the officer. So, we were told to form groups of two or three and examine every inch of the scene of a crime.																								The rule applies even to road mishaps. An on-the-spot search can prove whether it was really an accident or a pre-planned murder, said the officer.

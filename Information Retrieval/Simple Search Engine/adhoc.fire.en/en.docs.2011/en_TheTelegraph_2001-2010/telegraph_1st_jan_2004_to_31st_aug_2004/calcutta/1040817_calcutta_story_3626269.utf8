Picture by Aranya Sen															A busy weekend at Winning Streak, the nightclub at the HHI, kicked off on Friday night with DJ Gaurav from Delhi and Neeraj Sreedhar (of Bombay Vikings fame) holding fort.The scene at the sports bar, which has been the hub of a lot of activity for the past week, started hotting up around midnight when DJ Gaurav took command of the console, churning out latest tracks like Hum Tum, Saat Samandar and Dekh Le to the delight of a chock-a-block dance floor.																					Once the crowd had warmed up, Sreedhar caught up with the action as well, lip-syncing to tracks like Woh Chali and Aa Raha Hoon Mein, teasing the crowd before succumbing to the Chhod Do Aanchal clamour.																					It is great to be in Calcutta. The folks here are so receptive to music commented the singer who had been on a daylong tour of the city, before calling it a night.

Indias premier book retail chain has kicked-off a 15-day (from August 13 to August 27) Music Mela to pamper its clientele.																					Having launched the bookstore four months ago, the store has organised a number of events to foster the love of reading and provide a browsing-friendly ambience. Now, the effort has begun to woo music aficionados with some great live music, starting with Chandrabindu on August 18 and Krosswindz on August 21.																					Crossword is not only a bookstore but is a multi-purpose destination. We want to turn it into a platform for social and cultural events, explained Sidharth Pansari, managing director, Crossword.																					Neeraj Sreedhar appeared here as well to launch the show. I have always loved to be in Calcutta. People here appreciate music and the food is fabulous, smiled the singer.																					Colour fest																					 Aksh, a four-year-old label of design wear, has been catching the eye quietly but steadily at boutiques around town. From Virgo, Aura, Mantra and Studio Nilanjali closer home, to Oorja in distant Hyderabad, you would spot the label sharing rack space with big names as well as local tags. 																					Aksh creations have always been screaming out from the shelves with their splash of bright colours  turquoise, fuschia, orange, red, lime green. And colours are precisely what the new festive offerings from the label are all about.																					The sister-in-law duo behind Aksh, designers Kiran and Shruti Dhanuka, has launched a collection of lehngas and salwar suits for the coming festive season  primarily Rakhi and the Pujas. And the essence of the collection lies in the medley of bright colours. Combinations like red and firozi, orange and turquoise, fuschia and green form the palette.																					There are two lines of salwar suits  formals and semi-formals, ranging from Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,500 respectively. While the semi-formals are in cottons and linen, the formal ones are in crepes and georgettes. Zardosi, sequins, stonework and kantha embroidery adorn the heavier kameezes, while the casual collection is more about block prints and hand-paint. 																					The lehngas, ranging from Rs 7,000 upwards, in crepes and georgettes, have embellishments like zardosi, sequins and stones. Theres also a limited line of cotton crushed skirts, priced at Rs 1,500, which can double up as casual lehngas. Nicola in an Aksh outfit.

We have not had a major event at the food court since its inception last year. We were planning to come up with something and what better occasion than Independence Day, said Malay Dastidar, manager, Burp.																					The floor was done up in green and golden hues to give the feel of the day, with special menus at the outlets adding to the patriotic fervour.																					If the chaat freaks were crowding the Chatpati chaatwaala, the ice-cream lovers were having a rollicking time at the Rollick Ice-cream outlet. Veggies made a killing at Raj Veggie Point and meat-eaters were ecstatic at Badshah Quikys. 																					Apart from the reasonably priced food, the kids playing arena was a huge hit with the mothers and their toddlers soaking up some sun.

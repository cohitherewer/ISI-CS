The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Business as usual back at the bakery
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 The verandah of the Saha house at 91/3C, Tollygunge Road, deserted after Saturday nights multiple deaths. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Death made no difference. It was business as usual at the three-room factory-cum-office of Ramakrishna Bakery on Monday, after seven members of the Saha family died under mysterious circumstances late on Saturday. 																								The bakery is run by brothers Sukhendu and Dibyendu, who live in the same building as their brother Nabendu, who died along with his wife Anubha, sons Shibendu and Krishnendu, Shibendus wife Swati and their two children. 																								The mood at the bakery, on Izzatullah Road, in Tollygunge, on Monday was one of nonchalance, as loaves emerging fresh from the oven were being graded, assembled and packed for distribution as on any other day. 																								The set-up in the mezzanine floor office is extremely modest, with the portrait of paterfamilias, the late Santosh Saha, staring down from the wall. The furniture is basic. The manager answers the lone telephone, and some part-time accountants pore over files. Calendar cutouts are plastered on the walls. 																								The fortunes of the bakery, which employs 90 workers in three shifts, have obviously gone from bad to worse in the past five years. Numerous small bakeries mushrooming on Izzatullah Road, off Tollygunge bridge, have hit hard the ageing establishment, whose annual turnover has plummeted to a lakh.																								Business was faltering so much that the brothers had to take a loan of Rs 5 lakh from the West Bengal Financial Development Corporation a few months ago to upgrade the 20-year-old equipment, an insider said.																								Employees say that whereas Dibyendus son comes once in a while to see how the unit is doing, Sukhendus son has not shown up for a long time.																								The differences among the brothers is apparent from the fact that Sukhendu and Dibyendu did not trade with brothers Nabendu and Amalendu, who ran a wholesale business in refined flour, sugar, semolina and other groceries.																								We procure our raw material from Burrabazar, from the same shop from which Sri Krishna Trading Company procures its merchandise for wholesale, part-time accountant T.R. Das elaborated.

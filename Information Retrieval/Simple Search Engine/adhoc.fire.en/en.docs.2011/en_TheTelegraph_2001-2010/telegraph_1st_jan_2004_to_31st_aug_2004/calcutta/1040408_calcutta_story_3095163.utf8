 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 Gillian Roy makes a point at the workshop. Picture by Aranya Sen																								They are handlers of history who take great pains in trying to preserve the past. But for museum curators, formal training is something that is a little hard to come by.																								To address this problem and go a little beyond, a workshop on conservation techniques for museum curators got underway on Tuesday. 																								Bridging the knowledge gap is Gillian Roy, a consultant with the British Museum in the UK and an expert in the field. The three-day workshop targets keepers of smaller museums from across the state and is being organised by British Council and Centre for Archaeological Studies amp; Training.																								Were looking at smaller museum curators, who have probably not had much training and would want to know the preliminary steps to conservation, said Roy, a British national married to a Calcuttan. Her husband died last year. Fifteen participants are attending the workshop from places such as Ananda Niketan Kirtishala in Bagnan, Malda Museum, North Bengal University Museum in Siliguri and Bangiya Sahitya Parishad in Bishnupur. 																								Only two of them have had any kind of training in the work that theyre doing, said Roy, so we want them to begin at the beginning.																								Roys laurels are many. From serving as conservator at premier museums to visiting lecturer in UK colleges and also as member of advisory boards  Roy, whos in her sixties, has filled several shoes in her long career. Though shes been visiting the city on and off since 1979, this is her first formal workshop here. The participants are very interested and rather interesting by themselves as well, quipped Roy, who admitted that initially language was a bit of a barrier, particularly while explaining the terms of the trade.																								And handing out the hints hasnt been easy for other reasons too. The challenges that curators face here are very different from those in the US and the UK, Roy said. Climate, financial resource crunch and personnel problems are just some of those. But even if I dont have an immediate solution to these, I know of experts who the participants can get in touch with, she added.																								Communication, both between the small museums and experts and among themselves, is something that must be developed. The younger people coming into the profession are impressive. They are eager to learn and more often than not equipped with computer skills, she said.																								Impressive too, according to Roy  who had a session with Victoria Memorial staff last week  is the standard of the city museums. 																								The standard has certainly gone up in the past few years. One area in which Calcutta will score much more now is cleanliness. 																								But as a reality check, Roys tips to museum-keepers is to set standards that are achievable. Another area, according to her, that demands development is domestic production of archival material such as archival boxes, tissues and adhesives, which are mostly imported now.

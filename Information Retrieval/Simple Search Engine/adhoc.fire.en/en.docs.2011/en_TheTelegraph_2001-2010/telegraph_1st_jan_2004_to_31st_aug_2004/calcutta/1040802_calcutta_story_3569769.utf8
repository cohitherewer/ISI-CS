The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 02, 2004  Fashion flagship																					Arrow, a premier mens apparel brand, opened up its first flagship store in Calcutta, and its 50th nationwide. The store at City Centre, Salt Lake has been created in keeping with Arrows new format, which accords the tastes and preference of the Arrow Man top priority.															We have always had a strong presence in the city, but mainly through multi-brand outlets like Shoppers Stop and Pantaloons. We decided to open up an exclusive store here because, of late, the Calcutta male has become quite fashion conscious, explained Janak Dave, business head, Arrow, in town for the launch over the weekend.																					The city man, added Dave, is no longer content to lag behind his counterparts in Mumbai or Bangalore, and is now demanding a wider range.																					The 2,000 sq-ft store would house the latest Arrow collections by Italian designer Renato Grande under the tags Arrow Premium, Arrow Classic, Arrow Sport and others, covering all aspects of fashion, style and convenience.																					Arrow is now also veering off the ready-to-wear track. The inauguration of the store coincided with the launch of its value-added service Be-spoke. Now, it is possible to choose from a wide variety of fabrics, collars, cuffs and sleeve lengths. The rest will be taken care of by Arrows expert tailors.																					The shirt prices at the store would range from Rs 800 to Rs 2,500.																																													Friends first																					The London Pub at The Golden Park was the venue for a Friendship Day party thrown by a group called the Unique 5, formed by the students of Bhawanipur College. The motto of the party was to get all the friends under one roof and have a blast.																					The crowds started pouring in at 3 pm to shake a leg and to mingle with friends (Picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).																					No occasion is better than Friendship Day to tell your friend how much you care. The party celebrates the essence of the day, gushed Vicky Jaiswal, student and spokesperson for Unique 5.																					Controlling the console was DJ Jeetu. I started off with retro tracks to warm up, after which I will concentrate on bhangra, he explained.																					Even the Asia Cup finals could not dampen the spirit of party-hoppers. India plays so many One-Day Internationals a year, whereas Friendship Day comes only once. So cricket can wait. Wed rather party today, said Vishal Jogani, a student of Bhawanipur College.

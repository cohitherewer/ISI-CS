 A STAFF REPORTER																								Milk booths to meat and milk-product marts. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government plans to turn 10 Haringhata milk booths across Calcutta into shops selling fresh and processed meat, milk and milk products.																								Some of the Haringhata booths are open only for a short while in the morning. They can be converted into shops that stay open for longer hours, according to state animal resources development department secretary Subesh Das. The idea could serve the governments purpose of popularising some kinds of meat that have not yet caught on in Calcutta, like rabbits, ducks, turkeys and quail.																								Plans are afoot to start off by converting about 10 booths to sell the meat of rabbits, ducks, turkeys and quails, as well as sausages and salami. The outlets will also have milk and milk products, like butter and ghee. 																								The government already has some outlets, like the Surabhi stalls for selling milk and milk products and the Pranija stalls for fresh and processed meat. We intend to open some stalls where all these products could be sold together. This will also help push the sales of various types of meat, Das explained. 																								Quail meat, which is known to be cholesterol-free, is Rs 32 per pair of birds. This is not expensive and can easily be made popular. Even the meat of rabbits, priced between Rs 40 to Rs 50 a kg, is low in cholesterol and has tremendous potential, Das said.																								Production of all these forms of meat  both fresh and processed, like sausage and salami  is already underway in government farms in different parts of the state, like at Tollygunge, Haringhata and Kalyani. 																								Once the outlets become popular, we can open another 20 to 30 more. The idea is to select the best localities in the city, which will give us a good market, Das added.

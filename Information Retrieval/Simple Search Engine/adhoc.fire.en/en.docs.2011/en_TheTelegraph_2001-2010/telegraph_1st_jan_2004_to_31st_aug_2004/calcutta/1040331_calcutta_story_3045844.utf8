 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Ticket examiners at Howrah station would rather release a detained free-tripper unable to cough up the fine than produce him before a magistrate because of procedural hassles in carrying out an arrest.																								The result: the number of ticketless passengers arrested at Howrah station has plummeted by 94 per cent since last year. 																								From April to December 2002, 543 free-trippers were detained at Howrah station and produced in court for failing to pay the penalty. The corresponding period of 2003 saw 34 arrests only.																								The drop in count is inevitable because we can no longer hand them over to the railway protection force (RPF) or the government railway police (GRP) without undertaking a medical examination of their state of health, said the ticket examiners at Howrah station.																								According to them, in 2003, Eastern Railway introduced an inspection memo and a memo of arrest for ticketless travellers to be taken in custody and produced before a magistrate. In the six-point inspection memo, details have to be filled in of an injury, if any, on the body of the arrested person at the time of his being taken into custody. Besides, the police officer rounding up the suspect has to be named. 																								It was the practice among ticket examiners to hand over free-trippers to the RPF, who in turn sent them to the GRP for safe custody before production in court. Now, the checkers pointed out, the RPF and GRP personnel insist on the medical report of the person detained.																								So, for a medical report, an examiner has to take the ticketless traveller to Howrah hospital, get him checked and then return to Howrah station to hand him over to the GRP.

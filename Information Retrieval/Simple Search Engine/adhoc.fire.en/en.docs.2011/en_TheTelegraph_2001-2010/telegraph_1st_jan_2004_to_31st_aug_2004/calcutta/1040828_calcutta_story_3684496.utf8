 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Green board bans tree-axing after replant order flout
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Casuarinas kissing cedars, deodars standing tall beside gulmohurs  if roadside greenery seems a thing of the past, dont lose heart. 																								With the grand old trees gone and not many replaced, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) has slapped a ban on further felling of trees by the civic authorities. 																								Besides, the PCB has also called upon police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty to ensure that there is no more chopping of trees on the pretext of widening roads. 																								Not until the civic body has followed the rules of transplantation  six saplings for every tree axed.																								The order comes in the wake of a PCB finding that suggests the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had failed miserably in completing the transplantation programme, as per its previous agreement with the Board. 																								Earlier, the PCB had sanctioned felling of 50 trees on Rashbehari Avenue, 334 on the CIT Road-Beleghata stretch, 37 trees on Mahanirban Road, 24 trees on Darga Road and 34 on CIT Road, in Park Circus. 																								However, the approval was given on the condition that the CMC would plant a said number of trees in the corresponding areas. 																								The Board had also sought a compliance report after each transplantation programme.																								However, the Board later found that the civic body was dragging its feet on transplantation of trees. 																								The PCB has dashed off a letter to the CMC chief engineer, asking him to present a detailed report on the work done so far at a hearing.																								In a recent submission before the Board, the chief engineer had failed to divulge details of the progress of the CMCs transplantation drives. 																								The report claimed the CMC had planted 15 saplings at Vivekananda Park and 76 on Gurudas Park  way short of the PCBs directive. 																								The report submitted by the CMC clearly falls short of the directives of the Board, said a senior member of the PCB. We will carry out an on-the-spot inspection of the sites and ascertain the veracity of the claims. Till the time the CMC satisfies the demands of the Board, the order banning felling of trees stays, the Board member added.																								Board member-secretary Shyamal Kumar Sarkar shied away from making a statement, saying: I would rather reserve my comments on this issue. It was only when the civic body turned a deaf ear to the PCBs repeated warnings that the Board decided to continue with the stay on felling of trees.

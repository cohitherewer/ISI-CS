Pet PassionNelanjana BhowmickLast year, I was at a pet store in the US. The range of pet accessories baffled me. From regular suede collars to diamante and pearl ones. From jumpers to designer suits! Bones and biscuits in every possible flavour (peanut butter and carrot topping the list). I also discovered Doggles, goggles for dogs!Closer home, I have some desi suggestions for apna pets: Toilet kit: Pet toothpaste, toothbrush with soft bristles, cotton balls (to clean ears) and nail clipper (never use human clippers, they can split and injure the nails).Shampoos and aroma oils: Vets recommend herbal shampoos or baby tearless shampoos. All essential oils should be offered to an animal before any application is made. Observe how the animal responds to the treatment.Rosemary and sandalwood for shiny coat; chamomile, geranium and lavender as stress-busters; lemon grass, eucalyptus and peppermint to tackle parasites and fleasCombs/brushes: De-matting combs have long, widely-spaced teeth that can separate and untangle mats. For general use, a half-coarse-half-fine comb is best. A hound-glove brush or a rubber-curry brush is commonly used for dogs. You can use colourful hair clips for the girls; for the boys, part their hair differently for a change of look.Dress them up: I use baby-sized or tiny T-shirts for the cats and a slightly bigger size for the dog. Use a colourful, triangular piece of cloth around the neck as a bandana for Him and around the head, as a scarf, for Her.Note how your dogs popularity soars in the social register!

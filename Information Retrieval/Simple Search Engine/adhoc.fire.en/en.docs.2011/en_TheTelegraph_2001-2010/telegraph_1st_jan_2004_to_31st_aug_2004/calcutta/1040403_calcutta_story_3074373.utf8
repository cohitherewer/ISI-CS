 																											- State bus fleet major offender, exhaust analyser under upgrade SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The court may have directed the state government to clean up its act as far as monitoring polluting vehicles is concerned, but who will doctor the doctors?																								One of the main culprits, as far as polluting the city air is concerned, is the fleet of government buses that has no pollution under control (PUC) certificate, plus the huge number of private buses, minibuses and taxis that get away with fixed clean chits.																								Of 18,000 private buses and minibuses plying in the city, only 550 comply with Bharat Stage II (BS II) norms. Another 1,250 are BS I-compliant. The rest are all over 14 to 20 years old. 																								Of 1,500 state buses, only 60 are BS II-compliant, 400 are BS I-compliant, while the rest are pre-1991. 																								Of 65,000 goods vehicles, only 500 comply with BS II and 1,500 are BS I-compliant.																								The average life of any commercial vehicle, especially a bus, is eight years. A 10-year-old bus can never comply with emission norms. The pollution level of over 80 per cent of the buses and trucks is very high, said Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary, West Bengal pollution control board (PCB).																								If emission levels are properly monitored, most of these vehicles will have to go off the road. While some manage PUC certificates, many use fake ones, added Sarkar.																								Though private vehicles are compelled to produce PUC certificates to renew their permits and certificates of fitness, there is no such rule for state buses.																								The CSTC has its own system  or rather the lack of it  to test emission under the supervision of the depot managers at all 11 centres.																								When the government does not take steps to control emission in its own vehicles, how will it direct the people to do so? the court had demanded, while stressing the need for more stringent checks on auto emission.																								We have already started phasing out a number of old buses and bought new ones, CSTC deputy director P.K. Bhar claimed on Friday.																								The transport department is now working with the PCB to replace the two-gas analyser machine with multi-gas analyser machines. 																								The emission testing machine will be linked to a computer and the findings recorded in a specially-developed software.																								Public vehicles department director H. Mohan explained that there would be less possibility of manipulation under the new system.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Go for more weights, reduce the lifts
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bengal all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla tones up at Train Smart. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Bulk up fast is the concept behind a new gym that has opened in the city. With an eye on the specific needs of sportsmen, Train Smart is preaching a new fitness formula that promises rapid increases in strength in just two-and-a-half minutes a week.																								The static contraction workout regimen builds endurance and strength, according to owner, Pradip Agarwal, by working on particular groups of muscles without the repetition required in conventional methods. Most sportsmen suffer because of over-training, leading to injury, says the Hyderabad-based Agarwal, who has been working with mental training in the sports industry.																								So, instead of a number of bench-presses, static contraction requires lifting and holding of a larger weight, a method now believed in some international body-building circles to increase rapid muscle growth. High-intensity and not frequency is the key of the technique.																								The month-old gym on CIT Road does not offer much by way of frills. The two-room facility has a number of weight machines, and some warm-up equipment like treadmills. But it already has over 20 clients, including cricketer Laxmi Ratan Shukla.																								The brief, once-a-week schedule starts with a short warm-up. Trainer Debmalya Sengupta takes clients through the paces with the weights. The equipment and methods ensure that there is no risk of injury, says Sengupta. Apart from this, light cardio-vascular workouts can be added through the week, but no more weight training, stresses Agarwal.																								This method can also work for those who dont necessarily want to bulk up. If you dont increase the amount of weight from week to week, it will just give more definition, assures Sengupta.

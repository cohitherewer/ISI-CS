 Sunday, August 15, 2004 Coffee, tee and a cuddle
Nelanjana BhowmickHow about taking your pet for an adda session over steaming cups of Cappucino, or dropping him at the pet salon to be pampered, bathed, styled? And finally not feeling guilty about leaving your pet in the care of loving people when you take a holiday. An Animals-Allowed-Coffee House, A Pets Salon and A Creche, three things that top every pet-owners wish list.Noted singer Paroma squeals at the thought of taking Chhotu (her dog) along for an evening cuppa. She says: Its a swell opportunity for avid animal lovers to meet and discuss common issues pertaining to their pets. Add to that some fun and games to improve your pets socialising skills. Toffee, Coffee, Piku (Culture Poms), the prima donnas who sport beautiful bows to tiny tees. Fashion editor Jeena Mitrabanik makes sure their look goes through a monthly revamp. She says: Taking your pet to a salon is an extension of your love for them.Swati Sam, an HR professional, laments: My parents and I havent taken a holiday together because we cant leave Basant (their dog) behind. Most pet owners face the dilemma of not knowing where to leave their pets while holidaying. The need for a creche that treats pets with love and care when the owners are away.Heres hoping some of us come up with ideas or even better, places catering to the special need of our pets. To make them feel extra special. (And if you already know of some, please feel free to drop me a line at nelanjanawritesyahoo.com. Thanks!)

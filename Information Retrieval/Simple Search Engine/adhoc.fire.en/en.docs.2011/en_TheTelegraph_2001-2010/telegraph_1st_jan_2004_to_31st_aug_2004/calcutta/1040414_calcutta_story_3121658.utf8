 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Torture tale jolt for CU ragging panel
 A STAFF REPORTER																								When Niladri Das, first-year B.Tech student in the information technology department of Calcutta University (CU), stepped into his hostel room on the night of April 4, he had a dream to pursue. Today, hes struggling to come to terms with the nightmare that has unfolded at his Ballygunge Circular Road address.																								From a village in Nadia district, Niladri has fallen victim to a case of ragging so serious that it has become the first to be taken up by a special committee set up by the university three years ago.																								According to a complaint, not only was 21-year-old Niladri mentally tortured for four nights on the trot, he was even subjected to regular beatings by a group of seniors.																								The first-year student had initially taken his case to the universitys students union, said Subhas Mondal, its assistant general secretary. He later lodged a police complaint.																								Among the diktats that Niladri had to follow was to knock on the doors of each and every boarder in the varsitys technology hostel in the dead of the night and introduce himself.																								I did not want to do it, but with the seniors shouting at me, I did knock on a few doors. But they forced me to carry on. When I finally mustered up the courage to say no, they thrashed me, recounted Niladri.																								He pleaded for mercy, but in vain. They went a step further. The next night, they ordered him to strip in their presence, said Souvik Chatterjee, general secretary of the technology students union.																								Niladri burst into tears. This allegedly infuriated the seniors, who locked him in a room for the rest of the night.																								The youth fled the hostel the next morning and took refuge with a relative.																								Later, with the help of the union leaders, Niladri also lodged a complaint with Amherst Street police station, close to CUs technology college campus at Rajabazar.																								Word of the incident, however, reached the university authorities on Monday, when some classmates of Niladri lodged a complaint with the officials, demanding a probe and punishment for the culprits.																								We are worried that an incident of ragging has taken place. Such an incident has not taken place in the university for several years now, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor, CU academic affairs.																								CU was one of the first universities in the country to set up a committee to monitor ragging. The move was in response to a Supreme Court order that directed all categories of educational institutions in India to formulate rules against ragging.																								I have received a copy of the students complaint, Das said on Tuesday. We will refer the case to our ragging committee on Thursday, which will make inquiries and recommend action according to its findings.																								The signals from the Rajabazar Science College campus were mixed, with some blaming the incident on outsiders.

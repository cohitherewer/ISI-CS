 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has no records of 4,000-plus waterbodies, spread over 2,000 bighas, in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, now under its jurisdiction.																								Despite several high-level meetings between the civic authorities and the state government, the records of these waterbodies have not been transferred to the CMC from the state land and land reforms department over the past 20 years. 																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to take up the matter with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Till mid-1980, Calcutta was 104 sq km in area. In 1984, another 83 sq km of South 24-Parganas, covering Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, were added to it. The addition was made without handing over the land records. Hence, the civic body is still not in a position to verify the status of a plot of land with its own records, the mayor pointed out.																								Land is always in high demand in the city and supply is limited, mayor Mukherjee said. The resultant price spiral lures unscrupulous promoters and political musclemen towards these waterbodies for a windfall.																								A civic official said, barely 5,100 waterbodies survived the onslaught of realtors, totalling about 2,500 bighas in area.																								A rough estimate by the civic estate department suggests that at least 100 of these 5,100 waterbodies are being filled up by promoters every year.																								In the absence of a land record, it is not possible for the CMCs building department to ascertain the actual character of a plot while sanctioning a construction proposal. 																								According to the CMCs former chief valuer and surveyor Sadhan Thakurta, just 30 years ago, there were more than 2,300 ponds in the city core area. Most of them have vanished. Only 150 waterbodies have survived.																								If Cossipore (wards 1 to 6) and Tollygunge, Tiljala and Kasba (wards 91 to 100) are taken with the city core area, then only 1,100 waterbodies have survived.																								Up-to-date records of these 1,100 waterbodies are with the CMCs survey department. But the civic body is totally in the dark about the waterbodies in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, as the original survey records of those areas were prepared and preserved by the land and land reforms department.																								With a view to overcome this lacuna, former municipal commissioner Asim Barman had ordered a survey of the ponds in the added areas. A nine-month-long physical survey identified 4,000-odd ponds in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. 																								In 1998, a meeting was held at Writers Buildings by then principal secretary (land reforms) Rathin De, director of land reforms D. Sarkar and municipal commissioner Asim Barman. It was decided that henceforth, the CMC will not sanction construction plans on these 5,100 plots.																								Barman handed over the list of 4,000 ponds to De during the meeting and it was agreed that the land and land reforms department will provide the corresponding land records (name of the owner, dag number and khatian number) of those waterbodies to the CMC. 																								But no documents have been transferred to date.

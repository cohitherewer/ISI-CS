				 	 Sudipta Chatterjee																								Sometimes building castles in the air pays. At least, it did for Sudipta Chatterjee. The 44-year-old civil servant has notched up the third prize in a nationwide contest for her fictional piece, entitled Sandcastles.																								The competition, organised by oxfordbookstore.com in association with Rupa amp; Co, is the largest online talent search forum for writers hosted out of India. I had seen an advertisement inviting entries in the newspaper. An unfinished story was lying about. I brushed it up, made it into a proper chapter and sent it over, recalls Chatterjee. The prize came as a pleasant surprise. The contest website says there were as many as 2,000 participants. So it is a huge honour, she says, speaking from her Sidhu Kanhu Bhavan office.																								Chatterjee works as the assistant managing director of the West Bengal Tribal Development Co-operative Corporation. This is my 19th year of service, she smiles. I had no intention to come to this profession. I sat for the examination by chance and got through, is how she describes her joining the West Bengal Civil Service. 																								The 19 years have taken her to many places and posts but it is her first assignment as the block development officer of Khandaghosh in Burdwan that threw up the most exciting memories. The BDOs job is a mix of administration, development, law and order as well as contingency measures. So it was a huge challenge for a youngster fresh out of college. The district had also never seen a woman BDO. This evoked conflicting emotions in villagers. An old lady came forward to touch me the first day I went on an inspection. She could not believe that a woman could occupy a government post. The sabhapati of the local panchayat even protested my appointment, asking whether the importance of his block had diminished, she recalls in amusement. The fact that her successor was also a woman draws an additional chuckle.																								If Chatterjees professional plunge was a matter of chance, her passion was an abiding interest since childhood. I have been writing since the age of 10-11 years  poems, diary, stories Despite an on-the-move childhood  Jamshedpur to Bombay to Durgapur  her writings regularly made it to the school magazines. Gradually as she settled in Calcutta to join Lady Brabourne College, and later the WBCS, her stories began to be published in various newspapers. 																								But Chatterjee is not one to sit on her laurels. A deadline of May 31 spurs her on. The three of us will have to complete the stories of which we had submitted the first chapters. The judging will be done afresh. Reason enough to give it her best shot.

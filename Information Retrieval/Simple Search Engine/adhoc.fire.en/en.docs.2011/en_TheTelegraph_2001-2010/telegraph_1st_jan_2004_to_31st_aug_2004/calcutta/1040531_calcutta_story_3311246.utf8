The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Examiners are only human
Jyotirmoy Mukherjee				 	 Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary (HS) Education, met readers of The Telegraph in his office last week. Participants included Tapas Roy, Diptimoy Ghosh, Rajib Saha, Jayati Banerjee, Swarnali Nandi, Debashree Bhattacharjee, Binoy Banerjee and Chandrima Ghosh				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Chandrima Ghosh: How is it that marks for the same answer vary from teacher to teacher?																																																			The present system of marking is dependent largely on the examiner. We have conducted surveys and found that examiners, following the HS guidelines, get a fair idea of how many marks to award after examining 25 to 30 answer-scripts. On an average, we have seen that for a particular answer, the percentage varies between three and five. That is, if a teacher gives 73 to a student out of 100, other teachers will not be giving more than 78 for the same answer. Now, to minimise this human error, we are introducing the grades system. So, if a student scoring 82 is placed in A Grade, another student with 85 will also be on the same grade. Thus, this human error is minimised.																																																									

Jayati Banerjee: Are answer-scripts written in English checked by teachers of English-medium schools only, or do teachers of Bengali-medium schools assess them, too? Are they properly judged?																																																			While selecting the examiners, we keep in mind that the scripts of a school should not be checked by teachers of the same school. Accordingly, a teacher of a middle-rung Bengali-medium school can get the scripts of a better-known school. This is done assuming that all examiners are equally competent in judging the scripts. In this context, I would like to point out that once, while I was principal of a college, I knew two girls who, after passing their HS, failed to get admitted in any college under Calcutta University (CU) for shortage of marks. Later, they went to Delhi, from where they completed their graduation and post-graduation and cleared the test for the state college service commission. They were appointed teachers in the colleges under CU which they once failed to qualify for at the under-graduate level.																																																									

Tapas Roy: The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) authorities have introduced a method this year of giving examinees 10 scripts of 10 different colours for writing 10 answers. A particular examiner is given scripts of one colour only to examine. Can this system be replicated in HS? 																																																			That will be difficult. We have a larger number of candidates than JEE every year  three lakh, on an average . We do not have the infrastructure to introduce this system. 																																																									

Chandrima Ghosh: Does HS offer super speciality marks for outstanding performance? Some universities in the US award 11 out of 10 to indicate an outstanding performance.																																																			No, we dont have any such system. But we always retain a provision for the best answer while awarding marks for non objective type answers. 																																																									

Debashree Bhattacharjee: Do you have any provision for re-examination of candidates whose answer-scripts have been lost? Are the errant teachers punished?																																																			No, we do not have any provision for a re-examination in such cases. Regarding the punishment of teachers who lose answer-scripts, we take stern action. On inquiry, if we find the teacher guilty, we send a report against him to the higher education department, recommending that his increment be stopped. Recently, we recommended that eight increments of a teacher be blocked for such a misdemeanour.(Concluded)

 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Spouses in suicide bids yet to recover
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons, who attempted suicide as a fallout of their respective unhappy marriages, were still fighting for life on Monday at two city clinics. 																								Anil Mandal, who consumed poison after murdering wife Alpana on Sunday, is still unconscious and not out of danger. 																								Vaishali Chatterjee, who, with husband Kaushik, took sleeping pills to end their lives, not being able to find themselves a decent job, is reportedly recovering at another clinic.																								Anil, an employee of a private transport company, smashed Alpanas head with a pestle at their Jatin Das Road residence and then swallowed a bottle of phenyl. Their limp bodies were found by their 16-year-old daughter Banashree, in the kitchen on the ground-floor flat of the three-storey building. Banashree had been to visit a friend. She called up her fathers employer, G.K. Mohan, who informed the police of the mishap. 																								Kamal Patra, OC of Tollygunge police station, said Banashree told the police that relations between her parents had soured after her mothers extra-marital affair with a local youth came to light a couple of months ago. 																								My father loved my mother. He did all that he could to win her back. Only a fortnight ago, he had requested the mans uncle to come to our house and help him make my mother see reason, Banashree told police.																								The effort went in vain, as a couple of days ago, the man called up. Banashree took the call and handed the phone over to her mother. 																								She spoke to him for five minutes or so and then hung up. I was very upset but did not tell my father a word, the girl added.																								We are waiting for Anil to recover. Once he is in a condition to speak, we will know what occurred between the couple that fateful night, OC Patra added.																								In the other incident, Kaushik Chatterjee, an aeronautical engineer, and his post-graduate wife Vaishali, attempted suicide on March 18 by consuming sleeping pills at their Shyambazar Street residence. Kaushik died at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital the same day. 																								According to Dulal Dey, officer-in-charge (OC) of Shyampukur police station, Vaishali, who was taken by her family to Belle Vue Clinic, is responding to treatment.

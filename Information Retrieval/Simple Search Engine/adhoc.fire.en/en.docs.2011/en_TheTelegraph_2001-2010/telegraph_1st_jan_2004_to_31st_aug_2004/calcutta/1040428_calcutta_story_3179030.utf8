 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 For the love of painting
Rabinarayan Nayak paints for the love of painting. Imbuing luminosity with serenity and eloquence with sobreity, the chromatic forms laid out on the canvas are not mere embellishments. Nayaks creations on paper are personal expressions of an emotion that we are called upon to respond to. His paintings offer different symbolic forms of Lord Jagannath in a fantastic synthesis of the hand of a master, the mind of a genius and the heart of an ardent devotee. It is a marvellous manifestation of an artists perception of the mystical through symbolism. Nayak, in his paintings, has deftly followed the tradition of the art form of Orissa which finds expression in the geometric structure that runs like an undercurrent in his works. Nayaks paintings offer Calcuttans a glimpse into the world of Orissan art.																								Event: Paintings by Rabinarayan Nayak																								When: Till today; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex

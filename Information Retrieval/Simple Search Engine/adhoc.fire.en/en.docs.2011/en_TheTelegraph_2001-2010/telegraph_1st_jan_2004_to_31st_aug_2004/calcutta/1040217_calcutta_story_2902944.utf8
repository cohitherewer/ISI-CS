 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Students off food in facility cry
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Students of the Bengal Institute of Technology (BIT) at Bamunghata, in the Calcutta Leather Complex police station area, are on hunger strike demanding better facilities at the institute. 																								BIT is one of the many private engineering colleges that have come up in the state. The college was established in 2000 and there are nearly 1,200 students in five streams. 																								Trouble started after the results of B.Tech first, third and fifth semester examinations were published on February 11, in which 86 students of 530 got backlogs. Souvik Ghosh, general secretary of the BIT Students Welfare Committee, held teachers responsible for the poor results. The quality of teaching at the institute is not up to the mark. But no one dares protest, as they fear they will be victimised, Ghosh said. 																								Students complained that the college lacked a number of facilities. When the authorities ignored our demands even after we started a relay fast from February 12, a dozen of us decided to go in for a continuous fast from yesterday, in spite of a doctors warning, Ghosh added.																								Students alleged that the college was in a deplorable state. The laboratories are ill-equipped, frequent power cuts affect practical sessions at the computer and electronics laboratories and classes are carried out in shifts to accommodate students. They claimed that though the college belongs to the Techno India Group, it refuses to improve the centre. Principal B.C. Bhattacharya denied the charges.

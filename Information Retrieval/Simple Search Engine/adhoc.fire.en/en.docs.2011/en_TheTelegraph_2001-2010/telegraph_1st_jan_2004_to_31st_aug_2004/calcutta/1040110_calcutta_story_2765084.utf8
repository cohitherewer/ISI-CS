 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Beauty, history and a treasury of artistry
 SAMARPAN DUTTA 		 The ivory boat on display at the Indian  MuseumEver wondered where the statues and other valuable items go, once they are intercepted while being smuggled out of the country? More than a dozen artefacts have made their way back to the Indian Museum, Calcutta, thanks to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Government Railway Police (GRP).																								A brass statuette of Buddha  a rare piece of Nepalese art  adorns one corner of the exhibition hall. It was recovered by the GRP and handed over to us, but as soon as the word spread, Nepal asked Interpol to find out whether the Buddha was one of the pieces stolen from its museum. We have sent a photograph to the Nepal government and hope it will be easier for them to identify the statuette, said museum director Shyamal Chakraborty on Friday. 																								The Indian Museum, the ninth-oldest regular museum of the world and the oldest institution of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, is also the repository of the largest museum objects in India. Collection is the lifeline of a museum and we are dedicated to the cause. At present, we can boast of more than 10 million items, but we must add more pieces of beauty and of historic value, Chakraborty added.																								 The ongoing exhibition at the museum  after a gap of more than 15 years  has on display 78 artefacts, of the 400 acquired over a period of seven years (19972003). The museum staff chose from articles donated by renowned families and some acquired by them from across the country. A Baluchari sari, an 18th Century Chinese vase, an ivory boat all have their own tales to tell. 																								Of the items gifted by the CID, two are of extreme importance  a stone sculpture of snake goddess Manasa and one of Mahishasurmardini. The Manasa has immense historical value. Not many ancient Indian artists would engrave their names on their works. But here, Suboko of 10th Century AD, has taken care to inscribe both his name and that of the goddess, Bansreemoti, Chakraborty added.																								Apart from artefacts of historical importance, the exhibits include a gift by a Baul, his ektara, and a sarod gifted by the royal family of Natore. Theres also a display of traditional masks and jewellery from Assam, Bhutan and Nagaland.

 Sunday, July 04, 2004 Mend your monsoon ways
Pet PassionPets often suffer unnecessary hardship during monsoons. Not only are they spooked by loud thunder and flashes of lightning, some even run away from home. Add to that the high humidity levels which make our four-legged friends very uncomfortable. To make the rains less of a damper for your pet try out these devices.Pacifiers: Thunderstorms cause a great deal of stress. Never leave pets alone at home. Confine them to a safe, secure room. I usually turn the TV on loud to help drown the sound of thunder.I-D tag: Many dogs run away from home during monsoons. Some out of fear (the noise of thunder), others out of folly (its the beginning of the mating season). Make sure your pet has a collar and I-D tag, with your address.Hygiene: Pets get their paws soiled in rainwater. Make sure you dry their paws and use an anti-fungal powder to prevent any kind of infection in the digits.Grooming: Most pets start shedding during this weather to combat high humidity. Just before the rains set in, give your pet a hair cut. That way you can also spot ticks and fleas.De-worming: Its important to de-worm before the rains as dogs are prone to stomach infections.Guarding against maggot wounds: Stray dogs with maggot are a common sight now. Precautionary measures must be taken even with minor wounds.We all know how enthusiastic our pets are when it comes to their morning walk and evening stroll. The monsoons restrict their quota of socialising and most want to rush home after a walk in the rains; do make them feel at home.

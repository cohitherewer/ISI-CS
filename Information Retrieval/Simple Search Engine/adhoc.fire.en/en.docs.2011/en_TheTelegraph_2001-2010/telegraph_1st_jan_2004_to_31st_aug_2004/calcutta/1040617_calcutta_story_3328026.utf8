 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Shes got the look Biryani binge
 Models Reshmi Ghosh and (below) Sharan Mishra don the make-up of the moment (courtesy: Prabir De)																								If you want to take some load off your toiletry case this summer, get rid of the lipstick. Chances are, you are not going to need much of them this season.																								One look at the faces that stare at you from the covers of fashion magazines is enough to drive home the make-up mantra of the moment: nude lips are the hottest thing to flaunt right now.																								Minimalism, with luminous, clear skin can be the biggest style statement. The main touch of colour to this clean look has to be in the eye region.																								Clean skin, dark eyes and clear lips define the look of the season, feels make-up artiste Prabir De. Even on the ramp, cakey foundation is totally out. I am only using as much base as is necessary to conceal blemishes. A little bit of blusher and very little shimmer is all that I recommend for the face.For the eyes, the defined eyeliner look is passe and the smudged kajal effect is more in fashion, he adds. Lots of colour for the eyes is what is in now, especially shades of pinks, peaches and light orange. Kajal pencils in these shades can be used above the eyes and smudged to get the right effect. Mascara is a must as this gives density to the eyes. A little bit of shimmery eye-shadow completes the look. For the lips, very subdued or no lipstick is recommended. And even if someone is using lipstick, it has to be a creamy one, and not glossy. And the lip-liner is a total no-no, he stresses.COLOUR CODELots of colour for the eyes for a dark, smoky look. Use a kajal pencil in light shades, or get edgy with some smudged kohl on the eyelid 
	 If eye shades like peach and light orange are too way out, stick to a brick orange
	 Mascara is a must
	 Flaunt bare or light pink or peach lips
	 Lip-liner is a no-noMake-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar agrees. While women in Calcutta are conservative when it comes to accepting international make-up trends, the new global look with vibrant eyes and clear lips have trickled down even among them. He adds that the eyes are the only enhancement in the current look.																								Kohl is very in right now as the eyes can be made to look very dark using kajal pencils. Colours like peach and light orange are hot for the more adventurous kinds, but for others, brick orange is a good option. The shadow has to be in a natural tone and the lips should be kept clear. If one wants to use lipsticks, warm tones like pinks and peaches are in fashion, is what Anuruddha recommends.																								The no make-up look is what model Pinky likes to show off when she is not on the ramp. A healthy glowing skin looks best in the summer. You just have to add a bit of shimmer to it with some bronzer. Lots of kajal and some black shadow for the eyes and muted lips with only a touch of gloss will do the trick, she feels.																								Cut out the clutter is event manager and model co-ordinator Sanchita Kushary Boses advice. In this heat, the stress should be more on skin care than make-up. The skin should be kept as uncluttered as possible. So, a clean face with some kajal and mascara for the eyes should be enough, she says.																								With all eyes focussed on the eye, the smoky look continues to enjoy good times. While on the international ramps a new twist has appeared with gold or bronze shadow, here it is black and grey that still dominates.																								To achieve the smoky look, you have to put some black and grey eye-shadow on the socket above the upper lid and blend it well from dark to light. But the easy and faster way to do it is to put kohl heavily on the upper lid and smudge it into the socket, advises De.																								So, the next time you are dolling up, remember to keep an eye for the eye. And lock up those dark lipsticks till chillier times!																								lWhile its khichudi, beguni and Ilish machh from moms kitchen on a rain drenched afternoon, theres biryani and kebab flavours from Guchhi, the Indian specialty restaurant at the Hyatt Regency. The resident chefs feel monsoons are the best time to enjoy piping hot biryani accompanied with some succulent kebabs. 																								The fest features a wide range of biryanis and kebabs both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. In a bid to churn out an extensive menu the chefs have had to dish out some experimental recipes apart from age-old favourites like Hyderabadi Biryani. 																								It is difficult to go wrong with authentic recipes, but the success of their experimental fare like Vilaity Subzi Ki Biryani and Guchhi Chilman Biryani will depend on the guests adventurousness.  Items from the biryani and kebab festival at the Hyatt Regency. Picture by Rashbehari Das Thus, while the former using a variety of English vegetables like broccoli, baby corn, asparagus and coloured bell peppers may appear bland to a biryani buff, the latter may stand to win simply due to its novelty factor achieved with a flour puff covering or chilman that is uncovered right in front of the guest for them to enjoy the fresh aromas of a combination of Kashmiri morels cooked with royal cumin seeds. The chefs claim the improvisations are based on popular demand. The high patronage of Vilayati Sabzi in our regular menu, for example, prompted us to use the mix by playing around with the concept of the usual vegetable biryani, said executive chef Deepak Bhatia. 																								The kebab platter is as eclectic. Jheenga Nisha (pomegranate juice, yoghurt and spices marinated with jumbo prawns), Shikampuri Kebab (deep-fried lamb patty) and Kastoori Kebab (chicken cubes marinated with gram flour, red chillies and garam masala) are the standouts in the non-veg section, while for veggies theres Phaldari Seekh (an assortment of fruits like apple, pineapple and guavas along with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes), Subz Gulati (patty of kidney beans) and Dahi Ke Kebab (a sour tasting thick yoghurt patty) among others.

 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Receipt rights of cable tax payer
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Enjoying a satellite TV exclusive 																								Many cable television viewers around the city can spot a scroll running along the bottom of their TV screens these days. In English, Bengali or Hindi  depending on where you live  it asks viewers to pay eight per cent service tax to the cable operator. And if theres no scroll, a personal message from the local operator carries the same sermon. This has left the hapless subscriber confused yet again.																								The need, all of a sudden, to pay service tax to the operator, its effect on the monthly cable bill and what changes or improvements, if any, can be expected in cable service after the tax is paid, are some of the questions that have arisen in the subscribers mind.																								Behind the scroll display is the recent move by the excise commission, which, concerned with the loss of service tax revenues, has upped the ante in collecting the tax from operators. A large section of cable operators is neither registered under service tax, nor pays the eight per cent tax to the government. The commission is conducting a drive to bring these operators under the tax net by getting them to register first and then take the next step of collecting tax from them.																								As a part of the drive, we have written to big cable operators, sub-operators and multi system operators (MSOs) to furnish details about their service tax registration and payments, said an official of central excise. The response to the drive, according to the official, has been fairly good. Task forces are also being formed to deal with operators who are not complying.																								There are a few things to expect from the cable operator, once the subscriber starts paying the service tax, points out the official. First on the list is a proper receipt. Most operators across the CMDA area do not issue a receipt for the monthly cable fees paid. Instead they maintain a register or a card on which both parties  the operator and the subscriber  sign when money changes hands monthly.																								On paying the tax, the subscriber should now be furnished with a receipt clearly mentioning the operators service tax registration number. It should also carry the service tax amount in the bill. Installation charges and other repair charges cannot be included while calculating the service tax amount, the official added. And the tax paid should be exactly eight per cent of what the subscriber is paying now. For instance, if someone is paying Rs 200 per month, he should pay Rs 16 more now.																								Operators already doing it the right way are all for the drive. We registered in August 2003 and have been providing our customers with a proper receipt, said R.N. Chowdhury, an operator in Behala. Its essential that all operators pay the service tax, he stressed.																								Apart from earning revenue for the government, the tax drive would help address the under-declaration issue as well, hoped excise officials.																								Service tax is one of the various taxes a cable operator is supposed to pay, including entertainment tax and trade licence fees.

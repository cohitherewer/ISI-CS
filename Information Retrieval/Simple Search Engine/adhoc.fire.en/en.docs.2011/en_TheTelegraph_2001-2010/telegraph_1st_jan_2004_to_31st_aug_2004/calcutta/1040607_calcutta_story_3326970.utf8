 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Job profile circular agitates civic staff 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee is worried over the fate of the on-going capacity-building programme with British grant in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), following the recent change in the political scenario. 																								Though trimming of the CMCs pay-roll list by weeding out the redundant and idle workforce is one of the main objectives of the programme, mayor Mukherjee thinks it will be hard to realise the objective in the present political scenario.																								As advised by the British Department for International Development (DFID), the civic authorities had approved the selection of AF Ferguson and Company as consultant to examine the organisational structure and human resources development of the CMC.																								 According to Mukherjee, the consultant will undertake an employee survey through one-to-one discussions and by organising workshops, before furnishing suggestions on organisational development for building up capacity of the CMC. 																								The consultant will charge Rs 95 lakh for the service, and it will be paid by the DFID.																								Municipal secretary Sajal Bhowmik, in his circular on May 19, directed all CMC employees to cooperate with the consultant firm and answer the employee survey questionnaire prepared by it. 																								The distribution of a 75-point employee survey questionnaire prepared by the consultant firm has already created commotion among the 38,000 employees of the CMC. In the strictly confidential questionnaire, an employee has been asked to rate his job, vis-a-vis job security and condition of service. 																								The employee has been given an opportunity to disclose whether he/she faced any pressure from citizens, councillors or the senior management.																								In the human resources management column, an employee has been asked to furnish the areas in which he/she would prefer to receive training, such as technical, managerial, computers, communication or citizen handling skills.																								These three particular items in the questionnaire, in the human resources management column, is what makes the CMC trade union leaders sceptical about the actual intention of the survey.

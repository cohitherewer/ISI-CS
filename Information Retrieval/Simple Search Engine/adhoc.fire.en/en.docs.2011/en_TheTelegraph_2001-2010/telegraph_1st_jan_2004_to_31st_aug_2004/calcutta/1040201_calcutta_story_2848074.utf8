 Sunday, February 01, 2004 				 Power tariff hike scare in SEB area
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bad news in these feel-good times. Consumers in the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) area may soon face an increase in electricity tariff, as per indications received from officials in the state power sector. 																								A senior official of the state power department said on Saturday that the WBSEB had placed a proposal before the West Bengal Power Regulatory Commission that the overall average tariff per unit (including domestic, commercial and industrial consumers) for 2004-05 be raised by 35 paise. If the proposal is accepted, the overall average tariff will become Rs 3.57 per unit. However, it will be at least another three months before the Commission announces its decision on the proposal. The new tariff rate is usually implemented from April 1, though the decision is announced later in the month. 																								The proposed hike is not uniform and varies according to the nature, quantum and purpose of the consumption.

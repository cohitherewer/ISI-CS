The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 On amp; OffScreen On amp; Off

	His is one comeback that would go down as one of the more dramatic ones on the Indian screen, big and small. From a teenage heartthrob who lost his way after the mega success of Jaan Tere Naam to the biggest thing on the small screen, Ronit Bose Roy has been there, done that. And he now has almost every television award in the last two years to show for it.
	 I have certainly learnt to handle success better than I did last time around. At that point of time, I hadnt taken my career all that seriously. Those wrong moves had put me out of work but this time I am aware of what I am doing, says Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu This Mihir, with a confident smile. 
	Ronit doesnt mind admitting that his life has witnessed a complete turnaround after his exploits in Kammal, Kyunkii and Kasautii Zindagii Kay. Not only has it got better for me materialistically, the love I have received from everyone has been amazing. They hug me, kiss me, even worship me  I couldnt have dreamt of all this a couple of years ago.
	 Now the former assistant editor at Mukta Arts (he plays a brilliant cameo in Ghais Kisna) is planning to direct his own venture. It will not be something on television  it has this stagnancy factor, which has me playing three different lives at the same time. I would direct a film some day  I am still learning the craft.
	 And if ex-co star Rituparna Senguptas acknowledgement of Mr Bajaj when they shared the spotlight briefly on Thursday was anything to go by, Ronit is learning his craft really well.  Rimii Sen: Home truths
	Bhagaban korun, Bangla cinema jeno amay kokhono na kortey hoy (I pray to God that I do not have to do Bengali films ever). Staggering statement that from Bengali beauty Rimii Sen, hours before packing her bag for a days trip to Calcutta on Friday.
	 Given that she is set to soar even higher in Bollywood if her next Yashraj Films release creates a Dhoom, one can understand the priorities of the girl, just back from Romania after shooting for Boney Kapoors Dost  My Best Friend. 
	As Sweetie Chatterjee, the doctor wife of Jay Dixit (Abhishek), Mademoiselle Sen is looking sensuous in the promos. Darun sundar, bhishon gorom (Very beautiful, very hot), gushes director Sanjay Gadhvi about his leading lady in the number Shikdum shikdum where Rimii is painting her room in a shirt and a towel till Abhishek enters as a romantic distraction. She is looking so good that the song is getting a lift, feels composer Pritam, fellow Calcuttan on the Dhoom boat. Laughing at the compliments, Rimii says she is grateful to the Yashraj Films banner for giving her the best look yet. The Dhoom experience was also memorable because of the three male co-stars. John (Abraham) and Abhishek would keep making us laugh. 
	If the men got to ride the super bikes, Rimii also had a scootie. I did not know how to ride one, but since I have been riding bicycles since childhood, I could pick up in five days, she laughs.
	 Film-makers around may be getting away with Murder and more, but Rimii is not flowing with the fleshy tide. Those who accept such roles will have to wear such costumes and do love-making scenes. I am not doing any of those, she states. No shikdum (code word for love-making between the couple) on camera, please.
	 Is her presence in Buddhadeb Dasguptas Swapner Din not a contradiction to her no-Tollywood resolve? Do not count that as a Bengali film. I did that for international recognition. Smart move, considering the film has already received a call from the Toronto Film Festival.  Mitchell: Bol Radha bol
	We will rock, booms the gentle voice on telephone. Ace percussionist Sivamani will be in town next week along with colleagues Shankar Mahadevan, Louis Banks, Karl Peters and Sridhar Parthasarathy. The concert, being organised by Shoppers Stop, will be the occasion to unveil the Parikrama collection of ethnic wear. Passes are flying thick and fast with Rs 2,000-plus bills at the shopping mall.
	 The synergy with garments goes with what the quintet will play on the evening of August 29. Their signature composition, Silk, takes its name from the initial letters of the names. S is for me, Shankar and Sridhar. I stands for India, L for Louis and K for Karl Peters, Sivamani explains. The piece is very flexible. We play it in different ways and for varying durations according to the venue and the kind of concert where we are playing. 
	Sivamani is happy to get back to his favourite city. There is music in every home in Calcutta. Louis used to tell me how they shut their doors and played all night. After music, comes hilsa and all else on the Bengali platter.
	 So the date at the Royal Bengal Ballroom of City Centre Salt Lake next Sunday promises to be a real rocker. 
	Radha Rani Amber Indigo Anunda Mitchell. If that went flying over your head, Radha Mitchell might be an easier chunk to chew. Well, she is the next big thing from Down Under after Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts.
	 She must have an India connection, right? Wrong. Radha is, apparently, the daughter of a hippy Hare Krishna devotee from Melbourne. That explains the Radha Rani and possibly the Anunda (could she have been trying for Ananda?). She is also a vegetarian who practises yoga. 
	You can check out the 31-year-olds acting prowess on August 21, Star Movies at 9 pm, when she appears opposite Colin Farrell in the premiere of Phone Booth.
	 You are likely to see a lot more of her over the next year or so. Man on Fire is worth watching out for, starring Denzel Washington and child star Dakota Fanning. Radha will be spotted in Woody Allens next film, Melinda and Melinda. Finding Neverland, starring Johnny Depp, is about what triggered J.M. Barries Peter Pan. Finally, she stars in the romance Mozart and the Whale with Josh Hartnett.

 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Election panel boon for walls
 																											- Public building scope widened in crackdown on poll graffiti A STAFF REPORTER																								Leaders and political parties contesting the 2004 Lok Sabha elections will have less space to smear with graffiti.																								The Election Commission (EC), in its restriction on defacing walls, has extended the definition of public buildings to encompass all structures of central and state government undertakings, municipalities, panchayats and municipal corporations.																								Earlier, public buildings signified state and central government offices only. 																								According to Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority estimates, the new EC directive will save the walls of over 1,000 buildings and structures in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area from being defaced by poll graffiti.																								The Calcutta Metropolitan Area, measuring 778 sq km, includes three municipal corporations, 33 municipalities and 60 panchayats. 																								Candidates who have already used the walls of public buildings will clean them immediately. If they do not, the EC will take steps to clean the walls and the cost will be realised from the candidates. The amount will be included in the election expenditure of the candidate concerned, said chief electoral officer Basudev Banerjee on Monday.																								Writing of slogans and/or pasting of posters and campaign material on public and private walls shall be dealt with strictly, as per local laws, he warned.																								Despite the existence of two laws  the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Prevention of Defacement of Premises Act and the West Bengal Prevention of Defacement of Public and Private Premises Act, 1976, the EC had to issue the directives restricting graffiti on public and private premises as the Act was never taken seriously by politicians.																								During the 1996 general elections, then chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan first made some effort to enforce the laws to restrain graffiti.																								The EC issued strict guidelines to all political parties to refrain from defacing the walls of public buildings. 																								About private buildings, the EC said it would take measures if the owners lodged complaints with the state election offices.																								The state Act of 1976 banned slogans on the walls of government offices and made it punishable with imprisonment or fine, or both. However, graffiti on private walls or premises would be a punishable offence only if the slogans were written without permission of the owners.																								Meanwhile, an all-party meet at Writers Buildings has agreed to refrain from defacing public buildings. The members have promised to clean the walls within a week. However, they have not taken any initiative in this direction so far.

 Pratik ShrivastavaPratik ShrivastavaStrumming on strings...Is what Pratik is best at. The 16-year-old began playing the sarod at age six, with grandfather Pt Ravi Chakraborty giving guidance, and the sounds he makes have grown sweeter with the years of practice and performance. And he has played for international audiences to much applause and appreciation. Now, he learns from musician mama Rajeeb Chakraborty and also his mother. The boy from Ballygunge has grand plans for the future.Around the world...Is what the Class XI arts student of Patha Bhavan wants to do, playing at classical concerts and being part of a fusion group. For, while he performs Indian classical, he loves listening to rap and rock music. The Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Eminem fan is headed the right way, having progressed from the Salt Lake Music Conference in 1998 to the International Childrens Festival in Amman, Jordan, in 2000, and Ploermel, France, in 2001, with a brief stop in Germany, too.Cosmopolitan dude...He is, with the Anun Lund Rej Memorial Scholarship from Norway under his belt. A memorable moment was playing at Nazrul Manch with Bikram Ghosh. Reason  the tabla maestros encouragement calmed the jittery nerves. Meeting Ustad Ali Akbar Khan was unforgettable, too. Pratik has performed at the occasional fest as well, and won at Jaco Jagaran a couple of years ago. Although studies are a top priority, building a career in classical music means having to practicse almost every day, for about an-hour-and-a-half. But support from school, friends and family means he can miss the odd exam  or two  without much ado.Sporty Sagittarius...And a promising player to boot  on and off the field. For, soccer is his second love. He used to play it regularly, till other commitments intruded into his precious sporting time. But Pratik has played for his house before, and is now trying out for the school team.

 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Jail term threat for tormentor son 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday came to the aid of an elderly man and his wife who had allegedly been tortured regularly by their son, and warned the respondent that he would be sent to jail if he did not stop misbehaving with his parents.																								Ask your client to behave properly with his parents. If he harasses the aged couple again, I will have no option but to send him to jail. He is a government employee. Do not force me to take such a drastic step that he loses his job, Justice Pinaki Ghosh said.																								 The judge then asked the petitioners  Haridas Das, 80, and Lila Das, 71, residents of Behala  to go home and added a few reassuring words. Do not feel insecure. I am with you, he said. 																								Unable to control their emotions, the couple broke down in the packed courtroom and alleged that their second son, Pranab, and his wife, Anita, were pressuring them to transfer the ownership of the house to their names. 																								As we are not ready to do so, they are harassing us in several ways. Just a few days ago, my son even tortured us physically, said a tearful Haridas. 																								He said that he was a retired government employee and got a monthly pension of Rs 6,000. My youngest son has been suffering from serious diabetic problems and is almost on the verge of losing his vision. A lot of money has to be spent on his treatment. So, I have to incur much expenditure to maintain my family, the old man said.																								Haridas also told the court that his eldest son had purchased a flat elsewhere and lived separately. I can earn a little money by letting out a portion of the building. But my second son is not allowing me to do so, he pointed out. The situation has forced us to come to this court, the duo added.

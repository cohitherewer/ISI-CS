The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Framed, cry in eleventh hour
 AMIT UKIL IN KULUDIH (BANKURA)																								Even as the noose tightens on Dhananjoy Chatterjee, his family and neighbours in his hamlet near Chhatna, about 240 km from Calcutta, are confident that the 40-year-old former security guard will not be hanged on Saturday. 																								They even claim that he is innocent and has been framed.																								A squeamish calm greets the outsider on approaching the condemned mans place of birth. Optimism has eroded since the President refused to grant pardon last week. But hopes flicker over the filing of the appeal in the Supreme Court and its hearing scheduled for Thursday.																								Dhananjoys brother Bikash, 29, who works at a cycle shop in Chhatna, was informed of Tuesdays developments in Delhi by the lawyers in Calcutta. We are 99 per cent sure that he will not be hanged, says Bikash. When I met him on July 28, Dada told me he was innocent and that he just had not had the opportunity to tell the truth. 																								The brother believed that the Parekh family, which was rich and commanded influence, had ensnared a poor youth from the village. They pushed Dada into the situation he is in, Bikash said. There is not even a single witness who has seen him committing the crime, he added.																								Please tell our parents I am absolutely innocent, Dhananjoy had told his brother during a visit to the jail. 																								Father Banshidhar, mother Belarani and elder brother Gangadhar believe him. So do neighbours Sasadhar and Khagen Bauri, with whom Dhananjoy grew up.																								He had no history of bad behaviour through his childhood, or in his school days. Even when he worked in Bilaspur, and later in Bhowanipore, Calcutta, there was no taint on his character. If we had the money and the right connections, Dhananjoy would have been released and by my side today, said his aged father.																								Wheezing after some shots to ease his asthma, Banshidhar urged the media to help my son get justice. With folded hands, he said Dhananjoy was the victim of money power and influential people.																								Since 1990, has there been no rape and murder committed? There are so many leaders, even MPs and ministers, who are getting away with their crimes. Why is my son being hanged? Because he is the son of a poor farmer.?																								One thing that emerged from meeting Dhananjoys brothers and neighbours was the harsh attitudes they had developed and the cynicism that has enveloped them. 																								The endless stream of mediapersons and curious visitors from the neighbouring villages has hardened them. One got the feeling that their comments are well-rehearsed, in the hope that somewhere, a stroke of luck will intervene.

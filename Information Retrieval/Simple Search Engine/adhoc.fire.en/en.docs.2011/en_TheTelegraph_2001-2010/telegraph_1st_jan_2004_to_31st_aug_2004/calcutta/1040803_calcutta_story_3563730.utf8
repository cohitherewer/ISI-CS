Irfan Ahmed / MixologistCalcutta during the monsoons can be very wet and depressing. Which is why I like to brighten up my evenings with a shot of rum. A sweet, exotic spirit that insists you take it easy. It warms you from within and lets you enjoy the weather without. Rum, also referred to as pure liquid gold, developed in conjunction with the growth of sugar plantations in the West Indies. It was made from the leftovers, namely molasses. There are three main types of rum: white, golden and dark. As rum heightens fruit flavours, it is used as a base for a number of cocktails. As an ode to the monsoons, Id like to introduce two classic rum-based cocktails, the Daiquiri and the Mojito. Incidentally, these two, were the drinks of choice of famous writer Ernest Hemmingway in the bars of Havana during the 30s and 40s. The rains leave the world outside looking fresh and clean and that is exactly the effect a Daiquiri was intended to have. The Daiquiri has experienced many a deviation from the nothing-but-lime rule. It found equally compelling partners in strawberries, mangoes, kiwis and bananas. Ive heard the Mojito described as a devil disguised as a cocktail, as the mint leaves add a refreshing and light touch, tricking you to think the drink is more harmless than it is!Mango DaiquiriIngredients: 60 ml white rum, juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp castor sugar, 2 tbsp fresh mango pulp, 1 cup crushed iceMethod: Put all the ingredients together in a blender. Blend thoroughly to a smooth consistency. Pour into a sugar-frosted cocktail glass. Garnish with a slice of mango.Ginger MojitoIngredients: 60 ml white rum, 1 whole lemon cut into wedges, 1 tsp castor sugar, a handful of fresh mint leaves, 4-5 pieces of ginger, thinly stripped, 1 teacup crushed iceMethod: Put the mint leaves, lemon wedges and sugar in the bottom of a glass, crushing gently, till the lemon releases its juices and the sugar dissolves completely. Pour in the rum and mix well. Pour into an old-fashioned glass over crushed ice.

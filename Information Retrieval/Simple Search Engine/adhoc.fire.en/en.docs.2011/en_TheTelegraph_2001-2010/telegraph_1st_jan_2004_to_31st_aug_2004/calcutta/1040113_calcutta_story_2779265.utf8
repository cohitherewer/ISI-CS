		 Aniruddha MaitraAniruddha Maitra																									Are his two loves in life. While the latter might be understandable, the former, for a 22-year-old, is perhaps a little unusual. But as far as Aniruddha Maitra is concerned, acting, although a passion, is a hobby. Education is his real love in life. Case in point  92 per cent in Madhyamik was really easy, besides subject prices in school for Sanskrit and history. However, 80 per cent in HS was tougher. English or French																									Hes a master of both. Language is a life-long love, too. Having completed his diploma in French from Alliance Francaise de Calcutta, the boy from Hindustan Park is all set to go after the higher diploma. But its English, on stage and off, thats his first priority. Topping the BA Part II and III exams in the subject in JU, hes now in his first year of English masters. Next, the plan is a further degree in cultural or gender studies. Writing and talking																									Are his strong points. The winner of the UN debate in Class XI and the Bengal Education Council debate in Class XII is now busy writing. Once again, its an unusual job  for the past six months, he has been penning scripts on basic astronomy for childrens shows in planetariums, for a Japanese company. While learning the violin might have lasted only a year, this is sure to stick, since the ex-South Point student wants to be a teacher. And Aniruddha is also an amateur journalist, reporting on campus news. Leading lad																									The Scorpio usually is, when it comes to the stage. Be it the author in the Theatrician production Episode in the life of the author, or the main man in the JU department play The way of the world, hes at the forefront. His last performance was in Sakuntala, and his personal best was playing Rosencrantz, in Theatrons first English production, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Although elocution was a favourite pursuit in school, acting is centre stage in college. Be kind																									Is the Richard Dreyfuss fans motto in life, and a quality those who know him associate with Aniruddha. Thats the winning ticket.

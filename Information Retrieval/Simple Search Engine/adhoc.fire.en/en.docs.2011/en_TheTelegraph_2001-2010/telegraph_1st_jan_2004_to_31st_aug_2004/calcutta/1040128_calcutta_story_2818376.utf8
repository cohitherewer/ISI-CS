The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Hope trio: Hooghly, wetlands and trams
 JAYANTA BASU																								Calcutta may still be saved from the soot, smog and grime. That was the message Albrecht Klenk, expert in urban development and land-use planning, had for participants from across the globe in a three-week training programme on eco-cities, organised here by the department of architecture and regional planning, IIT, Kharagpur, and Stuttgart University.																								Klenk, a professor at Stuttgart University, stressed the merits of the Hooghly riverfront, the wetlands on the citys eastern fringes and the tramways. The city must protect its unique assets, like the riverfronts and the wetlands. The tramway system must also be preserved, he said.																								Planning is imperative to upgrade the eastern and western banks of the Hooghly, so it remains connected to the people, he said. Klenk advised city planners against laying roads close to the riverbanks. Roads very close to the banks spoil everything. We have learnt this the hard way in Europe and now we are actually trying to undo that, he added.																								The wetlands should be the focus, he said, and the authorities must protect them against over-exploitation.																								An overhaul of the transport system is called for, said both the German expert and his Indian counterpart, Professor Uttam Banerjee of IIT. While Calcuttas trams are struggling, all major cities in the world are reviving this transport system. This is sheer short-sightedness on the part of the policy-makers, they opined.																								Banerjee stressed the need for integrated traffic planning for the Metro and trams. Klenk felt taxis, too, posed a major problem for the city. Its like Istanbul here, where there are many taxis but most dont have the space to wait for passengers. So, many roam the roads, reducing traffic speed and pushing up the pollution level, which is already phenomenal.

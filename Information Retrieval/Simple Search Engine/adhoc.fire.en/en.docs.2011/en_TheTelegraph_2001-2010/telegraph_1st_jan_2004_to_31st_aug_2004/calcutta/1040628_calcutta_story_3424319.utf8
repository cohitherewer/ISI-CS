 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 JU boost for colleges
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After proving its excellence in the field of imparting engineering education, Jadavpur University (JU) has decided to offer help to private engineering colleges to develop their faculty.																								The university, in its executive council meeting held recently, approved a proposal to reserve seats in five of its post-graduate courses in engineering for the Future Institute of Engineering and Management (FIEM)  one such private engineering college located at Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of Calcutta.																								The conditions of the agreement, however, say the JU seats will be for graduate engineers working as teachers in FIEM. 																								Other candidates having engineering degrees, who intend to remain in teaching and research, will also be eligible. 																								The engineering and technology faculty of our university is one of the best in the country and the central government declared it a centre of excellence a few years ago. We now want students of upcoming engineering colleges, where infrastructure is being developed, to share the facilities of our institution, said Manoj Mitra, dean of engineering and technology faculty of Jadavpur University.																								The state-controlled West Bengal University of Technology, too, has requested the premier engineering institutions in the state  Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering College  to cooperate with the upcoming engineering colleges where the facilities for post-graduation education and research are yet to be developed. 																								Dean Mitra said a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with FIEM will soon be signed on the reservation of seats. The five disciplines in which the seats will be reserved for the FIEM are electronics and communication engineering, computer science and engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and electronics and instrumental engineering.																								Silajit Ghosh, FIEM director, said the tie-up with JU will help his college improve its teaching standards.

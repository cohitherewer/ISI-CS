 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Helping hands falter, aged vagrant count up
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE A 50-year-old woman, mentally unstable and almost naked, was lying under a roadside tree. She was dumped there by her family members. Her legs bore the scars of serious burns. She groaned feebly and though the people of the locality wanted to find a shelter for her, they did not know where to take her. A middle-aged man was often seen lying semi-naked on the stretch between Lake Town and Bangur, on VIP Road. He had been left behind by his impoverished family as they were unable to feed him. No family member has a stable income.																								While the number of aged vagabonds is on the rise in the city and its suburbs, non-government organisations (NGOs) and other social welfare bodies that look after them ask themselves how much longer they will be able to do so. 																								Organisations that treat these destitutes when they fall ill, too, are alarmed, as with their limited resources, they find it difficult to provide service to any more people. 																								While no official statistics are available on the number of such destitutes, according to the NGOs, about 180 people are abandoned on the streets every month. While many perish, others continue to survive precariously. 																								On an average, we receive five destitute patients each day in our hospital. They are brought by various welfare organisations, clubs or even by individuals. Many of those admitted have such serious ailments that it will be a problem for other hospitals to admit them, said Sister Angelina, in charge of one such hospital for destitutes, run by the Missionaries of Charity. . 																								But recently, their numbers are on the rise, and with each passing day, and we fear that soon we may have to deny them admission, though that will go against Mothers instruction to accept anybody who comes to the Missionaries of Charity, rued Sister Angelina.																								 It would have been a great help if the government could arrange for some bigger place for the treatment of these helpless people. she added. 																								Medical Bank, an NGO entrusted with the responsibility of collecting such homeless people, echoed Sister Angelinas fears. 																								Last winter, we collected nearly 50 such vagabonds from the streets of the city and shifted them to different charitable institutions. Most of them are over 60 years of age. Two had perished on the road even before we could arrange for any vehicle and collect them, said a spokesperson for the NGO.																								We see the number of such destitutes rising by the day and it is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with the situation, the spokesperson added.																								Most of the NGOs observe that the task of rehabilitation is gradually becoming more and more difficult owing to financial constraints and lack of any proper guidelines from the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Measure for measure, or what you drink
 															- 20 popular bars warned, fined for pouring less per peg or over-charging SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								What you are told by the barman is half-full could be more than half-empty. This is not to test your arithmetic after downing a few  its a shout from the legal metrology section of the consumer affairs department to stop you from being short-changed.																								Acting on a complaint that consumers were being poured far less than promised at some of the more popular bars around town, the state government wing has slapped caution notices on 20 of them. Officials said they were also fined Rs 1,000 each. The legal metrology section has also drawn up some dos and donts for consumers (see box).																								Some bars on and around Park Street were raided over the past month, said controller of legal metrology Ashok Bhattacharya. Officials from the department turned up as customers and did not get their moneys worth. We were surprised to see so many of the reputed bars and restaurants using peg measures that do not measure up to our standards, said Bhattacharya. Besides, many of them were charging way above the maximum retail price (MRP) for bottled mineral water and soft drinks.																								Bhattacharya said the bars were fined and slapped notices warning them to mend their ways. If any of the bars repeats the offences, it must be prepared to face strict disciplinary action, he said.																								Inspectors from the consumer affairs department came to our bars and checked the peg measures, confirmed Trincas manager J.L. Vadera. We told them that the peg measures were procured from the Hotel and Restaurant Association of India, he said, adding that they would definitely get their measures checked by the authorities.																								Kwality manager Abhijit Ghatak, however, termed the directive to charge only the MRP for bottled water and soft drinks impractical. How will we maintain the establishment then? he demanded. We, like all other bars, bill the MRP for the sealed bottles and then specify the extra amount charged as establishment charge, Ghatak explained.																								At the establishments raided by the officials, peg measures being used were often found not to have been tested by the authorities and some were found to have rough edges. Also, in the process of pouring liquor from the bottle to the peg measure to the glass, the unsuspecting consumer would lose out more than a precious drop. So, for good measure, regular checks will be carried out at bars.

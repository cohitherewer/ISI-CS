	Swimming pools at Hedua, College Square and Puddapukur were popular among swimmers in the past. Many champions started training for competitions here. But improper maintenance has taken its toll on the infrastructure and water at these pools. Will the authorities take steps to renovate them and make them fit for the novices? 
	 Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 
	A rich history is associated with Sraddhananda Park, in Sealdah. Netaji delivered his last speech in this park in 1940. Sadly, it is now bereft of any greenery. I request the CMC to revamp the park.

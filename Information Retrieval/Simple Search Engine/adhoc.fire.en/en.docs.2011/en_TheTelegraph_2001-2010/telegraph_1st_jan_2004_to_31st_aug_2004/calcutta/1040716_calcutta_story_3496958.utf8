 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Five-day package to put Puja on tourism map
 A STAFF REPORTER Durga Puja: A new perspective 																								A guided tour of the Victoria Memorial, a cruise down the river to Belur Math, a heritage tram ride through the winding lanes of Chitpur, a visit to Mother House Folk art and crafts, music and classical dance recitals, and of course, the pulsating power of the rituals and thrills of pandal-hopping																								This is when the citys little bylanes metamorphose into gateways to heaven. And this time, both the Centre and state have come together to support the piety push by a catalyst group to wrap-sell the magic of Bengals biggest festival.																								What started as a test case last year, has become a pilot project this time round. Happenings, a band of dedicated professionals, keen to re-explore and rekindle interest in Calcutta as a tourist destination, is once again stitching together Mahotsav, an initiative to package the Pujas to a national and overseas audience.																								From 62 tourists last year, including NRIs and foreigners, the NGO is ready to up the ante to about 100 individuals this Pujas, and some tour operators have been roped in too. Our dream is to put Mahotsav on the world map as the grandest socio-religious festival that transcends caste, creed, colour and embraces everyone, says Viji Iyengar of Happenings.																								However, he is quick to point out that it can happen only when the strategic partners are convinced of the pulling power of the product. Our role is basically to make people aware of the potential of the festival and drive it as a vehicle of cultural tourism. But the private sector cant be the horse to draw the chariot, adds Iyengar.																								Realisation of the Pujas potential to rival the Mardi Gras or the Rio Carnival seems to be dawning at last on the corridors of power. Instructions have gone out to Air India and Indian Airlines from the Union ministry of tourism to promote the festival, while the ministry itself is spreading the good word.																								The Union ministry of culture too has chipped in. While Rukmini Devi Arundales Kalakshetra Foundation will regale the guests with a Bharatanatyam evening, the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) has been asked to provide support.																								The state government, though not off the blocks in a flash, sees long-term potential in the product. Happenings initiative needs to be commended and we have assured them logistic support, like a launch for the immersion spectacle, coordination with the police brass, etc, says S.N. Bhattacharjee, managing director, West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation.																								The NGOs focus this year in the five-day package (at $750 on twin-sharing basis) is on art and culture stops. We want to grow the product around the axis of events, history and rituals quintessentially Calcutta and change the perception of the city, declares a member of Happenings.																								From Bikram Ghoshs Drums of the East to Mahamela, a three-day crafts fair at EZCC, a dance festival at G.D. Birla Sabhagar to a day-long outing at the back-to-nature Vedic Village  its a kaleidoscope of myriad moods and vibrant colours that awaits the visitor.

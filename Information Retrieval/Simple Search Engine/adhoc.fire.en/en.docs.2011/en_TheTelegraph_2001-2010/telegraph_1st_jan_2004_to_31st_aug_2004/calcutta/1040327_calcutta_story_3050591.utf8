 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 A serving of laughter
																								In celebration of World Theatre Day, Trincas presents its second Luncheon Theatre performance, The Marriage Proposal, a short comedy by the famed Russian writer, Anton Chekov. A Theatrecian production, the play is about a hypochondriac who pays a visit to his neighbours house to propose to his daughter. Predictably, what happens next is extremely hilarious. Directed by Dhruv Mookerji, the play, in the genre of the laugh-a-minute comedy, is full of innocent fun and banter. However, it does not stop short of taking gentle digs at societys fallacies either. With its cast including Roshni Bose and Deborshi Barat, besides Mookerji himself, this comedy promises to amuse, entertain and invigorate the senses.																								Event: A play in English, The Marriage Proposal, by Theatrecian																								When: Today at 12.45 pm																								Where: Trincas, 17B Park Street

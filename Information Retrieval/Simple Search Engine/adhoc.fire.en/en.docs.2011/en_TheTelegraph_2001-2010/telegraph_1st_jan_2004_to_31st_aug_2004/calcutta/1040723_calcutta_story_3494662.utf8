 															- New-flavour sandesh becomes Indias brand ambassador to Iraq and Italy A STAFF REPORTERTASTE CASE  Mukti: Made of kulekhara, boosts haemoglobin level 
Spandan: A liberal dose of arjun powder takes care of the heart Pran: Carrot sandesh, increases intake of vitamin A and replenishes anti-oxidant demand 
Soundsleep: Sushni sandesh guarantees deep rest 
Tulsi Doi: After mango and pineapple flavours, its curd with a dash of tulsi extract Smriti for memory, Spandan for the heart and Pran for vitamin A. Translations? Take a break. Think sandesh. 																								Never since the ubiquitous sandesh stepped out of its mould to don new flavours has herbal sandesh reached such a high. Born in the bylanes of Jadavpur, Smriti, Spandan, Pran and their likes are now on route to war-ravaged Iraq.																								Rabindra Pal of Hindusthan Sweets says negotiations have been finalised with the Federation of Iraqi Chambers of Commerce for the first-ever export of techno-powered herbal sandesh from Calcutta. Techno-powered, because the sweets from Pals stable have found the stamp of the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Jadavpur.																								During our last meeting with the Iraqi Chambers of Commerce, its members had expressed their satisfaction over our nolen gurer rosogollas, Pal recalled. And after they tasted the herbal sandesh, they were very keen to introduce the products back home. The decks had been cleared, but then war broke out. It would be difficult to send the nolen gurer rosogolla, but we can surely export some of our herbal sweets.																								For the time being, though, Pal  and Bengals sweet trade  is poised to chart the waters of Italy. The India Trade Promotion Organisation, the central wing of the Union government seeking to promote industry abroad  has picked on the herbal sandesh as one of Indias odd new brands for the Italian market. A delegation is scheduled to hit Rome later this month to showcase some of Indias best offerings.																								The choice of Bengals sandesh as a brand ambassador comes at a time when the industry is poised for a giant leap towards modernisation. With around 500,000 employees directly engaged and an annual turnover of Rs 14,000 crore, the industry is now looking for benchmarks in packaging and production to give its products a new look. 																								The link with the IICB is a step towards this. We realised the need for a revamp while using carrots as an ingredient in a variety of sandesh, said Samir Bhattacharjee, IICB director. Its difficult to sustain the colour and flavour unless the sweet is prepared the right way. So, we took some of the ingredients, homogenised them and then froze them dry, before turning them into a fine powder scientifically in our lab, he added.																								The results are showing. Pran, made of carrots, is flying off the shelves and connoisseurs extol its anti-oxidant values. Then, theres Mukti, a sandesh made of kulekhara ( an anti-diabetes herb) that, Pal boasts, pumps up the haemoglobin count if taken over a period of time. And to top it all, theres tulsi doi.

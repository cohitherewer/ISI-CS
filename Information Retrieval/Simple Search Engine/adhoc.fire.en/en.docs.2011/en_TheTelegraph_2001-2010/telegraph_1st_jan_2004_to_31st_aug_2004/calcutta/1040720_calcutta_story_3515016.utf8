																								In a world full of dishonesty, greed and corruption, it is the rule more than the exception that the good are made to suffer grievous injustices, while the evil go unpunished. Such is the fate of Manikchand, the tragic protagonist of Ekti Dals Narak Gulzar. In the play, the devils disciples, in the guise of landowners, moneylenders, religious leaders and law-keepers, exploit people like the poor, illiterate farmer Manikchand, who is cheated out of his own land and forced to eke out a living in the city. Circumstances drive him to take his own life and his wife too is killed soon afterwards. The play reaches its climax when the two meet halfway between heaven and hell. Exasperated by Lord Brahmas inability to dispense justice, Narada takes matters in his own hands to initiate a turn of events that is entirely unexpected. Written by Manoj Mitra and directed by Chinmoy Chattopadhyay, this absurd play brilliantly uses laughter as a device to make some very important social statements.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Narak Gulzar, produced by Ekti Dal																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

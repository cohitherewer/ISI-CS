The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Last-minute flurry at the gallows
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT The countdown to Dhananjoy Chatterjees hanging began in right earnest minutes after his brothers petition was rejected by the Supreme Court special bench. The news reached inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty at Writers Buildings around 12.30 pm on Thursday.																								Though the hanging has been fixed for early Saturday, we were in two minds, as a petition was moved in the apex court by his brother. However, preparations are now in full swing, said deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya.																								He held a high-level meeting with senior officials at Alipore Central jail, where Dhananjoy has been lodged in cell no. 3. A message was sent to hangman Nata Mullick, who, along with his son Mahadeb, came to inspect the gallows for over an hour. 																								Minutes after Mullick returned to his Tollygunge residence, he was called back on Thursday night and asked to stay in the jail. 																								Mullick will stay on with one of his assistants from Thursday night. We wont take a risk. A mock-hanging will be conducted on Friday morning, ahead of the final hanging, said a senior jail officer.																								Manila rope, a special variety, will be used for the noose, which is being lubricated with butter and mashed banana. 																								The noose has to be slippery to ensure a quick death, the official added. 																								Friday onwards, Calcutta Police will take over the security of the jail. Deputy commissioner (south) Anuj Sharma will visit the jail on Friday to discuss arrangements.																								Security has been beefed up in and around the jail to prevent entry of outsiders. 																								The number of warders guarding Dhananjoys cell was doubled. Two female warders are also on standby in the jail round-the-clock. 																								Moreover, those who have been guarding the cell for the past three days have been replaced by a fresh set of warders. 																								We are not allowing any warder near Dhananjoys cell, except those on duty. Besides, other inmates keen to talk to him are being sent away, said a warder.																								Dhananjoy is being served a special diet and his health is being checked thrice a day.

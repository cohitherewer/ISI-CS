 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Kashinama
 Set in the backdrop of Varanasi, cradled in the bosom of the Ganges, Kashinama is a poignant tale of the battle for survival between savage fanaticism and culture. The protagonist is Varanasi; Varanasi personified subtly to accommodate the various ravages this religious town has suffered over the last decade in the name of religion and socio-economic changes directed at providing a boost to the milieu. It is a story about the ruthlessness of globalisation, an evil that has crept into the essentially simplistic lives of people living in a small town cocooned from the world at large, and a gradual erosion of its innocence. The play addresses such compelling questions as the apparent dissimilarities between globalisation and its propagation by self-professed cultural pundits, as opposed to the uncanny resemblance between the two. Kashinama also makes an attempt to unveil the inherent hypocrisy and unabashed perversity that has come to be unanimously associated with todays milieu. With eminent theatre personality Usha Ganguli at the helm of this production, Kashinama promises to awaken its thinking audience from its self-inflicted somnabulance with pertinent existential questions.

Pictures by Ashok Majumder 																								They could look classical, pristine, sensuous or simply sweet. Or whatever Aveek Mukherjees camera wants them to be. At age 38, the cinematographer based in Golf Green has made a habit of mesmerising cine-goers with stunning women blazing a trail on the big screen. 																								Heres some of the best and the most beautiful, through Aveeks looking glass.																								The Ash effect																								December 2002. The challenge of a lifetime  morphing the dolled-up Aishwarya Rai to a demure, deprived widow fit for an adaptation of a Tagore novel. Among all the women stars he has worked with, capturing the Bollywood beauty on celluloid has been the most challenging, confesses Aveek who has worked with Ash in Rituparno Ghoshs Chokher Bali and Raincoat.																								It was not essential to make her look beautiful. I had to mould her according to the demands of the two films, the relationship she had with the other characters. That was difficult as she tends to remain Aishwarya Rai with the kind of exposure she has got, he explains. 																								In Chokher Bali, Aishwarya was projected as slightly larger than real life. In Raincoat, she is a girl next door. Her expressions were poles apart in the two films and the use of light was vital to the two interpretations, he adds. If the absence and presence of red  offset by Ashs pristine white  set the tone in the Passion Play, the colour green reflects the mood in Ghoshs forthcoming drawing room drama. The story of a past relationship between Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya unfolding one rainy afternoon has a sombre note, if the leading ladys ruffled look in the stills is anything to go by. Aveek clarifies matters: Gloom is an inseparable part of Raincoat as the relationship is affected by a set of truths and lies, and I have used green to enhance this aspect.PEEK PEAKAveek Mukherjee, from Durgapur, studied chemistry in CU before graduating in cinematography from FTII, Pune.
 He has shot Aparna Sens Paromitar Ek Din, Mrinal Sens Amar Bhuvan, Rituparno Ghoshs Ashukh, Titli, Utsab, Shubho Mahurat, Chokher Bali and Raincoat.
 Avijit Chowdhurys Patalghar fetched him his first National Award. Gautam Halders Bhalo Theko (right) got him his second recently. 
 Aveek also finds himself busy with commercials. His best includes the Airtel ad with Sachin Tendulkar and the Samsung stint with the Indian cricket team.But the FTII-trained cinematographer sure knows how to weave a celluloid spell on the screen goddesses. Well before Chokher Bali was canned, he had sent Binodini cooing: Aveek is sooooo good; I dont think Ive ever looked prettier. Hes one person I would recommend to anyone in Mumbai. He is up there with the best.																								Search for Suchitra																								Ash apart, Aparna Sen, Sharmila Tagore, Raakhee, Nandita Das, Raima Sen, Konkona Sen Sharma, Vidya Balan Aveeks list of prized faces is perhaps a wish list for many. 																								If Chokher Bali was challenging, tackling three actresses in Shubho Mahurat was no less daunting. Here, the problem was of a slightly different nature. You know what its like when you have to work with someone you have grown up admiring, laughs Aveek, hinting at Sharmila and Raakhee.																								The play of light and shadow on Sharmilas face was vital to impart that grey shade to her character. With Raakhee, I tried to bring her close to the audience and make her look very sweet, says Aveek. Shubho Mahurat had Nandita in a different role of a contemporary woman (as opposed to the rustic role in Mrinal Sens Amar Bhuvan). And she is one actress who looks completely different in photos. 																								But Aveeks favourite face is the one that reminds him of Suchitra Sen. Raima (Ashalata in Chokher Bali) has an unusual face. Its almost classical with that resemblance to Suchitra Sen.																								Binodini to Babli																								Watch out for August 23, when Aveek gets behind the camera for Shaad Alis Bunty Aur Babli, starring Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee and produced by Aditya Chopra. 																								Bunty Aur Babli targets a different audience. But I dont think crossing over to the mainstream genre will be difficult as I am used to this kind of sensibility having done a number of commercials. I had a photo session with Rani and it turned out quite well, says Aveek. 																								Come September, Rituparno Ghoshs Antarmahal will have the citys ace cinematographer back home to capture Abhishek Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, Soha Ali Khan and Rupa Ganguly on his camera.

Religious intolerance to social divide. A new initiative in higher education promises to take care of many a crisis troubling the world, at global and local levels. 																								Service-learning proposes to teach not just in the classroom but through community projects. The universities can no longer stay cooped up in their ivory towers and ignore the problems around them, explains Linda A. Chisholm, president of The International Partnership for Service-learning and Leadership (IPSL), the world body coordinating activities in the field. 																								Chisholm, along with colleagues Humphrey Tonkin and Nevin Brown, is in town to attend a conference hosted by Tagore Gandhi Institute for Culture Studies and Service-Learning, that took stock of the work being done here. 																								One of the many uses to which service-learning can be put is production of leaders and public servants from the community. There is despondency in the US over the militaristic direction the political leadership is taking, points out Kalyan Ray, IPSL India director and faculty member of Morris College, New Jersey. Fear is being used as a political device to extract conformity, agrees Tonkin, IPSL vice-president for programme evaluation. People-to-people interaction beyond borders allows this fear to recede. Moreover, these youths, when they grow up to be leaders of society, would be loathe to pull the trigger on or bomb a population they have seen from close, adds Amitava Ray, IPSL India coordinator.																								Another exercise that has become extremely relevant in the present context of religious divisiveness is a theology workshop. Funded by the Luce Foundation, of Time and Life magazines owner Henry Luce, the programme has student participants from eight countries reading original texts to rediscover the commonality of religion, Nevin Brown, dean of academic programs, says.																								If such are the benefits of interaction beyond borders, there is much to be gained locally. Community service brings into partnership education and the social service sectors. Farmers in Thailand had failed to use a government grant as they did not know what to do with the money. So a team was sent from the business department of a university. The students suggested that a pond could be turned into a fish hatchery. Such interactions foster ones commitment to ones roots, says Chisholm.																								IPSL has spread to 26 countries. It offers an MA programme in service-learning, spread across two countries.																								Students from the US have been visiting Calcutta annually for the past 14 years. Such visits, during which they work with NGOs and stay with local families, increase their engagement with the host community, points out Kalyan Ray. One of these students followed the trail of garbage in Calcutta and produced a fantastic paper on recycling.																								We have met teachers and students here with amazing social commitment, they said, adding that the acceptance of service-learning would depend on the flexibility of the local higher education system, before taking the night train to Purulia to meet student- leaders there.

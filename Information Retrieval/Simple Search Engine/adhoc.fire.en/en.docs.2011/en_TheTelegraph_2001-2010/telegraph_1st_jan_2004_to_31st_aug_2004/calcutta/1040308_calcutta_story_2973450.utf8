 Monday, March 08, 2004  Guide to City Living MRS SEN OFFERS SOLUTIONS TO YOUR DAY-TO-DAY PROBLEMS				 																																												Q: I am a 64-year-old retired man living alone in an apartment building. My immediate neighbour is a young man who is working and studying part-time in a management school. Now, every morning, the newspaper boy sticks the days paper in my grill-gate but before I can take a look at it, my neighbour manages to glance through it. I know he doesnt get any newspaper, but this kind of behaviour is quite aggravating. On the few occasions that I have found him glancing through my paper, he offered some apologetic excuse. How do I stop him from reading my paper and let him know that its high time he bought his own? O.G, Lenin Sarani				 																																												A: If you care so much, just tell him that you dont like somebody else going through your paper before you have read it. If he really wants to have a look at the days headlines and cant afford his own copy, he can have yours in the evening when you are done with it.

 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 O-rail signals Saturday run 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than 30,000 commuters had to suffer on Friday as Circular Railway services remained inoperative for the third day, with the tracks near Ultadanga Road station submerged. 																								After Wednesday mornings Norwester, water could not be drained out from the tracks because of an embankment built on New Cut Canal by the irrigation department, which is dredging it.																								Suburban commuters who avail of the Circular Railway services to the city heart had to take diverted routes to office and return via Sealdah station. 																								Officials of Eastern Railway and the irrigation department conducted a joint operation on Friday morning to assess the situation. Later, irrigation officials said they made an outlet in the embankment to allow the accumulated water to flow out. 																								The water level in the canal will subside by Friday night. We have asked the railway authorities to pump out the accumulated water on the tracks, said Goutam Chatterjee, executive engineer, irrigation department. 																								The outlet was dug in the morning.However, we thought it was inadequate and so, it was widened in the afternoon, Chatterjee said. 																								We expect to resume Circular Rail services from Saturday, said Radheshyam, divisional railway manager, Sealdah. Till Friday morning, the tracks were under two feet of water. 																								The dredging of the New Cut Canal, part of a comprehensive drainage scheme, has been undertaken by the irrigation department from Gajnabi Bridge, near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, to Ultadanga. 																								After Wednesday mornings shower, water accumulated on the Circular Railway tracks. Because of the embankment, the water in the canal stood at a level higher than that of the ground at Chitpur yard. As a result, the water, which should have passed into the canal through the yards drainage system, started flowing back, a railway official said.																								Irrigation officials said the low level of the track aggravated the problem. But sources said it was an extreme case. 																								Although we deploy pumps to clear the tracks of waterlogging after heavy showers, it does not affect train services for more than a couple of hours. This time, it was for three days, a railway official maintained.

 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Orlando Bloom, actor.  You relate easily to people, but need to be more diplomatic.  Work done last year will reap rewards. You have a healthy  respect for the power of money. You always honour your elders,  and stay in constant touch with your nearest and dearest.   Kusum Bhandari

 																											- Textile sector showcase at Howrah with eye on export avenues A STAFF REPORTER																								After IT park and toy park, its time to unveil an apparel park.																								With a view to upgrade the states textile sector, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is developing an integrated park in Howrahs Uluberia.																								All this, with an eye on January 1, 2005, from when textile and clothing will come under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework and restrictions will be lifted on imports to the country.																								There will be possibilities for large-scale export to other countries, and so we want to set up an integrated apparel park in the state, said Gopal Krishna, managing director, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).																								Moves to acquire a large plot in Uluberia are underway. The WBIDC has asked West Bengal Consultancy Organisation Limited (Webcon) to work out a feasibility study and a detailed project report for the park.																								The report compilation has just started and will be completed in 12 weeks, said Gopal Krishna. At least 150 of the 210-acre plot in Uluberia will be used as an apparel park; the rest could be used to develop other industries, he added.																								The idea is to set up a one-stop address for all kinds of units related to the textile sector  dyeing, bleaching, manufacture of clothes, processing of cloths and fibre manufacturing.																								Though the country does well in the textile sector as far as exports go, Bengal lags far behind.																								Companies targeting textile exports will be encouraged to set up units in the park, said Gopal Krishna. The purpose behind the park is for Bengal to do well in exports.																								The WBIDC wants to tie up with the West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBIIDC) to develop the integrated park. 																								Uluberia has an inbuilt plus point  a large, skilled labour force working for the textile sector in and around the place. This is one of the biggest advantages of the location, added Gopal Krishna.																								Webcon, in an earlier report, had suggested that the government upgrade and modernise its textile sector on a priority basis. The report had also suggested that the government develop an international apparel mart (on the lines of the one at Gurgaon), a hi-tech weaving powerloom park, an export-oriented handloom park and a hosiery park.																								We are going ahead with an apparel park; once the feasibility study and detailed project report are completed, the mega project could be put into place, said the WBIDC managing director.

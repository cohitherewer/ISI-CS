 							 - 12 years on, apathy dogs Memorial upkeep JAYANTA BASU																								What ails Victoria Memorial Hall? When one takes a green look at the white monument, apathy tops the list, alongside a host of environmental odds. Twelve years have passed since a leading environmental institution conducted a study sponsored by the Memorial authorities and pencilled a clutch of concrete suggestions. Little has changed since.																								In the early 1990s, the Calcutta zonal centre of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) was picked by the monuments trustee board to prepare a report regarding the preservation of Victoria Memorial Hall from the polluted air environment.																								The monument protection plan, submitted by NEERI in 1992, spelt out short-term measures, like periodic washing of the monument with a water jet or sprayer, protective coatings on exposed metallic rods and building material and creating a green belt around the monument.																								But as petitioner Subhash Dutta has pointed out: The Memorial authorities have done nothing in 12 years, except shift the toilet down from the rooftop. The Memorial authorities refused comment.																								The NEERI report had warned then that if the localised spots on the monument are not checked at this stage, the continued deterioration process can lead to significant irreparable damage. The present findings of experts are consistent with the NEERI finding and foreboding.																								The cause of the patches on the once-milk-white marble is essentially automobile pollution. Sulphation can be a major problem, leading to so-called stone cancer, that has also been found to plague the Taj Mahal, points out professor Sudip Banerjee of the environmental science department of Calcutta University.																								According to Dutta: The dumping of a huge amount of loose soil, as well as regular parking of nearly 100 chartered buses on the south-west side, are proving great environmental hazards for the monument. All these are likely to find grave mention in the report being readied by the high court-appointed expert committee to help safeguard the monument.

 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 City link for district hospitals
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government on Saturday urged all district chief medical officers to ensure that their hospitals are properly linked with the medical control room at Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital.																								The instruction was passed on at a meeting held with health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. The control room needs to be updated about the latest in the district hospitals, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee.																								On dialling the NRS medical control room at 1600335533, one can get information on the availability of beds in the state-run hospitals as well as the facilities offered. State health department officials co-ordinate with hospital superintendents to admit patients, especially in case of accidents.																								This apart, health department officials reviewed the progress of leprosy and tuberculosis eradication programmes at Saturdays meet.  Traffic crippled																								Traffic came to a standstill on Strand Road between 10.50 am and 11.25 am on Saturday after a group of porters, cycle-van and rickshaw pullers put up roadblocks to protest the restrictions on their movement. The two blockades on Strand Road  one near Mayo Hospital and the other at the K.K. Dagar Street crossing  crippled vehicular movement along the entire stretch and caused massive snarls between Howrah Bridge and Dalhousie Square, said traffic police.

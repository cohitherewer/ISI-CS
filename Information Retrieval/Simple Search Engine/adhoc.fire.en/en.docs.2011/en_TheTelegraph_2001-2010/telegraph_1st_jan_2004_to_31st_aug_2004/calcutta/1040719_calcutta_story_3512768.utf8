 A STAFF REPORTER UNBELIEVABLE: Soma Das, the Sahas domestic help. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								Everyone seemed so happy on Saturday, whispered Soma Das, head bowed and eyes moist, as everyone was being carried out  lifeless  on Sunday afternoon.																								The normal household on Saturday had turned into a morgue on Sunday. And Soma, the teenaged domestic help working in the Saha household for the past year and a half, woke up to a tragedy beyond comprehension  she was the only living member left on the second floor of 91/3C, Tollygunge Road, on Sunday morning.																								Dada (Shibendu) was not the kind of person who would kill an entire family, said Soma. It is quite unbelievable. From what I have observed in the time that I have spent in this household, he never appeared to be the kind of person who could do this																								The maid seemed most bewildered by the fact that nothing throughout Saturday had suggested what lay in store at night.																								Everyone seemed so happy during the day, recounted Soma. Saturday was always a special day, since most family members had a holiday There was nothing that seemed out of place. Dada (Shibendu) also seemed to be his normal self. In the afternoon, he went out and bought this big bottle of soft drink.																								Soma said that a special dinner had been planned for Saturday night, since Jayashreedi (Shibendus sister) had been staying at the Tollygunge home and her husband was coming to take her back to Beleghata. 																								In fact, Biswanathda (Jayashrees husband) also joined the family for dinner  of chicken with naan  and left with Jayashreedi. Could they have ever imagined what was to happen in the next few hours?																								Shibendu, recounted Soma, was the only family member not to have had dinner on Saturday night. I repeatedly asked dada to eat with the rest of the family, but he refused, she said. That was the only thing I found to be a bit strange. Otherwise, everything else was absolutely normal.																								Was Shibendu a volatile person, given to moments of rage? On several occasions, I had seen dada lose his temper, but he would cool down as quickly as he would flare up, Soma said.																								But he displayed no trace of a temper on Saturday, when he stepped out to buy the soft drink or even when he refused his dinner, she added.																								So, to wake up on Sunday to find dada hanging from the ceiling, and then to be later told that he had killed six members of the family before taking his own life, has left the teenager traumatised.

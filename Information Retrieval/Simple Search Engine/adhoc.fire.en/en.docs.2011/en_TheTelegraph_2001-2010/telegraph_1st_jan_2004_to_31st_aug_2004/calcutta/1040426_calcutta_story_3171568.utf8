 Perizaad Zorabian on the dance floor of London Pub on Sunday. Picture by Aranya Sen 																								You would never guess that Perizaad Zorabian has just come back from a gruelling schedule in the middle of nowhere. She is cheery enough to talk any chatterbox into stunned silence, and looks as adorable as ever, even with a head full of bright blue curlers holding her brown hair in place.																								But her chatter has a purpose, as do the curlers. She clearly feels passionately about her character Nandini in Devaki, and has pledged full support to the shoot, as well as post-shoot marketing. And the rollers are a part of the pre-shoot beauty regimen, in preparation for a long day in front of the camera at London Pub.																								After shooting in the stunning, but very hard locale on the Bengal-Jharkhand border, Perizaad and the rest of the crew for the English-Hindi project, being directed by Bappaditya Bandopadhyay, have a fairly cushy day at the Golden Park nightclub.																								We were shooting in the heat, with just a chair under an umbrella, she explains before hitting the floor on Sunday afternoon. But it was worth it. Every frame looks likes a picture postcard, she gushes.																								While the whole experience was great fun, she has one major peeve. They dont believe in sleep! she complains. I am okay with waking up in the morning, but at 3.30 am?																								It was, however, all for a role that Perizaad compares to a gosht biryani for sheer meatiness. All fights she had with her director could have been due to a difference in vision, but were also the result of a shared passion for the tale.																								My world is pretty and sweet, and to some extent, about love. Bappas reality is dark, says the girl who made a splash with Joggers Park. She would defend the very real and disturbed Nandini, fighting for some hope and happiness in the protagonists role. 																								But the plot sees Nandini descend into despair, first in a village, where she discovers Devaki (being played by Suman Ranganathan) is being married off to an old man. Perizaads character works in an NGO, but is powerless to stop it. Then, she finds her own life thrown into turmoil.																								She does break a little I wanted her to have more hope, smiles the petite Parsi, who finally accepted the directors verdict. Not too unwillingly, we might add. While Perizaad feels the whole crew was great fun to work with, there are two people she wants to smuggle back to Mumbai  Bappaditya and cinematographer Rana Dasgupta.																								With shooting scheduled to be wrapped up by month-end, Perizaad is deliberating on taking up two assignments that she has been offered. I dont want to sign 10 films and then disappear. I want to act till I am, like, 80, she stresses. She is, therefore, picking only roles that interest her. Some Bollywood films I have been offered have been B-grade ones, she confesses. 																								But she would rather do those than pretentious independent films. Not wanting to wear a bikini caused one director to accuse her of not wanting a Bollywood break bad enough, but that is a label she is willing to live with. I am not a star kid, I will not sleep around and I will not take off my clothes. So my chances of success are actually very slim, she jokes.																								While a mainstream break is yet to come, Perizaad has become the rock star of independent films. With her transition from theatre to modelling to television to films, audiences have come to expect at least a sensible role from me, believes the Asmi girl.																								And that is one hope Perizaad is most eager to keep afloat.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

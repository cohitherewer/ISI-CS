 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Nights wait nets criminal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A night-long wait netted 35-year-old criminal Sagar Gayen from Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city, early on Friday. 																								Gayen was wanted in connection with at least 24 cases, including a dozen murders. The police seized some arms from him. Gayen was also an active Trinamul Congress worker but the local Trinamul MLA denied the links.																								Officer-in-charge (OC) of Bishnupur police station Pratik Datta said there had been a long hunt for Gayen, because of his role in cases of murder, dacoity, snatching, rioting and arson. But he enjoyed the patronage of an influential local Trinamul leader, which helped him evade arrest, Datta added.																								On Thursday night, the police were told about a midnight visit by Gayen to his house at Talpukur. He would leave before dawn, the informant said. Accordingly, a 10-member team, led by OC Datta, laid a trap close to the house. We let him enter the house undisturbed. But around 4 am, when he was leaving, we surrounded and overpowered him. Two pistols and a bagful of bombs and live cartridges were recovered, Datta said.																								Gayen was once the leader of a 40-member gang of criminals. In the last panchayat elections, he and his men damaged a number of houses and set fire to some of them. 																								Gayens reign of terror extended from Bishnupur to adjacent areas like Thakurpukur, Behala and Sonarpur. The police claimed that his gang members would openly tease local women even during the day and often snatch whatever ornaments they were wearing. 																								After Gayens arrest, local Trinamul legislator Dilip Mondal said the party had snapped all links with the criminal. At one time, he had been an active worker of our party but presently, the party maintains no connection with him, Mondal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Held goon levels link gun at IPS officer
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND BHAJAN GANGULY																								In a shocking exposure of underworld-police nexus, two criminals caught by the Howrah cops in the past 48 hours have confessed to working for a gangster. This criminal has, time and again, received ammunition from a senior police officer of Howrah, of the rank of additional superintendent of police (ASP).																								The police went into a tizzy after Ashok Shaw made the startling revelation during interrogation in Golabari thana lock-up on Monday night, and later in a packed Howrah courtroom on Tuesday. He claimed the IPS officer had supplied ammunition and even extended patronage to a gangster, who gave protection to local criminals.																								This don had hit the headlines in 1998 for his role in instigating gangwar at Tikiapara. Despite numerous complaints, he has never been arrested since 1998, when he was picked up for running a motorcycle-smuggling racket. He has eluded arrest mainly because he enjoys political and police patronage. 																								But with the recent revelations, the chances of his arrest have brightened, say senior officers connected with the case.																								On Monday, the police finally caught up with Ashok Shaw, in the Golabari police station area, and arrested him on various charges. Shaw confessed that he, along with another criminal, Ashok Mahato, used to work for the don, who was a motorcycle-lifter and an arms supplier in Howrah.																								Both Shaw and Mahato have several cases of murder, extortion and drugs-smuggling pending against them. On Tuesday, Mahato was arrested by the Bantra police and a gun, along with bullets and a chopper, were found on him.																								During interrogation at Golabari, Shaw, who was caught with a loaded pipegun, confessed to participating in the Tikiapara gangwar in 1998, at the behest of the don, who had supplied them with ammunition. 																								We were stunned when Shaw said the don had received ammunition from the ASP. He said the officer supplied the don with four revolver bullets (dana), said an officer who grilled him in the lock-up.																								While the home (police) department has ordered a secret probe into the allegation, Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police (Howrah), refused to lend credence to the charges. Criminals can say anything about anybody. I dont think these allegations are true. I refuse to believe them at all. It could be a conspiracy, Bhattacharya added.																								At Golabari, when the police officers asked him if he had the guts to stick to his story in court, Shaw reportedly said that he would. 																								True to his words, Shaw repeated his allegations against the senior police officer in an additional and district judges court in Howrah on Tuesday. 																								Investigations revealed that the duo used to work for political parties during elections and this year, too, would have been a profitable year if it hadnt been for the police. 																								Both criminals have been remanded in police custody.

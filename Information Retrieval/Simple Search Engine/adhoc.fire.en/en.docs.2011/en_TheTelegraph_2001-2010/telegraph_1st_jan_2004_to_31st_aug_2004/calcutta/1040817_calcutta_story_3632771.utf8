 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Building protest blocks traffic
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Residents of Pathak Para, in Behala, stalled the construction of a multi-storeyed building on Monday. They gheraoed the office of the borough chairman in protest and this led to traffic being held up for over three hours on Diamond Harbour Road. 																								The disputed plot in ward no. 119, measuring about a bigha, is locally known as Mollah Buxar Math. For decades, it has been used as a play area by children of the locality and a ground for organising programmes, including political meetings. 																								Local CPM leader Ajoy Adhikari said: We always knew it was a vested plot but now it is being identified as a private property by the present civic board. Construction work had started without obtaining proper permission, Adhikari added. 																								On the other hand, chairman of the local borough committee Susanta Ghosh argued that the land was never vested. It is a private property and the owner can use it according to his requirements. 																								He added: The developer started work in adherence with Calcutta Municipal Corporation rules. It is not possible for me to say when the mutation was carried out or the plan sanctioned.																								The municipality possesses documents to prove that permission was accorded only after official verification.																								But CPM leader Adhikari said: We wanted to see the current order but the municipal authorities could not show it, as their documents are old. However, the district administration has issued a stop-work order till the matter is settled.																								He added that residents had gone to several officials, including the local councillor, for intervention in the matter, but in vain. So finally, we went to the municipality today and submitted a memorandum, protesting the construction, he said.																								However, local councillor Asoka Mondal said she was given a few papers about the land only a fortnight ago. I have handed over the papers to the buildings department, which has the details. I am awaiting its version and have requested the residents to be patient till then, she added.

 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Dacoity spree in minister backyard
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Dacoits attempted to break into the Panchashayar residence of Ashoke Basu, vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, on Wednesday night, but neighbours raised an alarm and chased them away. The incident is the latest in a string of dacoities in the area.																								Residents of Panchashayar, in east Jadavpur, are up in arms over police inaction, despite a dozen dacoities in the area over the past six months. 																								Over 2,000 of them have decided to petition Kanti Ganguly, minister of state for Sunderbans affairs, who is a neighbour. They will also gherao the local police station on August 12 to demand tighter security. 																								The residents claim that the law-keepers are responsible for the rise in local crime, since their inaction encourages the goons. So much so that in July, a gang looted the house of Karuna Nath, the ministers next-door neighbour.																								Vice-chancellor Basu is the tenant of an executive engineer of the Sunderbans Development Board. On Wednesday night, during a heavy shower, the dacoits tried to saw through the grilles of Basus flat. His first-floor neighbours raised the alarm. The vice-chancellor was not at home. 																								Panchashayar is guarded by two police camps, in addition to Purba Jadavpur thana, because it has a high-profile minister as resident. However, his neighbours remain insecure. It is also home to the state finance secretary, and a number of bank executives. There are 400 houses on the 600-odd plots. The dacoits arrive by train from rural pockets like Canning, Basanti and Gosaba, and flee similarly. 																								Anil Ukil, secretary of Panchashayar Housing Cooperative Society, said: We have decided to hire four professional guards and adopt other measures to protect ourselves. We need, however, to talk to the minister before taking a final decision, he added.																								Minister Ganguly said he has instructed the local police not to rest easy. I support the residents decision to engage security guards, he added.																								Additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Subarna said: We will join the meeting convened by the residents. A solution can be arrived at only with local help.

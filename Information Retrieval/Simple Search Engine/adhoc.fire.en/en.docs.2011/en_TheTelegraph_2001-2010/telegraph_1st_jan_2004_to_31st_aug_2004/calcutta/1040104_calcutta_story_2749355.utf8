 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Minor held for kidnap of adult girl
 A STAFF REPORTER																								City police on Saturday arrested a minor, Zubin Ahmed, 17, on charges of abducting an adult girl. The boy was rounded up as soon as he surrendered at Watgunge police station early on Saturday. He was produced in court and has been remanded in police custody.																								Zubin was arrested though the 18-year-old girl, Priti Bhatia, a first-year student of South City College, sent a fax to deputy commissioner of police (port division) O.P. Gupta, saying she had eloped with the boy on her own. We arrested him on the basis of the complaint lodged by Pritis father Pradip Bhatia, said an official of Watgunge police station. 																								The girl returned last night. But we could not record her statement as her family has admitted her to a nursing home, he added.																								Priti went missing on November 19 from her Nazir Lane residence in Kidderpore and did not return even after nightfall. Zubin was the suspect as Priti had complained to her family that the boy used to harass her. Her businessman father lodged a complaint saying Zubin had plotted to kidnap his daughter. He alleged the boy was a member of a global girl-running racket.																								Zubins father was arrested though he had no role in Pritis disappearance. 																								The two, apparently, found it difficult to run from one hideout to another. So they decided to surrender, said an officer of Watgunge police station.																								Zubin can only be released if the girl declares in court that she had gone with him on her own. But that is not possible for the next few days as she is under treatment, said the official. Silver bar haul: Two persons,  trying to smuggle in 75 kg of silver bars worth Rs 6 lakh,  were arrested on Saturday morning from the Howrah station  by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials. The smugglers,  Moni Jadav and Ramesh Jadav, had boarded the Down Shipra  Express from Varanasi.

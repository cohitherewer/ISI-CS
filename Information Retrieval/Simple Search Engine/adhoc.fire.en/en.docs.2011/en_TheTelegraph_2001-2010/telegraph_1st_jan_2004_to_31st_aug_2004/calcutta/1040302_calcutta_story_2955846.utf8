 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Lawyer-cop jostle in bid to free accused
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out at Bankshal court when a group of lawyers tried to snatch an accused from police custody on Monday afternoon. The lawyers surrounded the officers of the detective department and scuffled with them but failed to free the man.																								Around 3 pm, accused Sheikh Suleman, arrested on charges of swindling a woman in the Amherst Street area, was granted bail by the magistrate. As he left the court building, a group of six officers of the detective departments anti-rowdy section accosted him. The sleuths, in plain clothes, were waiting in front of the court to re-arrest Suleman in connection with another case.																								The moment the sleuths grabbed Suleman by the hands, his lawyer Sandip Bhattacharya stepped forward. He claimed the sleuths had no right to arrest his client. He showed them a copy of the bail order.																								But the policemen, too, were armed with another warrant. Bhattacharya, however, was not ready to listen. He raised a hue and cry, said an officer of Hare Street police station.																								On hearing the commotion, a group of 15 lawyers rushed to the spot. They cordoned off the policemen and jostled with them. A section tried to free Suleman. 																								The sleuths, initially, were in trouble, as they were in plain clothes. Neither bystanders nor the other policemen in uniform could recognise us. Help came from the uniformed colleagues only after one of the sleuths introduced the team from the anti-rowdy squad. But it did not work, because we were outnumbered. So, we messaged Lalbazar for reinforcements, said an official of the detective department.																								Later, the sleuths pushed Suleman into a police vehicle and drove off straight to Lalbazar.																								There are several cheating cases pending against Suleman. He was produced in court in connection with one of the cases. As he was granted bail, we went there to round him up in connection with another, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).																								Suleman will be produced in court again on Tuesday. This time, we will not take any chances. Adequate arrangements will be made to resist any attempt to free him, said Mitra.

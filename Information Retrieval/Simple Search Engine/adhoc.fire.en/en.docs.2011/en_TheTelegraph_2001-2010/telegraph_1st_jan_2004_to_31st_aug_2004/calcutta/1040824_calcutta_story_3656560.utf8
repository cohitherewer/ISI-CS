Victor BanerjeeWe turn green with envy because the grass is always greener on the other side of fences we build around ourselves and the lure of the greenback that has emptied our nests is enough to make us sick  after we turn green. From the aesthetic brilliance of kala pata green to the olives that justify amoral conquests, from the emerald seas with schools of brilliantly-coloured fish to the single green blazer that millions of golfers gouge freeways for  it would take a genius far greater than Einstein to figure out what we on this blue planet mean when we indiscriminately use the same colour to describe a 100 diametrically opposed attributes.But, perhaps the most enigmatic green that has ever fired the imagination is derived from what the Greeks called apsinthion  wormwood. Absinthe, the fairy liquid that virtually elevated French creativity to heights it has still not surpassed, is the sort of devil in the bottle that influenced the likes of Degas, Gauguin and, some say, Manet.But the greatest tribute to this vile green lubricant, the queen of poisons that drove a generation of 19th Century French geniuses to madness, is the Museum of Absinthe, set up in Auvers-sur-Oise, where Vincent Van Gogh killed himself after painting vivid images of nature under the influence of this green fairy he loved dearly. At the beginning of the 20th Century, absinthe was banned and it disappeared from the cafes in Paris, all centres of Impressionist art in Europe and even the United States. Absinthism was defined as the vilest form of alcoholism and wine producers suffering under its popularity heaved a sigh of relief when their lobbying to ban the stuff was promulgated by Chardonnay, whisky and bourbon guzzling dictators of public morals.But the British continued to serve the stuff in pubs and a decade ago even had the villainous stuff bottled by an octogenarian Czech who had for years held his grandfathers secret recipe close to his chest. But the English were scared to loosen stiff upper lips to a point where it might twist to a mind-blowing zaniness. Pub owners were warned not to sell a customer more than two shots. There are unconfirmed reports about its ramifications in the arena of homosexuality but, in Biochemical Pharmacology, the magical ingredient of absinthe was classified alpha-thujone: Gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A receptor modulation and metabolic detoxification.Absinthe is a liqueur with wormwood (that contains thujone), anise and 75 per cent proof alcohol  a compound with rather obvious potential. One is meant to louch it by adding water to make it into a cloudy drink. You may swirl in a teaspoonful of sugar to cut the bitter taste of the wormwood.What has inspired this piece of mine is a review I read of Jad Adams book entitled Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle. I thought it would be an eye-opener to many aspiring artistes suffering under the influence of employment conditions, hazardous health centres and yet fighting to uphold a tradition of art and culture that Bengalis have been accustomed to pioneering.That apart, I suddenly thought of the most brilliant green potion (besides a concoction of Pudin Hara and dry gin that passes for Crme-de-Menthe) that I have become famous for after Ruskin Bond published it in one of his culinary memoirs. Stinging Nettle grows wild in the hills. The monks in the gumpas of Tibet survived almost entirely on a diet of nettle and its positive attributes, both physical and metaphysical, are there for the world to behold. Dont use the five-pointed variety; use the tender shoots from the normal plant with oval-shaped leaves. Use a wet cloth when plucking the leaves or at least wet your hands to prevent itching.STINGING NETTLE SOUP  Ingredients: 1 large onion, 1 bunch of nettle as large as any other bunch of spinach sold in the bazaar, 1 tbsp butter, one pinch nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, flour/butter to make a roux for thickening Van Gogh: Inspired by the green fairyMethod: Chop onions fine. Handle the nettle carefully and remove all the stems. Put the leaves into a large pot of water. Wash thoroughly and drain. Toss the chopped onions briefly in butter and add the nettle leaves and stir with the onions for a minute or two till soft. Now add as much chicken stock or water as required for the soup and cook till the onions and nettles are ready. Cool and puree in a blender. Replace in a saucepan and boil for a few minutes to required consistency. (You can add a stock cube if you have used only water).If it is too thin make a roux of flour and butter and add with a little milk pouring slowly to avoid forming lumps. If you prefer a creamy soup, you can add milk for texture. Season with salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg.For Calcuttans used to swallowing Gelusils and Digenes after every over-eaten meal, let me tell you about the discovery made by a millionaire playboy who lived in Boston a 100 years ago. A friend of his invented Enosinthe; half absinthe and half Enos Fruit Salts. Take it from there. And, good luck to all our easel-toting geniuses and jhola-toting poets dotted under banyans and pipals on the Maidan.

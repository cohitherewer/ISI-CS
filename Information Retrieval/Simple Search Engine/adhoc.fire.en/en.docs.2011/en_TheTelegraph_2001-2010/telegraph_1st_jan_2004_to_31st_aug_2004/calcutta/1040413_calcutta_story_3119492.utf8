 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Cable snag has Saltlec powerless 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Large areas of Salt Lakes Sector V suffered prolonged power cuts on Monday, following a major fault in the high-tension cable. 																								A spokesman of the state electricity board (SEB) said some areas remained without power for eight to nine hours. The fault occurred around noon and its impact was severe on the units in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec).																								The power cut affected workflow at the information technology (IT) companies, and phones started ringing at Webel, the state governments nodal IT agency and the agency responsible for affairs in Saltlec. We got in touch with the SEB and repair work started immediately, said a Webel official. 																								As only a handful of the bigger IT companies have permission to use generators, the power cut affected the small and medium units and the call centres. 																								Given the nature of our business, the government should make foolproof supply arrangements for units here. We had to incur losses because of the power cut, said the CEO of a tech firm. 																								A senior SEB official said supply was back to normal in most of the affected parts of Sector V by 8.30 pm. There are a few consumers still in the dark and we hope to restore supply by tonight, after we repair a vital high-tension switchgear, he said.

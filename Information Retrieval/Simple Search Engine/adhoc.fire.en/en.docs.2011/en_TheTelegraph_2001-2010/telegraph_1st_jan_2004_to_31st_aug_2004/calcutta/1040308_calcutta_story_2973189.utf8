Chaiti Ghoshal - ActressWhat book are you reading at the moment?Right now, Im poring over Sculpting in Time: Reflections on the Cinema by Andrey Tarkovsky, which is incidentally also the last book I read. I keep returning to this book, as its an extremely inspiring read. The work captures this cult directors reflections about the medium of cinema and reveals all the tricks and techniques he harnesses to bring a story to life on the big screen. At the same time, the reader also gets an insight into the ordinary life that he leads. After completing such classics as Andrey Rublyov and Solaris, Tarkovsky returns to his mundane, routine way of life and tends to such things as repairing the sofa or changing the curtains. The book is a beautiful balance of the complexity of his work and the simplicity of his life, and thats what is so arresting about it.What books or magazines would we find on your bedside table?Mine is a crazy schedule so I cant really devote as much time as I would like to reading. However, my bedside table is stacked with quite a few books and magazines. I usually keep the latest editions of Inside Outside, Sananda, Graphiti and Desh close at hand. Film magazines are not really my favourites but from time to time, I do flip though one if there are any interviews of my good friend Tabu. When it comes to books, Hojoborolo by Sukumar Ray, dealing with the imaginary world of an eight-year-old child and a couple of other kids books which I read with Amartya, my son, find space on my bedside table.Which is your favourite book ever?This is really difficult to answer, but after much thought, I would have to say Mongpote Rabindranath, a travelogue by Tagore that explores mans relationship with nature. In the book, when man returns to nature, the latter strikes up a dialogue with him and consequently brings about a series of changes in his life. All of Rabindranath Tagores short stories and novels are brilliant, but for me, this is the one that stands out.If you could save one book from your library, which would it be?This is a tough call. Its impossible for me to choose just one, so Id go with Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl, the many works of Tagore that I have, Hojoborolo and Tuntuni And Baagher Galpo by Upendra Kishore Raychoudhury. I would have probably mentioned a lot more but you see, I wasnt allowed to shift my library from my baaper bari which contains quite a few rare editions.What would you like to read on a flight?I would probably leaf through something very light such as a magazine or a gripping murder mystery. In fact, I still remember the book I read on my very first flight was a mushy Mills and Boons romance. I still have a quite a few of these at my baaper bari.What books do you like to re-read?There are quite a few books that I cant help but return to including Hojoborolo and Char Adhyay, the latter by Tagore. I believe its one of his best novels and the dialogues are outstanding. Even the heroine Ela is the epitome of femininity, courage and the conviction to go forward when things are bad  the type of protagonist who evokes courage in the reader. Then again, Dak Ghar is another book I keep reading because I love the exchanges between the characters and the different pictures that are painted. I also really like the character of Amol, an eight-year-old boy, whom I played on stage when I was all of seven.Rate the best books you read last year.My best read in 2003 would have to be Jhumpa Lahiris Interpreter of Maladies. Its not like heaven on earth, but after a while, this book really grows on you. Many a time, we finish a book just for the sake of reading the entire thing. Thats not the case with this book  it will never be a waste of time. Last year, I also read a very interesting travelogue on tigers in the Sunderbans. Im extremely fond of reading travelogues  perhaps thats the wanderer in me. My ideal situation would be working for six months and travelling the rest of the year.Which is the best book you read as a child?My best book as a child was also the very first Bangla book I read: Amatir Bhepoo by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay. I took a whole month to complete it and cried a great deal when Durga dies. Satyajit Rays classic film Pather Panchali is based on this work.What books would you recommend to children?I would whole-heartedly recommend books by Leela Majumdar, Upendra Kishore Raychoudhury and Sukumar Ray as well as Bangla fairytales. Panchatantra, the Enid Blyton and Pokemon series as well as Tintin and Asterix are also must-reads. Featuring on my long list too, would be the Secrets of Droon collection by Tony Abbot, Daniel Defoes Robinson Crusoe and of course, all the Harry Potter books. I think Harry Potter is a great read especially since the language is so easy for children. What kind of book would you like to write?I would love to write travelogues that would capture not just the physical beauty or appeal of a place but also the spirit of the people living there. And first on my list would be Ravangla in Sikkim.AS TOLD TO JANINE WYNNE-PETERS

 A STAFF REPORTER																								A new South Point at a new venue. This is the golden jubilee gift to the city from its biggest school in terms of student population. 																								We have reached a saturation point at the present site, with every square foot of the 80 cottahs of land at our disposal being put to optimum use to provide a variety of facilities to our 12,500 students. So we are looking at possibilities for expansion, announced R.S. Lodha, trustee of South Point Education Society, on Saturday. 																								While the details of the project would not be made public before April, he indicated that the school would build on its own strengths. We have a successful model in hand. But if there is scope to improve, we would go for a new model, he added.																								The eye, for now, is set on the present and the focus is on the celebration of the past. The school, founded by Satikanta Guha on April 1, 1954, has turned 50 and a week-long celebration has been planned as a run-up to the day. 																								Said Madhu Kohli, principal of South Point School: A day each has been set aside for all sections of the school, including guardians, former teachers and ex-students. 																								Debates, panel discussions, inter-school singing competitions and felicitation of 50 distinguished alumni are some of the programmes which will bring the past alive. The felicitation list includes filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh, danseuse Tanushree Shankar, author Kunal Basu, Professor Supriya Chaudhuri, cricketer Snehashish Ganguly and municipal commissioner Debashis Som. Included in the list is also Ustad Wajahat Khan, nephew of Ustad Inayat Khan, who will fly down from London for a sarod recital at his alma mater.																								A documentary film entitled My School has been put together by former students. Directed by Abhijit Dasgupta, it has been set to music by tabla player Tanmoy Bose and edited by Arghyakamal Maitra. 																								Two publications will be available on the occasion. While 50 amp; Beyond will chronicle five decades of the school, through interviews of former students and teachers, Golden Frames will be an album of group photographs of each of the present classes with the class teacher, said J. Solomon, principal of South Point High School. 																								The curtains will come down on the event with Governor Viren J. Shah releasing a special cover granted by the department of posts at the Science City auditorium on April 1.

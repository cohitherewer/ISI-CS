 															- Hearing-impaired theatre troupe perfects its cues to go on stage A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The Action Players rehearses for Beyond the Land of Hattamala on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								They are from different backgrounds, of various ages and occupations. But they have one thing in common  they suffer from hearing impairment. Not that it stops any of them from doing everything that others do, and certainly not a play. 																								For, they are part of The Action Players (TAP), a theatre group with members like Irfan, a father of two, and Piu, a Class XI student of The Assembly of God Church School. On Tuesday, the troupe was busy rehearsing for the opening night of their next show, Beyond the Land of Hattamala, presented in association with The Telegraph.																								The play is the directorial debut of Jhuma Sircar, a member of TAP. She is the first student of Oral School for Deaf Children, on Short Street, to go to university. The third-year history honours student of Rabindra Bharati University says through sign language that the performance is alright so far, but more practise and improvement are required. 																								It is also the first time that Indian, not American, sign language, is being used. And the actors do it all through visual cues and by silently counting to synchronise actions.																								The two main protagonists are computer whiz Vishal and tailor-turned-marble-cutter Irfan, who has been with TAP since 1985. They all take time out from their busy schedules to be a part of the group, started in 1973 by a teacher of the Oral School, Zarin Chaudhuri. Vikas Agarwal is the south Calcutta distributor of edible oils and also dabbles in computer graphics, but the father of two makes it to the afternoon rehearsals without fail. As does Lavinya, a beautician trained in Jamaica, the US, Mumbai and Calcutta.																								The performance is all the better for the main means of communication being mime, since the actions are exaggerated, which works wonders for the humorous tale of two thieves who suddenly find themselves in a never-never land. The English translation of Hattamalar Oparey, adapted by playwright Badal Sircar from the childrens novel Hattamalar Deshey serialised in the magazine Sandesh, is a treat. With the help of three student voice actors, choreography by Tanushree Shankar and original music by Neel Adhikary, its sure to strike a chord when it opens on August 28.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Four counts to plug leak theory
 							 - CU hands over test-paper case to sleuths A STAFF REPORTER																								Handing over the case to the detective department of city police, pro vice-chancellor of Calcutta University (CU) Suranjan Das said on Monday there were several anomalies in the B. Com (Honours) Part II question papers that had come into the hands of The Telegraph on Sunday.																								On the basis of what has been printed the university feels that what is being presented as a question paper does not appear to be so, from prima facie evidence, said Das.																								The Telegraph, in the article published on Monday, had said that students of a tutorial centre near Shyambazar had received one set of the question papers on Wednesday and the other on Sunday.																								The Telegraph had stated that it was in no position to confirm if the two sets of papers that had fallen into its hands were the question papers that had been set for the April 16 exam. It was also mentioned that the paper bore a tell-tale mark matching the paper of the previous year. A part of the first page of a question paper had been printed with Mondays article.																								Explaining why, prima facie, it does not appear to be the universitys B. Com question paper, Das stated:																								6The code number given on the right side of the question paper does not conform to the code number of the current year																								6The format for the question paper printed in The Telegraph does not conform to the prescribed format of the universitys question paper																								6It was surprising how some students had secured two sets of Paper V of the B.Com exams, as the university only prints one set of the two or three sets of questions moderated for each year																								6Nowhere in the question paper is the particular university mentioned; it could, therefore, belong to any university, anywhere. It is mandatory to mention the universitys name in all question papers printed by CU.																								The question of a leak does not arise, Das said. The question papers have been printed and sealed and are under lock-and-key in the strongroom. They have not been despatched yet.																								Das also clarified that the B. Com examination would be held on schedule and investigations would not come in its way.																								He, however, said the university would come to know if any of the questions from Paper V tallied with the ones procured by the tutorial students only when the question paper packets were opened 10 minutes before the exam for distribution.																								Even the vice-chancellor cannot open a sealed packet to verify this, Das said. Only under exceptional circumstances, when the code number is established and the format and other details tally, can this be done.																								According to Das, if after the question paper packets are opened and it was found that the questions tallied, the university would take a decision on what to do only at that point of time.																								Deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra, however, refused to comment. We shall first have to examine the matter, he said.

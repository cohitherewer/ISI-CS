 Overhead telephone wires that are liable to snap frequently. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryR.A. Mundra: In some areas, especially the business district of Burrabazar, the wires linking the sets with the connection boxes hang overhead. Often, the wires come in the way and snap. 																																																													Our basic landline phone service uses overhead wires to connect the external distribution box with the phone set. It is a problem to hang the overhead wire in congested areas and often, the wires get damaged and have to be repaired frequently. Now, we are planning to introduce wireless connections in the congested areas to reduce the complaint of disconnection due to external problems. Though the system is yet to be implemented, we have had a trial run in some parts of the city. The functioning of the system is under observation. If it works well, we will extend this mode of connection to other parts of the city.

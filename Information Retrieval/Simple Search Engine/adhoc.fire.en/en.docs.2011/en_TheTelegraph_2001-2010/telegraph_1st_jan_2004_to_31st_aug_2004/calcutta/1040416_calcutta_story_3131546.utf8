 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 AC coach row holds up train
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Passengers on the air-conditioned (AC) chair car of the Howrah-Dhanbad Black Diamond Express were in for a shock on Thursday morning. They found the train had just one, instead of the regular two, AC chair cars.																								Passengers who held tickets for the second chair car did not allow the train to leave Howrah station on schedule, officials said. The train left Howrah at 7.08 am, nearly an hour late.																								The Black Diamond entered the station at 5.27 am. But when passengers of the second AC coach did not find the compartment, they became furious. They entered into arguments with the train staff and senior officials who had rushed to the platform. 																								As the train started to pull out at its scheduled departure time, they pulled the chain, demanding explanations on the absence of the coach. 																								There were 44 passengers and most of them were accommodated in non-AC coaches, while a few took refunds, an Eastern Railway official said later on Thursday. Those who made the trip will get the balance refunded on application, he added.																								According to Eastern Railway sources, the Down Black Diamond came to Howrah minus the AC chair car on Wednesday night. As a result, we had to send the train without the coach from Howrah. We do not have an extra AC chair car, the official said. The coach is unlikely to be attached on Friday too.

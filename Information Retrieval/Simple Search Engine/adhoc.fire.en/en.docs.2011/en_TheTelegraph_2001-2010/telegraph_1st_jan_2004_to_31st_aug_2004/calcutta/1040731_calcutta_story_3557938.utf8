 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Homage to a young artist
																								Nothing is more tragic to the artist community, or for that matter to society at large, than the untimely demise of a talented young artist. Galerie 88s retrospective of the works of Parthasarathi, a young painter who had gained much recognition, is an effort to pay tribute to the genius of this departed soul. Having carved a niche for himself as a painter specialising in landscapes, Parthasarathi distinguished himself by his mature insight and drawing styles from a very young age. In a career spanning two decades, he explored and developed a metaphor for melancholia in his works, particularly those featuring nocturnal scenes. Though his later works displayed an attempt to treat more complex ideas, his subjects were always characterised by an astonishing simplicity and innocence. They reveal his concern for human relationships, unfettered by social identity and coded with a strong social message. An artist who painted with great passion and precision, his palette reflected a sombre dignity.																								Event: Parthasarathi Retrospective																								When: Till August 7 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

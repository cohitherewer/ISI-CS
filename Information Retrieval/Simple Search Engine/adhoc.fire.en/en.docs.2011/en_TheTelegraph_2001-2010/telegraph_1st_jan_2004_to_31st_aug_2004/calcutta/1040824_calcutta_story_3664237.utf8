 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Shilpa, but seriously
 Shilpa ShettyReinvention is the name of the game and Shilpa Shetty is playing it well (and for once we arent talking about her nose and her). In fact, she is almost a pro at it now, what with her Dhadkan racing faster than her pelvic gyrations. Come Friday, Revathys Phir Milenge will see her in a new avatar, where her histrionics will score over her jhatkas.																								I didnt plan it. I have always been a fan of Revathy, the actor, and also loved Mitr. So, getting the opportunity to work with her was enough for me. Yes, it is a complete turnaround for me in the sense that it is a totally deglamourised role, said Shilpa.																								And then she followed it up with what is music to many ears (and eyes): Doing a Phir Milenge doesnt mean that Ill stop doing my filmi dance numbers  that will always remain my USP.																								Shilpa does feel very strongly about AIDS awareness. It is one important message that we all have to believe in. The stigma that has become synonymous with the disease has to be done away with. Through Phir Milenge, I have been able to do my bit as an entertainer. The films box-office fate doesnt really matter. The message should reach the audiences, she stresses.																								One message that sure has reached Shilpas fans is that theres more to her than oomph. Once the promos came on air, there was so much of positive feedback. I have always been lauded for my dances but here were people calling me up and telling me that they loved the way I cried!																								Post-Phir Milenge, Shilpa will be seen playing a high society escort in Deepak Tijoris Khamosh. But it isnt a sex story. It is a murder mystery and what really pushed me to do it was that it got over in 25 nights flat. Now I am doing another film with Deepak, Fareb, a social drama-cum-mystery opposite Manoj Bajpai. I also have the multi-starrer Dus, where I play an anti-terror squad member.																								As far as show business goes, the woman with one of the best bodies in Bollywood takes a be-bold-but-be-beautiful line: The Murders and Julies have worked not just due to the flesh factor but also strong content. As far as I am concerned, I know I have to look appealing on screen but I would never do anything that I cant watch myself. I cannot look vulgar.						PRATIM D. GUPTA

		 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Declaration to avoid discrimination
 Candidates at a Higher Secondary examination centre. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySwarnali Nandi: Like ICSE and CBSE, will we get this years HS results on the website or through the short messaging service (SMS) of various mobile service providers?																																																													As earlier, this years results, too, will be put on the website. But that will be done only after we officially send the results to the schools. Two factors guide the decision. First, we have reports that several cyber cafes overcharge students to inform them about their results if the material is posted on the website earlier. Moreover, several students from the remote villages told us they do not benefit as they have no easy access to the Internet. To avoid the charge of discrimination, we will post the results on the Net only after they are made available to the respective schools. Regarding SMS, we are a little hesitant because mobile service providers, we feel, fleece the students in their hour of anxiety.

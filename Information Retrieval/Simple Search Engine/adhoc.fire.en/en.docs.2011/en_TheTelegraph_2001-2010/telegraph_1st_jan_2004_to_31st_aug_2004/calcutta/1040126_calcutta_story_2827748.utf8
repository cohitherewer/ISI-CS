The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 All hail, Calcutta cabs turn true blue
 															- Round-the-clock and no-refusal, tamper-proof meters and printed receipts NISHA LAHIRI Cool blue no-refusal cabs, with  air conditioners, global positioning satellite systems to  keep track of the taxis and two-way communication with the  control room, available 24 hours a day, with phone booking  facilities.																								From February, watch out for the Blue Arrow taxis, which will have all this and more for the Calcutta commuter fed up of cab fights. The time for the city launch is ripe, feels adman Ram Ray, founder-chairman of Arrow Amenities, with the April 1 Bharat Stage II deadline  It will force a number of cars and cabs to go off the road, and we will be filling that need space.																								Steering the customised Rs 3-lakh-plus Tata Indicabs with digital, tamper-proof meters and receipt printers, first-aid kits, passenger accident insurance and lost-and-found service, will be uniformed, mobile phone-toting drivers. The call-a-cab facility, for starters, will be restricted to 24-hour advance booking, with the tech tools being put in place for immediate pick-ups in future.																								The Blue Arrow bonanza doesnt come cheap. If the flag-down fare is Rs 13.50 (see box), its Rs 10 per km thereafter, and there is a surcharge between 10 pm and 6 am. The first two pieces of luggage are free, and its Rs 10 per piece for the next two.																								With a fleet of 125 set to go and 125 to be added every month, the target is 1,500 Indicabs by the year-end. But we have a permit for 5,000. So, if the service is well received, we will bring in more, adds Ray. Six months after being launched in Calcutta (a mature taxi market), the cabs should roll out in other cities.																								We had conducted a survey among 5,000 people nationwide. Some of the key priorities for commuters are safety, honesty, integrity, hygiene, no-refusal, non-polluting, first-aid kits, cellphones and availability after 10 pm. We will give people what they want, with bonus, promises Ray.																								The driver recruiting  including women  is underway and 50 of the 900 applications have been processed. Requirements include proficiency in Hindi and Bengali, as well as working English, three-year blemish-free driving record and city knowledge. Training will be provided in driving and people skills and benefits include Rs 1 lakh accident insurance for the driver and Rs 25,000 per month medical coverage for the family.																								The major revenue, explains Ray, will be from the advertising inside and outside the taxis, and future facilities include corporate membership cards and even sale of pens and bottled water on a ride.

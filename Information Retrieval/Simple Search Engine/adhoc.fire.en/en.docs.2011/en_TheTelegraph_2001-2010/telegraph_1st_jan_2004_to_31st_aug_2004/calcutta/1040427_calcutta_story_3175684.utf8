 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Trafficking kingpin held
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Criminal Investigation Department (CID) sleuths have arrested the kingpin of a racket in the trafficking of minor girls. 																								Three members of the gang were held last Wednesday and eight minors rescued in a CID swoop on the Delhi-Kalka Mail, while it was ready to pull out of Howrah station.																								Racket leader Maya Sardar was arrested last Saturday in Sandeshkhali, said Ramphal Pawar, special superintendent of police (CID), on Monday. We will send a team to Delhi to trace the links of the gang there, he added.																								Sardar was produced at the Howrah sub-divisional judicial magistrates court and given a seven-days remand in custody, officials said. She was arrested by the local police and handed over to the CID, they added.																								In busting the rackets, we collaborated with the Government Railway Police (GRP) and asked them to keep a strict vigil on Howrah station, Pawar said.																								Eight minor girls, lured to the Capital on promises of jobs, were rescued by the CID last Wednesday. They hailed from Gosaba, Basanti, Hingalganj and Hasnabad. Three persons escorting them  Lakshmi Mondal, Basanti Sardar and her brother Saktipada  were arrested. 																								During interrogation, the trio said the girls were being taken to Delhi to work as domestics.																								The GRP has started a case against those arrested on Friday from the Delhi-Kalka Mail on similar charges. The girls rescued claimed they work in Delhi as household maids. We are checking if their claims are true, said Sunil Mullick, superintendent of railway police, Howrah. Eight girls were rescued after Railway Protection Force personnel intercepted the team at Howrah station.																								Police officials said these rackets usually take women to Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. We have to depend on a tip-off to net them, as it is not possible to monitor all the trains, a GRP officer said.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 The Victoria Memorial Hall: Ground realities																								Victoria Memorial has had enough problems going green. Will going red prove simpler?																								Bengal Rose Association has come up with a colourful proposal to create a rose garden on the Memorial grounds. A Calcutta High Court division bench, framing eco-friendly guidelines for the city landmark on Monday, has urged the Memorial authorities to consider the proposal favourably.																								Two more gardens, covering 450,000 sq ft, have been proposed on the grounds adjacent to the Memorial. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will lay out one, opposite Rabindra Sadan, jointly with Calcutta Police. The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners has suggested a second opposite SSKM Hospital.																								The bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Tapan Dutt, directed the government to file an affidavit and report on the proposal by next Wednesday, when the matter is to come up again.																								Experts should be consulted to make the gardens eco-friendly and help save the monument from pollution, said the bench, which asked for detailed plans of the proposed layout, design and lighting of the gardens.																								The division bench made it clear that all development work adjacent to the monument should be undertaken in consultation with the Memorial authorities, with the courts prior approval. The surrounding roads, it stressed, should be converted into a green channel (possibly leading to a bed of red).																								Commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty told the court that a team of police personnel, formed at the behest of the division bench, has been monitoring the Memorial and its surroundings to prevent dumping of plastic bags. Traffic policemen on duty near the monument are controlling vehicular movement to reduce air pollution, he added.																								The bench noted that visitors cars are usually parked off the outer wall of the Memorial and ordered that this free-parking zone be converted into a fee-parking zone, to curb the car count and reduce pollution.																								Activist Subhas Dutta had filed a petition seeking the courts intervention to protect the monument from air pollution. An expert committee, set up by the division bench, had suggested that no hawkers be allowed within 500 ft of the complex. This, Dutta alleged, was not being enforced.

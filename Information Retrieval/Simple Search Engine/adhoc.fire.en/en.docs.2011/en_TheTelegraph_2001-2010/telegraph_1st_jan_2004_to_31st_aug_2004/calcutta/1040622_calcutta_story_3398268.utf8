 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Patient hangs himself in hospital
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A patient, suffering from chronic renal failure, hanged himself in the toilet of the medical renal unit of SSKM Hospital on Monday morning, hours before his wife was to take a string of medical tests and donate him a kidney.																								Samir Chakraborty, 42, a resident of 23/7/B, Tollygunge Road, was admitted to the hospital on June 15 with chronic renal failure and respiratory infection.																								He (Chakraborty) had asked me to donate him a kidney so that he could live. I had asked the doctors about the procedure and the medical tests were to be conducted today, lamented wife Anita. The electrician was on the third floor of the medical renal unit. Doctors had planned to put him on dialysis from Monday.																								Early on Monday, Chakraborty went into the toilet, armed with a stool, which he placed on the commode and hanged himself from the drainpipe with his lungi and a towel.																								Doctor on duty Swapan Dey spotted Samirs body at 5.40 am. The body was handed over to police at around 7.45 am.																								The hospital authorities called up one of Chakrabortys neighbours in the morning, summoning wife Anita and other family members to SSKM.																								We are going to find out how it happened, SSKM superintendent S.K. Tripathi said. But preliminary findings suggest there was no negligence on part of the hospital, he added.																								Officials at Bhowanipore police station, meanwhile, said the patient could have been suffering from depression, too, as his financial condition was not stable. He was unable to bear the cost of treatment, an officer disclosed.																								Chakraborty had been admitted to SSKM twice earlier. This time, his condition turned so serious that he had to be taken in again. We generally do not admit patients of chronic renal failure, but since Chakraborty had other complications as well, he had to be admitted, Tripathi said.																								The doctors here were pressuring us to take him away, alleged Narayan Chakraborty, the victims elder brother. It was hard for us to bear the cost, but neighbours came to our aid, he said. Uttam Dutta, a neighbour, admitted that funds had been raised locally for Chakrabortys treatment. 																								Other patients in the ward said they had noticed nothing unusual in Chakrabortys behaviour on Sunday night.																								He seemed normal when the ward was being swept, said Rustam Ali, a patient who was discharged on Monday.																								Chakrabortys family alleged negligence on part of the hospital authorities. How could a patient go out unnoticed from a crowded ward and hang himself? No one cared to check the toilet even though he was there for so long, cried Manisha, a relative. 																								The SSKM officials denied the charges of negligence. It is not possible to monitor every movement of all the patients, said superintendent Tripathi. There could have been a history of psychological problems, too, he added.

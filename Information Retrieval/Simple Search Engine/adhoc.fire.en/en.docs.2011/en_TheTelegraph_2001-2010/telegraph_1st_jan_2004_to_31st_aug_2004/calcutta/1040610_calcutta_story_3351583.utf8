 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Students cry foul over fees
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Protesting the decision of the Bengal Engineering College authorities at Shibpur to hike tuition fees, post-graduate students, who are due to write the second semester examinations, have called a strike and are staging a dharna in front of the administrative building since Monday night. 																								The students complained that the college authorities had hiked the fee structure in such a way that they might have to give up studies. 																								The authorities have raised the tuition fees from Rs 400 per month to Rs 1,500, and they informed us about it only on Monday night. If we dont pay the backlog from June 2003, they will not allow us to write the second semester exams from July 8, said Anil Patra, an ME student. 																								College officials admitted that the new fee structure was implemented from June 2003, but the authorities did not inform students of the Masters level about it till Monday evening. 																								It is a lapse on our part that the students were not informed about the new fee structure on time. But we are willing to discuss it with them, asserted registrar of the college Aditya Bandopadhyay. 																								He said the college authorities had told the students that they would not have to pay the backlog from June 2003. But they will have to pay the enhanced fee after the second semester, that is, when they would be able to sit for the third semester examination, Bandopadhyay added. 																								The students said the revised fees of BE College were the highest in comparison with that of other engineering colleges.

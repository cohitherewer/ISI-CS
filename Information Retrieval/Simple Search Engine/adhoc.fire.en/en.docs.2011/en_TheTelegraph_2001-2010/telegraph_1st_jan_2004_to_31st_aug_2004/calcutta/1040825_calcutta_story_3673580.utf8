The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Call to preach, not punish
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should members of the audience be penalised if their cell phones ring during a performance in an auditorium? More letters will be published next week				 Trade talk: Stay connected, but outside an auditorium RAKA SARKHEL, 
																		Jadavpur																																																														Careless members of the audience who let their cell phones ring during a performance should definitely be penalised. This shows a lack of respect for the performer, which is a matter of shame. If it is an emergency, one always has the option of setting the cell phone on vibrator mode.									

Fakhre Alam,
																		Tiljala Lane																																																														Cell phones are part and parcel of life, that people live with and benefit from. It is not advisable for anybody to keep the cell phone switched off during a performance. The silent or vibrator mode in the phone might be a way out. For, if cell phone users are penalised, audiences will dwindle at live shows.									

Debyani bASU,
																		Birati																																																														For an artist, the auditorium is a temple and the performance a form of worship. A ringing cell phone distracts the performer and disturbs other members of the audience too. It should be the moral duty of the listeners to keep their cell phones silent in an auditorium, or else they should be penalised.									

A.F. KAMRUDDIN AHMED,
																		Hooghly																																																														Punishment for such an offence is totally out of line. Todays viewers and performers should not take ringing phones seriously. A viewer should not be robbed of his right to stay connected with the outside world during a show. A penalty for such a purpose will only lead to decreasing viewers in the auditorium.									

MEGHNA BHATTACHARYA,
																		Jyotish Roy Road																																																														Offenders should definitely be penalised. But not before adequate warning in the form of notices or announcements to keep their phones switched off. Those with the option of keeping the phone on silent or vibrator mode, should do so. They should realise that a call, important for them, might disturb others in the hall. Strict penalty is a must to stop this.									

Sourish misra,
																		Salt Lake																																																														The irresponsible members of the audience should definitely be penalised. They should understand that their habits are disturbing everybody around them in the auditorium and hampering the performance of the artist on stage. The silent or vibrator mode can be of help in such cases. Nirmal Kumar Saha,
SintheeThere should be a strict rule by which members of the audience should be penalised if their cell phones disturb other viewers in an auditorium. The audience should be alert in switching off the cell phone or keeping it on silent mode before he/she enters a hall. 									

Debasish Chakraborty,
																		Cossipore																																																														Everyone pays to see a show, which they watch with rapt attention. If in such a situation a cell phone rings, it robs him of his listening or viewing pleasure. The cell phone user should see to it that nobody gets disturbed because of him.									

Seraj Alam,
																		Bansberia																																																														Cell phones help us keep in touch with others all the time. They are very useful gadgets. They do not merely disturb others in an auditorium, they also reach us urgent information, even during a performance. A penalty for this is ridiculous.Atif Ayaz,
																		Serampore																																																														Yes, if a cell phone rings during a performance, the member of the audience who owns the set should be penalised. The ring of the phone as well as the conversation disturb other viewers.									

Prantik Sanyal,
																		SP Mukherjee Road																																																														Though certain members of the audience act as if a great mishap has occurred if a cell phone rings in an auditorium, it is not that serious a problem. Even then, the habit of a few people to chat inside a hall, without consideration for others, should be discouraged. 									

Rajdeep Guha,
																		Panchanantala Road																																																														Despite repeated requests from organisers and auditorium authorities, some people keep their cell phones switched on. This disrupts the ambience during a performance. Such offenders should be caught and reprimanded.									

K.L. Ghosh,
																		Kalindi 																																																														We can hardly do without cell phones for even a few minutes today. Visitors to a show can keep their mobile phones on silent or vibrator mode during a performance in an auditorium.Prahlad Agarwala,
																		Majdia																																																														People walk into a hall to enjoy a performance in peace. If during the performance, cell phones, carried by a section of the audience, start to ring, the others definitely get disturbed. So, such offenders surely deserve to be penalised.Sunita Wadhwani,
																		SR Das Road																																																														Organisers should print on the tickets a warning about limited cell phone use inside a hall. Cell phone service providers, too, should provide users with a list of dos and donts. Security guards might be brought in for this purpose too.									

Prasenjit Das,
																		Jadavpur																																																														A performance or show is hardly ever more than a couple of hours long. It certainly cannot be a big problem if the user switches his phone off for a short while. Otherwise, an offender needs to be punished for disturbing others.Govinda Bakshi,
																		Budge Budge																																																														It is a nuisance when cell phones start to ring during a performance, distracting both the artist and the audience. Youngsters generally keep their phones for show, not caring about the proper time and place for using them. Only strict punitive measures can stop this.Basant Chowdhury,
																		Kankinara																																																														No, members of the audience should not be penalised, for a single missed call might be of immense importance. Keeping that in mind, banning cell phones in an auditorium is unwarranted, but the call may be taken outside the hall by the user.Apurba Mitra,
																		Paddapukur Road																																																														A hefty fine cannot be a permanent solution. What we need in this situation is awareness. People should realise the importance of maintaining the sanctity of a performance in an auditorium.Virendra Shah,
																		Amratolla Lane																																																														Since most people are loathe to learn a lesson by persuasion, strict penalisation is the only way out. Most irresponsible users have no consideration for others in the auditorium as they talk on, without any sense of guilt about the disturbance caused.Md Ayub,
																		Bright Street																																																														It is impossible to find out whose phone is ringing in a dark auditorium. Since it is also not feasible to switch off cell phones, the gadgets can be kept on vibrator or silent mode. That way, one does not miss a call, neither is anyone disturbed.Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														Certain etiquettes need to be maintained during a performance in an auditorium. Penalising cannot help in the long run. Instead, awareness should be created among the users, such that they do not inconvenience others. 									

Satyen Biswas,
																		Pathak Para Road																																																														First, the organisers should put up a notice outside the entrance asking users to switch off their mobiles before stepping in. Still, if a phone rings in the hall, the owner should be punished.									

Rounak Pal, 
																		Birati																																																														If a penalty for ringing cell phones in an auditorium is introduced, it will be of great benefit to the true connoisseurs of the arts. We attend shows to forget the drudgery of the world outside. Life would become unbearable if our troubles seep into an auditorium via cell phones. A fine should be imposed on those who flout the norms.

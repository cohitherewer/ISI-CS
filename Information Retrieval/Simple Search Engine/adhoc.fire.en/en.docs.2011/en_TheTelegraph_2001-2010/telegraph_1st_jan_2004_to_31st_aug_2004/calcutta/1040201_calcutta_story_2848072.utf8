The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, February 01, 2004 				 Disease spurt regroups doctors
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Faced with a rising incidence of lifestyle diseases in Calcutta, doctors will re-examine ways of dealing with problems like diabetes, cancer and asthma at a workshop on Sunday.																								Doctors across specialities will meet for a brainstorming session on treatment protocol and will also take part in a diabetes workshop.																								The conference is crucial as the number of lifestyle diseases is steadily increasing, with as many as seven out of 10 patients complaining of diabetes or other associated illnesses, said R.D. Dubey, joint secretary (headquarters), Indian Medical Association. The conference, organised by the association, has been called to formulate a better counter-plan, explained Dubey.																								Orthopaedic surgeon P.K. Banerjee will also deliver the prestigious Nilratan Sircar Memorial Oration on mobile knee replacement, a procedure he pioneered in Bengal.																								Apart from cancer, which brings over 60,000 new patients to city hospitals a year, diseases like asthma and movement disorders among senior citizens are becoming increasingly common.																								Rising respiratory distress, which has prompted the Calcutta Medical Research Institute to open the citys first asthma-awareness clinic, will be up for discussion as well. Nearly three out of every 100 Calcuttans are said to suffer from asthma symptoms, according to recent studies. Airport entry: The Airports  Authorities of India (AAI) on Saturday lifted the ban on  visitors for entering the domestic and international lounges  of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport. The visitors will  be allowed in only with entry tickets.

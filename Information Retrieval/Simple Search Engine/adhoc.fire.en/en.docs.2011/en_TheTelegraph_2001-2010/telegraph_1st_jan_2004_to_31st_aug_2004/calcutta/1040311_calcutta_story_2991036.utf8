 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 A little bit back to society
				 	 Sudip SrimalSudip Srimal He is better known as the man running the show at Nehru Childrens Museum, where he is the honorary secretary. But his other activities include looking after a school for slum children and providing computer education for unemployed youth.																								For Sudip Srimal, social work runs in the family. The mother of this 62-year-old had served as the vice-president of Indian Council for Child Welfare among other organisations, his father helped set up the Nehru Museum, and one of his brothers imparts vocational training to deprived children in Baruipur.																								Srimal follows a simple philosophy in life  one taught by his father  to look a little beyond making money and giving back to the society in whatever form possible. Thus the involvement in the various family businesses, including an advertising firm and a billboard company, apart from the museum and other social activities.																								These include a school beside Rabindra Sarobar, where around 80 kids from neighbouring Gobindapur basti are taught the alphabets and a little more, to create an interest in education in them. The school, functional for almost 17 years, has recently been housed in a more permanent one-storied building. There are problems with kids often skipping school to help out their mothers, who usually work as maids. But a serious lot is sent to proper schools each year.																								Srimal and his friends also run Ankur in Jadavpur, which serves as a computer-training centre for unemployed youth. Functioning since 1999, the centre charges only Rs 100 for the six-month course. Computer Association of Eastern India helped Ankur by donating the computer terminals.																								Though his family has been in Calcutta since the 19th century, Srimals school life was spent at St Patricks, Asansol. College saw him return to the city and subsequently remain and work here. Lending a hand to his fathers advertising firm and working for the museum in its nascent stages in the 1970s were simultaneous activities for Srimal during his college days.																								Most of the museums activities, understandably, involve kids. Scholarships are provided for excellence in art and dance, and board examination toppers are felicitated annually. But perhaps the most significant contribution is providing financial help to children who have to undergo major surgeries. Depending on the seriousness of the operation and financial condition of the patient, aid up to Rs 3 lakh is provided.																								Funds are raised through renting out the museum auditorium, ticket sales for the plays held, and through donations.

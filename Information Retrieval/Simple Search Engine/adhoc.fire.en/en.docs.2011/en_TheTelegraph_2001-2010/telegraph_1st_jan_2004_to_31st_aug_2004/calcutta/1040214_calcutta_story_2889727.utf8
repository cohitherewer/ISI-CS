The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 City Lights
				 Starry nights on stadium turf Coming soon: Kareena  Kapoor, (top) Fardeen Khan and Salman Khan Big concert is the flavour of  February in Calcutta. If February 1, 2003, created musical  history with A.R. Rahmans first  and biggest  live show  at the Salt Lake stadium, 2004 has two more galas lined  up. Valentines Day will see the start of Adnan Samis world  tour, while on February 28, the stars  including Salman  Khan, Fardeen Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Shilpa  Shetty and Yana Gupta  will descend on the same stage.				 																																																											After Rahman and Hrithik Roshan before that, Sami has chosen Calcutta as the place to launch his concert tour. Former Miss World Yukta Mookhey will compere the show, which will feature actresses Namrata Shirodkar and Rimi Sen. Sami stresses the completely live show will have a lot in store for the audience. These shows are the best time for me to interact with my fans, says the pop sensation, in the city on Friday. It will be a completely freaked out party, he smiles. The evening will include numbers from his albums, film songs as well as some instrumental music, which is an important part of the pianists repertoire.				 																																																											Calcutta is special to the singer, not only because of the tremendous amount of love he has received from fans here, but also because he has been inspired by the music of S.D. Burman and R.D. Burman. The folk influences found in their music can be traced in Samis own work, he admits. He has been approached to do songs in Bengali, and confesses he would love the adventure.				 																																																											Mookhey was happy to be in Calcutta again, with all its old-time charm, while for Shirodkar, it was enough to be performing alongside Sami  by far one of my favourite-est singers  once more.				 																																																											Another adventure awaits Calcutta, with the star-studded Bollywood Hungama coming up this month-end. The show, conceived by Smita Thackerays Mukti Foundation is, apparently, the largest ever fund-raiser for AIDS awareness in eastern India. The bevy of actors and actresses  performing pro bono  will dance to their own hit tracks. A part of the proceeds from the show  to feature a troupe of dancers from Mumbai, adding action to the tunes of Sukhwinder Singh and Sadhna Sargam  will go to the foundation. Senior members of the All India Freedom Fighters Association, also working to increase awareness about HIV/AIDS, are to be felicitated.				 																																																											It has been honoured as the best book to be published by a Bangladeshi in the field of women and human rights in the past three years. The Bangladesh President gave away the award on January 29. 				 																																																											When Bangladesh was still East Pakistan, Muslim personal law was reformed during the regime of Ayub Khan. The law has also been reformed in countries like Iraq, Libya, Indonesia, Turkey and Morocco. Yet, as women all over South Asia, irrespective of their religion, know to their cost, all matters of marriage, divorce, custody, maintenance and inheritance fall under religious-personal laws, that in tandem with customary practices, perpetuate injustice and suffering. Using Bangladesh as a case study, Pereiras book is a serious discussion on doing away with personal laws across South Asia.				 																																																											The book begins with the specific cases of three Bangladeshi women and then examines the position of women in Christian, Hindu and Muslim traditions focusing on the various existing codes. It concludes with Pereiras recommendations for radical law reform aimed at a uniform personal code.				 																																																											In her preface, Indian lawyer-activist Indira Jaising points out how rights guaranteed by the constitutions of South Asian countries conflict with the existing personal laws and how the Indian Supreme Court has evaded the issue. 				 																																																											Pereira, an advocate of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, says: I am a Bangladeshi woman who has taken up human rights activism as a life vocation. I dont really see it as a career but as a calling Bangla is my mother tongue.

Efforts are now on to increase penetration of the product  behind such films as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Harry Potter, Spider-Man, Ice Age and The Matrix  in a number of industries. A team from Tata Elexsi was in town this week to connect with animators and trainers in eastern India, and demonstrate the latest innovations.				 																																																											Apart from special effects, Maya is being billed as a tool for advertising, architecture and even hospitals. But a dearth of trained people has held back the application from gaining ground. Improving the quality of training institutes in Calcutta is part of the strategy, adds Bhaskar Dutt, corporate manager, marketing, Tata Elexsi.				 																																									 Theres an evening of love lined up by the river at Hugli, a lifestyle store on Hastings Court, on Saturday, 7.30 pm onwards. Priti Patel, Tanusree Shankar, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Sanjeev and Priti Goenka are expected to attend.

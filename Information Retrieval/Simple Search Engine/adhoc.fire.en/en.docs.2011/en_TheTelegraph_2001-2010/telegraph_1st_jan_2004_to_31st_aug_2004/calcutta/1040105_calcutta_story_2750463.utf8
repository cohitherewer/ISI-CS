The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Tech tool to speed up Metro work
 A STAFF REPORTER																								While Metro Railways Tollygunge-Garia extension turns the stretch along Tollys Nullah into a nightmare for residents, the authorities have hit upon a technological innovation to speed up work. We are planning to hand over downstream stretches of the canal within our project to the irrigation and waterways department for dredging within a month or two. That is much before the scheduled date, with the girders being cast using a new technology, said Ashok Gupta, Metro Rail chief engineer.																								Instead of casting the girders with support from the bed level  which would mean blocking the Nullah further  they will now be placed from the top with gantry cranes, Gupta explained, adding that casting of girders would start this month.																								In normal course, it would have taken over a year to hand over the first stretch to the irrigation and waterways department. But now, we are expecting the handover in the next few months, said a Metro official.																								But the smooth functioning of sewer lines and booster pumping stations of the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) is essential for the deadline to be maintained, officials added.																								According to Metro authorities, 700 concrete girders will be cast along the 7.5-km stretch of the project on the Nullah, out of the total 8.7 km. 																								Residents along both sides of the Nullah, in Bansdroni, Naktala and other areas, are facing a severe problem as the sewer system has all but packed up since work on the project began.																								Local residents are facing a problem as the sewer lines are getting choked, mayor Subrata Mukherjee told Metro. Angry residents had recently set up roadblocks and lodged complaints with the authorities.																								Residents of seven wards have borne the brunt, with lanes and bylanes overflowing. Matters have worsened over the past three weeks with the boosting pumps of the Ganga Action Plan not functioning properly, said Anita Kar Majumdar, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 113.																								She said pumping out the water would be no more than a temporary reprieve for thousands of families in Bansdronis Bidhan Palli, Naskar Para, Adi Ganga and other areas. 																								The waste water is even entering houses by the canal, alleged Biren Ghosh, CPM councillor of ward 111.

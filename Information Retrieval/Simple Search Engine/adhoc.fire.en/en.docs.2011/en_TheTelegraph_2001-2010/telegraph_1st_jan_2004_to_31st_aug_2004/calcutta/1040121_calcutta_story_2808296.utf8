The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Tax to fill empty state coffers
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should a toll be imposed on cars using the new flyovers, instead of a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles? More letters will be published next week				 Pricey path: The  citys newest flyover on AJC Bose Road  Satyen Biswas, 
																		Behala.																																																														Yes, it is necessary to impose a toll tax on all vehicles using the new flyovers. The government of West Bengal has been suffering from a financial crisis for a long time. This tax will help mitigate the crisis.									

Stuti Agarwal, 
																		Beliaghata.																																																														Levying of a blanket annual tax is highly unfair to vehicles not plying on them. Therefore, private vehicles and taxis should not be made scapegoats on account of the other modes of public transport using the flyovers on their daily routes. 									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane. 																																																														A toll should be imposed only on private cars using the new flyovers. Private car-owners can afford to pay a flyover tax. If a tax is imposed on buses and taxis, it will be an extra burden on them, as a hike in prices of petrol and diesel has already hit them hard. The government is always eager to impose a new tax, but it does not bother to collect it, which is absolutely necessary. India is a socialist country, but the theory of socialism does not prevail here, resulting in a disproportionate distribution of wealth. So, instead of imposing a flyover tax on all vehicles, it is advisable to impose it on the affluent only. The government has taken a loan to build the flyovers and they have to repay that loan within a specified period. It is our duty to help the government come out of the financial crisis. 									

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														A blanket flyover tax on all vehicles is a better idea. The damage to roads is usually by heavy vehicles like buses and minibuses. Hence, the cost of repairs and maintenance of roadways should be borne by these modes of transport, too. 									

P. Pramanik,
																		Santoshpur Avenue.																																																														The necessity of imposing a toll on cars using flyovers or the blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicular traffic will arise only if the amount is collected honestly. Proper collection and wise utilisation of the tax are the only answers to recovering the money invested in the flyovers and not imposition of a random toll on cars plying on them, which will create more congestion at the approaches.									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park. 																																																														Why should only cars be trapped and taxed, while other vehicles are allowed to go scot-free? Presumably, government cars will also be exempted. What is the rationale for such discrimination? In fact, cars are not heavy and therefore, do not cause much damage to the roads. So, either every vehicle should be taxed or the idea be given up. 									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
																		Behala.																																																														All vehicles use the flyover. The idea of imposing a toll only on cars is not logical. If only cars are to pay a toll then, for the sake of justice, other vehicles should not be allowed to use the new flyovers. Otherwise, legal problems may arise. Flyovers are constructed for smooth flow of traffic. So, all vehicles must be allowed to use them. 																																																														For maintenance of flyovers (new or old), the government incurs a recurring expenditure and the cost of the upkeep of old flyovers is comparatively high. So, it is better to charge a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles. Realisation of a tax annually will minimise harassment and wasted time on the part of the vehicle-owners.									

Kanai Saha, 
																		Gouri Bari Lane. 																																																														To avoid chaos, there should not be any discrimination in imposing toll tax on cars for using the new flyovers. It would be better if an annual tax is imposed on all vehicles.									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore. 																																																														Flyovers are used by private cars and goods vehicles like trucks, and not by public or private buses. If an annual flyover tax is imposed on all vehicles, fares will be increased and the burden will, ultimately, pass on to the passengers which, no doubt, will be unjust. Hence, instead of forcing all vehicles to pay the annual tax, only cars plying the new flyovers should be subjected to pay the tax. 									

Anil Kumar Sen, 
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.																																																														We know that the new flyovers are being made at a huge cost by the government to minimise traffic jams. As the flyovers will ensure smoother movement of vehicles and keeping in mind the financial constraints of the government, a toll must be paid by all vehicles. 									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge.																																																														The recently-constructed flyovers and those coming up in the city are the only answers to avoid traffic snarls. No one can deny this truth. Naturally, a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles will be a sensible idea, since the realisation of a toll tax at entry points will be hazardous.									

Subir Kumar Das,
																		NKC Lane.																																																														I presume that the aim of collecting a toll or a tax is to recover the cost or part of the cost of construction of the flyovers. If a toll is levied only on cars that are using the new flyovers, the rates might be higher than what a blanket charge on all vehicles would amount to. Then, the drivers may develop a tendency to avoid the flyovers. This will create extra pressure on the roads. Besides, the system of collecting toll at the entry points of flyovers is bound to create congestion and will defeat the very purpose of the flyovers. Therefore, imposing an annual tax on all vehicles is obviously a better option.									

Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna. 																																																														The cry to replace the proposed blanket annual tax structure with a flyover toll does not make sense. The viability of imposing a toll tax should be carefully studied prior to enforcing it. Once it is replaced, it will have far-reaching consequences.

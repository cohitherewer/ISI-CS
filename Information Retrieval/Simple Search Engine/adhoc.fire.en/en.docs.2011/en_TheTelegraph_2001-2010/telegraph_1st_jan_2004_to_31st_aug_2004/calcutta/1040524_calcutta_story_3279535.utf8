Sculpting has been one of the most potent forms of expression of the aesthetic sensibilities of an artist. A sculptor has a varied choice when it comes to selecting the medium of his expression. It can range from terracotta to ceramics like glass to metals like bronze. The artist goes through a candid process of creation as he moulds the raw material to lend it a shape that freezes an emotion in time. Metropolitan Art Salon presents an exhibition of sculptures by five eminent sculptors including Bipin Goswami whose sculpture in bronze appears above, Shankar Ghosh, Tapas Sarkar whose fame as a sculptor is based largely on his 30-odd giant sculptures spread over the country in sizes ranging from 13 feet to 50 feet, Sandip Chakraborty and Ram Kumar Manna whose artistic genius finds its finest expression in terracotta.

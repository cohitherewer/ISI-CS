 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 A repertoire of diversity
																								The human experience is about connecting with others. Language, therefore, plays a vital role in communicating and expressing oneself. But then the human situation is larger than words can express and hence, since time immemorial, man has been searching for newer modes of communication. Art was invented to fulfill this void. It is not only a celebration of creative expression but a unique way of communication. Akar Prakars current exhibition of graphics, prints and paintings is a repertoire of diversity and showcases the works of both veteran and upcoming artists. The list includes names like Devyani Krishna, Manjit Bawa, Amitabh Banerji, Arun Bose, Nirban Ash, Aloke Kumar Paul, Chinmoy Chatterji, Susmit Biswas, Jyotirmoy Ash, Shakti Barman and Ballari Mukherji. 																								When: Till February 10; 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: Akar Prakar Gallery, P 238 Hindustan Park

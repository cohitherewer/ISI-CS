 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sports channels ESPN and Star Sports made a return to around 3.5 lakh cable homes under city multi-system operator (MSO) Manthan, on Thursday afternoon.																								The stand-off between broadcaster ESPN Star Sports (ESS) and the MSO ended following a portion of the dues being cleared by Manthan on Thursday.																								We have been assured that all payments would be made by June 24, an ESS spokesperson said.																								The differences have been mutually resolved, was the response from Manthan. Owing to the craze surrounding Euro 2004, our operators accepted the demands of ESS, added a Manthan official.

				 Railway restrained on staff transfers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER
																								Calcutta High Court has passed an interim order restraining the Eastern Railway authorities from transferring the catering staff of their Howrah division to the Indian Railway Catering Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) with retrospective effect from April 1, 2003.
																								Justice A.K. Mitra, in his interim order, also restrained the railway from giving effect to its decision to change the service conditions of the catering staff. The matter will come up for final hearing after three weeks.
																								Appearing for 82 of a total of 1,200 catering department staff members, counsel Debjani Sengupta and Ramaprosad Sarkar told the court that the recent railway decision had sparked fears of retrenchment among the employees, on permanent service since 1957. The staff had been absorbed into the railways in 1957 by then railway minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. In early 2003, however, the railway decided to hand over its catering department to the IRCTC, a private firm.
																								It sent its catering staff a circular saying that they would have to work for IRCTC and assured them that they would continue to enjoy the benefits of permanent railway employees. 
																								Last month, however, the IRCTC told the staff that they would have to carry the identity cards issued by it and not the regular ones issued by the railway. The employees also came to know that the IRCTC was planning to hand over charge of railway catering to another private firm. We have been asked to close down the eateries on stations from January 20, they alleged in their petition.
																								The judge directed the petitioners to serve notice to both Eastern Railway and IRCTC. Railway panel advocate Uttam Majumdar said he had not been informed about the petition. However, the railway will clarify its stand at the hearing, he said.

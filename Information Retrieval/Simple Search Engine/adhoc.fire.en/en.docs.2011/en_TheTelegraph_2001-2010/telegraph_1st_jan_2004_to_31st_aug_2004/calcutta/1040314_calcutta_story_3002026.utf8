 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Legal hurdle in way of Lake wall
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A case was filed in Calcutta High Court on Friday, challenging the legal validity of the construction of a concrete embankment on both sides of Rabindra Sarobar in Dhakuria by the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT).																								The petitioners, environmental activists of south Calcutta, alleged that the CIT had violated the provisions of the Bio-Diversity Act, 2002, by constructing the concrete wall on both the banks of the Lake. 																								The case will be heard on March 15.																								Recently, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board had furnished a report before the green bench of Calcutta High Court, saying that the Sarobar water was unfit for bathing, that it was contaminated and that the government should ask the people not to use it.																								To keep the Lake water pollution-free, the CIT had undertaken a programme to construct a wall on both sides of the water-body. Accordingly, construction was carried out on the banks. But, according to an environmental expert, the quality of the Lake water would further deteriorate after its completion.																								The petitioners contended that the strengthening of the embankment would increase chances of malaria spreading in the surrounding areas. 																								Some of the species living on the muddy banks of the waterbody, like snakes and frogs, consume mosquito larvae. With the construction of the embankment they will disappear and the entire area around the Lake will become infested with mosquitoes, the petitioner alleged.																								Asked to comment on the issue, environmental activist Subhash Dutta said on Saturday that according to the provisions of the Bio-Diversity Act, 2002, it is illegal to strengthen the embankment of water-bodies and it goes against the ecological system.																								Some of the creatures and insects living in and around water-bodies take care of the ecological balance of the surrounding areas and their droppings improve the quality of the water, said Dutta.																								Legal action against the construction of walls has posed a serious problem for the CIT. But the department would have to reconsider the matter if the construction of the wall deteriorates the quality of the water, said a CIT spokesperson.Clarification																								The article Brand wagon published in Good Life on March 13 says that the sale at Pantaloons is on till March 19. The last date of the sale is March 14.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Irish brew, too hot to handle
Colin Farrell on a signing spree and (top) Pierce Brosnan spreads his wings																								Los Angeles may be notorious for its pollution, but Hollywood is sure looking green. Its no secret that Ireland has always been a fount of artistic genius (the literary credits need no mention), and it comes as no surprise that the Celtics have thrived in other creative pursuits, doing what comes naturally on the silver screen.																								Here is a look at some of the big names from the Emerald Isle that have endeared themselves to us through the past few years:																								Pierce Brosnan																								James Bond has to be at the head of the all-Irish star list. Calcuttas love affair with the man known as Remington Steele had started with the coming of cable and the dawn of the detective show. The passion is still as powerful today, with a film as shamelessly corny as Laws of Attraction still drawing considerable crowds in the multiplexes, all presumably on the strength of its leading man. Born in Navan, Country Meath, Ireland in 1953, he will also appear on our small screen on August 22, at 8 pm, with Mars Attacks (HBO).																								That apart, the will-he-wont-he-play-Bond game continues, with the next film in the pipeline (and Quentin Tarantino inching towards the directors chair).																								Brosnan may be showing his age a little, but who cares? He seems to get more and more attractive with every wrinkle (sound proof: the oooohs among girls just out to have fun at INOX).																								Colin Farrell																								Then there is the angry young man who has been hailed as one of the biggest things to hit tinsel town in some time. The Dubliner is making a telly splash next week with The Recruit (starring Al Pacino, on August 20) and Phone Booth (August 21), both scheduled for broadcast on Star Movies.																								The flawed hero Hollywood has been looking for is what they are calling him. The angst may come from a wannabe rock-star psyche: he had auditioned for a berth in the Irish boyband Boyzone, but was turned down.																								Daniel-Day Lewis																								He may not have been born in Ireland, but this A-list actor has adopted it as his home, becoming a citizen in 1993, and has settled down in County Wicklow. The kinship seems natural, as the Oscar-winning star has played a number of Irishmen through the years on screen. Calcutta recently saw him as The Butcher in Martin Scorseses Gangs of New York. Notorious for becoming completely engrossed in his characters, Arthur Millers son-in-law is the man behind films like My Left Foot, Last of the Mohicans, and The Crucible. (Wrong foot: turned down the part of Aragorn in Lord of the Rings).Liam Neeson																								He caught everyones eye as a German, but Liam Neeson is actually Irish, born in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, 1952. The 1992 role in Steven Spielbergs Schindlers List won him an Academy Award nomination for best actor, and instant acclaim. The man with a towering screen presence has also starred in Michael Collins, Star-Wars: The Phantom Menace and Les Miserable. Now married to Natasha Richardson, his list of ex-girlfriends is as impressive as his filmography: Julia Roberts, Barbra Streisand, Brooke Shields...																								Kenneth Branagh																								The actor from Belfast was last seen in town as the bumbling Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Branagh is set to be back in 2005, with the release of Mission Impossible 3. Has starred in a number of screen adaptations of Shakespeare, including Hamlet and Loves Labour Lost.

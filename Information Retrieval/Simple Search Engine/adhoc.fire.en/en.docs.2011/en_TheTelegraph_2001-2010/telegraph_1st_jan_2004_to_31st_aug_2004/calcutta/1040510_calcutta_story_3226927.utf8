 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Hunt for clue to murder of factory guard
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mystery shrouds the death of the gatekeeper of a factory at Belgachhia, in the Liluah police station area. The body of Jang Bahadur Lama, 63, was recovered by the police from a well in the factory on Saturday evening. 																								Police said Lama had been tied with a rope and hanged in a well. There were no injury marks on his body, though. We think he was strangled with the rope and then hanged. There must have been several assailants, police said. We are waiting for the post-mortem report. 																								A case of unnatural death has been started. A few persons have been remanded in custody for interrogation, said an officer of Liluah police station.																								Inquiries revealed that Lama had been gatekeeper of Kalidurga Engineering for years and was popular. We have interrogated the factory owner. He was shocked to learn about the murder, the official said.																								Since January, similar cases of factory gatekeepers getting murdered have been reported from Golabari and Malipanchghara police station areas, adjacent to Liluah.

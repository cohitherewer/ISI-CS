 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Wifes lover electrocuted
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A 30-year-old man was electrocuted on Wednesday night by the husband of a woman he was having an affair with. 																								Lalmohan Das body was found in a pond beside the home of Sulata Mondal, his paramour, in Uluberia on Thursday morning. Bikash Mondal, Sulatas husband, was arrested on Friday. 																								After the body was recovered, it seemed a case of suicide. But the truth came out when Mondal confessed that he had killed Das by electrifying the iron grille of a window in his house, said an officer of Uluberia police station. 																								Superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya said Mondal had employed a novel way to eliminate Das. He had even succeeded in hoodwinking the police, almost.																								Mondal, a businessman, had married Sulata 10 years ago. They dont have any children, and that was a constant source of worry. 																								Mondal would have to stay away from home for days to tend to his business. And Sulata got involved in a relationship with neighbour Das. 																								It was learnt that almost every night, Das would come to Mondals home to meet Sulata. Neighbours said he would wait outside the window and talk to the woman for hours. 																								Mondal came to know of the affair. He had warned both Das and Sulata to stop seeing each other, but neither paid any heed. 																								The two carried on as usual, which, Mondal told police during interrogation, had put him under mental stress. 																								Finding no option, he decided to kill Das. On Wednesday night, Mondal had sent his wife to her parents. Then, he attached a 220-volt wire to the iron grille of the window that was the tryst point, an officer said.																								Das, as on other days, came to meet Sulata. As soon as he touched the grille, he recoiled and fell into the pond behind, where he drowned. Mondal was arrested only after neighbours informed police about the Das-Sulata affair.

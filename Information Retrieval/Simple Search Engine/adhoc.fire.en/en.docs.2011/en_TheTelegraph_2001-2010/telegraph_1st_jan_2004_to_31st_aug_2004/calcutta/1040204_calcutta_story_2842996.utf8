The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 After sunset, its status horribilis
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Sushma Swaraj just needs to hire a taxi from Medical College and Hospital (MCH)  preferably at night  to get to know the place into which she has promised to inject Rs 100 crore.																								A Union health ministry team visited Calcutta a few weeks before Union finance minister Jaswant Singh confirmed on Tuesday what Swaraj had promised last month  aid to upgrade MCH to All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) standards. After being shown the best possible face of MCH, the team went back, happy with its ability to attain AIIMS standards if it got Rs 100 crore.																								But time spent on the campus  a few days after Swarajs promise and a few days before Singhs announcement  revealed that it was in the clutches of several organised rackets that packed enough punch to turn the citys AIIMS into just another state-run hospital.																								Ask Sachchidananda Sinha, former MCH superintendent beaten up on campus by supporters of a former CPM legislator in 2002. A hospital where the superintendent is not safe cannot be safe for anyone, a senior official said.																								A fortnight ago, relatives of a patient alleging delay in treatment took him away  and ransacked the records of all other patients  from the burns ward. We can make up for the lost records but its difficult to work without feeling secure, said one of the nurses who witnessed the rampage.																								But the campus waits till night to really come alive. From extortionist taxi drivers to Group-D staff who have been known to open fire during drunken brawls or slash women interns on the stretch between the hostel to the wards, the hospital has hidden many warts from Swaraj and Singh.																								From the broker of beds to the taxi driver, who asked for Rs 350 to go to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital last Friday, everyone here lords it over the poor patient. The hospitals location adds to the problem. The red-light district (Premchand Boral Street) invariably sends drunks, rowdies and toughs with patients, complain doctors. The eight liquor and ganja dens within a one-kilometre radius add to the problem, they say.																								The authorities are aware of some of the problems. A recent probe into the racket in arranging beds has resulted in stopping the practice of admissions on trolleys, said MCH superintendent Rabindranath Chatterjee.

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE				 	 Christopher Eagar: Missing the minister																								If Christopher Eagar thought an appointment was good enough to meet a minister at Writers Buildings, he was horribly wrong.																								The UK-based writer stood waiting for over two-and-a-half hours on the pavement outside Writers. By the time the visitors slip finally reached the table of Subhas Chakraborty, with whom Eagar had a meeting scheduled, the transport minister had left.																								The writer of cultural and human development wanted to meet the minister to seek special permission to travel around the state on a three-wheeler. After finishing the tour, I wanted to take the vehicle with me, said Eagar.																								An employee of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees information and cultural affairs department, who was supposed to send the visitors slip (no. 22062) to the transport ministers chamber, refused to act during his tiffin break and Eagar was kept waiting on the street outside, under the sweltering sun, from 12.45 pm.																								After waiting for about half-an-hour, I inquired about my slip. I was told to wait for another hour, as the tiffin break was on. I requested that the ministers office be contacted, but my pleas fell on deaf ears, recalled Eagar. I inquired again around 2.15 pm. I was told to keep waiting, as a number of visitors slips had piled up at the counter. Finally, at 3.15 pm, I was allowed in, said Eagar.																								He went to the ministers chamber, only to be told that Chakraborty had left for the day. Eagar briefed Nikhil Pal, confidential assistant to the transport minister, about his taste of non-cooperation at Writers. On Thursday morning, he (Eagar) had called me up and sought an appointment with the transport minister. I had told him to come on Friday afternoon, around 2.30 pm. The minister waited for him, but Eagar had come to meet him not as a VIP but as a common visitor, said Pal.																								An embarrassed information and cultural affairs department secretary Arun Bhattacharya, who is also secretary to the chief minister, apologised to Eagar over phone and assured him of an immediate appointment with the transport minister. It is a shame for us. The employees who were on duty at the counter should have acted promptly. I shall definitely take up the matter, Bhattacharya later said.																								Eagar, along with brothers Jeff and Steve, tours different countries to collect material for their books. They have already visited 60 countries and this year is dedicated to India, from Bengal to Punjab. We came to Calcutta in 1999 and were delighted with the rich cultural heritage here. So, we planned a long trip here to learn more about Bengal and write about it, said Eagar.																								He wont forget in a hurry the lesson he learnt at the seat of Bengals do-it-now governance.

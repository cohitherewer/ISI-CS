The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Fightback cry in despair 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Down, but not out. Even as the fire was being extinguished and the last embers were leaping back to life, the owners of Dasgupta amp; Co were resolute that this fire would not wipe out Bengals oldest bookshop.																								The loss is difficult to assess and express in words. But we will fight back, vowed Ranjan Dasgupta, one of the co-owners of the shop, who was trying to help fire-fighters in their bid to minimise damage.																								The bookshop was set up in 1886 by Girish Chandra Dasgupta, who had apparently spent months scouting for a suitable spot.																								We have come a long way since then and this fire cannot stop us, said Ranjan, standing inside the store plunged into darkness following the fire.																								The store boasted a collection of 50,000 books. Most of it was damaged by the time dusk set in on Sunday.																								Members of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild of Calcutta said Dasgupta amp; Co was not only the oldest bookshop in Bengal, with the largest collection of reference books for higher education, it had also played the pivotal role in forming the guild.																								Prabir Dasgupta, youngest among five brothers, who died a few years ago, had founded the guild in 1975.																								He was also the first treasurer of the guild and the Dasgupta bookstores contribution towards the formation of the guild was enormous, said Kalyan Shah, president of the guild. We will extend all help to them to rebuild the store, he added.																								The shop on Calcuttas book street has been the haunt of generations of students and scholars. Many scholars, like Sukumar Sen, Shushobhan Sarkar and others, were regular visitors at our store, said Ranjan. There have been so many others, I cannot recollect right now, he added.																								Senior bureaucrats from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have been visiting the store regularly, added one of the employees.																								The store started off with a small collection of books but grew in size and stature over the decades to build a bank of loyal customers seeking reference books. If anyone was looking for a wide range of reference books, Dasgupta amp; Co would be the obvious destination, said Shah.																								This apart, Dasgupta amp; Co is also one of the largest suppliers of books to different libraries across the country. We have a wide range of books, from Pratham Bhag to a modern-day bestseller, added one of the Dasgupta brothers.																								The bookshop found itself in the limelight earlier this month, when it hosted a film crew led by actor Victor Banerjee and Charlie Chaplins granddaughter Kiera, for an extensive shooting schedule.																								It was all bright lights and book talk then, with Kiera thrilled with the quaint shop and Victor feasting on the treasure trove of knowledge.By Sunday evening, the lights had all gone out and the pages had turned to pulp at the beloved book destination.It was such an old shop and used to store different kinds of books. It was a favourite of Bengalis settled abroad as well, as it used to regularly supply books overseas The fire must have been an accident, but it is very sad Sunil Gangopadhyay, writerIts like a personal loss. I even crossed the shop on Sunday afternoon During our Presidency College days, we often used to spend time at Dasgupta... The shop is a vital part of the College Street tradition. I am very sad Nabaneeta Dev Sen, writerIts the loss of Dickens Old Curiosity Shop for Calcuttans. It is an institution, more than a bookstore. When I was shooting there this month, I discovered what a beehive of knowledge the upstairs was Victor Banerjee, actor

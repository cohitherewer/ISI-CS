 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Melodies of 19th century Calcutta
Having ushered in the Bengali New Year with great enthusiasm, the time is now right for us to rebuild our ties with the past and indulge in pleasant memories of days gone by. To help revive this nostalgia, Jalsaghar and Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture present Sabeki Kolkatar Bangla Gaan, an evening of old Bengali songs that were prevalent in 19th century Calcutta. The programme, featuring compositions of Swami Vivekananda, Nidhu Babu, Dashurathi Ray, Ramprasad, Gopal Udey, Sridhar Kathak and other illustrious personalities of the time, will be rendered in dhrupad, tappa, thumri and top-khayal styles by Gopal Chattopadhyay, Siddheswara Mukherjee and Chandidas Mal. With songs sung in antiquated tunes, and capturing the moods and melodies of an age that is all but forgotten, this occasion promises to be an opportunity for music connoisseurs and old timers to revel in the richness of a musical heritage that was once Calcuttas own.

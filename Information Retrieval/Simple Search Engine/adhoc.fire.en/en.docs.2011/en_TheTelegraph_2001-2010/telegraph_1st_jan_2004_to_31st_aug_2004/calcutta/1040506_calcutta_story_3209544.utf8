 Santanu RaySantanu RayHis mothers prolonged eye-related illness and subsequent demise only strengthened his resolve to raise awareness regarding body and eye donation, work for thalassaemic children, and on the whole, try and make a difference to society.																								Santanu Ray started Howrah Angan in 1985 to conduct small cultural programmes held in neighbourhood clubs on occasions like Durga Puja and Rabindra Jayanti. With time, the social activities grew till it started functioning as a full-fledged social organisation.																								Through Angan, Ray is actively involved in organising blood donation camps for children affected with thalassaemia, thalassaemia detection, free eye check-up and medicine distribution, and camps for body and eye donation. Angan also brings out guidebooks on thalassaemia with the help of haematologists. 																								The eye donation and check-up programmes find a special place in Rays heart since his mother lost her eyesight in a failed operation and he had to run from pillar to post for treatment. In as many cases as possible, Ray tries to arrange for eye surgeries at a minimal cost.																								Kids, feels Ray, must be the first ones to be made aware of the social and environmental issues. With his group of faithfuls  Angan had started out with only a handful but it now has around 30 full-time members with neighbours and friends occasionally chipping in  and through skits and music, Ray presents programmes and demonstrations in various schools. He takes a lot of pride in his compositions and plays. 																								Apart from Angan, this Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) employee finds time to spare to work for an orphan house in Uluberia.																								Born and brought up in Ramrajatala in Howrah, where he currently lives with his wife and daughter, Ray always had a knack for dramatics. He joined Shilpi Shongshod, a freewheeling body of performers, in his childhood. Later, in his college days, he graduated to a professional theatre group called Natyaranga and devoted himself to acting.																								The municipal job in 1995 threatened to curtail his other activities. But till date, he feels he has been able to maintain a balance.																								Rays one unfulfilled dream remains recording an album with his musical compositions. Several offers came his way over the years but family problems invariably crept up always. It may now be a little late, but the man in his mid-40s retains his optimism.																								A growing concern for Ray is social work taking on political colour. He does not want to be affiliated to any political party to continue with the work that he is doing, but that, sadly, is easier said than done.

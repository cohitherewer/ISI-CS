	Most burning ghats in the city are very ill-maintained and pose serious problems to visitors. The river bank at Siriti, Kashipur, Nimtala and Kashi Mitra burning ghats turn slippery during the monsoon. As a result, relatives performing the last rites find it difficult to reach the waterfront. The bank should be cemented to provide a better foothold. The condition of Keoratala is comparatively better and people are saved the trouble of negotiating the slushy surface. The ghats may also be beautified with gardens and seating arrangements can be bettered. The area surrounding the burning ghat should be freed of hoodlums with the help of the local police.

	The condition of roads and traffic in Calcutta is getting worse by the day. Till very recently, a manhole was lying open on a footpath in front of a building on AJC Bose Road. Though a railing had been placed on it, stray animals could easily fall into the pit. During a second visit to the area, I found the manhole filled with garbage. Is that a solution?

	It is noticed that a bandh called by even an insignificant political party affects the daily life of Calcuttans. Although many government buses run, people prefer not to venture out in the absence of private buses, for fear of getting stranded in some part of the city. However, during the Trinamul Congress-sponsored bandh on August 2, some Left Front supporters were seen on the roads trying to bring normalcy. But this work should clearly be left to the law enforcers. The political parties should introspect on whether bandhs succeed in achieving any objective.

	It is quite unfortunate that the legendary magician P.C. Sarkar (Jr) has never been bestowed with any public honour that befits his position. This despite his immese popularity all over the country and even abroad. His shows register phenomenal turnouts whenever he camps at Mahajati Sadan. His efforts to revive the popularity of magic should be recognised by the government.

	The stretches from Police Training School to Hastings and from Fort William to Kidderpore are terribly dirty. When will the authorities take notice?

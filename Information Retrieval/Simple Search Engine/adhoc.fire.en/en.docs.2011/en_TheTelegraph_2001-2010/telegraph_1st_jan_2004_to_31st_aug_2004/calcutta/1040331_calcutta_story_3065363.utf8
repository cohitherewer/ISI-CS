The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Tramcar tale of pain and gain, while other metros party
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Next time youre in Hong Kong, hire a tramcar fitted with a bar and have a party. The organisers have also thoughtfully provided a dance-floor. With music, drinks and dance, you and 24 of your guests can have a blast through the night, as the tramcar trundles through a city asleep, all for $230 (HK), excluding food and drinks, of course. 																								A recent issue of Time would have us believe that the idea is catching up because noisy parties, especially late at night, disturb neighbours and spoil otherwise convivial ties with them. Therefore, across the world, more and more people are taking their parties outside  quite literally, to the street. At Newcastle, one can even hire a fire engine, which can accommodate just 10 guests besides the crew for a party!																								Calcutta, too, has tried to be innovative. A heritage tram was introduced on Sunday mornings to take people on a ride through the north and central parts of the city, including a stop at Jorasanko to pay routine obeisance to Tagore. 																								The trip failed to take off, it seems, because not enough citizens were up to the task of waking early on Sunday mornings and hopping on to the tram by 9 am. 																								The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) also let out a few tramcars for carrying wedding guests but the idea, without much of a facelift for the tramcars, left most people cold. 																								With that, the innovative spirit of the CTC appears to have petered out. Tram enthusiasts from Melbourne Down Under had prodded it to agree to a Tram Yatra (or Jatra, if you please), which, too, failed to sustain the enthusiasm for the antiquated transport system.																								The city has been grappling with the existential question for the past decade and a half. To phase them out or not is the tantalising question that the authorities are unable to answer. 																								Yes they say in one breath, allowing the CTC to run buses as an alternative, only to negate it in another. One day, the transport minister states that the government will withdraw tramcars from busy streets, but the very next moment one sees a massive track relaying project take off on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, disrupting traffic. The crores sunk in to bring tram tracks to the road level would indicate that trams are here to stay, at least for the time being.																								That would please many and give an ulcer to an equal number, one suspects. A section of the school-going children and their escorts, the old and the retired and, of course, visitors here for a short period, would all swear by the tramcar. 																								Motorists, on the other hand, would swear at the slow-moving cars that slow down traffic, imperiously stop at intersections and appear at the most inconvenient moments, forcing drivers to desperately graze past buses and rickshaws.																								What one fails to understand, though, is the companys reluctance to get out of the metro. Calcuttas nightmare can well be the small towns delight. 																								If the CTC plays its cards well, there is no reason why tramcars cannot make themselves useful in towns like Kalyani, Durgapur and Siliguri. Indeed, the CTC should be able to use its expertise and experience to reach out to small towns across the country, from Imphal to Indore, and set up subsidiary companies to run the systems, in collaboration with the respective state government or municipal body. 																								Dispersing manpower and tramcars from Calcutta would provide the CTC with the flexibility it currently lacks and, quite possibly, make it profitable.																								In the city, the CTC can experiment by running school specials in the morning and afternoon. It can think of operating a night-long service from Howrah and Sealdah. 																								It can also remodel some of the tramcars and hire them out for parties. Make them air-conditioned, provide for a bar and a toilet, change the floor to allow dancing and arrange for music  and parties on the move can certainly become the latest craze. A joint venture with some city hotels could take care of the funds required for the makeover.

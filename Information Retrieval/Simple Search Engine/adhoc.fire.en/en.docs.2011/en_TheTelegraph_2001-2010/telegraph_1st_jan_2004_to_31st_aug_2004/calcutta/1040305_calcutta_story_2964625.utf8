 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Legal sop for leprosy
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A move to modify the laws of the land by acting Chief Justice of India J.N. Bhatt will eventually enable leprosy patients to return to the mainstream. Age-old legal provisions bar leprosy patients from exercising their rights and from leading a normal life.																								However, recent developments, particularly Bhatts decision to initiate suo motu proceedings on March 16, following a request by a dermatalogist to change biased laws, are likely to modify matters.																								The Jamnagar specialist, K.M. Acharya, stressed in a letter to the Chief Justice of India that modern science has a cure for leprosy and no longer should patients be ostracised. Acharya raised the following points on how the law is biased against leprosy patients: Under the provision of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954, leprosy has been mentioned as an incurable and virulent disease and a ground for judicial separation and divorce. Even the Christian Marriage Act and the Muslim Marriage Act permit separation and divorce on grounds of leprosy. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, specifies that a leprosy patient cannot inherit a share of ancestral property and cannot even bequeath any property to his heirs, because he is considered to have undergone social death. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, does not permit leprosy patients to acquire driving licences. Election rules do not allow them to contest polls.																								Taking cognisance of the matter, Justice Bhatt observed that it is a fit and appropriate case for entertaining as a public interest litigation and the letter is directed to be treated as suo motu PIL under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.																								The attorney-general of India and the advocates-general of all states have been asked to send their observations and opinion before March 16, the day the case will come up for hearing in the Supreme Court.

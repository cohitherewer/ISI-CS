 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Sleaze-veil slur, party peeved
 A STAFF REPORTER																								First-time MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar allegedly made the mistake of keeping the party leadership in the dark about husband Avtar Singhs growing involvement with the underworld. 																								On Thursday, CPM mandarins said Sikdar would be formally asked to explain her conduct to the leadership, which decided to shield her from the after-effects of Singhs arrest from his Merlin Park hotel in Salt Lake. 																								State CPM secretary Anil Biswas had defended Sikdar on Wednesday, but officials said the leadership had already made it clear to Sikdar that they were unhappy with her failure to inform them of Singhs dark deeds and the transformation of Merlin Park hotel into a sleaze hub. 																								A couple of times, the party, upon receiving reports from different quarters, had asked her to dissociate herself from the hotel, but she did not respond, the officials said.																								The CPM, it is learnt, will defend Sikdar because she is a party MP and Parliament is in session. 																								Biswas and other senior leaders are now in possession of reports on how Sikdar visited the hotel on a regular basis, how she oversaw its functioning and her knowledge of her husbands racket.																								On a few occasions, according to reports, Sikdar had tried to rein in Singh but failed because he was too far gone. 																								Having failed to bring her husband around, Sikdar chose to keep to herself the details of Singhs links with criminals. 																								The CPM state secretariat and state committee, which will meet on Friday at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street, are likely to institute the promised inquiry into the Singh affair. 																								The partys North 24-Parganas district secretary Amitava Bose, also a member of the state secretariat, is likely to head the truth committee.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will skip Fridays state committee meeting as he is not in town. But it is almost certain that the secretariat members will take up the Sikdar issue with Bose and make a final decision on the constitution of the fact-finding committee. 																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas on Thursday refused to discuss the Sikdar episode. 																								He also refused to respond to the Trinamul Youth Congress rally plans at SSKM Hospital on Saturday to protest Avtar Singhs treatment at the hospitals Woodburn Ward, reserved for VIPs.

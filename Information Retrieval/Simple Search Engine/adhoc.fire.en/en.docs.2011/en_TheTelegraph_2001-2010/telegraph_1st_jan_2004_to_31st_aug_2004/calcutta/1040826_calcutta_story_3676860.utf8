 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Avtar tested for aches
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After seven days at SSKM Hospital, complaining of various aches and pains, Avtar Singh got the first taste of real pain on Wednesday, with doctors subjecting him to a battery of tests to diagnose what exactly was wrong.																								The husband of athlete-turned-MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, given a fit certificate by a medical board on Tuesday, stayed back in hospital after complaining of abdominal pain.																								Treatment started on Tuesday evening itself and soon, nurses fitted him with an intravenous fluid bottle. Since we did not know what was wrong, we put him on fluids immediately. Dinner was out, explained a doctor.																								If Tuesday night was spent minus solids, Wednesday morning saw a medical board recommending that Avtar undergo an endoscopy.																								A team of gastro-enterologists inserted an endoscope through his mouth, but did not find anything wrong. Later, the doctors decided to conduct an ultra- sonography of the abdomen to see if they had missed something.																								Since he has been complaining of pain each time we decide to release him, we did not take any chances, said a member of the medical team.																								The days investigations continued for Avtar with a series of blood tests and then a liver function test, which threw up some abnormal readings. But the doctors informed Avtar that he was in absolutely good shape and need not worry about his health.																								We decided to let him stay on for at least another day as he is still on fluids. Tonight, we plan to take him off his liquid diet, said Santanu Tripathi, SSKM medical superintendent and vice-principal.																								In Midnapore, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said he has given police specific instructions on the Avtar case. The law will take its own course, Bhattacharjee said.																								If Avtar does not throw any further tantrums till Thursday, a police team should escort him out of SSKM Hospital to the confines of Barrackpore sub-jail, where he will be interrogated for his links with the sleaze world.

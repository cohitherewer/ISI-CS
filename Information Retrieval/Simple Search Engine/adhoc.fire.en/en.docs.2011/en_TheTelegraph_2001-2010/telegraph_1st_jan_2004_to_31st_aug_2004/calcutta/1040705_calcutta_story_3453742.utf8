The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Cheaper irons, fairway flock
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 SWING TIME: Indrajit Bhalotia, who has given the game a push at the grassroots level. Picture by Pabitra Das																								What drives the likes of Sergio Garcia, Retief Goosen and Hale Irwin on the pro Tour can now drive your fairway dreams too, and  whats more  it doesnt cost the moon to tee off anymore.																								With equipment prices being steadily marked down by major manufacturers to stay competitive in a cut-throat global race, the elitist tag attached to golf is dropping out of sight as a clutch of kids with affordable kits take to the greens.																								Yes, cost of gear was the main roadblock, which is lifting rapidly. Earlier, one needed to shell out Rs 40,000 or 50,000 just to get started. Now, a basic kit (comprising three metalwoods, nine irons and a putter) comes for as little as Rs 14,000, with a bag thrown in, says Brandon DSouza, president, Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), which drives the Indian tour.																								DSouza feels better affordability and easier availability of world-class equipment should serve to explode the myth that golf is only for the well-heeled. And international golf-gear majors are keen to drive home the advantage.																								Sunday saw TaylorMade launch its much-anticipated R7 Quad driver in the city though a demo day at Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) and a repeat driving demo is scheduled for Tuesday.																								And kids in Calcutta, eager to hit the ball longer and straighter than ever before, are all flocking up to birdie. There is a refreshing enthusiasm in the air of late and more and more youngsters are joining the fray, observes Indrajit Bhalotia, who has been at the heart of a putt-push that has seen young city-based golfers pulling their weight consistently in national tourneys.																								Bhalotia has under his wings no less than 120 trainees, from five to 17, at RCGC and Tollygunge Club, including 20 in the special programme of the Indian Golf Union for the east zone. Quality-wise, we are right up there and our top 15 juniors can hold their own if pitted against their top 15 counterparts in Delhi, stresses Bhalotia, past winner of the All-India Matchplay.																								The fairway fiesta is translating into rising footfalls and conversion at the exclusive golf gear boutiques in town as well. We have recorded a 70-80 per cent rise in sales over the past two years, as parents no longer stonewall their wards aspirations to swing a club, says Vivek Jairath, who runs the RCGC Pro Shop and Golf Stoppe on Garcha Road.																								These days, you dont need to fetch equipment from the US any longer. You get the same TaylorMade, Ping, Callaway or Mizuno stuff right here and virtually with the same price tag, adds Jairaths partner Arun Nanda.

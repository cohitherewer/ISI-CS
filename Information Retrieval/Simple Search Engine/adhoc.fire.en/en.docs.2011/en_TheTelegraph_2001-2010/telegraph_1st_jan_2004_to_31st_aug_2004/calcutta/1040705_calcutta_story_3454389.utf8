																																																		The government will restrict installation of deep tubewells in Calcutta after 2006, when construction of all seven underground reservoirs are completed, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya has said. The underground water level has been falling rapidly due to rampant installation of deep tubewells in different parts of Calcutta. But after two years, no one will require underground water, as we will be able to supply adequate drinking water by that time, he said.																																																								alcutta requires 334 million gallons of drinking water every day, of which 270 million gallons is supplied by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and other agencies. The seven new reservoirs are coming up in Garfa, Ranikuthi, Bagmari, Kalighat, Watgunge, Jorabagan and Kasba, apart from the existing ones at Mohd Ali Park, Raja Subodh Mullick Square, Auckland Place and Behala Chowrasta.

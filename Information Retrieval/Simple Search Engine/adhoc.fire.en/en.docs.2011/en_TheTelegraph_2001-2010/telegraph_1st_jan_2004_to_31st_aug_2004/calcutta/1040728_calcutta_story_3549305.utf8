The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Short of 50? Courses aplenty
 																											- Colleges offer study options to HS examinees who scored low A STAFF REPORTER 																								One nail-biting wait is over, but another has just begun.																								With the Higher Secondary (HS) results being announced on Tuesday, the countdown to the admission conundrum started ticking loud and clear.																								Of the total 387,329 candidates who appeared for HS 2004, only 38,020 secured 60 per cent marks and above, against 38, 566 last year.																								The number of second and third division achievers has swelled since HS 2003. So, the going will be tough for the 95,566 students who scored between 45 and 60 per cent, and tougher still for the 91,911 who managed a third division (between 30 per cent and 45 per cent).																								The spotlight may be on the top scorers and their struggle to pick the perfect course in a college of their choice, but the queues outside the windows offering general courses will, of course, meander much longer.																								And this is where the long list of colleges offering general courses provides some hope for those lagging behind in the marks marathon.																								In accordance with Calcutta University norms, all honours courses have stipulated their cut-offs, pro vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said on Tuesday. 																								There are options open for all those who have not performed up to the mark. Any student who has cleared the exams is eligible to apply for seats in the general-degree courses in colleges affiliated to the university. They can gain an edge by supplementing such a course with a diploma or degree in computers, suggested Das.																								For those determined to pursue an honours degree, distance education remains the best bet. 																								We have a whole range of under-graduate honours courses to offer all students who have passed HS 2004, but have not secured high marks. All regular honours courses in subjects like English, history, geography, physics, chemistry and mathematics are open to them, said Suravi Banerjee, vice-chancellor of Netaji Open University. 																								Moreover, we have numerous diploma courses and vocational courses, she added.																								Candidates, however, should rush their applications, as the last date has passed but the university is considering HS pass-outs on a first-come-first-served basis. For those who have scored 50 per cent and above, Rabindra Bharati University provides a good platform to pursue higher studies, said vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee. There are a number of general subjects in distance education, she added.																								Vidyasagar University, Kalyani University and Burdwan University have all set up camp offices in town to woo those falling short of the 50 per cent mark.

 A STAFF REPORTER 																								After 15 long years, patients entering the ENT department of SSKM Hospital can do so without the fear of being refused or referred to any other hospital. 																								For the past few days, thanks to the initiative of the authorities, who managed to convince the cardio-thoracic department to part with the equipment, the ENT department has started free endoscopy services.																								Doctors explained that during endoscopy, probes of various shapes and sizes fitted with a video camera are inserted into the throat. 																								These reveal on a monitor the exact location of a foreign body or an ulcer inside the respiratory tract or the intestine. This helps a surgeon arrive at a decision. 																								Two days ago, a seven-year-old boy, who was turned away from three hospitals  in Kandi, Behrampore and NRS Medical College and Hospital  finally got some help at the ENT department of SSKM Hospital. 																								An examination revealed that he had swallowed part of a broken flute. He was finally brought to SSKM Hospital.																								The boy seemed to be in considerable distress and somehow, the family had the impression that they would be referred to another hospital. But we assured them that nothing of that sort would happen and he would get all the help here, said Arunavo Sengupta, an ENT specialist at SSKM Hospital.																								The doctors then performed an endoscopy and traced the broken flute near the trachea. The doctors brought the piece out. After some rest, the boy has now gone back home to Murshidabad and is scheduled to come for a follow-up soon. If there was any further delay, things would have taken a turn for the worse, Sengupta observed.																								Last Monday, the doctors handled another tricky case. An elderly patient from Bongaon had swallowed his dentures, which got stuck in the oesophagus. In yet another case, a minor boy had swallowed a coin, which was also taken out through endoscopy by the team of doctors.																								Earlier, all the cases used to be sent to Calcutta National Medical College or other private hospitals that have endoscopy facilities. As a result, the reputation of the hospital suffered a lot, but strangely, no one bothered to do anything about it, a senior hospital employee said. 																								Newly-appointed hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi noticed that the equipment with the cardio-thoracic surgery department could be put to better use at the ENT department. 																								The hospital superintendent called an emergency meeting, at which the issue was settled amicably. The hospital hopes to utilise more such equipment lying under-utilised in various departments.

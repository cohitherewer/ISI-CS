 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Purse plea to flyover bank
 																											- Clock ticks on funds, Park Street project way behind schedule A STAFF REPORTER																								The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), which is financing the four flyover projects in the city, will be urged to extend the March 2004 deadline, as construction of the Park Street flyover is running behind schedule, officials said on Tuesday.																								We will have to put in the request because there is no hope of completing the flyover within the deadline, the officials said.																								According to the agreement between the government and JBIC, the financier will close the bank account, putting an end to all financial transactions, on May 29. So, all deals, including claims for reimbursement, will have to be completed by then. And the work must be completed by March, as at least two months are required after completion of the project for formalities involved with financial settlements.																								As per the agreement, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the monitoring agency for the flyovers, will first make the payments, which will be reimbursed by the JBIC. So, if the bank winds up its account in May, officials fear a large portion of the funds might be lost.																								We have completed the Gariahat and Beckbagan flyovers in time and construction of the Lockgate Road flyover will also be completed within the March 2004 deadline, but there is little hope for the Park Street flyover, as we are at least two months behind schedule. As of now, we need at least four months more to complete it. So, if the JBIC does not extend the deadline, we could be in trouble, admitted officials of the transport department.																								Meanwhile, the JBIC has expressed its dissatisfaction over the delay in implementing the project. In a letter to the transport department recently, the bank pointed out that it boasts international goodwill for its efficiency, quality of work and punctuality. 																								The delay in completing the citys flyover projects, the bank said, was not desirable.																								We have already written to them about the progress of the Lockgate Road flyover and the cause of delay in implementing the Park Street project, said H. Mohan, joint secretary, transport department.																								HRBC chairman Sadhan Banerjee said the agency was in touch with the contractor and monitoring the progress to make up for lost time. We are holding meetings with the contractor at least twice a week to try to sort out the problems and the transport secretary has involved himself in the process. But, completion by March will not be possible, Banerjee said.																								HRBC officials are planning to penalise the construction firm in charge of the Park Street flyover for its failure to complete work on time.

																								Prayasam, an organisation that dedicates itself to the welfare of our citys underprivileged children, hosts an exhibition of designer garments and accessories. Titled Sambhar, the exhibition showcases exquisite creations in fabric by 23 of the citys leading boutiques, like Srijoni, Riki, Srimoti, Banithani, Ruchi and Boutique Saaj. Visitors will be treated to a dazzling array of ethnic kurtas, exclusive salwar-kameez sets, hand-crafted costume jewellery and intricately hand-worked sarees. Adding a dash of spice to the show will be the food stalls set up by Rannabari and Pancha Byanjan. An occasion that promises to please the senses while satisfying the mind, Sambhar provides the right balance of beauty and quality, fashion and feasting, along with something to fulfil the conscience. A praiseworthy initiative by the organisers, the exhibition is one that commends itself to the patronage of all those who care about making a difference to the lives of poor, needy children.

 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Teenager battles rare disease
 															- Treatment involves expensive transplant unavailable in India A STAFF REPORTER																								She was growing up with the dream of arguing others cases in a court of law, but destiny has scripted a different story for 15-year-old Siddhi Worah. Today, the Class IX student of La Martiniere for Girls, Calcutta, is fighting her own case in a different court. 																								During the past six months, she has spent more time in the hospital  both in Calcutta and Mumbai  than in school, but her condition has hardly improved. 																								After months of investigation, doctors have diagnosed her with haemophagocytic lympho histocytosis, a rare disease and, according to her doctor parents, she is the 180th case in the history of medical sciences. 																								We dont have much time and her treatment has to start as soon as possible, says mother Swati Worah, staring at the medical papers and reports on the glass table in the drawing room of Flat 5C, Rajhans Building, on Judges Court Road.																								A sense of gloom hangs heavy in the air in the spacious flat, despite the inmates  from Siddhis brother Shaswat to her mother Swati  efforts of presenting vibrant and smiling faces. And the cause of all the anxiety sits quietly in a blue salwar-kameez  and a face-mask. 																								My daughter is putting up a brave face, but she is tired of her illness and wants to lead a normal life, explains Swati, a skin specialist with Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan.																								The disease and the related complications have changed Siddhis life. She couldnt take the Class X exams last year and has been advised not to attend school. Restrictions have been imposed on her food habits and outings for the young girl means visits to clinics and hospitals. Even at home, she has to don a face mask to avoid infection. Activities in Siddhis life, who always dreamt of being a lawyer, is limited to listening to music, reading books and praying to Sai Baba. 																								Despite the high-dose steroids, a series of chemotherapy and blood transfusion sessions and an emergency spleenectomy last October, her condition is deteriorating. But the treatment of the ailment is easier said than done, explains her mother. 																								Siddhi has been advised matched unrelated donor bone-marrow transplant, and the facility is not available anywhere in the country. 																								We have got in touch with Dr Lisa Filipovich in Cincinnati, Ohio, and an expert in mismatched bone-marrow transplant in US. But the treatment will cost around $300,000, which is beyond our means, explains Swati, desperate to mobilise resources for the treatment of her once lively and funloving daughter. 																								The Gujarati family has contacted a few city-based voluntary organisations for help and is also planning to get in touch with the chief ministers office here and the Prime Ministers Office in Delhi. We have spent over Rs 14 lakh on her treatment during the past eight to 10 months and now we need help from others, says Swati. (Contact for help: 98310 56365, 98311 08458).

 Ritajaya BanerjeeRitajaya Banerjee																									Might well be her middle name, for Ritajaya is quite the singer. Thirteen years of training in Indian classical music has not just honed her skills, but instilled in her a passion to be the next Asha Bhonsle, her favourite singer. She has started on a high note, coming first in additional music in Madhyamik 2000.																									Is Dina, as she is known to family and friends. For, the 20-year-old spends most of her free time composing music and penning lyrics. Following in the footsteps of R.D. Burman and Salil Chowdhury might not be too distant a dream, since the Presidency College student has already made a name for herself, winning inter-college contests. Being creative comes naturally, and her hobbies include playing with images on the computer, using Photoshop.																									Is what the second-year-philosophy student believes, and it is Bengali songs that she scripts. Her claim to fame is not just the fact that she has learnt thumri from the great Girija Devi, through a short summer course, but that her voice has been heard on the radio and even at Raj Bhavan. Although the band, Shabdo Kalpo Droom, in which she was composer and lead singer, disbanded a while ago, Dina is still at the forefront in college competitions, even compering the antakshari event at a JU fest. 																									She is, too, through Riddhit Culture Centre, a dance school set up by her mother. If music is her first love, creative choreography is in her family. Not only does Dina help teach the toddlers there, but she also assists in coaching under-privileged children at the school. Has been doing creative dancing shows for 11 years, and is into her second year of kathak. Being stage shy is not in her nature, since her debut was at age seven.																									For Dina, as she gets ready to cut her own album, once her BA Part I exams are over. And the determined little lady, who has performed near and far, from Calcutta and Mumbai to Bangladesh, is sure to accomplish her mission of becoming a music director.

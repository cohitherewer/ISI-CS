Picture by Aranya Sen																								A dedicated breast cancer clinic was launched at the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman amp; Child Care Centre on Tuesday.																								With breast cancer overtaking cervical cancer as the leading kind of cancer in Calcutta, at 23.2 per cent of all diagnosed cases, doctors advise that early detection is the only way to bring down fatalities and increase chances of victims leading a normal, healthy life.																								Dr Suman Sarawgis Breast Care Centre, set up in collaboration with the Rawdon Street hospital and Pulse Diagnostics, was launched by dancer Mallika Sarabhai. 																								It will run between Mondays and Saturdays, 3 pm onwards. We wanted to make the clinic as accessible to housewives as possible, explained Suman Sarawgi, a radiodiagnosis specialist.																								People know which doctor to go to for a fever, or a bone injury. But when it comes to matters of the breast, women have been at a loss so far, Sarawgi added. A gynaecologist may be of help, but is not an expert in the area.																								A multi-disciplinary team has been set up at the centre to ensure it offers comprehensive care  from diagnosis to recovery. A surgeon, oncologist, radiation therapist and breast counsellor will be available at the clinic in case of detection, though the first step is a mammogram.																								The focus of treatment at the clinic will be promoting early diagnosis, conservation and reconstruction of the breast.																								A monthly self-exam seven to 10 days after the first day of menstruation and a regular clinical exam is advisable, according to Sarawgi. A mammogram, however, can detect a lump up to two years before it can be felt by the human hand, she pointed out.																								The smaller the lump is, the better the chances that the sufferer could return to a completely normal life after treatment. Annual mammograms after the age of 40 could be the best defence against the growing disease.																								Sarawgi also observed that more than 70 per cent of the cases have no family history of cancer. Any changes in the breast appearance, a lump, thickening, discoloration, discharge or pain could be warning signs.																								We, unfortunately, live in a country where a womans greatest virtue is supposed to be her sacrificial nature, said dancer Sarabhai, at the clinic debut. It is time to prove our worth in other ways. We can be far more useful to society by staying healthy.																								Sarabhai stressed that she herself has a mammography annually, and the disease can be combated if women ensure those around them received proper treatment.																								Biologically, it has been proven that women are stronger, and that if they get equal access to healthcare, they live far longer than men, the dancer added.																								Awareness drives at housing societies and clubs, free screening camps for the under-privileged have also been lined up by the clinic, to take the message to the masses.

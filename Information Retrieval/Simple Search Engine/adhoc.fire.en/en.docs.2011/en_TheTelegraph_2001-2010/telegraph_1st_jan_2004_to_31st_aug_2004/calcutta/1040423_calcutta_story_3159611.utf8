The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 23, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Cable operators frequently telecast latest films on the local cable channel though the practice is illegal. Recently, my cable operator aired Ab Tak Chhappan and Armaan. Pirated VCDs of just-released movies are openly available at roadside shops. This discourages film buffs from visiting cinemas. They prefer watching them at home. The film industry loses a lot of revenue in this manner. The authorities should nab the vendors and cable operators who boost this illegal trade.

	A product I purchased from a state consumers cooperative store, Samavayika, on CR Avenue, turned out to be of inferior quality. However, I couldnt lodge a written complaint because the shop did not maintain a complaint/suggestion register simply because it was not in vogue. Samavayikas dont have weighing scales either, for those who want to verify weights of packed commodities, like sugar and pulses.

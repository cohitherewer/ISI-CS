 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Taps will flow, 24x7
 A STAFF REPORTER																								If fun was the operative word for his commissioner on Thursday, flow was what the mayor went with. Subrata Mukherjee announced plans to provide Calcuttans with filtered water, 24x7, by December 2005. The secret to the steady stream: two additional water-treatment plants at Palta becoming operational.																								A step in that direction was taken on Thursday with the commissioning of a 20-million-gallon treatment plant, along with a new pumping station, at Palta. My dream is to ensure ready filtered water from the tap 24 hours a day by 2006, the mayor said.Round-the-clock water is possible provided there is no major leak or waste from the taps on the roads, said Ranabir Chowdhury, water supply consultant to Howrah Municipal Corporation.

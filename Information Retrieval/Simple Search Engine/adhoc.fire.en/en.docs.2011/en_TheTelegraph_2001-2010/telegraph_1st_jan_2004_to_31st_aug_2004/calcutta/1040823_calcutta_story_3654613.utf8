 Monday, August 23, 2004 Who wants to go home?
Office Space Companies have woken up to the need to give workers a place to have fun, and thereby increase productivity. Nisha Lahiri spends time at oneRows of small cubicles, people separated by dreary walls and closed doors, papers and files piled high on brimming desks, heads bent in silence Could be any office, anywhere. Walk down  or up  the stairs, and theres something different. A name on the wall, written in bright colours and funky font. Walk through the door and into another world. Ozone is the name, a peoples centre is how its described. Its a place for employees to rest, de-stress, chill out, hang out and do anything but work. In the middle of the day, or to start or end it. Cool, casual and bright is the look. Gym, library with Internet access computers and cafeteria are the facilities.The bonus is a large area with lounges and sofas and a big screen attached to the TV for special events, like the India-Pakistan match on Saturday, which was on through the day. So who wants to go home?The location for this employee zone  free for everyone, from peon to MD  is Oxygen House, the home of BOC India, in Taratala . Inaugurated on Independence Day this year, it is split into Moksha the caf, Nirvana the library and Suswastha the gym.There are no straight lines, only curves, with every cushion, panel and pillar unique. The idea was to do something original, completely different from the rest of the office. They wanted it to be bright, so we played around with colours, not repeating any, with striped pillars and even little funky panels, explains Ritu Duggal, one half of Decorage and Associates.The brainchild of the MD of BOC India, Sanjiv Lamba, Ozone took all of three-and-a-half months to build, from the planning to execution stage, and cost around Rs 25 lakh. Spread over an area of over 6,000 sq ft, it now stands where there were once more rows of cubicles. There are no phones, to avoid being called and no shop talk is already a rule.Better utilisation of workspace, say employees, with no argument from the bosses. Certainly a foolproof way of clearing the cobwebs on a dull workday and getting rid of the Monday morning blues. Its to help get the creative juices flowing, provide a break from work and make office a fun place to be, smiles S.K. Menon, finance director, BOC India.We cant match the salaries of FMCG or IT companies. But we can create the same work atmosphere. We push them hard, and they work long hours. The least we can do is make it fun. Its about empowerment. We want them to regret going home. It shouldnt be just a job, but life, he adds. FUN CORNERS: People centres at work should make employees regret going back home, feel the bosses The gym is the largest, with 800 sq ft of space, and has tummy trimming equipment, recliner cycle, bench press, twister, stepper, weights and a nine-seater multi-gym. Decorated in pink and purple, there are lockers, toilets and a shower room. Open in the morning and evening for the time being, an hour is for the ladies only. A professional trainer is on the cards.The library has cupboards and shelves of technical books, a magazine rack and at the moment four Internet computers with space for more. On one pillar is space for a wall-mounted CD player. Once they are in, people can read and relax with a bit of music. There are also two brainstorming rooms off the library. Cool blue is the calming colour here.The caf, with food and beverages sourced from Caf Coffee Day, has light bites like sandwiches and a host of drinks, from shakes to flavoured coffees. Everything is orange, to keep the sleepy and tired eyes open. The tables have Checkers, Ludo and Scrabble boards painted on them and the games will soon be ready to roll.Theres a message board in the corner, to wish someone well or let off steam. The music system plays whatever people desire, and theres a little raised corner with a TV and sofas. The caf doors can be opened out into the lounge area to form a presentation  or party  room.As Kaushik Narayan, a BOC employee, puts it: It beats getting muri at the station on the way home.Pictures by Pradip Sanyal

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Star pull for ballot boost
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Does the participation of non-political personalities enhance/diminish the appeal of the elections? More letters will be published next week Voice of the people: Amitabh Bachchan at a 2002 rally in Uttar PradeshDebasish Chakraborty,
																		Cossipore.																																																														Non-political personalities (including filmstars) are invited, on behalf of party heavyweights, to join politics. Since people have by and large lost faith in politicians and their false promises, they are reluctant to give a clear mandate. They would rather listen to what the non-political personalities have to say. The general public uses its franchise to favour the party the stars represent. Thus, political leaders only engage them cleverly to grab power at the Centre. 									

Pijus Kanti Sarkar, 
																		Narendrapur.																																																														Rajiv Gandhi was one of the firsts to tap the star power of the likes of Amitabh Bachchan, Vaijayanthimala and Sunil Dutt to win voters. Now the two biggest parties of India are trying to get stars to campaign for them. Elections have now almost become a sort of a game show as the majority of the voters blindly follow in the footsteps of their favourite stars.									

Kanai Saha, 
																		Gouri Bari Lane.																																																														Non-political personalities neither belong to any party nor are they biased towards any particular section of society. Thus, their participation in the electoral process will do the people and the country a lot of good. 									

Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna. 																																																														Many Indians aspire to be politicians at any cost since it is a lucrative profession without any investment whatsoever. Some politicians make their way up the ladder with the help of just muscle power and money. Indian democracy has enough experience of partisan and opportunistic politics. It is high time that non-political personalities, especially the intellectuals, took interest in politics.									

Abhijit Chakraborty, 
																		Howrah. 																																																														Every person has the right to join any political party that he/she admires. Non-political personalities have the potential to draw the attention of the public towards hitherto neglected issues. And in our country, politics is a power house. 									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park.																																																														Election, at any level, involves politics but that does not mean that non-political persons cannot contest elections. A sizeable chunk of these non-political personalities comprise those from the film fraternity. Few are academicians or social activists. Film stars and former bureaucrats in no way enhance the appeal of the elections, despite their celebrity status. Rather contestants with political lineage, like Rahul or Priyanka Gandhi, may create some interest amongst the masses. 									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
																		Behala.																																																														Nowadays the general public has become fed up with political parties, as most of them follow policies which are self-serving. Peoples interests have become secondary to them. Induction of non-political personalities may, temporarily, create some interest, especially among young voters. But those who are a little more sensible know that even if these stars are elected, they wont be able to effect any significant change as the parties will dictate the terms and conditions to them. The political parties know that the masses have lost faith in them, so they rope in non-political personalities hoping to cash in on their popularity. 									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge.																																																														The bitter truth is that all political parties are ideologically bankrupt and do not dare to face the electorate. They even fail to form a viable united front to come to power. So the shrewd politicians are now in the hunt for non-political personalities who will approach their fans and turn them into voters for the party they represent. 									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia.																																																														Non-political personalities, like other citizens of India, have every right to join any political party. They have excelled in their professions and have huge fan followings. Their participation can enhance the appeal of the elections. 									

Md. Ayub, 
																		Bright Street.																																																														Yes, the participation of non-political personalities diminish the appeal of the elections. How can one without any knowledge of politics tackle political crises? Nowadays every party wants a big starcast to feature for its campaigns. They are ready to shoulder huge expenditure for the purpose even if these campaigners have absolutely no knowledge about the party ideology. Political parties have almost become producers fishing for film stars to parade on the campaigning stage. The producer who invests more has better chances of a hit. 									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane. 																																																														The participation of film stars will enhance the appeal of the elections. Politics is a dirty game where one cannot trust others. So, we, the citizens of India need non-political personalities to rid us of this scene of despair. Non-political personalities bring us some hope that they will work towards the betterment of the masses. We hope that they will bring their reel life heroism to bear on real life as well. These days Bollywood movies also inspire us to some extent. As in the Anil Kapoor-starrer Nayak, we need someone to come forward and save us from the clutches of the corrupt leaders. 									

Sandipan Dutta, 
																		Haridevpur. 																																																														Participation of film stars or non-political personalities may in the short run enhance the appeal of the elections but ultimately this cannot influence the populace. Political campaigns are gimmicks to bag votes as well as leave a good impression on the masses.Moupiali Mahalanobis, 
																		Dhakuria. 																																																														It is assumed that non-political personalities are unaware of the dirty side of politics and enter the political field with a clear conscience. So voters naturally expect a more sincere effort from them than from veteran politicians. In this respect, having candidates from non-political backgrounds in the fray enhances the voters interest in the polls.

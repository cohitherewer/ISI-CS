The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

				 ... why we call it the Blues				 																																																											First day first show: 35 per cent 				 																																																											First day second show: 75 per cent				 																																																											First day third show: 80 per cent				 																																																											The box-office at the Elgin Road INOX gets busier as the July day progresses into night, and as the cool crowd troops in to catch Nagesh Kukunoors Hyderabad Blues 2.				 																																																											The PLU (people like us) syndrome is developing a FLU (film like us) fetish, with the multiplex movie-goer choosing his space and his time to feast on his kind of flick.				 																																																											The figures at the City Centre INOX reflect much the same crawl-by-day-run-by-night trend when it comes to a movie targeted at the multiplex audience.				 																																																											Kukunoors second peek into the lives of Varun and Ashwini successfully carries forward the story from where it had ended, or rather paused. Successfully, because the film does seem like a continuation of the original movie, with an intermission that lasted six years, not minutes.				 																																																											The same characters, the same backdrop, the witty one-liners and the same thread of mild satire runs throughout  the rearranged marriage has all the ingredients of a hit sequel, a concept which hasnt really worked in India.				 																																																											Every film-maker gets tempted to make a sequel of a hit film. But the risks are very high as the second part is always judged by the standard set by the first one. I guess thats why we havent had any true sequel in India, with the suffix 2 in the title, says Kukunoor.				 																																																											The storyline, true to Kukunoors claims, has been kept simple. We catch the happy couple six years into their marriage. They have everything going for them  he runs a call centre, she is a doctor who is about to open her own clinic, and they have great friends and a cool social life.				 																																																											The only pester point: to sire or not sire. Varun doesnt want to become a father  boys will be boys (!)  but Ashwini is determined to have a child (with the backing of every member of their social circuit, of course). In her desperation, she decides to try every trick in the mating game and some, even picking up seduce-your-man tips from Shashi aunty. 				 																																																											In this endeavour, she is aided by her best friend Seema (a brilliant performance by co-producer Elahe Hiptoolah), who runs a marriage bureau, IMF (Instant Marriage Fixation). The entry of Menaka  the original mythological seductress in a cleavage-showing call centre manager avatar  into Varuns world adds an intriguing twist in the tale.				 																																																											This film too, like its predecessor, takes a dig at the Indian arranged marriage system and Seemas IMF mocks the concept from the inside. 				 																																																											Double entendre is a hallmark of the dialogues and just like on the previous trip into the Blues, it works. Of course, the line from the first part (Dil pe mat le yaar) that became something of a youth anthem, echoes right through the film and is even set to tune for a full-fledged song.				 																																																											You must hand it to the guy (director-actor Kukunoor), smiled Ankur, stepping out of an HB2 night show. The young IT pro and gang found the film damn cool as it speaks our language and addresses our concerns. 				 																																																											That, after all, is what a multiplex movie is all about  a hilarious slice of urban middle class life presented through everyday situations, a mirror to the lives and times of a niche audience.				 																																																											Postscript: The one missing link in the glad-to-be-back Blues brigade is Rajshri Nair, who with her girl-next-door charm had bowled us over as Ashwini. Jyoti Dogra in her first leading role in a film, is okay, but, hey, dont we like our favourite people to be just the way they were when we are on a nostalgia trip? Smita Roy ChowdhuryNine yards of life less ordinary				 																																																											She looks like a girl next door, with large, soulful eyes and a soft smile. An almost inaudible bosho is the first thing she says to her friends and visitors at Oxford Bookstore, for the launch of her first novel, The Sari Shop. I spent two years in Calcutta, she tells you. That was before Rupa Bajwa moved to Bangalore and then Kerala. 				 																																																											The girl from Amritsar began her book at age 22, fresh out of college. Five years later, its been published by Penguin and is already on the Orange Prize 2004 Longlist. But Rupa is looking ahead, having already started her second book of which she is loath to reveal anything (it kills the creative process. I dont even talk about it to friends and family, because it makes me less eager to write it).				 																																																											The Sari Shop takes a poignant, yet realistic, look at the class difference still strongly prevalent in society, through the life of Ramchand, a sari shop salesman in Amritsar. Woven around the lanes and bylanes of the old city and the more affluent areas, it follows his efforts to make a better life for himself. Rich with descriptions of the city, Rupa says she was mapping Amritsar in my head and bringing the city to the readers.				 																																																											Although unwilling to disclose any details of her past, because it confuses the issue for the reader, who assumes things, Rupa laughingly confesses that her parents did have to face some flak from neighbours and friends for the portrayal of some of the less-likeable characters, like the rich Kapoor family. My parents are so far removed from the literary world. I dont blame them for being upset, she clarifies.				 																																																											Perhaps I shouldnt have been so critical, but I set out to mirror society as I saw it. Its the fault of the characters for being over the top. I grew up with this, and I overheard the conversations and saw the people do exactly what happens in the book. Each of the characters has bits and pieces of people she knows, but the 27-year-old identifies most with the hapless Ramchand.				 																																																											Having written the book in phases, travelling around the country, doing a bit of this and that, Rupa took the last nine months off to concentrate on the book. Im sure Ill look back on it later and see how I could have done things differently, but it was my first book. The next one, I am sure, will be better, with less mistakes.Dancing girl on a roll: Khullam Khulla Koena callingPlaying the initial love interest of Anil Kapoor may not be a dream launch pad, but Koena Mitra is happy. The Khullam Khulla item girl in Ram Gopal Varmas Road will hit the travel trail once more with Sanjay Guptas Musafir. But this time shell do a little more than just bump and grind. My role (of club dancer) is small but has different shades, claims the Calcutta girl with smouldering looks and a body to match, who has a sizzler with Sunjay Dutt and a romantic number with Kapoor in the November film. Koena is a fine actress who was wasted in Road, says Musafir Gupta.

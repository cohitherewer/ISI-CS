 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Immerse idol, pay a fee
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Puja organisers this year will have to pay a fee for immersing idols in the Hooghly, neighbourhood ponds and lakes. 																								The decision has been taken at a recent meeting between the police and the state pollution control board (PCB).																								Officials said the funds raised by Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and other civic bodies around the city would be spent on maintaining the waterbodies and checking pollution. Well soon send a circular in this regard to the CMC and other civic bodies, said a PCB official.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, also chief organiser of a community puja in south Calcutta, said the civic body was yet to receive any circular. 																								The CMC doesnt mind charging puja organisers for immersing idols. But we have to offer them some service in return. Otherwise, the organisers will feel unnecessarily burdened. I request the government to hold a meeting with the CMC, he added.																								PCB officials pointed out that the straw-and-bamboo frames of the idols, clothes and decorative pieces, including garlands, pollute the river, lakes and ponds. 																								The green board, however, will not fix the fee. It will be decided by the civic authorities in consultation with the organisers, a police officer said.

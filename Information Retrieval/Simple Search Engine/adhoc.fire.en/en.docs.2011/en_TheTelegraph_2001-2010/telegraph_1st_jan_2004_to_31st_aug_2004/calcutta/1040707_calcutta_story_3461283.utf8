The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 07, 2004  Calcutta Column

	An iron railing has been erected to separate the two flanks of a 2-km stretch of VIP Road near Baguiati. As a result, elderly people and children are forced to walk all the way to the end of the railing to reach popular destinations like Big Bazaar or the Mahanam temple which fall in the middle. We request the authorities to leave an opening in the road divider and provide a zebra crossing so that pedestrians can easily cross over to the other side.

	Earlier, the Permanent Account Number (PAN) card used to categorise the information displayed on it. The category description was clearly mentioned as Name, Fathers name and Date of Birth etc. Recently, the income tax department handed over the responsibility of making PAN cards to an agency. The new PAN cards are devoid of any mention of the category. It cant be made out whether the date of birth mentioned is that of the person or his/her father.

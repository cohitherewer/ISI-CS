The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 The music lingers, the spirit soars
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 The Lahiris at work. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								More than 75 per cent of the Bengali music sales pie today is hogged by the Bangla band repertoire, and leading outfits like Chandrabindoo, Bhoomi, Cactus and Fossils command appearance fees in the region of Rs 40,000 for their gigs. 																								A genre that was pioneered by the late Gautam Chattopadhyay and his talismanic group Mohiner Ghoraguli in the 70s, has exploded into a crescendo and the tender nurturing of a quiet couple has a lot to do with it.																								For nearly a decade now, Mahua and D.S. Lahiri, driven by a desire to do something different, have been backing their instinct and promoting contemporary Bengali music with elements from the West from their 5, Moti Sil Street office, in central Calcutta. The Lahiris were fortunate to come in touch with the Mohiner frontman shortly after launching their recording label, Asha Audio, in May 1995.																								Gautamda was exploring avenues to resurrect the groups maiden four-track offering, which had an obscure release in 1975. We decided to take the plunge and re-released the songs, titled Abar Bochhor Kuri Por, recalls Mahua. Although the product launched at the Book Fair wasnt a runaway success, it had sown the seeds of a revolution that is now sweeping music retail racks in town.																								If Calcuttas love affair with alternative modern Bangla music was on slow-burn mode, a spark was provided by Best of Miles Vol 1, another bold venture by Asha Audio in 98. Prior to that, market response was feeble, at best. But we stuck at it since something within told us to be patient, says DS. Meanwhile, the Lahiris kept the faith in the original band man, releasing one Mohiner Ghoraguli album at every Book Fair.																								Simultaneously, we launched one fresh outfit every year, like Lakkhichhara, Fossils, Sahar and Chandrabindoo, says Mahua, who does the talent spotting for the maverick label. The perseverance paid off and Chandrabindoos Chaw became a cult product, clocking three lakh-plus copies till date, and accruing Rs 2.52 lakh by way of royalty for the band.																								People called us insane when we set sail on uncharted waters. But, its been a most rewarding journey. What was simply a passion for us has now translated into an expansive marketplace and the big players, too, see value in the genre, observes DS. Buoyed by the acceptance, the duo is sending the second Fossils album to Sterling Sound of New York, to be mastered by Steve Fallone, credited with doing Eric Clapton and Norah Jones albums.

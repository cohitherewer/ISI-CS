																								Art is synonymous with creation. It is a synthesis that is moulded out of the mundane, a constant reinvention of that which already exists but is given a new identity every time the artistic eye sets its vision on it. It is in keeping with this selfsame artistic temperament that powder coating has been adapted to terracotta and glass. Powder coating has been used previously on metallic surfaces, but the use was purely utilitarian. Its adaptation to terracotta and glass on the other hand is to cater to the aesthetic sensibilities of the artistically inclined. The exhibition at Bibidho Ratan showcases decorative pieces that have been powder coated to lend them a quality that serves to enhance their beauty. Application of the powder is as varied as the medium; it ranges from a direct application of colours from the packet to a permutation of different colours to form a vignette that is ensnaring. The exhibition is especially interesting because of its unique combination of art with the pragmatism of its use in our daily lives.																								Event: An exhibition of handcrafted items of home decor																								When: Till May 2; 11.30 am - 8.30 pm																								Where: Bibidho Ratan, 45 Jatin Das Road, Calcutta 700 029

 A STAFF REPORTER																								The planets are at play, again. After the rare line-up of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter in March, the month of June will see another rare astronomical event unfold in the skies  this time after a gap of 122 years.																								On June 8, Venus  the second planet in the solar system and closest to the sun  will be travelling merrily across the solar disc. During the transit (as astronomers refer to it), Venus would appear as a small dot on the disc of the sun.																								The phenomenon is extremely rare, the last one having occurred in 1882. Along with Europe, Africa and Australia, those in Asia will also be able to feast their eyes on the astronomical delight this time. Calcuttans will be able to observe the phenomenon between 10.44 am and 4.50 pm. The whole of Venus will appear as a black dot on the face of the sun at around 11.03 am, while the transit will be maximum at around 1.47 pm.																								Its literally a once-in-a-lifetime event, said Debiprosad Duari, director, research amp; academics, MP Birla Planetarium. After June 8, it is next scheduled to take place in 2012 and, thereafter, in 2117 and 2125.																								A transit of Venus is like a solar eclipse but instead of the moon being in line between the earth and sun, it is the planet Venus that is directly in line, explained Duari.																								The planetarium is making special arrangements for stargazers to catch the transit with the help of binoculars and telescopes. We will also have a regular programme, beginning second week of May, at the planetarium to make people aware of this occurrence, Duari added.																								The transit has a fair bit of history attached to it. Most notably, to observe the transit of 1769, Captain Cook sailed from England to Tahiti, discovering Hawaii and a few other places along the way. 																								The cyclical pattern of the transit is curious. After two transits in December eight years apart, there is a gap of 121-and-a-half years. After the gap there are two June transits, eight years apart again. This is followed by a wait of 105-and-a-half years before the pattern repeats itself.																								According to experts, while observing the transit, basic rules for protecting the eyes must be followed. Optical instruments such as binoculars, refractors and telescopes may be used, but the suns light must be filtered to reduce its luminosity one hundred thousand times in order to avoid damage to the eye.																								The safest viewing method is through projecting the suns image on a white screen.

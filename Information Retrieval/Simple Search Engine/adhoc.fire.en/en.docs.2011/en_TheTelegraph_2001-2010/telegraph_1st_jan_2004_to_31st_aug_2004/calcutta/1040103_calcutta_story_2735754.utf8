 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Unutilised trade hub plots to be taken back
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government has decided to take stern action against businessmen who have failed to set up units on plots in and around Calcutta that were given to them at subsidised rates. 																								Cottage and small-scale industry minister Bansagopal Chowdhury said on Friday that the government has identified 60 such businessmen and measures against them are in the offing for not utilising the land they were given 10 years ago. We had allotted plots to these people at various industrial complexes in Behala, Kasba and Baruipur, on Calcuttas southern fringes, and at Baltikuri, in Howrah. Their units have not come up yet, he added.																								The government will take the plots back. The minister said: The plots will be reallotted to other businessmen keen on setting up units here.																								West Bengal Small Industry Development Corporation chairman B.K. Chakraborty elaborated that 40 businessmen had already been evicted from the industrial estates and their plots reallocated to others. 																								The corporation is on an expansion overdrive in a number of industrial estates across the state. Before we proceed further, we have to find out how many industrialists have set up units on the land given to them, he added.																								Industrial estates at Durgapur, Malda and Murshidabad will be expanded soon to accommodate more units. The corporation is opening new estates at Tangra and Garia, in Calcutta, and at Asansol. The Tangra estate will come up on the land belonging to the closed Bengal Pottery. 																								Minister Chowdhury said a recent government survey had revealed that many businessmen had taken land at subsidised rates in various industrial estates and later transferred the plots illegally to other persons. We are determined to identify these traders and evict them from our industrial zones. The plots will be reallocated to genuine entrepreneurs keen to set up units here, he added.																								Sources in the industry department said the steps by the cottage and small-scale industries department were taken in close coordination with the industry department.																								Officials said industry minister Nirupam Sen is also of the opinion that land taken from the government at subsidised rates in and around the city cannot be left unutilised.

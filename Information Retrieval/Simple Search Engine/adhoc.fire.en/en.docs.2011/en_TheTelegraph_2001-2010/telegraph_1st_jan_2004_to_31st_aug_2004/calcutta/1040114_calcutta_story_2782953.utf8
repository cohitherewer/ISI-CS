 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Tea-stall bar, spy TV boon for banks
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Say no to tea-stalls and car parks. Say yes to heightened strongroom security and closed-circuit television																								Rattled by the biggest-ever bank robbery in Calcuttas crime history, the police have chalked up elaborate plans to strengthen security in and around banks. Last month, armed men looted Rs 85 lakh from the Kidderpore branch of the Central Bank of India.																								Last week, the first meeting of its kind was convened at Maniktala police station, involving over 50 bank managers and several police officers.																								The meeting was very educative, as the police threw up some novel ideas that could help thwart bank robberies. We will conduct inspections at every branch and if we detect any loopholes, we will take concrete steps to plug them, said S.S. Baswan, chief manager (security), United Bank of India.																								At the meeting, overseen by Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), cops highlighted the fact that most banks in the city do not even have the minimum in-house security requirements.																								The bank officers and police agreed on the following security measures to be implemented soon: Enhancement of strongroom  security by the banks No tea-stall to come up  in front of banks, as it allows criminals to wait, watch  and plot the strike Installation of closed-circuit  TVs by the bank authorities at the entrance and at other  strategic points Regular checking of the  alarm system, which is often found to be faulty No car should be allowed  to park for a long time in front of banks No high-speed vehicle,  including two-wheelers, should be allowed near banks. Staff  vehicles should be parked inside the bank compound Verification of drivers  and personnel of hired cars, if used by the bank authorities.																								In addition to all these safety measures, the banks have been asked to ensure regular checks of the air ducts of air-conditioning machines, grilles and the building infrastructure.																								We also stressed that bank officials must display their identity cards during banking hours. All the suggestions were accepted by the bank representatives. The idea is to create a more secure atmosphere for bank employees and customers alike, said Bikram Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of Maniktala police station.																								The brainstorming session is an outcome of the intense pressure the force is said to be under, from the home (police) department, for its failure to crack two recent robberies, one in Gariahat and the other in Kidderpore. In both cases, the robbers fled without any resistance.

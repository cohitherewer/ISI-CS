 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Bottled-up beauties 
If you are sick and tired of being told to eat your veggies, here is a creative way around the problem. Put them to even better use.																								Take your beans and carrots out of the cool confines of the refrigerator and give them a little acid test to stunning decorative effect. Doused in the caustic chemical, your stale veggies will stand pretty for as long as three years to add colour to your cooking or dining area.																								Kitchen dcor gets a new lease with bright fruits and vegetables preserved in vinegar in vacuum-packed bottles, usually imported from Singapore and China.																								The makers make sure that you cant lay your hands (or teeth) on them by heat-treating them and squeezing them into stylish bottles with narrow stems and broad bellies. The dried, yet bright beauties swell right back into shape when in the soothing, refreshing company of vinegar.RACK RAIDER Cool for the kitchen
 What
Colourful fruits and veggies in sealed glass bottles
 Where
Kriti, Forum 4th floor; Nik-Nish; Big Bazaar
 How much
Rs 100 to Rs 650The perfect choices for this accessory are colourful vegetables and fruits like carrots, chillies, bell peppers, beans, green peas, radishes and apples. They come in a variety of sizes and combinations .																								Usually available in thick glass bottles, these also come in wrought-iron racks with a chrome finish. For a more funky look, try out the long-twisted containers with sealed holes in their bellies or the pyramid-shaped ones. These rejuvenated veggies definitely do not take the shape of the space they inhabit.																								About to hit the racks soon: colourful spices and pulses in vacuum-packed, sealed bottles, probably doused in olive oil for long-lasting effect. 						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

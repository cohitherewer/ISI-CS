 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 The legacy of Bengals trinity
 															- Hes made only nine films, but each ones original  RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Adoor Gopalakrishnan: Different frames																								He had Ritwik Ghatak as his professor at FTII Pune, but the quiet Malayali youth was just too shy to walk up to the maverick film-maker for an informal chat after class. Ghatak didnt live long to see his student unleash a new wave in Malayalam cinema, but a few others  like Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen  were witness to the works of the bearer of their legacy.																								Ive had the chance to know all three  the Trinity of Bengali cinema, grinned Adoor Gopalakrishnan, hours before taking the podium at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute for a memorial lecture on the maestros 84th birth anniversary on Sunday. 																								Satyajitda and Mrinaldas views on my films have always mattered to me the most. With them, I had the satisfaction of being understood, which was far more important than fetching accolades from anyone else, said Gopalakrishnan, wandering off into a jog down memory lane.																								I remember the day when Mathilukkal premiered at the Calcutta film festival. I had just finished the film and had it hurriedly subtitled for the screening. Satyajitda was very ill then, but he climbed up a flight of stairs, against his doctors advice, to see the film. Coming out of the hall, the first thing he told me was marvellous Adoor! That sealed all my doubts. The words still ring in my ears, added the 63-year-old film-maker, born into a family of Kathakali artistes.																								Despite just nine films in more than three decades, Gopalakrishnan has left his mark as possibly the most significant Indian film-maker in the post-Ray generation. I dont like being prolific. Because I dont like repeating myself, said the second Indian director to be conferred the prestigious French Commandeur Des Arts Lettres (after Ray).																								Gopalakrishnan has, instead, chosen to be different with each of his films. Since all his screenplays are original, a lot of time is devoted to developing an idea into a story and then giving shape to the final script. 																								Once through with the film, he prefers to show it around to people, talk about it and study their reactions.																								Nizhalkkuthu (subtitled Shadow Kill), made with French collaboration in 2002, has found a large audience in the US and France. The multiplex and small festival culture has given cinema a shot in the arm abroad. There are audiences for my films in all the big cities in India, too. I am looking for the entrepreneur who believes in them and will be willing to screen them, said Gopalakrishnan.																								The film-maker is currently giving finishing touches to his second book on cinema, combining theory with rare personal observations.

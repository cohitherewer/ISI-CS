The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Billboard crackdown hots up, cops join fray
 							 - Distraction of drivers to be prevented PRONAB MONDAL																								The city traffic police said on Monday that it would supplement the campaign of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) against illegal billboards on either side of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.																								The traffic department said it had received complaints about the growing visual pollution, distracting motorists in a city where fatality in road accidents was alarmingly high.																								It is obvious that the aesthetic sense and quality of design of the billboards across the city are fast declining. None of the advertising companies pay minimum heed to it, said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police, traffic department.																								Last month, the hoarding of a musical soiree was pulled down in Mullickbazar when commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty himself expressed displeasure at its visual effect. 																								Deputy commissioner of the traffic department Peeyush Pandey had first noticed the billboard at the intersection of Park Street and AJC Bose Road. He informed Chakraborty. The commissioner went to the site and saw the advertisement for himself.																								After the billboard was put up, traffic movement on that particular stretch on AJC Bose Road and Park Street was disrupted. Initially, we had received reports of some cars grazing each other. 																								During the course of investigation, it was found that most motorists paid more attention to the hoarding than the road. As a result, the accidents and traffic snarls occurred, said an official of traffic department.																								Undoubtedly, obscene billboards distract drivers. The Bypass is the only road where a vehicle can ply at a standard speed. Keeping this in mind, no such hoarding should be displayed on any road, said Basu. We can take steps against such billboards by enforcing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act.																								According to police, it is clearly mentioned in Section 203 of the CMC Act that the municipal commissioner may either deny a licence or refuse to renew one, if in his opinion the proposed site for any advertisement is unsuitable from the consideration of public safety, traffic hazard (aesthetic design).																								The moment we get to know that a hoarding is distracting motorists and pedestrians, we bring it to the notice of the CMDA, Calcutta Municipal Corporation or the public works department and call for its immediate removal, said deputy commissioner Pandey.																								Joint commissioner Basu expressed his reservations about visual pollution. If anyone opts to come forward and lodge a complaint against a hoarding, he or she is welcome, he said, adding: Even if there is no complainant, it does not matter. We can take action on our own.																								The traffic department will soon prepare a list of hoardings that may cause traffic hazards. 																								We will send the list to the authorities concerned. Our effort is to ensure a drive that is safe for the driver as well the pedestrians, said an officer of the traffic department.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Full marks to numbers norm
 A silent prayer before putting pen to answerscript A resounding no is the verdict from Young Metro readers to the question posed by Time to Talk: Should the marks system in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary be replaced with grades? Here are the answers.Marks should definitely not be replaced by grades, as grades do not give a complete picture of an individuals potential. Be it HS or ICSE, grades should not be the ultimate decider, as the final verdict is uncertain. In board exams, where thousands of students compete for ranks, large numbers surpass each other by fractional marks. Grades might be given in minor subjects, but definitely not major ones like mathematics or English. Also, grades make students complacent. Grades may put less pressure on students but will not help in college admissions. We do not want mediocre students studying in good universities and colleges. Marks are a better sieve. 				 				 																															Gabriel GomesNo. The change from marks to grades would make life easier for students, but some are better than others and with grades, students will fall into the getting-good-grades-by-not-studying-very-hard mode. Discrimination is not a good thing, but as far as education is concerned, distinctions should be made between students of higher potentials and the rest.Tanmoy Das Lala,
St. Xaviers Collegiate SchoolThe system of marking students leads to someone getting a 90 per cent and the other missing the cut-off by a 0.5 per cent. Marking literature papers and essays is ridiculous. Students get obsessed with studies for the wrong reasons, as one has to study not for knowledge, but to beat others in the race to college. Grades have to be accompanied by other changes. It should not be done on a scale of 100. Also, colleges should devise their own entrance methods and let grades serve only as a reference. Grades should also be complemented by a profile of the student that the school maintains. Marks need to be replaced by grades, but only when they go hand-in-hand with these changes.Ranjana Das,
Lady Brabourne CollegeThe board exams are important for everyone, and no matter what the results of a student the year round, he/she slogs it out in the last few months and most manage to do well. So, it is impossible to judge someone from the results of only one exam. Some might deserve it, but a few adopt unfair means. If only one exam matters, then every possible measure should be taken to ensure that only the honest and diligent get through.Vivek Mukherjee,
B.G.K.V., Salt LakeI dont think grades are a better option for evaluating Madhyamik results, because a student can only evaluate ones success through marks, not grades, which provide a general outlook, and are not an indicator of individual performance. 				 				 																															Ruchika DhanukaIt will be very unjust, as it will help the average students pass easily, but will become a cause for concern for brilliant students. For instance, grade A means 90 to 99 per cent. So, students getting the two vastly-differing scores will be put on the same level. It will cause depression among brilliant students, and will perhaps increase the rate of suicides, instead of decreasing it.				 				 																															Sayantan Sarkar No. The originality of the West Bengal board would be lost if the marks system is replaced with grades. Also, its credibility would be at stake since it would mean following in the footsteps of the Delhi board.Arijit Ghosh,

	 Golden glimpses				 				 																															Turning 50 is a milestone in the life of any organisation, and South Point School made sure that the memories will be lasting. On April 1, 1954, a seed had been planted by educationist Satikanta Guha for the middle-class Calcuttan looking for an educational foundation in the English medium which later sprouted and grew to hit the Guinness Book of World Records for its student volume. 				 				 																															A year-long schedule to mark the golden jubilee culminated in a week of festivity. The celebrations gathered everyone associated with the school at present or in the past. Melting Point, the first days programme, got all the students on the St Pauls Cathedral Grounds, throwing darts, enjoying joyrides or taking a peep through the bioscope box. Another day, a dinner was arranged for all the teachers, past and present. The high point was former teacher and singer Gita Ghatak presenting Rabindrasangeet.				 				 																															Sunday was the busiest on the schedule with the morning reserved for the felicitation of 50 achievers who walked out of the South Point portals. It was a proud day for the school as the likes of danseuse Tanushree Shankar, top cop Shyamal Dutta, physician Mrinmoy Nandi and corporate captain R.N. Dutta took the stage. In the evening, it was time for the old boys and girls to be back on campus, to take a tour of the classrooms and playgrounds they have left behind. Such was the magic of the evening that alumnus Tanmoy Bose put up an impromptu performance with a dafli, to a roar of approval from the crowd. Celebrity guardians discussed how parental aspirations and ideas stem pupils potentials. Another lively Q amp;A session took place on the question of subsidising higher education, drawing panelists like football coach P.K. Banerjee to academic Neil OBrien. 				 				 																															An inter-school singing competition had eight institutes match their vocal chords. Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan came up trumps. This was followed by two colourful ballets put up by students. 				 				 																															The golden jubilee was not all fun and frolic. One day was set apart for students to visit their less-privileged brethren with gifts. The destinations included Nabanir, Thakurpukur Cancer Research Centre and a home for the deaf-blind-mute near Barrackpore. 				 				 																															The foundation day had Governor Viren J. Shah releasing a special cover and a cancellation granted for the occasion by the department of posts.

Picture by Rashbehari Das				 				 																															Action time				 				 																															A series of fun-filled activities was organised at The Heritage School, post-exams. The week included a variety of creative events like workshops on pottery, drama, dance, yoga and instrumental music, under the guidance of professionals.				 				 																															First was the TTIS inter-house quiz, watched by a packed hall with the audience comprising students from Class IV to VIII. Vipul Banthia, Rajarshi Ganguly, Parashar Banerjee and Satyajit Mullik of Patanjali House won the event.				 				 																															In the mime workshop, walking on stilts was taught by Suvendu Mukhopadhyay, the schools mime teacher. The stained glass-painting workshop was conducted by artists from the Colman paint company. There was a Play with Clay session under Dipankar Karmakar, while others learnt to make candles using shells and beads.				 				 																															The art workshop, Legendary Strokes, was conducted by Debabrata Hazra, in which mythological figures like Ravana, Durga, Daksha Raja and Jatayu were made using strokes of paint on discarded cartons and wooden planks.				 				 																															Chefs at Work tested culinary expertise. Dressed in apron and headgear, the enthusiastic students did it all, from preparing the items to laying the table. The results of the activity week were displayed at a craft bazaar on the schools prize day.				 				 																															 Sanchita Raha 				 				 																
	 Border memories				 				 																															It was an evening spent travelling down memory lane recently, when the peace ambassadors who had visited Pakistan in January gathered at a function to relive their memories, organised by Chowringhee High School. The young members of the TTIS team were given certificates while the teachers were handed mementoes, for taking the initiative.				 				 																															Team leader Barry OBrien also shared his thoughts on the trip to Karachi with principals, teachers and students of several schools. The presentation included video clippings, photographs and colourful charts. The chief guest at the occasion was minister for minority development and youth affairs Md Salim. Umme Habiba,

	 Class for teachers 				 				 																															As part of its professional development projects, blending creativity, thinking skills and behavioural management with literacy and numeracy, British Council brings the second batch of teachers from the UK to Calcutta from April 4 to 13, for the Teachers International Professional Development programme.				 				 																															The initiative, funded by the Department of Education and Skills, places 1,780 UK teachers worldwide each year. This time, 10 teachers from Hertfordshire will visit Birla High School (girls section) and Vivekananda Mission Society, including their community education centres.

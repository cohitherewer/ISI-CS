The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Grade parity for performers
				 	 Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary (HS) Education, met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Saturday. Participants included Diptimoy Ghosh, Debashree Bhattacharjee, Tapas Roy, Rajib Saha, Jayati Banerjee, Swarnali Nandi, Binoy Banerjee and Chandrani Ghosh				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Rajib Saha: We hear the HS Council is planning to replace the system of awarding marks with grades. Please explain.																																																			Yes, we are introducing a gradation system. I feel the present system of evaluating a candidate on the basis of marks scored is not right. Suppose a student of science scores 850 marks in the aggregate, which is the highest in that stream that year. Another student of humanities scores 750 marks in his aggregate, highest for that year. But when a percentage is calculated against the total marks scored, the humanities student will be behind the other on the merit list. Both have topped their respective streams but the student of science comes on top of the merit list. This, I feel, is injustice.																																																											In the system of grades, we will classify students by the marks scored. A percentage of 85 to 90 fetches excellent, very good is 75 per cent to 84 per cent, 60 per cent to 74 per cent is good, and so on. There will be nine such categories.																																																											The system will bring a parity of grading among performers in every stream. In fact, such grading has also been supported in the recommendations of the Ranjugopal Mukherjee Commission and the system is set to debut in the 2005-06 session. 																																																											The system of grading will help highlight the weaker areas of a student. However, on the marksheet, the students will be told the individual marks scored in each paper.																																																									

Rajib Saha: Will there be any cut-off marks for the grades?																																																			Yes we have finalised that. To pass the Councils examination, every student has to score at least 30 per cent, or the corresponding grade. This grade, naturally, will be the lowest grade in the nine-point scale. We will no longer go by the system of cutting some marks from one paper and adding it to a paper in which the examinee has failed. Marks will not be added even from the optional papers.																																																									

Tapas Roy: But how will colleges admit students under this system?																																																			We have decided that the gradation scale will be introduced. It is the business of the education department to make this system compatible with the admission and selection processes of colleges and universities in the state. Since this is a government decision, all academic institutions will be tuned to the process. How it will be done is yet to be finalised.																																																									

Diptimoy Ghosh: There prevails a system in colleges to slash a certain percentage of marks from students coming from other boards. Will this continue when the gradation system is effected?																																																			I am strongly against such a system of slashing marks of students from other boards. A number of seats may have to be reserved in colleges to stop this. Our system of marking and grading are different from other boards. They will not match. So, students coming from other boards will not benefit.																																																									

Tapas Roy: Can a method be evolved by which an examinee returns home with proof that he has sat for a particular paper? 																																																			Your suggestion may help us solve some legal problems. At present, examinees writing a paper have to sign two attendance sheets, which prove their presence in the exam hall. We will discuss your suggestion at our next Council meeting.(To be concluded)

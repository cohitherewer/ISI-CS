 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Poll campaign pitch boosts polio drive
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The polio vaccination count last weekend has thrown up a clear, if somewhat surprise, winner  borough 15 in the Garden Reach-Metiabruz area, and borough 7, covering the central to eastern part of city.																								The booth-day performances have improved overall in the city, with the figures rising close to 10 per cent from the November round 328,324 to 354,840  but the response is most pronounced in boroughs XV and VII, said a senior Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) health official.																								Nearly 70,000 children were vaccinated in these two boroughs. Whereas borough VII managed the top slot, the improvement in borough XV is more dramatic, observed experts from WHO and Unicef. Incidentally, the Garden Reach-Metiabruz zone, with most of its wards falling within the vulnerable list of WHO, has seen the booth-day number rising to 27,090 from 20,418 in the previous round.																								Iqbal Gazi, chairman of borough XV, attributed the improved showing to the effort put in by Unicef and the NGO enlisted by it for social mobilisation in all nine wards of the region.																								The Environment Governed Integrated Organisation (EnGIO) followed a unique election model in polio campaigning with local field workers, selected by councillors, taking out processions, putting up banners and posters and going door-to-door to convert the non-compliant households by simulating an electoral campaigning process. And it has definitely worked, said Gazi.																								Debasish Kumar, chairman of borough VII and Trinamul Congress leader, agrees with his CPM counterpart. The television appearance of stars may have had some impact, but proper social mobilisation on the streets is far more useful, he observed. We had arranged a polio picnic, with more than 100 slum children, in ward number 85. It won the appreciation of even the Unicef country health chief, who attended it, said Kumar.																								EnGIO representatives said the networking of available resources, including involvement of local leaders, was responsible for the success of the novel anti-polio programme.																								Public health experts, however, stressed that the good work has to be continued, especially in routine immunisation. There is no doubt that routine immunisation is still a weak area, even in Calcutta.

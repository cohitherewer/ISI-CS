The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Poll trail shines with stars
Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Does the participation of non-political personalities enhance/diminish the appeal of the elections? More answers will be printed next week				 What people want: Pretty faces or political acumen?Susanta Kumar Bedajna,
KB Sarani. 
The participation of non-political personalities will surely enhance the appeal of the elections as people have lost faith in political parties. They want to be rid of opportunistic alliances between politicians who are least concerned with the interests of the common people.Virendra Shah,
Amratala Lane. 
Non-political personalities can boast of a clean image, unlike the politicians, for the respect they have earned for their expertise in specific fields. Its time some fresh blood is injected into the nations machinery. People from the glamour world dont necessarily turn out to be assets, but they are in some ways better than the politicians and their descendants who are bereft of any principles or morality. Rounak Pal,
Birati. 
Non-political candidates will certainly be able to pull in a large number of people during the poll campaigns, but doubt lingers on whether their participation will at all bring about a change in our problematic lives. Do politicians think we are foolish enough to be swayed by pretty faces from the glamour world? Elections will be meaningful only if the political parties fight on their own merits, and not on borrowed splendour. Piyal Mukherjee,
Lake Town. 
Most political leaders are biased and are busy safeguarding their interests when in power. One can assume that eminent citizens, not related to politics, will spare a thought for our problems as well and will retain the basic objectives of a democratic nation. Tapash Chakraborty,
Hooghly. 
The participation of non-political personalities will certainly add glamour, but diminish the importance of politics. All major parties are roping in showbiz people as an election stunt. Several film stars are earning in lakhs by just appearing on the dais and waving at the crowds. The entire electoral process has been reduced to a sham. The practice should immediately be checked.Debaprasad Bhattacharyya,
Sonarpur. 
Film stars may have a loyal fan following, but when it comes to the polls, the public tends to think differently. The glamour world fails to influence people when they cast their votes; its the issues and agenda they have in mind. Participation of non-political personalities in the elections will only draw in the crowds, but not leave a mark on the ballot box.Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,
Barasat. 
We have a tendency to idolise members of the film, cricket and music worlds. We may jostle in a crowd to catch a glimpse of our favourite stars and applaud their sugar-coated speeches, but while casting our votes we will exercise our judgment. The bunch of cinestars and beauty queens parading at the poll campaigns have minimal impact on the Indian electoral process. They cannot woo voters. Arunava Bose Chowdhury,
Barrackpore. 
Present day politics is mired in corruption and lies. It cant be compared to that of the past when people from all sections of society voluntarily stepped in to serve the country. When not consolidating their financial positions, our politicians, for most of the time, are busy slinging mud at each other. Due to their inexperience, non-political personalities are manipulated by hardened politicians. Their presence will not serve much purpose.Satyen Biswas,
Behala. 
Non-political personalities should steer clear of the rat race to power. Politics is not an easy game that everybody can play. An occasional dose of glamour can never bear any fruit.Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 
Entally. 
The presence of non-political personalities certainly enhances the appeal of the elections. Political parties rope them in to woo the masses. Eminent citizens entering the political rat race is fine, as long as they remain the means and not the cause for pulling in the votes. Being a non-political personality does not disqualify him or her from campaigning for or contesting elections. Those wanting to serve the people without vested interests are most welcome. With their dedicated approach, its easier for them to win the confidence of the people.Manasi Chakraborty,
Behala. 
A dash of glamour is not enough to rule the country. Seasoned politicians who know the pulse of the people are more reliable for the job.Biman Saha,
Lake Town. 
Non-political personalities enhance the appeal of the elections as long as they are acquainted with the rules of the game. But unfortunately, most of them are inexperienced and remain mere puppets in the hands of the bigwigs after winning the polls. Politicians are never far in cashing in on their popularity. Such candidates fail to leave an impact on the common people.A.F.K. Ahmed,
Hooghly. 
Politics has turned out to be a lucrative profession in our country. From chartered accountants to beauty queens and social activists, everybody is in the fray to do their bit for the people. Non-political personalities will at least bring a change in the murky world of politics. Madhabi D. Ghosh,
Salt Lake. 
The presence of non-political personalities in poll propaganda surely does not diminish the appeal of the elections. But the extent to which they affect the voters is something to be pondered. Most political parties seem to think Bollywood stars can lure people to cast votes for the parties they are campaigning for. But this is a wrong observation.

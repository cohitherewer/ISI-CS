 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Hanging need not hang fire
 																											- Time up for filing fresh pleas, Dhananjoy seeks to meet kin OUR BUREAU																								Dhananjoy Chatterjee can go to the gallows any time now. 																								Technically, he can be hanged any time  even tomorrow. We do not have to wait for three to four weeks to carry out the execution order, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Friday.																								However, it will have to be executed in accordance with certain procedures, and it is due to this that the hanging cannot take place very soon either, he added. 																								After the date is set, the superintendent of Alipore Central jail will have to return the earlier execution warrant and ask for a fresh one from Alipore additional district and sessions judges court. 																								The district magistrate of South 24 Parganas -Alipore Central jail is under his jurisdiction  will be asked to inform Dhananjoy and his family about the date of execution. 																								An executive magistrate and a medical officer will also have to be informed, so that they can be present to witness the hanging, as recommended. 																								Following the Centres note that the President had rejected Dhananjoys mercy petition, officials at Writers Buildings started working on a speedy procedure. 																								It was concluded on Friday that three to four weeks is not necessary to carry out the order, as had been presumed earlier. 																								The idea is to give the condemned prisoner time to file a fresh petition, and thus, the date of hanging is usually fixed three to four weeks later. In Dhananjoys case, however, he has already exhausted all the possible avenues of mercy petitions, an official explained. 																								Home secretary Deb added that adequate security arrangements had been made at Dhananjoys cell and house. 																								For the first time in the past three months, during which his fate veered between life imprisonment and execution, Dhananjoy on Friday expressed the wish to meet his relatives and wife Purnima. 																								Six weeks ago, the same man had declined to meet them.																								Please inform my relatives and ask them to bring Purnima. I cant even remember her face clearly, Dhananjoy told a jail official on Friday over breakfast.																								He has not seen Purnima since the day he came here, said an officer of Alipore Central jail.																								But this time he wants to, and we have informed the jail department accordingly, he added.																								Doctors on Friday carried out another round of medical examinations and found Dhananjoy fit. 																								He only lost his cool when a certain senior jail official came in front of his cell. Dhananjoy charged the official with misleading him about his fate.

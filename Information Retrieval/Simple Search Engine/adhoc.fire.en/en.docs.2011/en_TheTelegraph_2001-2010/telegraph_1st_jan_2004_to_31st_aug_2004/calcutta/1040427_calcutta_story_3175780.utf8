 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Lawyers defer boycott
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								High court lawyers have pushed back by a week their Tuesday programme to boycott the chief justices court. The defer decision was taken at a meeting of the Bar Association on Monday, following some initiatives taken by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur to concede their demands.																								Last Friday, the association had decided that nearly 1,400 members would boycott the chief justices court from April 27 to press long-pending demands, including more division benches to hear writ appeals and more amenities in the high court.																								After Fridays resolution, Chief Justice Mathur and other judges toured the court and assured the lawyers that their demand for more amenities, including proper seating arrangements, would be met. 																								On Sunday, he met representatives of three organisations of the lawyers  Bar Association, Bar Library Club and Incorporate Law Society. Later, Bar Association leaders claimed Chief Justice Mathur had admitted that their complaint on writ appeal courts was genuine. There is only one writ appeal court now, presided over by the chief justice himself. 																								On Monday, when lawyers were told about the outcome of the talks with the chief justice, most felt it prudent to give him time.

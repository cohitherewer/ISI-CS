The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Sip, snip amp; surf, Park Streets Wi-Fi
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE																								Come September, and Park Street will be more than just hi-fi  itll be Wi-Fi. Whether parked in your car, hanging around before a hair-cut or waiting for a cup of coffee, you can surf the Net for free.																								Well, thats the promise held out by two separate addresses on the citys entertainment street, out to offer wireless fidelity access to all those with a compatible laptop or palmtop.																								Target zone one for the tech crazy  but in groups of 10, please  would be the Park Street-Camac Street intersection, where Optima Infotech, a computer equipment store, would allow passersby to log on to their wireless Internet network and surf the Net.																								We want Wi-Fi to catch on in the city, says Anil Bader of Optima. The 512 kbps DSL Internet connection that we have is more than enough for us, he explains, and the extra bandwidth can easily be shared with others.																								Baders network, to be set up by September, would cover a radius of 100 metres and be able to accommodate around 10 people at one time, with fixed access speeds and duration.																								All one needs to do is be within the radius and send a request to use our network, adds Bader, who would be installing two to three access points to extend the range of the network.																								Next up in the Net gain game is Barista, poised to offer wireless Internet access before the Pujas. We are introducing both wired and wireless Internet access service for our customers, says Brotin Banerjee, marketing head of the coffee chain. The happy e-zone: within a radius of 20 metres.																								Most of Baristas Calcutta outlets (definitely Park Street) would be covered in Phase-I of the Internet plans, that would finally stretch to 60-70 outlets in several metros.																								Wi-Fi, or wireless fidelity, has been the rage over the past two years in the US. It works on 802.11b, a standard developed by the international organisation Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) for wireless local area networks.																								802.11b works on radio frequency and utilises the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum (a free spectrum in most countries) to transfer data up to a maximum speed of 11 mega bits per second (Mbps).																								The network can be used in offices and homes for hassle-free connectivity, eliminating the need for wires and cables. Airports around the world have begun to offer free Internet access to travellers through Wi-Fi, as have snack stops such as McDonalds and Starbucks in the US.																								So, next time youre headed for Park Street, dont leave your laptop behind.

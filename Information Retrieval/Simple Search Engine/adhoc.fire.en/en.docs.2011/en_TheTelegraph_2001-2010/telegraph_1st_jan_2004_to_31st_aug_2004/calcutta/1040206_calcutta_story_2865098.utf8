 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Soha Ali Khan: Slogs the secret. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Phul tola je amar bhalobasha. Bhalobashay ki jor khatey? The first lines she had to speak as Kamallata at the mahurat shot for Ebong Srikanta flowed out with a studied fluency. My mom says I am good for a newcomer to the language. My Os and Ous do not carry a Hindi accent, smiles Soha Ali Khan, visibly proud of the language certificate from mother Sharmila Tagore.																								Having chosen to debut in filmdom with a Bengali film, a la mom, Soha knows she must get her act absolutely right. For more reasons than one. My mother had wanted me to learn the piano as a child, but it was a disastrous experience. She still complains: Wholl play for me when I am old? I cannot let her down this time.																								One look at the spitting image of Sharmila in Apur Sansar and you know shes her mothers daughter. People tell me so, but I also have a lot of my father in me, pronounces the youngest sibling in the Pataudi home.																								Years after elder brother Saif took the plunge under the arclights, Sohas time has come now, leaving Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi confused with our fascination for films. Only Saba, the second child, has stuck to her own thing  jewellery designing. But father is also very supportive. He tells us that we must work hard at whatever we do.																								So, slog is the sole criterion that decides her choice of screen favourites. It is my brother (who she now lives with in Mumbai). Genuinely. He is so distinctively different and puts in honest effort behind his work.																								But when it comes to actresses, theres no beating mom, who she has seen and loved in Debi and Abar Aranye.																								And the chance to go shoot in Santiniketan next week is an experience Soha is really looking forward to. I am aware of Tagore being part of my family and I have heard so much about the place from mom, she says.																								Soha has not read Saratchandra Chattopadhyays novel but she is keen to watch Suchitra Sens potrayal of Kamallata. Our adaptation is going to be a different interpretation, but I am curious to see her in the film.																								Neither has she watched Saanjhbatir Roopkathara, director Anjan Das earlier venture, but then again mom had heard of him. Though her first signing was Anant Mahadevans Dil Maange More opposite Shahid Kapoor, producer Dipak Bajajs Ebong Srikanta will be Sohas first release, with shooting set to be wrapped up by the end of the month.

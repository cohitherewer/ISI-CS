 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Full marks make debut
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The results of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and the Indian School Certificate (ISC) 2004, declared on Tuesday, saw many high-performing examinees in Calcutta scaling new heights.																								For, hundred out of 100 is the new mark of success.																								After nearly three decades  that is, ever since the two examinations were introduced in the mid-Seventies  the Delhi-based Indian Council for School Certificate Examinations has allowed the system of awarding 100 per cent marks to examinees deserving full marks in any subject.																								The council had introduced the system of not awarding a full 100 marks to students in the past, as it had felt it was necessary at that time. The council took the decision to change its policy and has done justice to students by awarding 100 per cent marks. The interests of our students are our most important concern, said Francis Fanthome, chief executive and secretary of the council, over the telephone. 																								Never before has the council, as a matter of policy, awarded full marks to students in any subject, including mathematics, even if the examinees answered all the questions correctly in a certain paper. 																								At least a single mark was deducted if any student scored a full 100. That is, 99 out of 100 was the maximum marks that any student could actually get in ICSE and ISC -- till last year.																								We thank the council, as it had promptly responded to the demands of teachers and students of ICSE and ISC schools and awarded full marks to the deserving candidates this year, D.K. Bhattacharya, a senior teacher of mathematics of La Martiniere School for Boys, said. 																								Bhattacharya is general secretary of the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools in Calcutta.																								I am happy to see that at least three examinees in ICSE and ISC from our institution alone have scored 100 out of 100 in mathematics, Bhattacharya added.																								The association had recently adopted a resolution demanding that the council abolish the system of deducting at least a single mark even if a student scored 100 out of 100 in any subject. It had sent a letter to the council for approval at its headquarters in Delhi.

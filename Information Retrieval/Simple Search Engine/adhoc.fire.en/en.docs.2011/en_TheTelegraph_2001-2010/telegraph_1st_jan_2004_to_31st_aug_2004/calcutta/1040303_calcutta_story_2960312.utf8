The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004  Madan MitraMadan Mitra								President, Progressive Taximens Union																																							Extra night charges are prevalent in all major cities of India. Even in Calcutta, it is customary to pay double to ambulances and hearses on long journeys. The same logic holds for taxis that travel at night, from say Bhowanipore to Salt Lake. If the taxi waits for a passenger, he is at risk, such is the law-and-order situation now. So, since the return journey is expected to be without a passenger, it is only fair that the person hailing the cab bears at least half of the cost of the return journey.

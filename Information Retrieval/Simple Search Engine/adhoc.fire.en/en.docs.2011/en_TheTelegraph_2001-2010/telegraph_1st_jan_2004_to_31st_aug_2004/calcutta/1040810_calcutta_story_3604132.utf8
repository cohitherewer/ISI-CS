The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Mom-again Madhuri out till 06
 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Madhuri Dixit: Motherhood first																								First, the dilemma over delayed dates. Then, hushed whispers of hiked rates. Now, the word is out  supermom Madhuri Dixit is expecting her second child and has pulled out of all films till 2006.																								This robs Calcutta of its date with the Bollywood beauty, now settled in the US, who was to have spent the Puja month here for Buddhadeb Dasguptas Hridayer Katha. The film, with an October-November schedule, had Jhamu Lagaan Sugandh as producer and Prosenjit as leading man.																								Other projects set back by the Madhuri motherhood syndrome include Somnath Leela Sens untitled film, starring Amitabh Bachchan, and Kamal Hasans bilingual feature.																								The Madhuri camp was guarded in its response. Yes, she is pregnant, confirmed the stars secretary Rakesh Nath from Mumbai. But I am not aware of the projects she has dropped out of, he added.																								Last week, the Mumbai film industry was abuzz with talk of Madhuri demanding a few crores for each film. From the first meeting I had with her, Madhuri seemed very keen on doing the film with me. She had stressed that money wasnt a factor at all. So, I was a bit surprised when her secretary conveyed the message that she was demanding an astronomical sum as far as Bengali films are concerned, Dasgupta said on Monday.																								Mother of one-year-old Areen, Madhuri was to have played a talented but dissatisfied actress, in search of a role that would help realise her potential. It almost mirrored a personal quest in her artistic life, felt the film-maker, who has been forced to work on a different script for his next film.																								It wouldnt be possible to cast Madhuri in the same role after 2006, because she would be touching 40 by then. But I am very happy to know that she is becoming a mother again, said Dasgupta.																								Another city film-maker resigned to life without Madhuri is Rituparno Ghosh, who was all set to cast her opposite Amitabh Bachchan for his winter venture till very recently. She was very keen to work in the project, but her secretary kept pushing back the dates. Now the reason becomes clear, he said. The maker of Chokher Bali wondered whether this marked the end of Madhuri magic. She is a phenomenal actress but I doubt if she will be allowed to make another dignified comeback, rued Ghosh.

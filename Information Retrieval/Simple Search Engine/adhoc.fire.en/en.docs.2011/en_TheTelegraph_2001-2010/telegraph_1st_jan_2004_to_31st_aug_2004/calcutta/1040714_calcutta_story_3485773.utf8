 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Council junks mayor house amnesty plan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tempers ran high on Tuesday in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), with most mayoral council members opposing mayor Subrata Mukherjees move to legalise unauthorised buildings. 																								While Mukherjees argument is that the illegal buildings  250,000 in Calcutta  cannot be torn down because their owners will move court and secure stay orders for years, his critics say it is a dangerous decision. They fear the subsequent civic board may put all such legalised buildings under a CID or CBI scanner.																								The seeds of discontent were sown during Fridays meeting of the mayoral council, at which members like Anup Chatterjee, Javed Ahmed Khan, Swapan Samaddar, Mala Roy and Samsuzzaman Ansari forced mayor Mukherjee to defer a discussion on the legalisation move.																								They said builders would cite the amnesty as a precedent and the city would see a boom in illegal constructions. 																								According to CMC estimates, at least 300 illegal constructions are being carried out at any point of time in the city. 																								Mukherjee, however, had his own logic. It is physically impossible to pull down two lakh-plus structures. But the inhabitants of these buildings are enjoying all civic facilities, including drainage, roads, water and conservancy. I think it is only practical to earn revenue by giving them a chance to legalise their structures, he reasoned.																								The mayor cited the example of a 10-storeyed residential-cum-commercial estate at 174, CR Avenue, which could not be demolished for the past six years despite a Supreme Court order. 																								A lot of problems cropped up. First, the building is in a congested area and difficult to demolish. There are also a large number of residences, offices and a market in the building, said Mukherjee.																								The mayor proposed last Friday to extend the scope of the term existing building, mentioned in Rule 72 of the CMC building rules. He suggested that the definition be altered to allow additions and alterations to include structures constructed without plans sanctioned by the CMC.																								From the mayors point of view, it would be practical to legalise these buildings and earn immediate revenue. At least Rs 100 crore could be realised by legalising the structures and allowing further construction on them, he pointed out.																								 The mayors step will encourage illegal constructions. It will also allow a section of promoters to construct buildings in flagrant violation of rules, said council member Javed Khan.																								His colleague Chatterjee said there was no use having a set of building rules at all. Before implementing the mayors suggestion, lets scrap the rulebook, he said. The law allows special consideration only for buildings in colony areas that had come up before 1995, he pointed out.

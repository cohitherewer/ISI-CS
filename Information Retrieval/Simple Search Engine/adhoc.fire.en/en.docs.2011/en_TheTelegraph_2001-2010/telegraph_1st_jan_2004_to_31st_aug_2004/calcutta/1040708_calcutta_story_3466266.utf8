 Thursday, July 08, 2004  Pasta pleasures HIMIKA CHAUDHURI Gourmet expert Karen Anand stirs up an Italian delicacy at a cookery workshop at the ITC Sonar Bangla on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal												Italian cuisine seems to have caught the fancy of food connoisseurs of Calcutta of late. Not only are Italian restaurants mushrooming across the city, recipes from the land of pastas and pizzas are the biggest hits at any cookery workshop. The latest of these, a four-day meet with gourmet specialist Karen Anand, kicked off at ITC Sonar Bangla on Tuesday afternoon with some basics of pasta making.																					The Spa Caf at the hotel was simmering over with gourmet enthusiasts of all ages, eager to learn the secrets behind authentic Italian cooking. 																					Karen started the session with recipes for two basic Italian sauces  Ragu, a basic sauce for pizza and many pasta dishes and Arrabbiata, a spicy tomato sauce. The sauces over with, she moved on to Lemon Pasta with Asparagus and Herbs and the all time favourite, Porcini Risotto, a delicacy made of Porcini mushrooms and Arborio rice from Italy.The lady who has penned a number of cookbooks, punctuated the highly interactive session with useful tips on the basics of cooking Italian food. Always cook pasta in plenty of boiling water (approximately three litres to a packet); sprinkle cheese and never stir it through; while boiling pasta make sure that the centre is a bit hard as it will soften when you cook it with the sauce, were some of her pointers.																					Wednesday afternoon, the second day of the workshop, was devoted to Mediterranean dips and starters, where Karen dished out recipes of five appetisers and also talked about serving etiquette and presentation. The workshop will deal with healthy low fat cooking with tofu on Thursday and soups and salads on Friday. Held in association with Olive Tree, a cooking ingredients company, the workshop has travelled to Bangalore before coming to town and will do the rounds of Mumbai and Chennai, too. quot;I like to conduct workshops in Calcutta because here people are passionate about food. In many other cities I have seen that people are unaware about exotic ingredients. But here, everyone seems to be familiar with them. Even the men take a lot of interest in cooking, said Karen, who will soon be back on television with a new cookery show. The new show will deal with easy recipes for men who want to cook. I have compiled a book on these recipes called Simple Cooking for Stupid Men. The show, which will go on air in October or November, is in Hindi, so it might have a different title.																					Beauty basics																					 Beauty tips never bore women, and when they come from a veteran like June Tomkyns, a packed hall is only to be expected. Even on a rainy Tuesday, Phoenix Hall at Saturday Club did not prove an exception.																					Omega 3, a company retailing the Dead Sea range of beauty products called Mineral Line, organised a one-hour session on skincare for club members. June Tomkyns, who retails the range from her Ballygunge Circular Road salon, demonstrated the correct use of the products on models Sheena and Ishika. She also gave Sheena a makeover to demonstrate how the makeup looks after the skin has been cleaned using such a treatment.																					The thrust of the session was on anti-ageing techniques. Many people think wrinkles are inevitable and they will appear with age. But this is not true. One can avoid wrinkles with a simple but regular skincare routine, says Tomkyns. George and Lee Alison Sibley at the celebrations. Picture by Rashbehari Das												The suns rays are the single largest cause for wrinkles and to protect the skin from the sun by using a sunscreen lotion daily is of utmost importance, she informs. One has to use a sunscreen lotion while going out throughout the year, no matter whether its summer or winter. Contrary to what most people believe, the winter sun is as harmful for the skin as the summer, she adds, naming the second enemy of the skin  cigarette smoke. 																					A good twice-a-day skincare routine is what she recommends to fight wrinkles. This has to start with cleaning the skin with a deep-cleansing product. For those with oily skin, Tomkyns recommends a gel cleanser, while those with normal or dry skin can opt for a lotion cleanser. After cleaning, all traces of the cleanser have to be removed with the help of a toner. The next step is to moisturise. A moisturiser is essential throughout the year, as it traps the moisture in the skin, says Tomkyns.																					Apart from this daily schedule, she suggests the use of a facial scrub once a week to boost blood circulation. It is necessary that you pamper your skin at least once a month with a facial. Also, be very gentle and careful while applying any product. Never drag the skin, always pat dry, recommends the ace beautician.Out for I-Day																					 For the first time, the fourth of July  or US independence day  ventured out of the consulate walls and into the city. George . Sibley and wife Lee Alison hosted a star-spangled bash at The Park on Sunday. 																					The citys consular corp turned out in numbers, as did industrialists and the usual faces from the cultural circuit. 																					Lee Alison sang the national anthems of both the US and India, before Skinny Alley took over the entertainment. Also keeping guests busy was a carefully selected menu of all-American food, with a few Indian highlights spicing things up. The selection included Nachos, Mini Lamb Burgers with Ranchero Sauce, Ranch Fried Chicken, Mini Hotdogs and Burgers, Corn on the Cob, Re-fried Bean Bake with Jack Cheese, and for some variation, Malai Fish Kebab. In keeping with the theme of the bash, dessert was a stunning stars-and-stripes cake. Bhaichung Bhutia at a mens wear promotion at Shoppers Stop in City Centre on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												In vogue																					 Whether its on field or off it, Indias only soccer star knows how to carry himself in style. Bhaichung Bhutia, who is still one of the countrys most eligible bachelors, knows exactly what his sexy gelled hair, his translucent white linen shirts, and his little pout can do to the woman brigade of the country.																					On Wednesday evening when the Sikkimese show-stealer landed up at Shoppers Stop in City Centre to launch the retail chains national promotion for mens wear, the scene was no different. I will never forget this day in my life. Bhaichung liked the T-shirt I chose from the racks for him and he has agreed to wear it! an excited lady customer care executive on the shop floor gushed to half-a-dozen of her colleagues.																					As eager eyes followed each move that the little, ever-smiling man made, Bhutia obliged one and all, happily signing an autograph or waving out to a known face in the crowd.																					Changing quickly from one outfit to the other (his TV experience must have come in handy here) with practised professionalism, he obliged the overflowing media crew posing all over the venue without raising an eyebrow. 																					I think Shoppers Stop coming to Salt Lake is a great relief for people in the north who can now buy stylish clothes at reasonable prices, pointed out Bhaichung. 																					I think the people of north Calcutta need to redo their wardrobe and pamper themselves with nice clothes, he added with a naughty smile.																					The Men in Vogue promotion, which will run across all Shoppers Stop stores in the country till July 25, will make buyers shelling out more than Rs 2,000 on a single bill eligible for gifts through a lucky draw.

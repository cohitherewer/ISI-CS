		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 A patch of green where kids can play
 The new park for the children of ward  no. 30. Pictures by Kishor Roy chowdhury Madhusudan Agarwal: We hear  that a swimming pool and a childrens park are coming up  in the area. What is the current status of the project? 																																																													This area is not a planned one. It has many residential complexes, but hardly any playground for the children. Vivek Udyan, on North Road, isnt large enough to accommodate all of them, so we decided to go in for another. A newly-acquired plot on Dhanadevi Khanna Road, next to Sabuj Sikha Club, will be developed into a playground for children. We have earmarked Rs12 lakh for the park. It will take some time to complete as the plot is dotted with shanties, from which the dwellers have to be evicted. Frankly speaking, the swimming pool is second on our priority list. But it will be completed in due course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Camera as chronicler(From top) A file picture of Mother Teresa by Raghu Rai, two survivors of the Bhopal gas tragedy at Seagull, and the lensman in the city. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				 																																																											For someone, whose lens has been drawn for decades to the basic human fabric in the heart of his favourite city, machher paturi at Bhojohori Manna has been a revelation this time.				 																																																											In the city now with his exhibition Exposure: Portrait of a corporate crime  photographs of the Bhopal disaster, Raghu Rai hardly needs an excuse to sit down for a chat. And it inevitably meanders from the power of expression of Calcutta and the endless challenge it poses to the lensman in him to his exhibition and the tenet of honesty and sensitivity, intrinsic to his camera.				 																																																											Calcutta, with its intense vibrancy has inspired me for years, says Rai, settling down in the library of Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre. Globalisation is here, you can feel it in the malls, and all the glitz. However, it is not the big, loud and gorgeous that is beautiful about the city, but the little moments of glory and strength in the peoples day-to-day lives. This is the intrinsic charm of life that Satyajit Ray explored. And which is why, Rai feels, Pather Panchali is forever and maybe Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Devdas is not.				 																																																											I come to Calcutta seven to eight times a year  wander the streets, try to look under the veneer of the city and always find what I want, says Rai. And with a sudden smile, a fleeting ray of hope or an unexpected hint of a storm, Calcutta never disappoints him. The Pujas enchant him and he loves visiting Kumartuli. It is fascinating to watch the limbs of the Goddess strewn around, headpieces haphazardly kept, before the idol is ready. This reminds him of a Mexican tribe. They pray intensely to the random idols and if their wishes are not granted, they tear down their own god, limb by limb. Kumartuli gives me a similar sense of man controlling his own god.				 																																																											Accompanying him to Calcutta this time are Rashida Bee and Champa Devi, two Union Carbide disaster survivors from Bhopal. They are just two of the thousands whose lives were affected by the gas calamity. If 9/11 killed about 3,500 people, the Bhopal gas tragedy has killed over 20,000. Many more are still waiting for a slow death, says Rai, for whom photography is a means of keeping track of time and writing history. 				 																																																											His lens has captured eloquent pictures of the Bhopal that was and what it has been since, till today. Families were wiped out, mothers lost the babies in their wombs, people are dying even now, he says, pointing at the frame of a smiling, demure almost-grown-up Gas Devi, who was born the same day the disaster struck. 				 																																																											She is a tough girl, muses Rai, now busy working on a volume on classical musicians of India. And of course, I will keep shooting Calcutta for that, he smiles.Rajrupa GhoshSitting pretty				 																																																											Ads? Fine. Music videos? Ok. Films? Not given a thought yet. Thats Tupur Chatterjee, who loves romancing the ramp the best. My job is to carry off a fancy dress as gracefully as a simple one. But I need to be comfortable with what I am wearing. Otherwise, I dont accept assignments, no matter how large the amount of money being offered to me is, says she, breezing through town for a fashion show with designer Abhishek Dutta.				 																																																											A filmi song number is on the cards, but thats not a so-called item number, swears the girl whose chiselled face, long legs and dusky skin tone make her a designers darling. 				 																																																											But hasnt the acting bug ever bitten this grand-daughter of film-maker Basu Chatterjee? Wouldnt have the directing bug been more apt? retorts Tupur, with a sly smile.

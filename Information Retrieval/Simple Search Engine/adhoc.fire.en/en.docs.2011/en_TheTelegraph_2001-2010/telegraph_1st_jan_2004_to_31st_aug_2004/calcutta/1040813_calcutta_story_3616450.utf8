 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Mother, three kids charred
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Nurul Afsana Bibi, 25, set her room on fire, killing herself and her three children. The incident took place at Shanapara, in Howrahs Bankra area, on Wednesday night. 																								Neighbours said Afsana Bibi was charred to death on the spot. Her children  Bobby Khatun, 8, Chhobi Khatun, 6, and Baby Khatun, 4  were taken to Howrah district hospital with 80 per cent burns. They died early on Thursday.																								The children were burnt beyond recognition when they were brought to hospital, said a doctor who treated the siblings. 																								Preliminary investigations confirmed that Afsana had committed suicide. But the cops are in the dark about the motive that prompted the mother of three to kill her children and herself. 																								The post-mortem report and further probes will reveal the truth, said Howrah superintendent of police (SP) Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya. 																								In search of clues, police interrogated Afsanas husband Rafikul Mollah on Thursday. Mollah is a butcher. SP Bhattacharya said Mollah was in his shop when the room was set ablaze. He admitted that the Mollahs were popular in the locality.

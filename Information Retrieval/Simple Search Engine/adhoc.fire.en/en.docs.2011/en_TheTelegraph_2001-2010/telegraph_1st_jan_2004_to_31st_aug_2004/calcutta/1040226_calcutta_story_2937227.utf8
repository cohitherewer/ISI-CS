A Thought for Food / Specialities of the New Market area				 	 Sudarshana (left) and Antara with some of the specialities from Blue and Beyond and (below) customers enjoy sandwiches from Ma Kali Stores																								There was a time when shopping in Calcutta was synonymous with a visit to the New Market. Today, with shopping malls and supermarkets mushrooming everywhere in the city, New Markets popularity has taken a beating (if only to a certain extent). But it still remains the preferred shopping destination of many. The area is also the cinema district of Calcutta with most of the movie halls screening English films being located here.Where there is cinema and shopping, can food be far behind? A number of food hubs right from fine-dinning restaurants to street-side stalls, serving almost every kind of food available, dot the area. These cater to thousands of people, many of them tourists, who throng the area around the New Market every day.Cool and classy There arent many fine- dining restaurants in the area, but among the few, Blue and Beyond on the ninth floor of Hotel Lindsay, deserves special mention. The 106-seater restaurant and bar specialises in Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisine. Mongolian Roast Lamb, Thread-it Chicken and Pepper-blast Prawns are the must-try dishes if you visit the restaurant. The incredible view of the Calcutta skyline that Blue and Beyond offers might just tilt the scales in its favour over the other multicuisine restaurant in the vicinity  The Princess on Free School Street, beside Kathleen. If you dont mind a short walk after a bout of shopping or a movie, theres also Zaranj and Jongs near the Indian Museum, on Jawaharlal Nehru Road. The Mughal eraIf youre in the mood for Mughlai food, try out Aminia near the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, on the road leading to Chaplin cinema. Your choices of chap, rezala and biryani are all available here and that too, at reasonable rates. Although Aminia can hardly be called a fine-dining restaurant, it is a pleasant enough place to take your family for lunch or dinner. Beside Aminia, opposite Chaplin, is the legendary Nizam, which has sadly, downed its shutters for now. A taste of Bengal Its a bit difficult to find restaurants serving authentic Bengali food in other parts of Calcutta, but not in the New Market area. On Free School Street, near the Jamuna cinema, are a couple of restaurants dishing out Bengali delicacies to tourists and office-goers alike. Prince, which is the better-known of the two restaurants, serves such items as Dhakai Murg Pulao and Lau Chingrir Murighanto. Says Bhupendra Saha, one of the owners of Prince, Foodies from all over the city visit us for meals. Our specialities are the fish preparations and on any given day, we offer a choice of a dozen fish dishes. If a breakfast of Bhuna Khichuri also interests you, this is the place to visit. Street-wiseNo other place in Calcutta offers as much choice of street food as the New Market area. The most prominent among the street food joints, which are located around the cinema halls, are the chaat and fruit juice places in front of New Empire and Lighthouse. Mostly frequented by youngsters, these also serve such items as chola-batura and dosas. To the left of the twin movie halls, along the road leading to Lindsay Street, theres another such eatery. About 50 yards further down the road, can be found a phuchkawallah, whose customers sometimes come from as far off as Santoshpur. The phuchkas here are a tad expensive compared to other parts of the city but that ceases to matter after you have placed the first dripping phuchka in your mouth.																								 Fast and furious																								If you prefer to rest your legs while having a snack or two, theres Rallies on Lindsay Street. Besides gorging on kulfis, idlis and burgers, you can down glassfuls of syrup and lassi here. Near Rallies, at the junction of Lindsay Street and Free School Street, is a very popular sandwich joint called Ma Kali Stores, which serves all kinds of sandwiches and burgers. The owner of the tiny place, which has been around for 40 years, M. Palui says, Over the years, the profile of our customers has changed. Initially, only the staff of nearby offices used to frequent our shop, but now its mostly tourists and youngsters who come here. The best bet in the area to satisfy a pizza craving is the Dominos outlet in the New Empire arcade. The place has recently put up some tables and chairs, thus enabling you to enjoy your pizza and bread sticks sitting down. You could also try out Scoop, behind New Empire. This has been a major haunt of teenagers for quite a few years now and offers most of the usual fast food items, though for a price. Its a cake-walk																								For confectionery aficionados, the New Market houses one of the oldest and most popular confectioners in the city: Nahoums. Old-timers swear by the Lemon Puffs and Black Forest Cakes sold at this quaint shop. Their wedding cakes are also much in demand. The Sugar and Spice outlet opposite Rallies, and Kathleen on Free School Street are the other confectioners to check out in the area. 						[+uc('Kaushik Ghosh Pix by Rashbehari Das')+]

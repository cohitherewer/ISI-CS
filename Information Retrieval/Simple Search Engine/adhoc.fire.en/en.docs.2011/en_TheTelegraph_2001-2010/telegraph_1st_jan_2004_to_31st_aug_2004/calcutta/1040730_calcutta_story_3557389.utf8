 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Final bloom and timely end
 Park Street represented a way of life and culture that died out soon after the Europeans bid adieu to the country, says Soumitra Das The brown sahib in me winced. The hunks, who paraded in and out of the gym in Queens Mansion to growl into their cell phones, wore their Tommy Hilfigers all right, and uniformly resembled Dirk in the popular comic strip Luann, but they spoke Hindi. Two, or maybe three generations ago, when Blyton and Biggles were the only pabulum that was thought fit for babas who went to English-medium schools, Hindi was considered declasse in Park Street, that occupied a mental space well beyond the actual thoroughfare. 																								It represented a leisurely, gracious and unhurried  and in retrospect, an artificial and ephemeral  way of life nurtured by the presence of the Europeans. That died a timely death soon after they said goodbye.																								The Park Street that my generation had seen in the Fifties up to the early Seventies, was that culture in its final bloom before it wilted as the city gradually plunged into chaos. Aided by the hallucinogen of nostalgia, we still look back in wonder. Park Street resembled a boulevard in the best of European traditions, when, as a one-time flaneur sums up: Beautiful Anglo-Indian women on one side. Beautiful Armenian women on the other.																								Now some points in the street have become haunts of derelict Anglo-Indians, who, frail of body and in tattered frocks or pants, look more pitiable than the others who seem to be quite content to live off the street. Armenians there are few, mostly an elderly lot, rarely seen in public.																								Designer and couturier Maggie Myers, who lives in Stephen Court, is the last of her kind in Park Street. Close to 90, she belonged to an upper class Jewish family, who owned landed property upcountry. One of her four sisters had married Murshidabad, a few blocks away. She had been trained in Paris, some say under the great Coco Chanel. Severely coiffed and perfectly turned out even today, she was the NIFT of Calcutta at a time when there was no NIFT, says one of her very successful former students.																								Miss Myers was also a psychic. She would look into a small crystal ball and tell people what the future held for them, helping them when she foresaw trouble. Of late, she has lost the crystal ball. Or did she forget where she kept it?																								The wimpled Irish nuns of Loreto House in Middleton Row and the Belgian and French Jesuits of St Xaviers College opposite the thana have become names to be conjured with in these two educational institutions their orders set up over a century ago. These fathers in their fluttering white cassocks were often seen sailing down the street on their bicycles. Known for the personal interest they took in every student, some of them, however, were martinets recalled with terror.																								A former professor of the B.Com department of St Xaviers, who was also a student of the same institution, remembers how they would go to Loreto to court their respective girlfriends during the break. Mother Superior had, perhaps, got wind. On one such occasion, a friend said to him Father Joris, who would haul truant students out of restaurants every morning, was standing next to him. Initially, our teacher refused to take this seriously. Then I suddenly saw a white cassock flapping next to me. The speed at which I sprinted back to my bench could have set a world record, he says.																								The adjective huge takes physical form in the flats of Queens Mansion. A gray-haired, paunchy man in his fifties, who has lived here nearly all his life, settles down into a chair as he mentally travels back to times when heavy engineering factories and shipyards boomed, and hordes of young men started their mercantile experience in Calcutta. Sixty-four to sixty-nine were the heydays of Park Street. If you were part of the crowd and not at Trincas between 3.30 and 7.30 during the evening jam session, your only excuse was that you were either in hospital with a broken leg or you were dead. Come December, and youngsters from all over Bangalore to Bombay congregated here. Even expats children would visit parents here. When we were kids, ayahs would be seen with their babas. Now you dont see them here. A whole generation is missing. They have moved out. 																								Most of the old bungalows have become highrises or offices of various degrees of ugliness. Yet Park Street can still boast five splendid and sprawling apartment blocks. The grandest of them is Queens Mansion, being given a facelift of late, whose wings embrace both Park Street and Russell Street. Stephen Court looks like a continuation of the Queens Mansion. No 20 is at the head of Middleton Row, and Karnani Mansion progresses into Free School Street, its Park Street wing housing two restaurants  Blue Fox and Mocambo  whose once famous live bands and crooners turned the road into the place for an evening out. Facing it is Park Mansion, a bastion of French culture till the night when a fire broke out, gutting the Alliance Francaise office and library, destroying the teak staircase of gate no 4, still locked up.																								During the monsoon, when an opalescent light appears fleetingly, one does not need poetic licence to say that Park Street looks uncannily like Gustave Caillebottes painting Paris, a Rainy Day. 																								Queens Mansion was originally called Galstaun Mansion, after the Armenian landholder, merchant and sportsman J.C. Galstaun. Its foundation was laid in 1920, and it was built in three years at a cost of Rs 65 lakh. It was renamed in 1952 at the coronation of the British sovereign. Today it is part of the estate of the LIC. After years of procrastination, when it was practically falling to pieces, LIC is getting it renovated, thereby giving the street itself a new face. 																								Karnani Mansion is a classic example of how disputes between landlords and tenants can condemn a mansion as large as this to perdition. Constructed in 1929-30, it was one of the classiest apartment blocks in the city, till it began to be associated with sleaze. Tenants turned flats into brothels and factories. Squatters hovels occupy the terrace and the stairs are never cleaned. Of late, the flesh trade has stopped but the factories are still very functional. No 20 Park Street always looks spick and span. Cricketer Sourav Ganguly is building a hotel where the servants quarters used to be.																								John Barry in his Calcutta Illustrated wrote that Armenian philanthropist T.M. Thaddeus had built Park Mansion in 1910 on the site of the former Doveton College. One of the first art galleries in the city opened on the first floor of this building in 1955 with exhibitions of Paritosh Sen, Gopal Ghosh and Prakash Karmakar. It is said that when Jeet Paul seemed to be buying up the street to set up The Park hotel on October 31, 1967, the industrialist asked a paanwalla, who owned a kiosk on the same spot how much he wanted for his shop. The paanwalla shot back: What do you want for your hotel? The Pauls acquired Park Mansion, which housed the fabled restaurant Skyroom, in the Eighties. Skyroom closed down in 1993 following labour problems.(To be concluded)

 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 City centre set for brand new look
 															- MoU inked on Curzon Park revival project, 120 days sought for feasibility report A STAFF REPORTER			The promise of a cleaner and greener  city centre was sealed with a memorandum of understanding  (MoU) at Writers Buildings on Wednesday. The MoU for the  Curzon Park redevelopment project was signed by the public  works department (PWD), two Singapore firms  Surbana International  (Consultants) Pte Ltd and Sembcorp Engineers and Constructors  Pte Ltd  and Pragati Growth and Development Ltd, a city-based  infrastructure solution-provider.																								The MoU was signed in the presence of state planning and development minister Nirupam Sen and PWD minister Amar Chowdhury, under the private-public partnership policy framework of the government. The grand revival scheme, blending pragmatism with aesthetics, (see box), has been conceptualised at an estimated cost of Rs 60 crore by architect-planner Dulal Mukherjee, at the behest of pressure group Concern for Calcutta.																								The consortium of the Singapore twins and Pragati has sought 120 days to prepare a techno-economic feasibility report and carry out a marketing-cum-financial viability exercise. As the independent professional agency, it will also help the government find investors for the project and, thereafter, oversee implementation through a bouquet of specialised services.																								International Enterprise Singapore Board (IE Singapore), under the ministry of trade and industry, will render assistance as and when necessary to Surbana and Sembcorp.																								After the signing ceremony, the Singapore delegation  including first secretary, commerce, Singapore high commission, Alan Tan called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The chief minister has invited us to participate in townships and expressway projects in Bengal and we are quite open to exploring avenues of cooperation, said Sembcorp senior vice-president Eric Goh.																								Sembcorp, a leading infrastructure company with close links to the Singapore government, will provide technical inputs towards management of cost and time in implementation of the Curzon Park revival project, expected to be completed within 24 months from the date of commencement of work. Surbana, a leading consultant in city planning, township and residential developments in Asia, will provide comprehensive and multi-disciplinary consultancy inputs.																								Wednesday evening saw another concrete step being taken to augment implementation of infrastructure projects in town, with Bengal Pragati Infrastructure Development Ltd, a joint venture with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, being floated.

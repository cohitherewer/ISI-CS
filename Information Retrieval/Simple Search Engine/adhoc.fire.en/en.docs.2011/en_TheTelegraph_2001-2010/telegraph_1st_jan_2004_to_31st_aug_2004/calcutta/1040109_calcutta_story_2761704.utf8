 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Exploring the heart of a city
																								Since birth we are compelled to bear the burden of our names and the names of places we are born in. In a way these are compulsions not borne out of choice. And each town or city or village has a tale of its own, a distinct character, an individuality that gets stuck to the bearer. Romantics feel a city has many facets, and like a diamond it transmits its inner radiance that is visible to those who care to see it. Artists often capture this brilliance on canvas, adding their own light and recreating haunting images or cityscapes. The current exhibition, Tale of a City, captures a plethora of subjects from abstract cityscapes to street-level human drama in an effort to capture the mind and heart of a vibrant city moving with the times.																								When: Till January 22 (except Sundays); 12 noon - 7.30 pm																								Where: Gallery Caps, 16, Jatin Bagchi Road

 PRONAB MONDAL																								We have to treat juveniles with sympathy. Show them your affection. Spend time with them. Talk to them and if they are being exploited, rescue them. They need our love and .																								The speaker was interrupted by four children, clad in tatters and carrying two trays laden with tumblers and teapots, who entered the briefing room of Lalbazar police headquarters. They doled out tea and snacks to each one in the room, from a sub-inspector to an IPS officer. After they left the room, the speaker continued his discourse on juvenile welfare.																								During a three-day training session on juvenile delinquents and juvenile welfare, four children from the police canteen at Lalbazar kept serving snacks and beverages to a batch of 50 participants. And surprisingly, none of the participants even tossed a hello at them.																								The training, a joint programme initiated by National Institute of Social Defence and the detective department, was focused on training police officers to counsel juvenile delinquents and help them back into the mainstream. The training will also deal with counselling street urchins, who run the risk of turning to crime or being exploited.																								Ten-year-old canteen boy Kartick Maity didnt have a clue about what was going on inside the closed room. In short pants and tattered sweater, Kartick shivered in the cold as he entered the room four times. But none of the policemen noticed it, because they were busy being educated on child welfare: The moment you notice a child shivering in the cold, give him warm clothes.																								Kartick has three colleagues  Bhola, Shambhu and Gurupada, all aged between 10 and 12. They, too, served tea to the policemen at the training session through Monday and Tuesday. All of them hail from Midnapore and have been working as canteen boys at Lalbazar for the past two years. During the crime conference and other routine meetings, these four boys are put on duty to supply what the participants want from tea and drinking water to cigarette packets.																								Bhola elaborated: Ekhane to majhe-modheyi meeting hoy. Ebar ki niye meeting hochhe janina (meetings are frequent here. I dont know this times agenda).																								When told the policemen were talking about children like himself and their problems, he smiled: Tai bujhi (really)?																								A senior Lalbazar official shrugged off all responsibility about child labour in the police headquarters. We are talking about children engaged in a profession harmful to their health. Working in a canteen or a tea-stall is not affecting their health. So, theres nothing wrong with the canteen at the Lalbazar police headquarters, he said.																								A section of officers at the briefing thinks the programme is mere eyewash. The initiative is a great idea. But following the guidelines is next to impossible. We have been told to build up a network in our own jurisdiction. But our normal duty schedule is too hectic. How can we manage time? asked an officer.																								A lady sub-inspector exclaimed: After duty, its difficult to find time for our own children. Wheres the time to care for streetchildren?

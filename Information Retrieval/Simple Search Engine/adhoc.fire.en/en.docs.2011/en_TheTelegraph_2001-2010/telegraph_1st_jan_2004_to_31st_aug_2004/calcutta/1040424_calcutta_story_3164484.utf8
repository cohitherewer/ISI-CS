 Saturday, April 24, 2004  Urban sound check SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND SOMA BANERJEE Actors Tota Roy Choudhury, Rituparna Sen and Swastika Mukhopadhyay at the screening of Le Pocha on Thursday. Picture by Rashbehari Das															The Park Street outlet of Caf Coffee Day was brewing over with action on Thursday night, with a screening of filmmaker Qaushiqs rockumentary on alternative contemporary Bengali music.																					We didnt want to do a usual documentary on the current Bangla music scene as very few people are interested in information-packed features. I would think twice before going for such a screening myself, says Qaushiq. So, the former adman hit upon the idea of stylised informal cinema that is not fiction but gets its point across with the help of dialogue and music. Titled Le Pocha, the documentary explores the boundaries of the Bengali alternative music movement right from the path-breaking 70s act Mohiner Ghoraguli pioneered by Goutam Chattopadhyay, more contemporary acts like Suman Chattopadhyay (now Kabir Suman), Chandrabindoo, Cactus, Fossils and singer Shilajit.																					Western music bands in the city were conspicuous by their absence. We have just concentrated on alternative, urban music native to Bengal, explains Qaushiq. After all, we are not an English-speaking country, he insists.																					The act might be local, but the audience was left pondering over the French-sounding title. Le Pocha is a Bengali street term, very popular in the 80s, meaning what the hell! explains Qaushiq.																					The evening started off with a five-minute, feel-good screening of coffee-shop culture by budding filmmaker Minu Agarwal, followed by the hour-long documentary. The film, jazzed up with live performances recorded at concerts, also threw in candid interviews with musicians, touching upon issues like creative freedom and art for arts sake, even if it meant antagonising the moral police.																					The struggle for survival and the endeavour to establish a niche audience was palpable even as most young musicians were happy to be doing their own thing, no matter what.																					We Bengalis are not malleable. As a society we are opposed to think niche, thats why we lose out on sub-cultures like the alternative Bengali music movement, feels Qaushiq. There are a number of talented musicians in the city but not enough audience. The form has stayed underground because of a lack of awareness about ways of life that are parallel to the mainstream, he adds, over a steaming cuppa.																					But the mood was largely buoyant, as captured by one of the musicians on film: A new generation has arrived in Bengal and they arent knocking at the door, they are kicking it! The new range at M.P. Jewellers. Picture by Aranya Sen 												Quick bite																					For those in between times, or even for those tummy-growling moments, office-goers and shoppers now have an air-conditioned option in the Esplanade area where they can tank up. Taste of India opened on Lenin Sarani on Thursday, targeting mainly office-goers.																					The trio of Sudhir Samanta, Subrata Dey and Rajesh Saha have tried to combine a sweet shop, chaat and roll take-away counter and restaurant into one, as well as offer free home delivery service within a three-km radius.																					We use the best quality ghee and refined oil available in the market, yet have kept the prices amazingly affordable, stresses Samanta. The prices are indeed reasonable, with fresh juices priced within Rs 20, kulfi  in kesar pista, chikoo, grape and mango flavours  costing Rs 12 per plate, chaats available for Rs 20 per plate, rolls within Rs 30. Mutton biryani, the most expensive item on the menu comes for Rs 55. The kebabs and biryanis may be worth a try with most of the 15 chefs being roped in from Bedwin and Royal. Interesting snacks on the menu include fish fingers, singara chaat and chicken pakora, all priced within Rs 25. This 24-seater restaurant is open from 9 am to 9 pm, seven days a week.																																													Carat count																					 Traditional jewellers have been smartening up to the needs of the urban working woman, cosying up to her ever-powerful purse strings. Moving away from chunky ornaments that stay in bank lockers for the better part of their life, M.P. Jewellers at Gariahat has launched a lighter, 18 carat range for regular use, on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya. 																					Twenty-two carat gold becomes a little expensive for everyday wear. Thus, we have launched a new range in 18 carat, especially for working women, which has more in terms of variety and is definitely cheaper. We would have liked to do a 14 carat range as well, but it has no demand in our country, says manager Rudra Roy Choudhury.																					The new range features gold chains with pendants in a variety of shapes and sizes that come studded with semi-precious stones like amethyst, garnet, peridot, lapis lazuli and blue and yellow topaz.																					Some of the chains reflect a hint of white gold, which is actually a rhodium finish for a more contemporary look. Stand-alone beaded chains with a touch of enamel work have the same trendy appeal. Earring and pendant sets are a little on the chunkier side but work well for informal get-togethers and that odd impromptu party you might need to attend after work. While the chains with pendants are priced between Rs 2,000 and 5,000, the earring and pendant sets come for Rs 6,000-7,000.

People scattered across gently undulating greens  sitting in cars, on top of cars, on the grass  watching in horror as the world comes to a grisly end, munching on fries and knocking back a beer.																					This isnt a dark look at voyeurism; it is Calcuttas biggest brush with drive-in movie culture. As people helplessly watched the world come to an end on screen, the 18th hole at the RCGC golf course came alive on Thursday night for the world premiere of The Day After Tomorrow.																					The best part of the evening, held in association with The Telegraph etc, was unscripted. As rainstorms, tidal waves and blizzards threatened to wipe out mankind with the coming of the next ice age in the film, thunder and lightning threatened to wipe out the mela spirit on the ground. 																					Through the most part of the movie, real-time nature was a mere shadow of the reality the hordes were vicariously living. But as the situation grew grim (Dennis Quaid looked a little blue in the face from trying ineffectively to get America evacuated, as much as from the arctic blast), a storm kicked in. Cars backed out and buzzed off as the screen went blank. If Roland Emmerich envisioned the world coming to an end The Day After Tomorrow, last night, nature managed to at least get in the way of the last 20 minutes of the film.																					The evening was still a refreshing departure from the usual nights out caged up in an air-conditioned hall, or squeezed into a sweltering nightclub. It drew out families and groups of friends. Some arrived in two cars and dumped one vehicle  leaving drivers behind, too  at the club parking lot, piled into one, and headed for the greens. 																					The breeze was blowing  albeit a light too hard. The stars were twinkling  till the dark clouds took over. The action was larger than life  though the organisers feared the sudden gale would blow the screen over.																					Our head count at the gate registered almost 3,000 people, said organiser Ashish Banerjee of Rampedge. Around 300 cars  with barely an Ambassador in sight  were also counted.																					Bags to dump trash from the food and drink presented an opportunity for direct marketing at its best. Each plastic packet had a slip of paper in it, with the mobile number of a French fry snack counter. A phone call was enough to have your order at your car doorstep.Meher Bhasin in the city. Pictures by Rashbehari Das												Model moves																					 She has sizzled on the ramp for almost 10 years and her gorgeous looks have worked wonders for various ad campaigns. But Meher Bhasin still exudes freshness and sincerity.																					The ace cat-walker was in town on Friday for the launch of Revolutions, a fashion footwear and accessories brand from Liberty shoes, at Forum. Accompanying her was the Chhod Do Aanchal guy, Grasim Mr India 2003 Rajnish Duggal.																					Things have changed since Meher chose modelling as her life. When I started, there were hardly 10 national-level models and we all wanted to make a career out of it. But these days, the attitude of the younger lot has changed. There are so many who start thinking they are superstars right after they have done a couple of big shows. And they fade out fast, as they are not serious about the profession, feels Meher.The leggy beauty has also reinvented herself over time. She is anchor for a show to be aired on Trendz in a couple of weeks. Called Runway Dazzle, the weekly programme talks about the latest fashion trends. We deal with one product or one designer in each episode. For instance, one day we talk about the latest styles in shoes. Or, we trace the rise of a particular designer, she reveals, having canned 12 episodes. This isnt the first time she has played host on the small screen. I have anchored two shows for Zee. One was Morning Zee and the other was a show based on women achievers. Next up, a music video.																					A project close to Mehers heart is her finishing school called Meher Bhasin Academy which she runs in hometown Delhi. The school, launched three years ago, grooms models as well as everyday guys and gals. We groom models, kids and young people on etiquette, how to carry oneself, speaking well, dressing up and make-up, Meher explains, flashing a trademark smile.																					Corporate workshops and grooming for Airtel, Amway and Sahara are just a few of her top credits. Heading her priority list is finding franchisees for her school. I have opened a branch in Ghaziabad and am looking for franchisees from all over India.																					Meher has given filmdom a deliberate miss, but there has been no dearth of offers, she stresses. I got offers for Kamasutra and Monsoon Wedding, but I had to refuse because my hands were so full that devoting six months to one project would have been impossible. I was also offered a role in Boom, and I am glad I refused. But she is still open to films if the role interests her.																					A frequent visitor to Calcutta, she just cant get enough of Bengali food, especially the mishti doi. In Delhi, I live in CR Park. So, I am almost half-Bengali, she laughs.

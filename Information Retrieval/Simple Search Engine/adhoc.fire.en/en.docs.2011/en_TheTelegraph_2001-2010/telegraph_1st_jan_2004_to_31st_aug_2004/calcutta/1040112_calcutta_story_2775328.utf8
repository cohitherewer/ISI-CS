 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Road mishap ignites mob
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Road rage erupted in the Ranikuthi area, under Regent Park police station, on Sunday morning, after a minibus knocked down a 26-year-old newspaper vendor, while trying to overtake another private bus.																								Gopal Biswas was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital in a critical condition. The minibus was damaged by a mob and a roadblock set up to protest the accident. Traffic was disrupted for more than two hours. Police later impounded the bus, but the driver remained untraced.																								Local Trinamul Congress MLA and leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee and local Trinamul councillor Shyamali Bhadra had to intervene to bring the situation under control.																								The accident occurred around 7.45 am, when the morning papers were being gathered and distributed. A minibus on the Harinavi-Howrah route was trying to overtake a private bus (on route 205) when Biswas was trapped in between the two speeding vehicles.																								Witnesses later said Biswas, on his bicycle, desperately tried to swerve to the right and get out of harms way, but by then it was too late. The minibus smashed into his bicycle, and Biswas was hurled into the air.																								While Biswas was being rushed to hospital, an irate mob started pelting the minibus with brickbats and even tried to set it ablaze. 																								When we took him to MR Bangur Hospital, we were told that his condition was critical, as he had suffered severe head injuries, said Ramananda Banerjee, a newspaper agent.																								Back at the accident site, a roadblock was set up as residents of the area and newspaper vendors demanded that an armed police guard be posted on the spot to curb rash driving.																								Soon, local MLA Pankaj Banerjee, accompanied by Trinamul party workers, reached the spot. 																								Only traffic constables can stop this menace, said Banerjee. The matter has been reported to the state administration a number times, but no action has been taken, he alleged.																								The roadblock was lifted following a discussion between officer-in-charge of Regent Park police station Swapan Pal, the local MLA and councillors.

 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Cop counsel to allay kidnap fear
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two mob attacks, a death and a hyperactive rumour mill have forced police to take extra safety measures at some schools in the citys eastern suburban division.																								Persistent talk about child-lifters on the prowl near some educational institutions has forced police to organise counselling sessions for school authorities and guardians.																								The immediate cause for concern was the lynching of a man, suspected to be a kidnapper, on August 14, near Momin High School, in Narkeldanga.																								Five days later, a similar incident occurred in Beniapukur, but this time the suspected child-lifter later turned out to be a mother who had come to fetch her daughter from school. She managed to escape the mob fury.																								This had prompted police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty to order the force to fight the perceived peril and intensify vigil around schools.																								This is a strange problem, as there is no element of truth in it. We held a series of meetings with the authorities of a few schools and explained to them the steps that should be taken to combat the fear, said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division). 																								We have simultaneously launched a probe to find out how the rumour was spreading, he added.																								Besides holding meetings, police have so far met representatives from several schools, including Maniktala High School, Momin High School, Bagmari Government School and Rajabazar Boys School.																								Several steps have been taken  or prescribed  to restore order: Guardians and school authorities have been briefed that there is no truth in the child-lifting rumours doing the rounds. Meetings involving police and the authorities of at least seven schools in and around Narkeldanga, Beleghata and Maniktala have been held. Meetings to bolster the confidence of teachers, guardians and even students have been organised. Special vigil by plainclothes policemen when schools start the day and give over. Teachers have been asked to keep an eye on students when school gives over. Guardians have been urged to pick up their children from school themselves. Men on motorcycles are not being allowed to hang around near the school premises. A threat of penal action has been sounded against any attempt to spread kidnap rumours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Cricket powers teams to Pakistan
 NISHA LAHIRI																								Alok Singh is going to Pakistan this summer, for a spot of sightseeing, shopping  and maybe to catch some cricket. Visiting the neighbouring country is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity the young businessman of central Calcutta is determined not to miss. Although hes not an avid cricket enthusiast, the upcoming India-Pakistan series is too good to miss.																								Visas arent issued at other times, so I cant miss this, says Alok. Ill go to Lahore during the Test series in April, visit a few places I could not otherwise go to, do some shopping and see a few matches. Even if I have to go alone.																								The Pakistan government has announced the sanctioning of 8,500 visas for Indians hoping to catch some of the cricket action in March and April. With Indian Airlines (IA) and Cox amp; Kings offering package deals (see box), inquiries from cricket-crazy Calcuttans have been pouring in. Even the many roadblocks to Lahore or Karachi are not enough to slow down the Sachin-Sourav fans.																								The main problem is that people have to personally apply for their visas from Delhi itself. Also, the number and capacity of the flights and bus trips a week across the border are inadequate. And, for a visa, you need tickets, but you dont want to book stadium seats unless you have your visas first, explains Manoj Saraf, secretary, Travel Agents Association of India.																								But that hasnt deterred the die-hard. There are plenty of fans who are now either in Delhi or going there to get their visas, before booking with us, says Suman Bhattacharya of Cox amp; Kings, handling the Pakistan bookings. But yes, there would have been many more if we could have got the visas for them, since the match tickets are non-refundable. People are mostly interested in going for the matches in Lahore, on March 21 and 24, because they see it as a safer destination.																								There are big groups, too, with special arrangements  a batch of 50 dealers from a private firm has made tentative bookings with IA, and another corporate team with Cox amp; Kings.																								Most travel agents agree that from the eastern region, visitors will be pure cricket fans, but from the north, there will be people eager to visit their ancestral homes and renew ties with lost families. And then there are those like Alok, for whom the promise of a forbidden country, combined with the cricket, is the lure to Lahore.

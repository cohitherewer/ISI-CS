The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Sand, stone chips and iron rods are kept in a disorderly manner on roadsides by builders of the many new highrises coming up in various areas of the city. It is a serious hazard to elderly people and children, especially after showers and during powercuts in the area. At times, the construction material takes up as much as half the width of the pavement. Pedestrians have to walk on the road instead of the footpath.B.N. Bose, Dum Dum 
	The public toilets in the Esplanade area are in a deplorable condition. An obnoxious smell hangs in the air all the time. However, there are some who dont mind the stench and relieve themselves near the lavatory, only to add to the problem. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is requested to undertake repairs immediately. When the toilets were newly constructed, even tourists from abroad, paranoid about hygiene, availed of the facilities. But now the ill-maintained toilets are a nuisance even to us.

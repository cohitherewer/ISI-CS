 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Bus, mini in strike cry
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bus and minibus operators met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers Buildings on Friday and warned of going off the road from July 1 without an upward revision of fares.																								Representatives of Bengal Bus Syndicate, Joint Council of Bus Syndicate and other associations submitted a memorandum to Chakraborty, claiming they were incurring a loss because of the steep hike in diesel price.																								They have demanded Rs 4 as the minimum fare (up to four km), Rs 5 up to 12 km and Rs 6 up to 20 km. Present fares are Rs 3 (minimum), 3.50 up to six km, Rs 4 up to 12 km and Rs 4.50 up to 20 km. Minibus fares are 50 p more than the bus fares in each stage.

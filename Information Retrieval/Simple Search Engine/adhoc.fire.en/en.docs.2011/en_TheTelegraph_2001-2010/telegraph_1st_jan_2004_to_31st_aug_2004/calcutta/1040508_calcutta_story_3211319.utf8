 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Seat-slash axe on colleges
 																											- Private institutions fear financial jeopardy, urgent talks convened MITA MUKHERJEE 																								The citys private engineering colleges are facing the axe, with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) considering a 10 to 30 per cent seats slash.																								College authorities fear that such a move, if implemented, would undermine their financial stability and even jeopardise their functioning.																								AICTE, the national-level regulatory body for technical education, is reportedly raising the axe in view of the failure of institutions to appoint teachers to senior posts, like professors and assistant professors, in conformity with the norms laid down by it.																								The seats slash could hit close to 50 private engineering colleges, about 30 being in the city and its adjoining areas. All of them are selffinanced and run independent of any kind of financial assistance from the government, the authorities insisted.																								In a desperate bid to save private engineering colleges from such a disaster, the government has hurriedly called a meeting with AICTEs regional officials on Saturday  Lok Sabha polls notwithstanding  to discuss a way out.																								We will know the exact reason for the seat-slash move only when we get the formal letter from the AICTE. But whatever be the reason, it would be unfair if we are asked to admit fewer students due to our inability to appoint assistant professors in our institutions, argued Satyen Mitra, administrator, Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology.																								Sources in the state higher education department said the colleges are expected to receive official intimation from the AICTE on May 15.																								Officials in some engineering colleges, meanwhile, described AICTEs move as unjustified.																								P.K. Ray, director of MCKV Institute of Engineering, explained why it had not been easy for private colleges to appoint senior teachers.																								For a new college, it is easy to get a suitable candidate to fill up teaching posts at the junior (lecturer) levels. It is difficult for such institutions to get teachers with five years experience as most of the private colleges themselves are no more than five years old, pointed out Ray.																								AICTE sources revealed that in the May 8 meeting with the state government, the council is also expected to give its final verdict on the number of private colleges to be granted permission to offer courses in new subjects.																								We, at present, need to develop our infrastructure to attract good students, for which a steady flow of revenue is required. Our project will suffer if we are forced to admit fewer number of students, said Silajit Ghosh, director, Future Institute of Engineering and Management.

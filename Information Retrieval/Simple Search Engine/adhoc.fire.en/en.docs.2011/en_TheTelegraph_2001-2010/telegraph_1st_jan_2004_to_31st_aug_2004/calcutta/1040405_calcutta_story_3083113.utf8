 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 A brush with the great masters
																								Bengal has for long been the cradle that has nurtured some of the greatest artistic minds in the country. It was under the tutelage of Abanindranath Tagore that the nation found some of its best painters. Those were the artists who were constantly at pains to understand their muse and lend it a new shape and form. The art of painting was for them a constantly evolving form of expression. The trend of the need for an exercise of the mind in the interpretation of art that was spearheaded by the likes of Jamini Roy continues till date through such stalwarts as Bikash Bhattacharjee and Shuvaprasanna (whose Golden Flute appears above), to name a few. But what one sorely misses in the young student is that fiercely artistic fire that shone through the strongly individualistic works of their masters. Curator Ratnottama Senguptas Dhaara is an exhibition of some of the finest paintings by the Bengal masters and their students who have left an indelible mark in the world of art. It is an attempt to trigger the spark that threatens to be extinguished unless rejuvenated with reminders of the glorious past.

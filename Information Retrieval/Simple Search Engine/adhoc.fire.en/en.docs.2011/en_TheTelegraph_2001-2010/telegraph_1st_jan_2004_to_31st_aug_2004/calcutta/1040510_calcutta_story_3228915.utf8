 Monday, May 10, 2004  Hot picks, cool comfortHIMIKA CHAUDHURI AND SOMA BANERJEE Model Nicola sports a Peppertree outfit at Just Casuals. Picture by Rashbehari Das.															Summer is not just about the delicious alphonsos, cool sherbets, pacifying cucumbers and thirst-quenching coconuts. Its about cool dressing too. And what better way to beat the heat than to deck up in some summer colours of whites and pastels. Cotton, of course, tops the list as the fabric of choice and skirts and kurtis voted as must-haves this season by the fashion conscious. 																					At Just Casuals on Ballygunge Circular Road, which is all set to celebrate its second anniversary, the summer collection boasts of light hues and fabrics like crepe cotton and cotton with hip cuts adding to the appeal. Skirts are doing very well this season, said Bharti Haralalka of the outlet. 																					Indeed, the range of long and short skirts in uni-colour crepe with sequin work, or block printed long skirts with side slits, classy wrap-arounds in shades of black and ones with funky prints are the hottest picks. Its advisable to team them up with a short embroidered top in crepe with a sprinkling of sequins for an evening out. 																					For a dressier look, a pair of flared cotton trousers with block prints and sequins will do the trick. Available in shades of beige and maroon, these are must-haves for an avid party animal. The USP of these lowers is the absolutely different look that they offer when compared with either denims or synthetic stretch trousers or skirts. 																					If you are more of a morning person, a set of kurti, salwar and dupatta in bi-colour with minimal embroidery should do the trick. 																					These come from a Mumbai brand called Peppertree and the look is essentially a mix of the ethnic and the contemporary, explained Bharti. 																					For women who are not sold on skirts or salwar-kurtas, the options range from cool capri pants from Liz and Springfield, spaghettis from Essentials, H amp;M, and Hennes, or cool crinkled shirts from Soho. 																					Men havent been left out of the loop either. GUSU, Nevada, Pacific Motion and Old Navy are the brands to look out for him. Bright checks or eternally classy stripes are the hottest draws in this segment apart from the peasant-look draw-string cotton pyjamas. 																					Theres something for tiny tots as well. Kids can take their pick from a range of tees and cargos from brands like Mothercare, Earlydays and Ladybird.  Chaiti Ghosal, Usha Ganguly and Chandrayee celebrate World Fair Trade Day. Picture by Aranya Sen 												Fair deal																					The fight for fair trade practices may have begun decades ago in Mexico, but right here in Calcutta, Sasha, an NGO working to promote rural handicrafts, celebrated the World Fair Trade Day with the support of celebrities from the field of films, theatre and music. The idea was essentially to spread awareness about problems that plague the artisans and labourers. For Sasha, that has been promoting rural handicrafts for years now, shoring up support for a cause like this wasnt too difficult. Thus the list of dignitaries ranged from theatre person Usha Ganguly to actors Chaiti Ghosal and Chandrayee. 																					I think this is a cause for which everyone has to unite. Artistes or artisans, at the end of the day everyone is affected by things like work conditions or pay, said Chaiti Ghosal. 																					agging off with a rally from Vivekananda Park on Southern Avenue, the dignitaries along with the artisans who came from various parts of rural Bengal, marched to the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium where a fair and a cultural show had been organised. Taking time off from their hectic schedules and making the best of what seemed almost like a field trip, the celebs hopped from one handicraft outlet to the other checking out wares on offer.																					The cultural function inaugurated by Rakhi Sarkar had Presidents Award winner bhavaiya singer Durga Roy and her troupe from Jalpaiguri performing. Roy sang some popular bhavaiya numbers forcing many in the audience to break out into a spontaneous jig. I am extremely happy to be part of this event, said Rakhi Sarkar. She went on to stress the importance of rewarding creative excellence for any business to do well in the long run. 																					It was, however, the Hindi drama staged by Usha Ganguly and her troupe Rangakarmee that was the high point of the evening. Titled Beti Ayee, the open-air drama spoke of womens emancipation and presented a theatrical version of it. 																																														No-holds Bard																					Celebrating Rabindranath Tagore at Big Ben? Well, unbelievable on first hear, but true for sure. Thats precisely what a group of A-list people of the city did on May 8, on the occasion of the Bards birth anniversary. The idea was to free Tagore from the usual seriousness that is associated with his work and give the event a free-flowing spontaneous feel where everyone irrespective of his mother tongue would enjoy the works of the great poet, said Sahana Chatterjee, one of the organisers of the meet. 																					Industrialist Sanjay Budhia was seen humming Purano Shei Diner Kotha along with singers Sona and Rittika in a venue that was packed to its full capacity with a fair mix of guests. 																					Language indeed ceased to be a barrier in the face of the spirit with which everyone who was there got involved in the proceedings of the evening. Everything conventional was sent packing, and literally. No dhoti-kurta or lal paar shada sari here. 																					Actress June Maliah took to the stage in an essentially north Indian outfit of lungi and kurti in keeping with the mood. Chiffon and pearls for women and cool T-shirts and branded trousers for men was the general dress code. In fact, the cosmopolitan theme made way for a fashion show as well, with models walking the ramp in kantha saris by Shamlu Dudeja and sparkling diamond jewellery from PC Chandra. 																					ist of performers also included danseuse Tanusree Shankar who read out Tagores poems. A Kathak recital by Vikram Iyengar and Deboshree wrapped up the evening which was interspersed with the launch of the third issue of Inner Eye, a magazine edited by Jayabrata Chatterjee, which gives a ring side view of the cultural and social happenings around town.

Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Crown jewels																					It is difficult to go wrong with precious and semi-precious stones if you decide to shop for jewellery at Jaipur Emporium. True to its name, most gemstones used at the shop are sourced directly from Jaipur. Deepak Mookim claims to have a good understanding of gemstones as their family is in the jewellery business for many generations now. Our forefathers were appointed court jewellers to the last Mughal emperor, so we naturally deal with jewels and gemstones, he explains. 																					Having moved away from The Great Eastern Hotel, the Jaipur Emporium outlet near Minto Park is eight years old. 																					Friday evening saw hectic activity at the store as fashion conceptualist Anjan Kar demonstrated make-up and jewellery trends on model Ranjabati. 																					At Jaipur Emporium, the diamonds come in from Mumbai and the emeralds, rubies, sapphires and citrines from Rajasthan. The rush of loyal clientele at the store, mostly comprising wedding shoppers, is apparent but the designs take in more than just the traditional. Hong Kong style necklace and earring sets in which the stones are held together, not by prongs but by pressure setting, gives an embedded look.																					Watches fashioned along international brands come in white metal and gold. White metal watches comprising 25 per cent gold and 75 per cent silver are priced at Rs 15,000 onwards while the diamond-set gold watches begin from Rs 25,000. 																					Worth a mention also are round and oblong bracelets studded with champagne diamonds in European motifs, matte finish neckpieces and reproductions of antique Victorian jewellery. 																					On a more Indian note, filigree work renders the items lightweight, all the time keeping the old-world charm of traditional Jaipuri jewellery intact. Cast items are difficult to spot as all the pieces are handcrafted to perfection. Especially beautiful are the chiks and chokers in longitudinally-cut baguette and taper diamonds set in 18 carat gold.																					We also offer value-added services like in-house designing to suit clients choices, remoulding and restoration of old jewellery and valuation of jewellery by government-approved valuers, claims Deepak.

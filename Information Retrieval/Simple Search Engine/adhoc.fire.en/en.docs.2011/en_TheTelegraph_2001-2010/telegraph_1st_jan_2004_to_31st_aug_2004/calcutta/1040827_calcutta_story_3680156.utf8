 																											- Buddha balm makes IT firm comfortable in Calcutta A STAFF REPORTER																								If a bandh had beaten back business in round one, the next rounds have found business bouncing back in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal.																								A Citu-sponsored bandh on February 23 had spoilt a US-based financial products companys chances of sealing a big-ticket contract and prompted it to abandon its Calcutta plans in a huff.																								Six months after the fiasco that had forced damage control from the chief ministers office, Fi-Tek on Thursday unveiled its expansion agenda in town.																								In the company of Edward Heidema of Citco Funds Services, Fi-Teks partner and a global player in the financial services sector, Subir Chatterjee, president and CEO, Fi-Tek, explained the rethink.																								We had made a lot of noise in February for what had happened then. But we have seen a lot of change here, which helped us in bringing our clients back. In view of the assurances from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the condition of the infrastructure in Calcutta, we feel comfortable here, said Chatterjee.																								Part of The Chatterjee Group (TCG) of Purnendu Chatterjee, Fi-Tek develops products used in the wealth management segment of the US financial services market and counts Ernst amp; Young, JP MorganChase and Bank of New York among its clients.																								We also felt that here, we can get the right kind of people for our work, which requires expertise in the field of finance and accounting, and thats why we are drawing up expansion plans in Calcutta, added Chatterjee.																								Heidema and Chatterjee called on Bhattacharjee on Thursday and during the meeting, the chief minister promised stability and availability of necessary infrastructure in Bengal.																								Rolling out the companys plans, Chatterjee said Fi-Tek had already moved into a 10,000-sq-ft office in Bengal Intelligent Park of Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec) and placed a requisition for another 20,000 sq ft.																								We have eight patented products that are used by 120 banks across the globe. As our business is growing, we will increase the headcount from 70 and add another 200 in the next 12 to 18 months across our offices in the US and Calcutta, announced Chatterjee.																								The company plans a foray into the BPO industry as well, and make Calcutta the centre for its services. The banks want to outsource their back-office operations and this will create BPO opportunities for us, said Chatterjee.

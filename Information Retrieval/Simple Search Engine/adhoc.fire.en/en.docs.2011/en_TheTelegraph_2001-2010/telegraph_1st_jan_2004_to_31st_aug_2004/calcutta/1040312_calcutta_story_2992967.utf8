The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Examinees fall ill, doctor not found
 															- Pledge on physicians at Madhyamik centres falls flat, hospitals plead ignorance OUR BUREAU 																								-Total number of venues: 1,852																								-Total number of examinees: 608,823																								-Total number of examiners: 23,964																								-Number of doctors who should have been there: 921																								-Number of doctors found on call: 0.																								Swatilekha Chandra, a Madhyamik examinee, was trying her best to crack the English paper at a BT Road school on Tuesday. The paper was exceptionally tough and a sudden cramp did not help matters. Despite prior doctor at the door promises made by the board, there was no medical cover in sight.																								A complaint lodged with the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education elicited this response: Send her to the doctors chamber. So, the school authorities contacted her parents waiting outside and she had to be taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where she was diagnosed with stress-induced indigestion.																								A few days ago, at its curtain-raiser before the examination, board officials had claimed that examinees this year would have medical help at hand. Board president Dibyendu Hota said the state health department had been alerted, along with all major hospitals and nursing homes, to stand by for situations needing urgent medical attention.																								But try telling that to Swatilekha and her parents. And they are just one among many Madhyamik families who would vouch for the fact that the boards promise was, like so often before, an empty one. Apparently, the message from the state school education department failed to reach the state health department  though both are based in Salt Lake now.																								We did not receive any communique from the secondary board, deputy director of health services (administration) Swapan Chakraborty said on Thursday. So there was no question of alerting hospitals or health centres, either in the city or elsewhere in the state, he added.																								Students suffered because of the communication gap. A girls school on Swinhoe Street (authorities there insisted that the institute must not be named) had two examinees suffer vomiting bouts and another complain of a severe headache. We called in their guardians, in whose presence the students were treated, said a school official, adding that the board was not informed as it would have been of no help at all.																								South Point High School and Jodhpur Park Girls High School had one examinee each coming down with chicken pox. The authorities of both schools said they had to make their own medical arrangements. No doctor visited our school, said a South Point official.																								Board president Hota, while insisting that the state health department had been told of the plans, admitted receiving several complaints about the non-availability of doctors at examination centres.

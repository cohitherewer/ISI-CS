The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Harass charge, cop cover plea
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two days after the veil was lifted over an alleged sex scandal at the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, involving medical superintendent Jahar Majumder, the government on Thursday swung into action.																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, alternative chairman of the institute, met head of anaesthesiology department Sadhana Saha and asked for details.																								She (Saha) told the minister that she was receiving threat calls from unknown individuals, asking her to withdraw the police case lodged against Majumder at Gariahat police station, said a close family friend, who accompanied Saha.																								The minister reportedly reassured Saha and later spoke to police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty about providing security to Saha. Ever since the lid blew off on the alleged sex scandal, this is the first time a minister has met Saha. The meeting went off cordially and we are confident that justice will prevail, the family friend added.																								Meanwhile, medical superintendent Majumder met senior functionaries of the Calcutta branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), an affiliate of Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, during the day. 																								He has in his possession copies of two previous harassment inquiry reports, which absolve him of the crime. The reports were never made public, but the copies speak for themselves, said R.D. Dubey, IMA joint secretary (headquarters). 																								Two employees, a sister in-charge and a doctor in the surgery department, had levelled allegations of sexual harassment and mental torture against Majumder in 2002.																								Majumder, on his part, said he had been turned into a scapegoat by vested interests who had been opposed to his clean-up in the hospital. They wanted me out of the way. They nearly succeeded, Majumder added.																								Members of the Association of Health Service Doctors also met minister Mishra and sought strong steps against the guilty. One allegation can be false, but three spread over as many years cannot be, an official said.

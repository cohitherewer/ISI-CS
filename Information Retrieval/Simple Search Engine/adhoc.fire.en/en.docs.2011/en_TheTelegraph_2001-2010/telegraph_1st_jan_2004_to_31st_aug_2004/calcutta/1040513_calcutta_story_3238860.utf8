 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Memorial seeks entry fee of Rs 15
 TAPAS GHOSH				 	 Walking the grounds of the Victoria Memorial is set to turn dear																								If Calcutta High Court agrees to the proposal, constitutionals in the sprawling grounds of Victoria Memorial Hall will set morning walkers back by Rs 15. 																								On Wednesday, the Memorial authorities submitted to the court a proposal aimed at putting a stop to the pollution of the grounds by hordes of people, who invade the grounds daily to take the air, romance or simply to kill time. 																								They have proposed the introduction of an entry card for morning walkers, against payment of an annual fee. The authorities feel a fee of Rs 15 will turn away a large section of visitors who spoil the grounds. The entry of people should be restricted, their proposal said.																								While the Memorial authorities were in favour of an entry fee of Rs 15, environment activist Subhas Dutta, petitioner of the case, proposed an entry fee of Rs 2 only. He, however, suggested that a separate fee be collected by the authorities for entry into the monument. Now, visitors are charged Rs 5 to enter it.																								The petitioner suggested that morning walkers be charged Rs 500 per year to hold a card issued by the Memorial authorities. A senior citizen should be allowed to enter the complex in the morning against payment of only Rs 250 a year, Dutta said. 																								A 13-member expert committee appointed by the high court had suggested that entry into the Memorial complex be restricted to make it a pollution-free zone. The committee recommended introduction of an entry fee for visitors to restrict movement. 																								On the basis of these recommendations, the division bench presided over by Justice Ashok Ganguly asked all the parties to file affidavits on their stand with regard to the entry fee.																								In Wednesdays affidavit, Dutta urged the court also to direct the Royal Calcutta Turf Club to throw open the race tracks to morning walkers.																								Dutta said the vast area of the race course remains unused during summer. Races are held only in winter. Since there is a scarcity of open space in the city, the race tracks could be used, he pointed out.

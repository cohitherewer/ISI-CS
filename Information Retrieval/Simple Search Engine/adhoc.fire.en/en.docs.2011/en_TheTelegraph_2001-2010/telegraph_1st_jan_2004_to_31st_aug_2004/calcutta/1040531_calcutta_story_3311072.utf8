 																											- Young man arrested for making ransom call in womans voice A STAFF REPORTER																								The mystery of the teenaged daughter of a state government employee, missing for the past eight days, deepened on Sunday with the arrest of a young man, who made ransom calls impersonating a woman. 																								Poulami Roy, 17, an only child and a resident of Jadavpur, had failed in her ICSE examinations this year. On May 22 morning, she went missing from home. 																								Her anxious father, Himadri Roy, lodged a missing diary with Jadavpur police station when she did not return in the evening. Later Roy, an employee of the public works department, put out advertisements in some local dailies with his contact phone number.																								Last Friday, I received a call from one Indrani Sen, Roy said. The lady claimed that she ran a private detective agency and Poulami was at the agencys office in Salt Lake. 																								Sen asked me to go to her office with Rs 2,000 to get back my daughter. I was specifically asked not to contact the police, Roy said. However, Roy informed the police about the phone call and two police personnel, including a woman, accompanied Poulamis mother to Salt Lake.																								When the team reached the address, they found a young man in front of the house. Poulamis mother told him the two persons accompanying her were her relatives. 																								The youth, who identified himself as Ashish Chakraborty, asked them to hand over the cash to him. When they asked about the woman who had made the call, Ashish told them not to bother about her. 																								Ashish and the trio roamed aimlessly for nearly an hour. The police personnel became suspicious and identified themselves. Ashish then confessed to them that he had impersonated a woman. He was arrested and taken to the police station. 																								Ashish told police that his parents had died and he was finding it difficult to maintain his CIT Road apartment. There was a huge arrear of electricity bills.																								We are probing if his claims are true and whether he has any links with an abduction gang, Humayun Kabir, deputy superintendent of police (town), South 24-Parganas, said on Sunday. 																								Himadri said he was getting numerous calls from Mathurapur and Joynagar, in South 24-Parganas, Bagnan (in Howrah) and other places, with the callers claiming that they had information about Poulami. 																								I have received calls from private detective agencies willing to take up the case, Roy said. There has been no breakthrough and the girls mother has fallen ill.

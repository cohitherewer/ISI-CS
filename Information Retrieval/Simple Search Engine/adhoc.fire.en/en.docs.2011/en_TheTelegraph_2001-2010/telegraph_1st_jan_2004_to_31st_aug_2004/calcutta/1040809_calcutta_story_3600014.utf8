Pictures by Rashbehari Das															We might have come a long way as a civilisation but is the change reflected in the attitude and opportunities available to the modern woman? A play titled Women on the Edge presented by Spandan at GD Birla Sabhagar this weekend sought to address these issues through a series of short skits.																					Conceptualised by Sujoy Chatterjee and directed by Lee-Alison Sibley, the play brought to the fore inner conflicts experienced by women grappling with day-to-day realities of life.																					The cast included an interesting mix of veteran theatre personalities like Renu Roy demonstrating their histrionic skills alongside amateurs like Sujoy Chatterjee, Lee Alison and husband, US Consul General George Sibley.																					The actors vibed well, especially in a divorce drama where Roy pleaded separation from her dead husband on the grounds of ideological differences and incompatibility.																																														Console king																					Guess who had Calcutta swooning to his tune on Saturday? It was the czar of console DJ Aqeel turning up the heat at Tantra once again. 																					The more the merrier seemed to be the mantra for the evening with the disco starting to fill up as early as 9 pm. 																					As expected, girls far outnumbered the boys turning up in their gladrags, hoping to have closer look at the dimpled darling.																					The Nahi nahi guy, however, took the liberty to test the crowds patience before taking the drivers seat at half-past midnight amid deafening catcalls. 																					The adorable Aqeel proved his worth, sending the crowd into a trance, churning out one smash hit remix after the other. 																					Koi mil gaya, Dekh le and Bin tere sanam kept the crowd on its feet till the wee hours when the guest DJ finally retired to his room, but not before promising to bring more music mania the next time around.

Picture by Sanjay Chattopadhyaya 												Bolly bytes																					Saturday night saw the Big Ben, the pub at The Kenilworth, sporting a filmi avatar. The entire pub was decked up with huge Hindi film posters to create the perfect ambience for the Bollywood Nite. 																					For the aural factor, there was the talented singer Tanya belting out everything from Geeta Dutt to Sunidhi Chauhan tracks. While forgotten melodies like Agey bhi jaane na tu didnt quite interest the night revellers, all-time chartbusters like Jawaani jaaneman were cheered on in full force.																					But it was the leggy Russian dancer Jenny who flung the crowds into complete frenzy. Along with dancing troupe Challenger, she swayed to catchy numbers like Aisa jadoo dala re and Babuji zara dheere chalo, with the party people giving her company on the floor. 																					At one point of time, the night came to a complete halt as in walked Bhaichung Bhutia. With most eyes transfixed on the national soccer icon, it was left to resident DJ Saranjit to swing the mood the Bollywood way. So in no time, you had the disco favourites Bheegey honth tere, Bin tere sanam and Its the time to disco mixed in, getting everyone into the party groove all over again.																					Conduct code																					Now fashion designers are referring to hand books on dressing and etiquette for they still have so much to know. Sharbari Dutta was candid enough to confess this at the release of Dressing amp; Etiquette, a hand book from Guide India. The Calcutta chapter of the all-India launch saw the usual celebrity-laced affair at Caffeine, Elgin Road, over a steaming cuppa. 																					The 167-page hard cover book covers areas like clothing material and care, dressing to suit body types and complexion for both men and women, tips on grooming and etiquette and detailed sections on accessories and even undergarments.																					A stimulating adda on gender grooming and the east-west etiquette divide was sparked off. Rita Bhimani felt happy that poor men finally have a guide to help match their better-dressed halves. I have always felt a little sorry for men when it comes to dressing up for an evening out, smiled Rita.																					Designer Sharbari Dutta suggested an additional chapter on hospitality while Rita thought the book might be a guide to westerners on Indian food habits and etiquette, an area that hasnt been formally written about so far. There are lots of things in the book I am sure foreigners would like to learn before accepting the invitation to a formal Indian dinner. Most westerners Ive met get zapped about how we use only one hand to eat! exclaimed Rita.																					The book, compiled by Daphne Chauhan (former research editor of Readers Digest) and her team, is available at popular haunts like Charnock City and Pantaloons, apart from all registered bookstores. At just Rs 150, it might give finishing schools a run for their money, agreed most.

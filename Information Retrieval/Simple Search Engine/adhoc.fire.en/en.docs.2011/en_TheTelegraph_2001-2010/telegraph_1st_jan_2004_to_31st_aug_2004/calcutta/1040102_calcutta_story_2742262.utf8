 A STAFF REPORTER																								The detective department said it had busted a racket in fake non-judicial stamps on the premises of the city civil and sessions court with the arrest of kingpin Chandan Saha early on Thursday. 																								Sleuths raided Sahas Rajarhat home, where he used to run a press to print stamps. Later, Saha associate Jayanta Roy was rounded up for supplying the fake stamps in and around the city.																								We seized 28,000 fake stamps and the printing machines from the arrested duo. Printing blocks were also found in Sahas press, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of the detective department. He added: Their capture takes the number of arrests in this case to eight.																								The police stumbled upon the fake stamp racket on December 23, with the arrest of three persons from the city civil and sessions court. At least 16,000 fake stamps were recovered. 																								Sahas name emerged following the arrest of two others, Tarachand Shaw and Bijoy Shaw, from their Ahiritola Street residences. During interrogation, the duo confessed that Saha was the man who would supply the stamps, said deputy commissioner Mitra.																								According the sleuths on the case, Saha was the origin of the supply line. Roy was his main agent. The others, like Tarachand and Bijoy, would collect the stamps from Roy, said an official.																								Police are now looking for the person who supplied the printing blocks. We found six blocks in Sahas unit. More arrests can be expected soon, stated Mitra. Police, however, are yet to locate the other places where Saha and his men used to supply the stamps.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

				 House of life, hotel of loveShashi and Jennifer Kapoor with Kunal, Karan and Sanjana at Fairlawn Hotel. The frame now graces the Sudder Street address				 																																																											In the balmy air drifting a few kilometres offshore from Juhu beach stands a pleasant 200-seater auditorium built in memory of a man who, despite being a big screen legend, had dedicated his life to theatre.				 																																																											Prithviraj Kapoor didnt survive to see his last wish take off, but his youngest son has taken up pen and paper to chronicle the urge that burnt within him to see a thriving theatre podium, 25 years after its inception.				 																																																											At 66, Shashi Kapoor finds himself busy recollecting a gallery of faces close to his heart and deeply etched in memory. His father, who steered Prithvi Theatres, one of the first professional Hindi troupes in India. His fathers contemporaries, who were stalwarts on stage in their times. And his wife Jennifer, who shared with him a zest for theatre.				 																																																											Strolling down memory lane, Shashi is digging out 60 years of history  from 1944 when Prithvi Theatres was born, to 1978 when he and Jennifer built the auditorium, and its 25-year run changing various hands.				 																																																											It was my fathers last wish to set up a theatre auditorium. After his death in 1972, Jennifer and I took the initiative to set the ball rolling and the building took off in 1978, says Shashi, who is being helped by his stage actress daughter, Sanjana, in the project. I am just helping him to put in the visuals, says Sanjana from Delhi.				 																																																											Set up by Kapoor Sr, Prithvi Theatres was a company that travelled through the country and performed plays with a group of 150 actors, stagehands, cooks, writers and technicians. After debuting with Shakuntala, the troupe strengthened its repertoire with a string of socio-political plays like Deewar, Kisaan and Paisa.				 																																																											The yet-to-be-titled tome  to be published a month later by Roli Books  is being spiced up by Shashi with personal anecdotes and Calcutta does occupy a large share of his mind and print space.				 																																																											For instance, the house on Hazra Road where Shashi Kapoor was born and even lived for some time. My father was employed at B.N. Sircars New Theatres in Tollygunge, where he worked for about seven to eight years. He had a close bonding with theatre veterans from Bengal and was a good friend of Shambhu and Tripti Mitra, says Shashi, who remembers the first time Prithviraj Kapoor brought his troupe to Calcutta.  1951. A cinema hall was turned into a stage to hold the play.				 																																																											The trip to Calcutta he took with his father some years later, in 1956, is also fresh in mind. 				 																																																											Father had come down to stage a play for the second time. It was in New Empire Is it still there? he asks, bemused.				 																																																											Next moment, the talk veers to Jennifer. It was during this trip that I had met her in Fairlawn. 				 																																																											Ever since, Shashi has made it a point to put up in Fairlawn Hotel every time he is in Calcutta. I have always loved that place, he adds fondly. 				 																																																											And no, the address is not 36 Chowringhee Lane.Reshmi SenguptaTwenty into seven on screen 				 																																																											Twenty handpicked telefilms at Nandan, seven select feature films at INOX-City Centre. The cine-goers plate is full this week and the next...				 																																																											If the past nine days have seen a large number of people queuing up at Nandan (forget the rains) for the 2nd Bangla Telefilm Festival, the Salt Lake multiplex is all set for a spurt in footfall this week. Saat Paake Bandha, a festival of contemporary Bengali films hosted by the multiplex, is expected to be the seasons top draw till date.				 																																																											Seven films, seven days, 7 pm. Thats how the fascination with lucky number seven runs at the INOX-City Centre festival. The weeklong fare, till August 5, has been timed to let movie buffs catch some of their favourite films on the way back from work.				 																																																											Selected after much deliberation, the INOX fare includes Tarun Majumdars Aalo, Sandip Rays Bombaiyer Bombete, Anjan Das Iti Srikanta, Kaushik Gangulys Warish, Subrata Sens Ek Je Achhe Konya, Buddhadeb Dasguptas Mondo Meyer Upakhyan and Rituparno Ghoshs Chokher Bali. The tickets have been modestly priced at Rs 60 and Rs 80.				 																																																											The screening time has been kept 7 pm to help people who had probably missed the films due to office. While picking the films, we were looking for quality and content suitable for a multiplex audience, said a spokesperson for INOX-City Centre.				 																																																											Besides, we want to tap the large population of Bengali cine-goers residing in Salt Lake and north Calcutta, added the spokesperson, explaining why City Centre was chosen over Forum.				 																																																											In the city centre, meanwhile, the 20-telefilm fare has drawn a satisfactory response. The footfall hasnt increased, as we had expected, but it is as good as last years, said Nandan director Anshu Sur.				 																																																											With several new directors making their mark among old hands Anjan Dutt, Raja Dasgupta and Avijit Dasgupta, viewers, too, have bowled the film-makers over with some tough posers during the interactive sessions. The bouncers have ranged from camera angles to shots and sound techniques.				 																																																											We have a more learned audience this time and that is very encouraging, added Sur, who hopes to repeat the popular fest next year. The competition may be even tougher then with Doordarshan entering the field, alongside ETV, Tara, Alpha and Akash channels.South by north-west: Raima Sen goes placesTo say it as we saw it, her performance matched Aishwarya Rai (and some more) in Chokher Bali. Ashalata  who will be returning to INOX-City Centre on August 5  is now causing a few ripples by the Arabian Sea. The pretty actress is busy shooting in Canada for Anubhav Sinhas Dus, which also stars Sunjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan, Zayed Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Diya Mirza and Esha Deol! The only fear factor: losing sight of Raima Sen in the crowd. But with a Telugu film soon to hit the floors and a Bengali one with Jeet almost ready, the face that launches a thousand memories of Suchitra Sen sure has something to smile about.

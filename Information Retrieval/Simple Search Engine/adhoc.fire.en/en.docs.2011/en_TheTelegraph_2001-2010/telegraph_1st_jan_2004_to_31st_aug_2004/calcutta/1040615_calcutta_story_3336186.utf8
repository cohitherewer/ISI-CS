 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 Summer style from young guns 
The real look at Earthy Myths. Picture by Rashbehari Das (above) one of Sayon Mitras ensembles.The year has been bustling with activity on the fashion circuit. To cater to the craving for a new look every season, three city designers have recently launched their summer lines. Here is a peek at what can be found on the racksGoing places																								So far, so good is how 2004 has been for designer Sayon Mitra. While the young man has been on the block for quite some time, its only this year that he seems to be really going places  quite literally. 																								It all started in January when he was noticed by the owner of Kimaya, a chain of designer boutiques, and was asked to showcase his creations in the Mumbai and Dubai stores. This set off something of a chain reaction.																								For one, Sayon has been approached by Shlok, a fashion studio in Mumbais new Phoenix mall which has emerged a prestigious outlet for designers.																								The owner of Shlok saw my clothes in Kimaya, liked them and got in touch with me. I have started retailing from there a couple of weeks back, informs Sayon, who flew off to the glam capital boutique for a promotion of his summer lines for both men and women on Monday. From Mumbai I will go to Bangalore to explore possibilities at both Ffolio and Cinnamon, he adds.																								Next stop will be Hyderabad where he will visit Elahi, another national fashion store where he is retailing. A corporate tie-up is also on the cards.																								But thats not the end of Sayons success story. Apparently, actress Rani Mukherjee was quite impressed with his work when she spied it at Kimaya and has picked up one of the outfits. Rani has shown interest in my work and I will meet her in Mumbai. I hope to make her my client, smiles Sayon.																								The designers summer collection comprises two lines for women and one for men. In one of the womens lines he has blended linen with tant panels in extremely structured western outfits in whites and off-whites. For the other line, a layer of brocade has been sandwiched between two layers of Chanderi fabrics and the clothes are shredded at some places to reveal the brocade. This one is in brighter hues of firozi, hot pink, mustard, red and off-white. The mens line comprises linen and cotton shirts, in which the designer has explored depth through layering. Bridal basicsWhile on young designers, theres yet another fresh talent doing the rounds who has hit big time recently. Abhishek Dutta, a first-batch passout from Wigan and Leigh College, has his own studio in Mandeville Gardens and also retails from Little India on Elgin Road.																								Not just that, Abhishek has also supplied a couple of costumes for the Perizaad Zorabian-Suman Ranganathan starrer Devaki. He has already become a member of the Fashion Design Council of India and hopes to participate in the India Fashion Week next year.																								The designer launched a unique line of summer bridals at Little India recently. The collection comprises lehngas and saris for brides-to-be. Going with the mood of the season, its a subdued line in pastel hues.I have used colours like lilac, dull mango yellow, and even white, informs the designer. The ornamentation is of semi-precious stones and crochet. Abhishek has used his trademark leather trimmings on both the lehngas and saris. Lehngas have been teamed with corsets and traditional dupattas, for the modern bride. The saris, mostly in pastels and neutrals catch the eye with leather cutwork. Keep it real																								Another designer who launched her summer line recently is Sucheta Merh. Her collection is all about teenage romance and so she decided to get some real teenagers to parade the clothes, instead of the usual catwalkers, at her Loudon Street boutique called Earthy Myths. 																								The collection is a relaxed and trendy one. And the young style manifests in the trendy skirts in various shapes, textures and her signature prints. Along with teeny skirts, there are the traditional salwar kurtas too. Ranging from pearly whites and soft pastels to vibrant reds, a wide palette of colours has found its way into the collection. 																								Along with her unique prints, theres also some traditional chikankari, which have been embellished with contemporary surface ornamentation. All these carry price tags between Rs 1,350 and Rs 2,950. Also displayed is her range of saris  comfortable kotahs and breezy georgettes adorned in prints, batiks and stylised embellishments.						SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

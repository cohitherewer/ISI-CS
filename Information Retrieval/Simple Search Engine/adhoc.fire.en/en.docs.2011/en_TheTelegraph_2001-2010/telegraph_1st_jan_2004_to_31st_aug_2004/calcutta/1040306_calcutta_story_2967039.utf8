The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Helplines at hand for test blues amp; toil blahs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Its pressure-cooker time for lakhs of students appearing for school-leaving examinations. And as the mercury and the stress levels rise, a scramble is on to put some safety valves in place.																								Help, often from unexpected quarters, is close at hand. Cellular service provider Airtel has launched a tele-counselling service, starting Thursday, where students can dial 670 on their Airtel phones, between 8 am and 8 pm, for help from a psycho-therapist on their doubts, dilemmas and despairs.																								Though the service will cost Rs 3 per minute  half of what one must pay to hear PMspeak  parents and students dont seem to mind. Ive already received around 20 calls since the morning, said Snigdha Gohain on Thursday, the voice-at-the-end-of-the-exam-blues tunnel manning the Airtel helpline. And its not just students, but a number of parents,too, have called up.																								Performance pressure from parents, fear of messing it up on D-day and illnesses related to seasonal change make March the cruellest month of the year for students.																								Apart from Airtel, NGOs such as Serve (2284-2218) and Sneh (2476-4011) are also doing their bit to comfort the kids. The number of calls that we receive remain almost the same during the exam months, said Brendan McCarthaigh of Serve, but the intensity and the desperation increase.																								Agrees Snehs Sramana Dasgupta: Generally, we receive non-exam-related queries throughout the year, but from end of February through March, we only get queries on how to handle exam-related stress.																								The common complaints, say counsellors, have remained the same over the years. Lack of confidence has to be the biggest problem, said Dasgupta. Despite preparing well, several factors, such as facing board exams for the first time, high expectations from parents and a fear of the worst happening, make the students panic, she added.																								While different counsellors apply different techniques to tackle the anxiety attacks, they all agree that a simple assurance often works wonders.																								As Soma Gomes, a teacher of a missionary school in central Calcutta, put it: The students want those who are in a position to judge them to provide some assurance. Along with certain examination techniques, helping them to think positively about themselves is an effective tool.																								There is nothing like face-to-face counselling, feels McCarthaigh, but concedes that the helplines provide a viable substitute. He peppers the counselling sessions with his own four-point psycho-technique, and tips such as taking breaks between studies.																								Making a checklist of what is left, studying at convenient hours but with adequate sleep, and an overall confidence-boosting also help.																								But parents must be coached as well, warned Dasgupta. With more and more parents becoming actively involved in their childrens studies and students becoming more open towards discussing their anxieties, we ask the parents to refrain from pressuring the students in any way.

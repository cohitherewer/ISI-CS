 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Rice ready in three minutes
 																											- Breakthrough boon claimed in food processing technology MITA MUKHERJEE																								After 2-minute noodles, its time for 3-minute bhaat.																								Instead of waiting for an hour to make sure that a plate of steaming rice is ready, just cut open a packet of processed rice, pour the cereal into boiling water, allow it to boil for three minutes and the bhaat is ready. 																								After a year-long research, scientists of Calcutta Universitys (CU) chemical engineering department have invented a technique by which one can cook rice within three minutes without using a pressure cooker.																								Our invention is significant in the field of food processing technology. We are the first in the country to have invented this, claimed Ajit Banik, a scientist of the CUs chemical engineering department, under whose supervision the research was carried out.																								The universitys invention is also significant in view of the emphasis the state government has laid on developing the food processing industry. The government has displayed the product at the stall erected by its food processing department at the ongoing Industrial India Trade Fair on the Maidan. The knowhow will be passed on to interested entrepreneurs for large-scale production, Banik said.																								According to him, some organisations already sell cooked rice in a dried form. He claimed that customers do not buy this because it gets stale fast if there is even the slightest defect in packaging.																								We process the rice in such a way that there is a minimum chance of fermentation. We have used this method so that the food value of the cereal remains intact and all its essential nutrients, such as amino acids and vitamins, are retained, said Banik.																								Officials in the food processing department said the cost of the product was moderate and this could help it to get a steady market. The product will cost only Rs 5 more per kg than the original price of the raw material used. If the raw material costs Rs 15 per kg, the processed product will cost Rs 20 per kg.

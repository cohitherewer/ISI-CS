The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

	Several amenities at the lounge of Calcuttas international airport are still wanting. Though visitors are charged Rs 20 for entering the lounge, the airport authorities have not provided a single PCO/STD booth or public toilet for their convenience. The electronic display board at the airport, which boasts of ISO 9001 certification, doesnt even function properly. Most passengers and visitors have to depend on the announcements made over the public address system. The staff at the airways information booths are also non- cooperative.

	A manhole on the footpath in front of the FMC building on AJC Bose Road has been kept open for many days now. Though a temporary fence has been put around it, the area still is dangerous after dark. Small strays can easily fall into it. It has already been filled with garbage thrown in by passers-by. Another manhole close to Big Baazar on Elgin Road is also without a cover. 
	S.S. Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.

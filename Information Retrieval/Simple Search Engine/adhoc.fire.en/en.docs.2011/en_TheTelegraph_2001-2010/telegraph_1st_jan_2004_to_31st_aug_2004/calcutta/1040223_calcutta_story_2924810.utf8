The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, February 23, 2004  Calcutta Column

	I recently shifted here from Mumbai. Trams are the cheapest conveyance available, but most conductors are lethargic and sell tickets to just 20 per cent of the total number of passengers. A commission on ticket sales might motivate them to work better.

	The two rows of seats in the front stall of south Calcuttas Bijoli cinema are too close to the screen. Tickets for these seats are for Rs 15 but watching a three-hour movie can be a strain. The front two rows should be removed altogether and the minimum ticket price made Rs 20.

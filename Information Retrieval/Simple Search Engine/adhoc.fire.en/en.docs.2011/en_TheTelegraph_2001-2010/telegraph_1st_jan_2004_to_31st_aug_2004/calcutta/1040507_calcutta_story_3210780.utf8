 JAYANTA BASU																								Climate control can be good business, especially with developed countries waiting to buy the benefits of green discipline here. A workshop on formulating clean development mechanism (CDM) projects in India urged industries to take advantage of this new concept regarding climate change. This has great business potential in developed countries like Japan, Canada and members of the European Union.																								The day-long workshop was jointly organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Resource Futures International, Canada, (RFI) and Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI). CDM, which is an off-shoot of the Kyoto Protocols commitment to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, predominantly carbon dioxide, in the industrialised countries and thus cater to the major environmental problems like global warming and the greenhouse effect, allows developed countries to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries, including India. 																								If an industry in India can reduce its greenhouse gas load significantly more than that required by the regulatory bodies through application of green technology, it can come under CDM purview. Either individual industries in the developed countries or such countries themselves can buy the resultant carbon balance by paying the implementing industry here as per the market price, explained Tara Preston of the department of foreign affairs and international trade and deputy director, CDM, in Canada.																								However, the whole process, starting from implementing the clean technology to getting the financial return from an agency of a developed country is a long one, requiring a clearance from the host country and then from an independent international agency. Once the final certification is obtained, the project will be open to the market. Two projects from India are in the final stages of consideration, she added.																								As of now, there has been more than 200 CDM initiatives, mostly from the southern states, out of which 30-odd have already got the ministry of environment and forest clearance. Unfortunately, there has been only one initiative from eastern India. We are trying to educate the industries here about the huge financial potential of the concept, informed K.P. Nyati of Environment Management Division of CII. He put the blame on both the poor awareness level and as well as the lack of adequate government efforts. Preety Bhandari of TERI agreed about poor awareness but added that industries would need time to react to the new and still quite fluid concept.																								Experts indicated that the potential areas for India vis--vis CDM were wind, power, biomass, small hydropower, village electrification, solar energy and waste. Aforestation and reforestation may be included shortly on the list. Director of West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Authority, S.P. Gon Chowdhury, pointed out that the CDM concept would succeed only when linked to innovative projects keeping government policy in mind.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Landlord terror target in eviction
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND BHAJAN GANGULY																								Barely three days after Justice Barin Ghosh slammed three cops for all but doing away with the rule of law, a resident of Howrah turned to Calcutta High Court for help, alleging that the local police were doing nothing to stop some goons from terrorising his family.																								Shantipada Roy, 58, is living in fear ever since he made the mistake of evicting a trespasser from his premises. Local goons have threatened to harm his college-going daughter and kill him, alleged Roy.																								On Monday, Roy moved high court, seeking intervention in the matter after the local police chose to turn a blind eye.																								I was stunned to hear what Roy and his family have gone through in the past few days. His daughter is traumatised and is finding it difficult to even leave home for college, said advocate Subroto Mookherjee, who filed a writ petition on Monday.																								The seeds of Roys tale of woe were sown back in 1997, when he first bought a house in Salkia. I allowed a distant relative and his family, who had fallen on bad times, to occupy a portion of the ground floor. But he just refused to vacate the house, leaving me with no alternative but to move court, recalled Roy.																								Armed with an order from the Howrah court in his favour, Roy, an insurance agent, asked his guests, Dilip Roy and family, to vacate the house on February 25. The tenant did move out, but not before promising to teach the landlord a lesson.																								The next night, some unidentified men, armed with rods and country-made revolvers, barged into Roys single-storey house. I was beaten up and told that I should not have dared to throw Dilip Roy out. Some of the men were local CPM leaders, while the others were criminals from the area. They told me that if I dared go to the police or to court, I would be killed and my daughter raped, Roy alleged.																								The criminals left the house only after Dilip Roy and his family moved back in. Golabari police station was approached for help, but no one was willing to hear Roy out, forcing him to approach Calcutta High Court.																								When contacted, Dilip Roy said he had been living in the house for years and there was no evidence to prove that he had made an unauthorised entry.																								Gouri Shankar Kanjilal, officer-in-charge, Golabari police station, admitted that Roy had been assaulted in his house. We will investigate the case, he added.

 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Special clinic for urine loss
 SANJAY MANDAL AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								It had been present for ages, but with the urine incontinence graph crossing the 35 per cent mark among the citys women, doctors have decided to press the alarm button.																								Specialists say that frequent childbirth, that weakens the pelvic muscles, and an unhealthy lifestyle are the primary reasons why women in Calcutta, in the 30-45 age group, suffer from uncontrolled urine loss.																								The problem of urine incontinence is widely prevalent among women in the city and is further aggravated because they dont want to talk about it at all, says uro-surgeon Amit Ghose.																								Urine incontinence, according to doctors, is caused when the pelvic floor muscle in the female body, which supports the urine and genital passage, becomes weak. 																								When the patient laughs or coughs, pressure is exerted on the abdomen and urine passes involuntarily, explains urologist Amlan Chakraborty.																								An unhealthy lifestyle, causing urinary tract infection in women, often gives way to incontinence, apart from complications from frequent childbirth. 																								A large section of women, in their post-menopausal stage, also complain about uncontrolled urine loss, but that is predominantly caused by hormonal imbalance. 																								After menopause, the secretion of hormones decreases, causing incontinence, apart from other problems. But with adequate hormone replacement therapy, the disease can be cured gradually, says obstetrician and gynaecologist Purabi Mukherjee. About 76 per cent of the cases are caused by stress on the muscles of the pelvic floor, doctors say.																								To address the problem, Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute has decided to open a speciality clinic from later this week. Earlier, incontinence was a condition suffered only by older women. But now, more and more young women have started to complain of the problem, resulting in the birth of the new clinic in the city, says urologist Chakraborty. Three doctors have been assigned to take charge of the project.																								Surveys conducted in the city have so far revealed that almost 90 per cent of the women do not talk about it at home and only seek doctors help when the problem reaches alarming levels. 																								Most women tend to treat themselves by using over-the-counter drugs, which only aggravates the problem. 																								Doctors advocate a significant change in lifestyle after the disease is detected, including regular exercise and weight reduction as the possible cures, apart from surgery and medication. Regular counselling at the clinic, apart from routine follow-ups, has been planned for patients.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, July 12, 2004  Remixed revelryHIMIKA CHAUDHURI AND SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY DJ Suketu rocks the crowd at Incognito and (below) a scene from the City Centre temporary disco. Pictures by Rashbehari Das DJ Suketu may still be cashing on his two biggest remix hits Pyaar Zindagi Hai and the now popular Bin Tere Sanam, but his dual performance in the city on Saturday evening proved beyond doubt that this remix-man is here to stay. 																					From the Royal Calcutta Golf Club where he rocked a 300-strong crowd to the posh gathering at the back-in-action Incognito, the little man with magic fingers spun the disks hard and loud.																					Kicking off with Bin Tere Sanam (what has become his signature track), and moving on to other popular remix numbers and international chart-toppers, he made quite sure that the crowd at the club and the guests at the nightclub both had their fill of it all.																					Hes learnt some real showmanship, too. From being the shy guy who hardly ever lifted his head from the turntable, hes graduated to guy uninterrupted, moving across the length and breadth of the stage, dancing to his own tracks and urging the crowd to follow suit.																					I have come back to play in Calcutta off and on, and it feels nice to see that the party circuit is growing here, said the disc jockey.																					The Incognito audience did well with some trance tracks interspersing the remixes. The hip and young brigade at The Taj nightclub seemed more interested in not just remixes but in a mix of good music. 																					Its not easy to keep an entire city rocking from 8 pm straight into the wee hours, but with the crowd on his side, Suketu didnt seem to mind the strain on his ears and hands.																																														French touch																					In matters concerning beauty and style, anything French is considered sacred. So, when French cosmetics major Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) hosted a makeup workshop in the city, it was little wonder that women of all age groups hung on every word, with hopes of learning the tricks of the trade from the world leaders.

Picture by Rashbehari Das The Calcutta chapter of the FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) organised a makeup demonstration workshop for its members at the Oberoi Grand on Saturday afternoon. Two makeup artistes  Gisele Dodde from Mumbai and Pooja Seth from Delhi  created magic with their deft fingers.While the first model for the afternoon was catwalker Sanjukta, the session was soon opened up for members of the audience. The transformation of the everyday women into glam dolls through the expert strokes was simply amazing.																					The sessions started with the very basics  cleansing and toning  as clean skin is a prerequisite for good makeup. After this, the primer or the base was applied using foundation and compact powder, followed by blush.																					Different looks for the eyes were given to each of the models, using eye-shadow, eyeliner and mascara. For the lips, lip liner and lipstick were given a dazzle with a trace of sungloss.																					Seema Bahety from Beauty Concepts, the company representing YSL, answered queries about the products that were displayed at the venue.																					We are planning more such interesting programmes for our members. Our aim is to draw women out of the kitchens and get them involved in other pursuits which would bring out their hidden talent, said Shashi Prabha Jalan, chairperson of the Calcutta chapter of FLO.																					Masti makers																					93.5 Red FM has been churning out music for Calcutta over a year now. Inox, the first multiplex to make its mark on Calcutta, has screened hundreds of films. But none of the two masti makers have got as close to Calcuttas youth brigade as they did on Saturday evening, when they jointly hosted an open-air disco session.																					The chance to be in a temporary disco at City Centre on Saturday evening drew everyone from the wannabe party animal to the unsuspecting curious shopper.While some worked themselves up into a frenzy dancing from 5.30 pm to the time when RJ Jimmy Tangree called it a night, others caught amidst the action stood bewildered at the sight of such a huge and extremely spirited crowd.Calcutta had come dressed for the occasion, with clear attempts at one-upping the Salman Khans and Isha Koppikars and everyone in between, swinging to tunes like Kaanta lagaa.																					Young women jumped onto the DJ console to dance, cheered by friends (some of whom they had brought along and some they made there).A floating crowd of 5,700 people apparently hit the open-air disco through the evening. Thanks so much for being here, love you all, signed off Jimmy, breaking many hearts with feet still aching to go on and on.Natural tones																					The perils of colouring hair with chemical dyes could well be over, according to Mayuri Henna, a newly launched hair-care company. 																					With three different colours of henna up their sleeves, the promise is that those with greying hair or otherwise can go for the coloured look without the side-effects of itching scalp or hair loss.																					The product is 100 per cent natural and involves no chemicals, so its better than using a dye to hide your greying strands, said Ritesh Ajmera, managing director of the Mumbai-based company which will now retail their products in Calcutta.																					Containing herbs like amla, shikakai, tulsi and ritha, the products can be used to give the original mehndi tinge to the hair, with black and brown variations available as well. All colours are meant to last at least a month.

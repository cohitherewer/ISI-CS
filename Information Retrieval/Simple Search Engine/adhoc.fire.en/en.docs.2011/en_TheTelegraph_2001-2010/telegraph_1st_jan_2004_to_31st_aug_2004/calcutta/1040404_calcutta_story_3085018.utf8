The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Hawker slapped to death in kerb space row
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It took just one slap to send an 80-year-old dry-fruits seller on his way to the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (MCH) morgue. He had picked an argument with a younger colleague on Friday night over the sharing of space on a pavement of Colootola Street.																								Police said a fight broke out between Ganikhan and Saukat over the space from where they sold their merchandise. Saukat, a youth in his mid-twenties, slapped the older man. Ganikhan lost his balance and fell on the pavement, receiving a head injury, an officer of the Bowbazar police station said.																								The boy would tease Ganikhan and he would shower abuses on Saukat. Last night the scuffle took a serious turn. Ganikhan was bleeding from the back of his head when we took him to the hospital, said a local shop-owner.																								Doctors at the emergency ward of MCH put sutures to seal the wound on Ganikhans head. He was admitted to the hospital in an unconscious state. His condition deteriorated and he died at around 9 am, the officer added.																								Rajiv Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, central division, said Saukat was absconding. We have started a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Saukat, Kumar said.Metro services hit: Metro Rail services were disrupted on Saturday evening after a down train, which left Dum Dum at 6.30 pm, developed technical snags at Park Street station. Normal services resumed at 7.40 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Unfair to force a purchase
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should buying at least one book be made mandatory for every visitor to the Book Fair? More letters will be published next week				 Beyond headcount:  Visitors or buyers? Diptimoy Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														Why should buying of books be made mandatory when visitors have to pay an entry fee to the Book Fair? This may cause resentment among book lovers because many go there to browse through books and collect information. The Book Fair allows only 10 per cent discount on prices of books, which is available round the year in College Street bookshops. 																																																														Moreover, if every visitor has to buy a book what happens in case of a family of four or five? This is ridiculous. The Book Fair is a festival of books. If purchase is made compulsory, it will mar the spirit of the festival. 									

Danish Khan, 
																		College Street.																																																														It is a foolish idea. It is entirely up to the visitors whether they want to buy a book or not. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore.																																																														There is no denying that out of the crowd that visits the fair, only a small percentage buy books. Thus, the main purpose of the fair gets lost while other purposes like meeting friends, snacking and roaming around are served. No doubt the proposed idea holds logic. The authorities may consider selling some low-priced books along with the tickets. 									

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 
																		Barasat.																																																														Booksellers say that they come to the fair not only to sell books, but also to create an awareness in these days of competition from the electronic media. You cant issue a writ that books must be purchased at the fair. The decision is best left to the judgement of the fair-going people. 									

Tanmoy Das Lala, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														Compulsions should not be imposed on people, neither should people take this event lightly. It is an event where bibliophiles come in contact with books that they had dreamt of buying or had only heard of, but could not buy due to the excessive price. It is an opportunity that allows people to buy books at reasonable rates. At the same time, people should not be allowed to come just for a picnic. 									

Subhobrata Basu,
																		Ballygunge Station Road.																																																														People browse through books, buy some and enjoy the snacks on offer. But there is a problem too. Some men do not go there to buy books, nor do they take any interest. How do you stop them? Either the entry fee must be increased or buying books be made mandatory. In this way, the street Romeos can be kept at bay. People who go to the fair for genuine reasons should not object to the compulsion of buying a book. 									

Biswajit Ganguly,
																		Dakshindari Road.																																																														Prices of books are soaring out of the common peoples reach and visitors to the Book Fair belong to various economic sections. So, one should not be forced to buy a book. Besides, the discount rates offered are very low as compared to College Street bookshops. And quite a few people prefer to read the Internet versions rather than buy hard copies.									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 
																		Deb Lane.																																																														Making it mandatory for every visitor to buy at least one book at the Book Fair is absolute irrationality. The Book Fair is visited by people with a passion for culture and not just books. The fair serves as a platform for budding writers, musicians, painters and craftsmen to present and publicise their creativity. In general, a fair is not a place where a visitor has to make some purchases. Such rules do not exist even in markets, departmental chain stores or shops, for that matter. 																																																														se of passion for art and literature rules amidst the commercial parameters of the event. So, making a purchase mandatory for visitors seems to mar the real essence of the event. 									

Binit Kumar Jha,
																		JL Nehru Road.																																																														The Book Fair is not always the best place to buy a book because of the low discount that it offers compared to what is given at shops in College Street. So making it mandatory to buy a book will do injustice to the visitors. The organisers can raise the entry fee to some extent to earn more profits.									

Indranil Sengupta,
																		Salt Lake.																																																														It wont be fair. The whole purpose of the Book Fair would get defeated if such a rule is implemented. Making it mandatory would certainly not mean that people would pick up a book for the love of reading. Books are not cheap any more. Visiting a book fair is always educative but very few genuine book lovers go to the fair. Most spend leisure time and the crowd near the food stalls is proof of that. This rule will not turn them to book lovers.									

Tapan Pal,
																		Batanagar.																																																														The proposal is good. People go to the fair to prove themselves to be what they mostly are not  book addicts. The fair is just the place to be on spring afternoons for a cup of tea and samosa. The proposed clause would help greatly to reduce the crowd at the fair, and would make the visits of bibliophiles comfortable. Some days of the fair should be reserved for people with a minimum level of academic accomplishment. It will also reduce the lumpen crowd.									

T.R. Anand,
																		Budge Budge Trunk Road.																																																														No, it is wrong to force all who come to the fair to make a purchase. The choice should stay with the visitor, who is paying an entrance fee and has every right to enjoy the presentations made and check out the fare. Such a rule may call for a boycott. Fairs are meant to woo the public into buying the products on display and not to force them. 									

S.S. Almal,
																		Lower Rawdon Street.																																																														Buying a book at the fair should not be mandatory. One cannot even bargain for the amount of the discount there.

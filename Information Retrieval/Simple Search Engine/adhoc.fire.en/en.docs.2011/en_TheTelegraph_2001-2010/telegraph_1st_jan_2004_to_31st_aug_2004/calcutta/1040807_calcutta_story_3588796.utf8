(AFP)																								From the new-age eateries in town to the unique nostalgia of Park Street as the citys original food and entertainment corridor, the allure of the river to the heritage monuments from the British Raj																								A bit of Calcutta in Dubai. Thats what representatives of the hospitality trade in town would like to carry to the shopping and tourism hub of West Asia next month. 																								The occasion: the 40th convention of the Federation of Hotel amp; Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI). The venue: JW Marriot Hotel, Dubai, the convention capital of the world. The agenda: showcase Calcutta as a happening F amp;B-entertainment cauldron.																								The conclave (September 9-11) is being held outside the Indian sub-continent for the first time, and the 50-strong delegation from Calcutta expected to attend, is keen to use the podium for highlighting the city as an emerging market to foray. 																								To add muscle to the hardsell Calcutta initiative, the eastern India wing of the federation is trying to rope in state tourism secretary R.K. Tripathy to pitch for the citys tourism potential. 																								We want to project Calcutta as the gateway to the East, Northeast as well as Nepal, and Dubai presents a wonderful opportunity to spread the good word to a global audience, says Sunny Puri, owner of Trincas. 																								Grain of Salt director Nitin Kohli agrees with Puri that the platform must be leveraged to benefit the food and entertainment business in town, and is getting a special photo-shoot of Grain and Shisha done for a premium brochure for the Dubai meet.																								As a tourism destination, Dubai has evolved beyond recognition in recent years. Every year, more than six million overseas tourists descend on it, the most internationally flavoured among the seven Emirates, while India is struggling to touch even three million. Their aggressive promotional and marketing drive should be a great learning curve for all of us, feels Nitin Shivji Kothari, who owns Peter Cat and Mocambo.																								He is keen to use the opportunity to interact with international players on the sidelines of the conference. 																								A lot of these oil-rich Arabs are always looking for viable options to park their funds, and we can tell them about the spectrum of potential Calcutta can offer, including our rich cultural heritage and the shining legacy of British architecture, Kothari points out.																								Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis Restaurant, another landmark eatery on Park Street, which like Trincas, has seen better times, looks at the convention as an occasion to trumpet the magic mix of Park Street that once cast a spell on Calcutta. 																								Its such a special street, with so much to offer in terms of ambience and heritage houses, culinary clout and shop stops. With resources and sympathetic inputs, it can be the same again, and maybe Dubai could provide the spark, hopes Daryanani.																								We will surely do our bit to underline the possibilities in the east. But, success of the hospitality trade hinges on a number of factors, like a well-appointed international airport, good roads, allied infrastructure and boosting linked tourist destinations, observes S.K. Khullar, owner of Amber restaurant and immediate past president, FHRAI.																								Apart from the 500-plus delegates from India, the Dubai conclave will also see international speakers from Europe and the US speaking on the latest trends in the industry, including resorts, restaurants and budget hotels.

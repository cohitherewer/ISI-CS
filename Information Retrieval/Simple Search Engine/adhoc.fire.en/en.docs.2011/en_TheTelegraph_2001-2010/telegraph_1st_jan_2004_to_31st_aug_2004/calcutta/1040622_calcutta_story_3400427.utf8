 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Duo in net for killing CMC man
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a pre-dawn swoop on Monday, city police arrested two more persons in connection with the killing of an employee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Lokelal Mahato, on Thursday night at Taltala. 																								The duo, Mukesh Raut and Souvik Das, was rounded up from a hideout in the same locality.																								Earlier, police netted another man, identified as Bapi Saha. All three were arrested on a charge of committing murder. Police are now looking for two others who were among the attackers.																								Investigation revealed that the killing was a fall-out of a long-standing rivalry between two families of Midnapore. A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Taltala police station, said Shouviks father, Salil Das, was beaten up by Piklu and Laltu a few days ago at Bhabanichawk, in Midnapore. From then on, Shouvik was bent on taking revenge, Majumdar said.																								Shouvik came to know that Laltu and Piklu were members of a club in Doctors Lane. Accordingly, he, along with four others, raided the club on Thursday night. Unable to find Laltu and Piklu they turned violent and started hurling bombs.																								Mahato, who had nothing to do with the attackers, received splinter injuries when a bomb hit his head. 																								The bomb first hit a tree and then struck Mahatos head. It exploded and partially blew off Mahatos head. He was taken to NRS Hospital, where doctors declared him dead, said an officer of Taltaa police station. 																								The attackers all belonged to the same pocket of Doctors Lane. Police have launched a manhunt for the other two attackers.

It is under his guidance that Kalashram has flourished into a school that nurtures traditional Indian arts and culture through myriad activities that include seminars, lecture-demonstrations and presentations of traditional and contemporary works. The city had the pleasure of being audience to Kalashrams Roopmati Bazbahadur in 2002 which was followed by Romeo and Juliet, a ballet in contemporary Kathak style, in 2003. Kalashram now returns with Kathak Yatra, presented in tandem by traditional artists from the village alongside stalwarts like Pandit Birju Maharaj, Rita Ganguly and Saswati Sen. Also participating are several senior dancers both from Calcutta and Delhi.																								When: Today and tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

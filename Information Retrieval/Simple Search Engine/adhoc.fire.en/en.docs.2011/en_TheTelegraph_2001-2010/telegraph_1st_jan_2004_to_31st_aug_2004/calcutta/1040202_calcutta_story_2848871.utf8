 															- Eminent citizens suggest ways to make Calcutta a better place to walk, drive in SWATI SENGUPTA				 	 PC Sorcar: Car management																								How about traffic police manning the streets of Calcutta on a dark winter day in fluorescent, instead of navy blue, sweaters and flashing bright boards screaming stop or go to drivers, instead of flailing their arms in futility?																								How about shifting bus stands from hospital entrances and having pre-paid taxi stands on hand, instead?																								How about zones marked no standing for pedestrians and no stopping for vehicles near crucial crossroads?																								If one or more of these suggestions made by some distinguished Calcuttans to the traffic wing of Calcutta Police are implemented, the city might yet be a better place to drive and walk in.																								We usually work on the basis of ideas acquired through our experience. But if we get the points of view of other Calcuttans, it definitely helps us in our work, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Peeyush Pandey.																								With this in mind, at least 50 teachers, doctors, engineers and artistes were invited and asked to offer suggestions for improving the citys traffic management system. We avoided bringing in politicians, as we keep getting their feedback from time to time, observed Pandey.																								The city police area, comprising 11 traffic guards, was divided into five broad zones, and about five citizens from each zone were invited to offer their suggestions. Among those prescribing traffic management methods were magician PC Sorcar (Junior), Asutosh College principal Debabrata Chowdhury, SSKM Hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi, National Library director Ramanuj Bhattacharya and orthopaedic surgeon D.P. Bakshi.																								Some of the best suggestions, police later said, came from the magician. The resident of Ballygunge did not claim to have the powers to make all traffic snarls vanish into thin air, but he did come up with some workable solutions.																								For one, he observed how difficult it was to spot a traffic policeman while driving in the dark. Their dull, navy blue sweaters can be replaced by some bright fluorescent colours. And they can hold up bright stop and go signs, was a Sorcar magic potion.																								We are taking note of all the suggestions, and plan to implement those that are practical. Some can be done soon, while others will take time, said Pandey.

 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Biman footage retain order
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A high court division bench has directed television channels Tara Bangla, ETV and Khas Khobor to preserve the video cassettes containing allegedly critical comments by Left Front chairman Biman Bose on the verdict delivered by Justice Amitava Lala in September 2003, restricting rallies on city roads.																								In a contempt suit against him, the Front chairman had filed an affidavit saying he had not made any adverse remark against the judge or his verdict. 																								The petitioners, however, contended that Boses comments were on record in the cassettes of the TV channels. The bench then asked the television channels to preserve the cassettes.

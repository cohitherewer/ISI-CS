 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Sisters locked in hut ablaze
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two girls, Wahida Khatun, 17, and Siba Khatun, 9, were killed and another, Nagma Khatun, 5, is fighting for her life at Nil Ratan Sircar Hospital after their shanty on Keshub Chandra Sen Street went up in flames early on Tuesday. Amherst street police station officials said the three sisters suffered serious burns.																								According to deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Sanjay Mukherjee, at around 6 am, a lighted kerosene lamp overturned and set the shanty ablaze. 																								Both the parents had gone out to work after locking the main door of the shanty, while the girls were asleep. The three received severe burns and were moved to hospital, where Wahida and Siba succumbed to their injuries later in the day, Mukherjee said.																								The girls father runs a paan shop in the area and leaves by 5.30 am daily. Hazra Khatun, the mother, who works as a domestic help in the neighbourhood, locks the main door every day before going out to work, said S.K. Mitra, officer-in-charge of the local police station.																								It was not safe to leave the house without locking the door, as the children used to be asleep when I would leave. But I had no idea that this would result in their death, as they could not come out of the house while it was ablaze, Hazra told police. 																								Neighbours noticed smoke billowing out of the shanty but by the time they realised it was on fire, it was engulfed in flames. 																								The three sisters, unable to make their way out of the burning house, were screaming. The eldest, Wahida, was trying to break open the door but could not, as the door was in flames. By the time the neighbours brought buckets of water to douse the flames, the girls had fainted inside, Mitra added.																								The fire brigade had not been informed and locals rescued the girls and took them to hospital. 																								The main entrance of the shanty was broken after they put out the fire and the girls were carried away to hospital. Wahida was the first one to die, at around 10 am, and Siba died a couple of hours later. While the youngest of the three, Nagma, is still fighting for her life, her condition is stated to be serious, a police officer said.

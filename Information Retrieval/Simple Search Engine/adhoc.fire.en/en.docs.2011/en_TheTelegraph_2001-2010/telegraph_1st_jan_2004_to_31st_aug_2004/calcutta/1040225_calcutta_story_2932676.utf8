The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 																				TINA MUKHERJEE								Model																																							Cabbies usually charge double the fare at night, and sometimes thrice, taking advantage of the hapless passenger desperately looking for conveyance. This is not fair. We face this problem often, especially while returning from shows after 1 am. Taxi drivers should not be allowed to charge 50 per cent extra as the fare is already too high in Calcutta when compared to other metropolitan cities.

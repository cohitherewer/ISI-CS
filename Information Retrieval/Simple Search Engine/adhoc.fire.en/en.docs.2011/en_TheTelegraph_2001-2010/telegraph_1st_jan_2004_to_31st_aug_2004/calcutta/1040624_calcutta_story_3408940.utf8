 																											- Eimpa drops representatives over militant unionism A STAFF REPORTER																								Eastern India Motion Picture Association (Eimpa) has decided to discontinue the services of representatives, engaged by distributors to pick up collections from hall-owners, following the assault on an exhibitor on Wednesday.																								Rup Kumar Goswami, proprietor of Pooja cinema, in Chandrakona town, West Midnapore, was allegedly attacked by members belonging to the Citu-affiliated Eastern India Motion Picture distributors representatives and employees association at 10, Waterloo Street, around 2 pm, where he had gone to settle a payment dispute.																								The representatives collect money from exhibitors who run films on a percentage basis. 																								Goswami, who was screening Songi on a rental basis at Pooja, refused to pay up when a distributors representative approached him recently. 																								I had dropped into the office of my booker at 10, Waterloo Street to sort out the matter when a group of 10 to 15 men heckled me and slapped me, in the presence of association secretary A. Kalam, alleged Goswami.																								A complaint has been lodged with Hare Street police station and Eimpa officials will take up the matter with the state government on Thursday.																								No distributor in the state will issue any duty to the representatives from Friday. We have decided to discontinue with their services. If need be, we will shut down the film industry, Arijit Dutta, president, Eimpa, said on Wednesday.																								The representatives have been unlawfully squeezing money from hall-owners for a long time. There have been incidents of physical attacks in the past and we have resolved to put an end to this malpractice, Dutta added.																								Around 400 representatives scattered across Bengal are engaged on a contractual basis by film distributors for a daily wage of Rs 95. Hall-owners who run films on a rental basis are not supposed to pay anything to the representatives, but they give in under the militant trade unionism practised by the association, claimed an Eimpa spokesperson. Goswami tried to reason with them and was harassed, he added.																								With technological advances, the film industry does not need the services of representatives any more, Dutta explained. 																								We can ill afford to spend a sum of Rs 1.5 crore on them annually, he added.																								With this decision, the memorandum of understanding between Eimpa and the representatives association, valid till October 2005, has also been suspended, said a spokesperson.																								Earlier, Eimpa comprised Bihar and Orissa as well. But we have lost the two states, thanks to the hooliganism practised by the representatives, alleged Eimpa vice-president Surinder Singh.

 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Jatra fest decibels disrupt Madhyamik diligence
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The day had seen the authorities rattling off a reassuring list of rules to help Madhyamik examinees.																								By evening, over 100 students in Barasat, preparing for Madhyamik 2004, were trying in vain to concentrate on their books, their efforts drowned in the din of a jatra festival organised by a club with political clout.																								Police efforts to muzzle the microphones blaring from Tuesday evening till well into the night met with stiff resistance from a club dominated by Forward Bloc members.																								The first batch of cops, acting on a complaint by teenagers in the area trying to study for the Madhyamik test commencing on March 5, was heckled and pushed back, till reinforcements arrived and restored order.																								But it was close to midnight before police managed to bring down about a dozen microphones and lower the decibel level.																								Students in the locality lost several study hours, their plight compounded by the fact that police decided to act five hours after a complaint was registered.																								The jatra started around 6.30 pm but police arrived only at 11 pm, though the site was half-an-hour away from the Barasat police station, said Nitai Bank, a student of Sarada Vidyapith.																								From around 6.30 pm on Tuesday, we received phone calls from the Ashwininagar area about microphones being played loudly by Baba Lokenath Natya Sangstha, a local club hosting a seven-day jatra festival. But with no force on hand, we could only send our officials to the spot around 11 pm, police later said.																								Officer-in-charge of Barasat police station Sunil Biswas said trouble broke out when cops asked club members to pull down the microphones. Led by a former Forward Bloc councillor of Barasat municipality Hemanta Das, they refused to comply.																								This is our sixth jatra anniversary and there has never been any trouble before. We dont know why you are asking us to pull down the microphones, said Das, adding that they had police permission for the function.																								Police claimed the decibel level was far higher than the permissible limit, leading to an altercation. When another batch arrived from Barasat thana, policemen forcibly pulled down the microphones, entered the jatra arena and cut off the power lines to the box-microphones.																								When organisers requested that the lines be restored to placate the audience, police did so on condition that the volume be lowered. But that was little consolation too late for the complainants.

 A child plays the violin at Crossword as Chandrani from Krosswindz looks on. Picture by Rashbehari Das They may have played in front of audiences numbering up to hundreds. They may have travelled across the country to perform for their fans. But Krosswindzs experience on Thursday evening at Crossword jamming with toddlers is sure to stand out as one of its most enjoyable gigs. 																								Interacting with an audience in the age group of three to five years can be far from easy. And telling them about the bass guitar, drums or shakers, at the risk of boring them totally, is even more difficult. But thats exactly what the band did and with elan. 																								Kicking off the show with a string of nursery rhymes, the band did everything from getting the children to try out the various instruments, to an impromptu jam session, to belting out numbers from their latest folk album Jhiko Jhiko. Weve never had so much fun, said Chandrani, the female lead singer of the band, cuddling the babies and coaxing them to sing and dance. 																								A part of the summer camp at the bookstore, this event sent even the parents of the participants rocking on their feet. I think we should have more such events. It helps us understand the interests of the child better, said Sonia Surana, whose three-year-old daughter Jasmine had just started showing interest in some colourful rattles lying around. 																								I think this is a great way of increasing knowledge, felt mom Alka Tibrewala, who had brought both her son and daughter to take part in the musical session. These single events are turning out to be big hits with both parents and children who feel they offer more flexibility than a three-day long summer camp. We intend to organise many such interactive and educative events in the future, in keeping with the concept of a community centre, said Sidharth Pansari, managing director of the Calcutta store.  With the crowning of a new Miss Universe on Wednesday morning, it was time to celebrate womanhood. That was the idea behind the revelry at the Cloud 9, that invited city models Pooja, Nicola, Ishika and Pinky to liven up the spirits of nightbirds who had come to shake a leg at the popular haunt. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Blenders pride 																								 Fiery concoctions to keep the party going is what the new cocktail menu at Tantra is all about. Top it with some flair bartending and chances are you might want to give the dance floor a miss in favour of the bar-stool.																								Juggling bottles and flipping glasses, bartenders Perry, Micki and Ugo from Italy and England have been serving up a special cocktail menu for the past week, some of which have found their way on to the permanent menu.																								The trio, who liked the idea of entertaining guests like they were at a theatre, introduced new mixes to suit the Calcutta weather. They lined up plenty of summer soothers that pack in seasonal fruity flavours along with a punch to remember. 																								Dedicated to the mango season, the new menu offers Bacardi based drinks like Mango Mojito that has just the right blend of mango and fresh lime topped with mint. Watermelon Cooler (Bacardi, Midori, cranberry and orange juice) helps cool off just as easily, while Champagne Dream (Bacardi, strawberry liqueur and fresh strawberry topped with champagne) lends a pleasant high. 																								Topping the unusual blends list though is West Indies Yellow Bird, mixing Bacardi, Galliano, banana liqueur, orange and pineapple juice to a unique flavour. Though steeply priced between Rs 450 and Rs 550, the cocktails appeal with their fine blends and attractive presentation.																								Packing in over 10 years of experience in bartending, the Europeans will be training the Tantra bartenders for the taste to linger long after they are gone. For the bartenders feel there is a vibrant cocktail culture in Calcutta and that there is room for an exclusive cocktail bar in town. Reason to raise the bar? The Sibleys with the Italian ambassador and his wife.																								Toast to Italy 																								 The flavour of Wednesday night was definitely Italy. The citys consular, corporate and cultural corp celebrated the European nations national day organised by the Italian consulate at the ITC Sonar Bangla banquets.																								The Italian ambassador to India Antonio Armellini, who arrived in India just a month ago, and wife Giovannella, attended the meet, on their first official visit to Calcutta. 																								I was here 40 years ago, but not officially, smiled the ambassador, who was accompanied by senior officials from the consulate, including consul general Agostino Pinna. Armellini had earlier met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and is in town till the weekend.US consul general George . Sibley and wife Lee Alison, writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Bob Wright were some of the people who dropped by for the evening. Food, in true Italian style, and beverage was the main attraction. After warming up with cocktails, wine and appetisers, the guests merrily queued up at the live counters serving up Italian specialities, including risotto, ravioli and a variety of pastas with the dessert buffet just as inviting.

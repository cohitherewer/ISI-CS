	With the increasing flow in traffic at the Shyambazar five-point crossing, it is quite difficult for pedestrians to cross the road. Sometimes people take unreasonable risks even as speeding vehicles converge at the junction from all directions. Accidents therefore are very common here. Moreover, some stalls have cropped up on the footpaths which has compounded the problem. It will be of immense help if a footbridge is constructed here.

	The depots of buses on route 44 at Baguiati, on 19A near Sarojini Naidu College and on 227 on Bangur Avenue become slushy after a shower. Passengers run a risk of slipping while boarding or getting off buses. Many buses do not come to a complete halt at the stoppage. Instead, they just slow down and the conductor urges the passengers to hop in. We request the authorities to level the area near the bus stand and fill up the potholes.

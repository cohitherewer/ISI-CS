 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Data gap behind cancer rise
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Nearly 40 per cent of the cancer cases can be prevented by simple methods, and an organised effort by the state government and private hospitals could check the number, city-based oncologists said on Monday.																								There is no organised effort to raise awareness among people for cancer prevention, rued Subir Ganguly, head of oncology department, Medical College and Hospital, and secretary, Association of Radiation Oncologists of India, Bengal chapter.																								Since treatment is very costly and requires huge infrastructure, the focus should be on prevention, Ganguly said. People should follow the health warnings; this will go a long way in preventing the spread of cancer.																								Continuous awareness programmes on the evils of tobacco can bring down the number of male cancer patients by 30 per cent, experts feel. Among women patients, basic health education bring down the number by 15 per cent. 																								The state government, however, claimed it was taking up cancer awareness programmes within limited capacity. For any kind of lifestyle disease, as well as cancer, preventive measures are the best way out, said C.R. Maity, director of medical education. We implement central government cancer prevention programmes but we have limited resources, he added.																								M.M. Chowdhury, vice-chancellor,West Bengal Health University, sought proper framing of curriculum and training, not only for doctors but also for technical hands engaged in cancer management.

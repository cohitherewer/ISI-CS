The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 29, 2004 				 In May, hit highway for summer fun
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A view of the theme park at Alampur. Picture by Pabitra Das																								In the scorching summer ahead, residents of the citys northern fringes will have a cool spot closer home for a family outing. Fantasy World, an amusement park with architectural expertise from Chennai, is coming up at Alampur, off National Highway (NH) 6, about 20 km from central Calcutta.																								The park is dedicated to common people who cannot afford to travel to the city for entertainment, and to the city folk who are tired of Calcuttas summer attractions, said entrepreneur Mousumi Jati, who conceived the theme park. 																								Jati expects people to pour in from the districts of Howrah, Hooghly and Midnapore, and the city as well. Alampur is well connected, with a bus route covering the adjoining districts, and Mourigram railway station just a kilometre away, she added.																								Spread over four acres, Fantasy World will have five swimming pools and one boating pool with four paddle-boats. The pool for children covers 7,500 sq ft, while the main pool has a 110-ft-long multi-lane undulating wave slide. 																								The entrance features a drive-in restaurant-and-bar overlooking the theme park. A posse of 40 securitymen, including lifeguards and bouncers, will be on watch. 																								The entry tickets have been projected at Rs100 per head on weekdays and Rs 150 on weekends, covering all the rides and some insurance, too. 																								The first phase of the project, to be unveiled in May, will feature a waterworld, with three different types of water-propelled undulating slides  open, closed and half-open  plunging into three swimming pools. A separate arrangement with similar slides and pools has been made on a smaller scale for children. We have the architectural expertise of a Chennai-based company, said Jati.																								In the pipeline are a wavepool, where six-ft-high waves will be generated to create a sea beach feel miles away from the coast, and an eight-ft-wide spiral float ride. Provisions have also been made for separate rooms with 750 family-size lockers, toilets, showers and bathrooms. 																								A food plaza and shopping complex, with retail outlets vending mainly swimming gear, and fun-and-games counters are some of the high points.																								A string of other attractions are also being chalked up to ensure a year-round footfall. The second phase will feature dry-rides, like new striking cars, bumper boats and octopus. A lodging arrangement of 25 restrooms, a discotheque-cum-open-air-theatre, a beauty parlour, health club, jacuzzi and a solar-powered warm pool are also on the cards.

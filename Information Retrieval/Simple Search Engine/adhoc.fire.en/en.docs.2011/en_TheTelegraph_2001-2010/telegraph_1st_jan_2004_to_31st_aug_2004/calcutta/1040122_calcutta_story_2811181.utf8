The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Triple bonanza foundation for housing hope
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Liberalisation of land laws and simplification of building rules will lead to more large-format developments in the housing sector, like Hiland Park (above), on the EM Bypass																								What Bangalore and Pune did yesterday, Calcutta is pondering about today. Recognising its potential to generate employment as well as allied economic activities, the state government has finally moved to remove major roadblocks in the growth path of the housing industry.																								State urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya assured stakeholders of the real estate sector on Wednesday that the government was considering simplifying building rules, liberalising the Urban Land Ceiling amp; Registration Act and restructuring the property tax system to boost the industry.																								Addressing a seminar, Vision India 2020  Housing for All, organised by Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI)-Bengal, the minister said the ruling Left was keen to adopt a flexible approach instead of total scrapping of the legislation. 																								Accordingly, a set of liberal guidelines is being framed, in consultation with city developers, to free large holdings of land with the rider of setting aside a portion for the poor, he said.																								Bhattacharya also informed the seminar that a panel constituted to simplify building rules has already submitted its interim report and experts views are being sought on the issue. He said the government was working on a uniform rate of property tax based on a transparent, unit-based method, to replace the existing one computed on annual rentals and left to the discretion of the assessing officer.																								The developers forum, knocking on the governments door for ages to bring down these hurdles, was understandably elated at the three-pronged bonanza declared by the minister. 																								If rules and procedures are demystified, levies rationalised and the enormous quantities of locked land freed for development, the citys skyline will soon see a dramatic transformation, observed CREDAI-Bengal honorary secretary Pradip Chopra.																								If Bhattacharya called for greater private participation in infrastructure projects like water supply, transportation and power, state housing minister Gautam Deb advocated more joint-sector companies in housing. At present, there are five joint-sector housing ventures (three more are in the pipeline). But why cant we have 35? Deb suggested.																								For both the ministers from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees do-it-now firm, and mayor Subrata Mukherjee, whose speech was read out in absentia, there were a couple of eminently replicable case studies at the session, titled Initiatives of state governments  Sharing experiences. The corporation, instead of being a strict regulator, has to play the role of a facilitator, Pune municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar said in his presentation.																								Kumar, the champion of Punes famed fast-track system, shared with the audience how buildings are sanctioned in 24 hours in his city and how the civic body treats 60 per cent of Punes sewage. Ravi Chander, member, Bangalore Agenda Task Force, stressed on the power of transparency and the need to bring in fresh thinking. He said: Our partnership with the government is to ensure better urban governance. Bouquets or brickbats, we are in it together.

 															- Thieves walk off with I-Day decorations for uniformed personnel A STAFF REPORTER																								Apathy, and then loss, have robbed the sheen off a three-decade-old effort undertaken to honour uniformed service personnel.																								Crafted in 1972 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Indian Independence, 20,000 extra gold and silver-coated medals had been dumped at a civil defence storehouse on Cossipore Road in 1974. The packaging had decayed, the wooden trunk had cracked open in several places, and the medals had all blackened beyond redemption. 																								Despite repeated appeals to have them shifted to a more secure place for storage, the medals remained in that condition, said officer-in-charge of Cossipore police station Anil Kumar Jana.																								Earlier this month, the 20,000 medals went missing. The entire matter was kept under wraps till the first arrest was carried out on Wednesday. It is now learnt that miscreants broke into the unguarded storehouse on February 9 and stole the white-metal medals. More than a week later, police arrested Rajkumar Prasad, a petty criminal operating in the Cossipore police station area, and recovered 2,627 of the stolen medals on Wednesday. A statewide hunt is on to track down the rest of the missing medals, worth several lakhs.																								The thieves entered the room where the medals were kept by scaling the boundary wall, then climbing on to the terrace and jumping in through a hole in the ceiling, said Jana.																								After initial interrogation, Rajkumar named his two accomplices and the shops he had sold the medals to. Further raids, however, yielded little, as the culprits had fled.																								The police brass said a special initiative had been taken to retrieve the medals, as a lot of sentimental value was attached to them. That, however, had not been enough to either secure the storehouse  instead of making it a soft target for Rajkumar and gang  or shift out the medals.																								The civil defence storehouse had been in bad shape for a long time. The door remains ajar even when it is locked. The concrete ceiling has gaping holes in it. So, it was hardly surprising that the thieves could carry out the operation so easily, said an officer, recounting how the medals had been made in Delhi and sent to various departments in all the states, to be distributed among uniformed personnel.

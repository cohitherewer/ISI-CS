The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Flush out foodies from fair
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should buying at least one book be made mandatory for every visitor to the Book Fair? More letters will be published next week				 Too crowded: Just  another place to hang out Puja Agarwal, 
																		SC Banerjee Lane. 																																																														The idea seems good. A mandatory buy will help drive out those who are more interested in checking out the food stalls rather than books. The thinner crowd will make picking books of their choice much less cumbersome for the serious ones. Booksellers will also benefit, as they will be able to attend to customers better.									

Mahasweta Saha,
																		Garia.																																																														Even a few years ago, it was mainly book-lovers who would visit the fair. These days though, it has turned into a favourite hang-out. A good number of people are more enthusiastic about tucking into phuchkas rather than checking out bookstalls. But despite that, buying a book should not be made mandatory, as one might not get the book of his or her choice. The restriction, if imposed, will trim the flow of visitors.									

Anil Kumar Sen,
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.																																																														Not too many people may agree with me, but I think the idea of a must buy at the fair is quite justifiable. The proposal is rather long overdue. It will help the fair and those who are genuinely interested in books. It will also encourage a healthy cultural atmosphere on the fair grounds.									

Stuti Agarwal, 
																		Beleghata. 																																																														It would be a very unfair move. Implementing the proposal will adversely affect book-lovers in the low-income group. Besides, the number of people flocking to the stalls not buying a single book is much less  the high sales figures of the guild say so. A rigid rule will only discourage people from visiting the fair. 									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Nadia. 																																																														The Book Fair is not just a seller-buyer meet, its also where one bumps into an old acquaintance, or meets up with friends. But even otherwise, most books are unaffordable for their high prices and forcing one into buying will only prove to be a negative move.									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane. 																																																														Its silly to even think of such a suggestion. Whether to buy or not entirely depends on the discretion and necessity of the visitors. A person may not get a book he has been looking for a long time and return empty-handed. And I certainly dont believe that the number of people not buying a single book at the fair is that huge. Calcuttans are fond of reading and eagerly await the fair.									

A.F.K. Ahmed,
																		Hooghly.																																																														The proposal, if implemented, will dampen the spirit of book lovers. The not-so-serious visitor might also want to buy a book, having been drawn to the display. The objective of the guild should be to encourage readers and create more interest, not just to push sales. The fair organisers have succeeded in doing this, so far. But coercion will backfire.									

Arnab Chattopadhyay,
																		Dhakuria.																																																														The Book Fair signifies a confluence of ideas and thoughts, and getting familiar with new writers and old. Whether to buy or not is a strictly personal choice. The Publishers and Booksellers Guild can, at best, request the visitors to buy at least one book at the fair.									

Ananya Banerjee, 
																		Bengal Institute of Technology. 																																																														The Book Fair should be an independent platform where people can meet, browse through books and buy them if they wish. But one should not be forced to do so. Such a rule, if implemented, will only reduce the footfall.									

Saswati Mukherjee,
																		Picnic Garden Road.																																																														Certainly not. People who do not buy books at the fair are heavily outnumbered by those who grab this opportunity to dig out rare and out-of-print editions. The Book Fair is a place where one gets to browse a wide variety of books.									

Kanai Saha,
																		Gouri Bari Lane.																																																														At the fair, people queue up in front of stalls for hours at a stretch for books of their choice. So, the proposition seems absurd.									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Beleghata. 																																																														The joy of reading has no substitute. Visitors to the Book Fair are usually interested in buying books, but the price of some publications may be a deterrent. If the stalls store less-pricey editions, people like me can afford more buys. The proposal is inconsequential. 									

Anandarup Ghoshal,
																		Baguiati.																																																														The idea cant be justified. Everyone has the right to decide whether he wants to buy a book from the fair or not. The Book Fair acts as an appetiser and helps sustain reading habits. The sight of thousands pouring into one place is really amazing. The city has enough serious readers who buy a book whenever their pocket permits. They dont wait round the year for the fair.									

Bhupen Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park. 																																																														Certainly not. A rule begets ill feeling among everyone. There is a tremendous craze for books in Bengal and people from far-off places like Howrah, Midnapore, Nadia and Murshidabad try to make it to the fair. Instead of restricting the flow, the organisers may consider a 25 per cent cut on the prices of books for students.									

Subhasish Majumdar, 
																		Sonarpur.																																																														People flock to the fair not only for buying books, but also for sharing their thoughts. But that can never be the reason to check the flow of visitors. It will only affect the coffers of the Booksellers and Publishers Guild.

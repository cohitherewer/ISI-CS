 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Campus car circular creates ripples
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A recent circular issued by the Calcutta University (CU) authorities regarding the mode of hiring cars by the heads of departments has created a stir in the university circles. 																								The CU authorities, in the circular, specified a particular car-hiring agency and asked all its heads of departments to hire cars from it. I live in Behala. But I have to hire a car for official use from the agent in Baranagar. It is really difficult for me, complained a senior teacher of the university, who has to use a hired car often for official purposes.																								Earlier, the heads of various departments and senior officials would hire cars for official reasons from agencies of their choice and submit bills to the university. But the recent order has posed a problem for officials who have to use cars on a regular basis for official purposes.																								A senior university official, who preferred anonymity, said most university officials were taken by surprise as they had been asked to hire cars from a particular agency. 																								I dont know why the authorities have issued such an instruction. Most of our officials are finding it difficult to carry out different jobs when they require cars for the purpose. I have information that many officials have stopped using hired cars and have also lodged complaints with the vice-chancellor in this regard, he added.																								Another circular issued by the university has also stunned many on the campus. The university has asked all the heads of departments and senior administrative officials to contact an advertising agency for putting out advertisements in daily newspapers. 																								Earlier, the university officials used to contact the newspapers directly for insertion of any advertisement. The process of getting advertisements published will be costlier, as we have to pay the charges of the agency through which we will put out our notices. We really dont understand what prompted the university to take such a decision at a time when the institution is facing an acute financial crisis, said a senior university official.																								I dont know on what basis the university has selected the agency. The selection makes one suspicious and we feel the university should clarify its stand by issuing another circular, he added. 																								Both the circulars were issued by registrar Ujjal Kumar Bose, who was not available for comment. 																								Pro vice-chancellor (finance) Tapan Mukherjee, when asked to comment, said: Why should I comment on this? Ask the official who had issued the circulars.

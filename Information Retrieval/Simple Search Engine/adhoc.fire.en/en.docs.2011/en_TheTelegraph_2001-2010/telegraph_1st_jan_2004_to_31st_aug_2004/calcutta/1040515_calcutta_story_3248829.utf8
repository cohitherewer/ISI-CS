 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Fresh flak for project delay
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Chief Justice A.K. Mathur on Friday expressed afresh his dissatisfaction over the work by Tantia Constructions in widening Gariahat Road and dereserving the tram tracks on it. 																								A week ago, the chief justice, who lives on the same road, had voiced his displeasure over the work. Some of the construction firms officials had visited him after his comments were published. He told the officials to go and do your job properly. 																								The chief justice added: Im sorry to say that the company is still not putting in enough effort. I am a victim of its torture, in the form of hammering and whirring generators. Being the chief justice, I cannot go and lodge a complaint against the company.

 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Red tape ties down taxi baby 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tension ran high at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday after a couple, armed with a family court order, demanded that it be given custody of a baby girl left behind in a taxi on May 1 and later handed over to the hospital.																								Superintendent Pradip Mitra told the couple and their lawyers that the girl, now in good health, could not be handed over to them straight from the hospital. 																								I am a government employee, and by the rules, I have to hand over the baby at Sukanya, the government home for abandoned newborns at Salt Lake. They (the couple) would not see reason and tried to tell me that I was flouting the court order, Mitra said. 																								After creating a scene, the couple left in a huff. We want the girl to find a good home, but we are only following government norms. They can easily get custody of the child from the Salt Lake home, Mitra said. 																								A young woman hired a taxi from the Sodepur area and got off at Baranagar, leaving behind the baby on the rear seat of the taxi. The driver handed her over to Cossipore police station.

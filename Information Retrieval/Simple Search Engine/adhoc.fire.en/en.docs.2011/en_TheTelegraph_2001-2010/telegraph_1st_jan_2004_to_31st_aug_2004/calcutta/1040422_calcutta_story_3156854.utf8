 Cup that cheers: Team India celebrates in Lahore For a current Xaverian, it was really interesting to read about what my school was like a few decades back (Makers of future movers, March 26).  There are still teachers who are gentlemen to their fingertips, amicable, soft-spoken and gentle and personified goodness. But there arent any with grotesque appearance, as described in the article. With the change in times, they too have become concerned about their stature, and come to school nattily attired. The environment is definitely not the same and gossip about teachers among students has increased.  I was surprised and impressed to know that Father M. Mairlot, 96, still keeps in touch with his students, despite his poor eyesight. With the passage of time, mentalities have changed and the teacher-student rapport is gradually fading away. Tanmoy Das Lala, 
Address not given. The article Catch, match amp; conch shell, March 25, made for an interesting read. Indias win at Lahore was historic and our men in blue deserve kudos for this unparalleled victory. They have silenced all their critics with a rare display of mettle on foreign soil. Hopefully, this win will also help shed the choker tag that has stuck like a stigma. We are grateful to the Pakistani crowd for the support and affection that they showered on the Indian team during the tour. Kunal Roy, 
Santragachhi. The report Factory guards lynch intruder (March 22) was disturbing reading. How can private security guards take law in their hands? This is happening due to less importance given to the khaki force. Will Esab India compensate the lynched intruder? T.R. Anand, 
Budge Budge. The Ritam Pal case (Human face of uniform, March 19) has once again established the fact that the police are not there to harm or lord over, but to protect us. The negative image of lawmen has made us forget that they too are human beings with hearts. This incident will go a long way towards changing the way society sees policemen. Avinash Gupta,
Bandel, Hooghly. We have become accustomed to seeing news on murder, robbery, cheating and snatching in newspapers almost every day. So, the report on the ragpicker who handed over a bundle of Rs 500 notes to the police (Factory hand finds, returns a lakh, March 24) was a pleasant change. In yet another report Factory hand finds , returns a lakh, (March 24) Amritlal Bhowmick, a machine operator, returned Rs 1 lakh to its owner. Such acts of honesty set examples for the rest of society. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum Park Amritlal Bhowmicks act proves that our society still has honest men. Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
Beleghata The report published on teaching of M.Com at our college (Geography teacher taking M.Com class, March 22) is untrue. On behalf of the Teachers Council, I want to point out that no teacher in pure geography is engaged in teaching M.Com. All teachers, teaching M.Com are eligible as per Calcutta University norms and have adequate academic qualifications. Susil Kumar Barman,
Secretary, Teachers Council, 
Goenka College of Commerce amp; BA Metro replies: Goenka College Teachers Council secretary Susil Kumar Barmans contention that the college authorities are following Calcutta University norms in letting geography teachers take M.Com classes bypasses the main point. The teachers have been given appointment by the Public Service Commission (and not the university) and Barman, therefore, should ask himself whether the prevalent practice is violating PSC norms or not. He should also ask himself and the principal  why some teachers of the management department, including the head of the department, are protesting against the practice; and if their protest is untenable, why have they not been told so. Besides, we cannot understand why the Teachers Council secretary is responding to the report, instead of the principal (the administrative head).

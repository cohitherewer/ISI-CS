The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Reality check for reel roll
 Madhur Bhandarkar dropped in at Landmark with Debasree Roy to launch a Hemanta Mukhopadhyay album on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta 																								Feeling left out in the film industry? It happens to everyone initially and you have to take that in your stride. Even I did the running around on the sets of Rangeela with Urmilas (Matondkar) costumes in hand, the maker of Chandni Bar reassured a bunch of aspiring film-makers on Tuesday evening.																								The dim spotlight in the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) auditorium was firmly focussed on the man in black kurti and trousers  in great demand among the citys film school students  explaining the rules of the game in big, bad Bollywood.																								A special Q amp;A with Madhur Bhandarkar is what the students have long clamoured for and the strapping film-maker, in the city on a two-day visit to conduct workshops at SRFTI, didnt disappoint them. 																								To the eager batch latching on to each word he uttered, Bhandarkar rattled off tips on how to find a foothold in Bollywood  from finding the right producer to convincing an actor, from networking with the people who matter to coping with star tantrums.																								Its very difficult to find a producer if you are trying to make a serious film. I knocked at the doors of around 10 producers with the script of Chandni Bar, but all of them wanted some sleaze in it. I refused to incorporate even one song, because thats how I wanted it to be, he told the enthusiastic participants.																								You should hold the reins of your film, asserted one of the hottest directors in tinsel town. Tabu in a still from Chandni Bar.																								On Tuesday morning, Bhandarkar walked around the sprawling film school campus on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, checked out the editing and sound equipment, had a brush with the students and faculty and was hugely impressed with what he saw.																								Here, there are students from Assam, Jharkhand and Delhi, which is really amazing. I had always yearned to join the Pune Film and Television Institute of India, but couldnt as one needed to be a graduate to get entry, Bhandarkar said wistfully. 																								For the film-maker, who started out with a video-cassette library before going on to make the national award-winning Chandni Bar, the lack of formal training was adequately made up with five years of apprenticeship under a man called Ram Gopal Varma.																								The film school diploma always stands you in good stead, but producers prefer film-makers with at least a few months hands-on experience. Its essential that you assist a film-maker of repute. That boosts your credentials, advised the director who is currently wrapping up Page 3, with Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead.																								This is not a lampoon of the high-society nightlife as many people are thinking. Its an emotional story from a journalists point of view, clarified one of the men behind the camera credited with blurring the reel vs real lines.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

				 Fair evenings of words worth (From left) Theatre  personalities Shaoli Mitra, Dolly Basu, Bratya Basu,  Suman Mukhopadhyay and Usha Ganguly share a laugh after  Thursdays debate at the Power of Words pavilion at  the Book Fair. (Below) The debate on films, moderated  by Rituparno Ghosh, on Friday. Pictures by Rashbehari  Das  Taslima Nasreen may have been  the biggest crowd puller, but every evening at the ABP Ltd  Power of Words pavilion at the Book Fair proved to be an  exciting exchange of ideas on all matters intellectual.				 																																																											Desh magazine organised a number of panel discussions at the 29th Calcutta Book Fair, where eminent Calcuttans queued up for discussions on subjects ranging from science to Rabindrasangeet, art to economics and marketing, cricket to politics. The audience had the chance to hear the citys opinion leaders hold forth on the burning questions across disciplines.				 																																																											The chance of Indias scientific community bringing home another Nobel prize was the topic broached on Day One, January 28. The spotlight shifted on January 31 to Ganesh Pyne, Jogen Choudhury, Laluprasad Shau and Paresh Maity, moderated by Shovon Shome, speaking about the marketing of art. While it was required to create a healthy market, it shouldnt be first priority, was the common view.				 																																																											Whether cricket has benefited from the onslaught of sponsors was the topic up for discussion on February 1. Arun Lal was the voice of practicality, stating: Cricket exists because sponsors exist.				 																																																											Taslima Nasreen was one of the speakers on February 2, along with Bani Basu, Shaswati Ghosh, Paulami Sengupta and Sharmila Bose, in a discussion chaired by Uma Dasgupta which turned to feminism. Is it all talk, the panel was asked. Nasreen rejected the idea, saying that the womens movement was a critical protest against patriarchy.				 																																																											Wednesdays political chat drew enthusiastic response. Do all political parties have the same ideology with different packaging, was the question before Santosh Bhattacharya, Tathagata Roy, Anil Biswas, Saugata Roy and Pradip Bhattacharya. With votes the common carrot dangling before all parties, how one went about getting them was where the differentiation lay.				 																																																											Thursdays question on the basic problems for theatre brought to the fore the financial hardships that limit the art form. Have people abandoned the theatre or has the stage got stuck in a rut and is now unable to draw the crowds, asked Usha Ganguly, Dolly Basu, Bratya Basu and Suman Mukhopadhyay, in a discussion chaired by Shaoli Mitra.				 																																																											Manishankar Mukherjee, Haranath Chakraborty, Satarupa Sanyal and Parambrata Chattopadhyay took part in Fridays discussion on whether it is art films or good commercial movies that would keep Bengali cinema alive. Moderator Rituparno Ghosh kick-started the lively session by pointing out ambiguities in the motion, primarily in the differentiation between art and commercial cinema, and on what makes a film good. The opinion of the speakers was largely that viewers, not critics or awards, were the ultimate judge of whether a film is good or not. So any film that appeals to the audience  regardless of it being categorised as art or commercial  will carry the industry forward.				 																																									 All perfumes from India are in fashion in France  movies, music, advertising Michel Kelemenis says, looking down at the road from the verandah of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta. He goes on to point out how so many ad campaigns these days use Indian people and Indian music, the Peugeot 206 ad with a Hindi jingle being a case in point. Bollywood films are also getting popular. 				 																																																											The choreographer himself is here to meet Indian artistes and plan a collaboration for 2005. A new image of India has emerged in the past couple of years  happy and dynamic. As an artist, I want to find a freedom from the sadness that there is in our artistic expressions. We are economically so rich but a feeling of depression hangs heavy on society.				 																																																											Kelemenis has already held a three-week workshop in Bangalore with 40 artistes. I want to meet dancers, costume designers, musicians and video artistes. But first he has to introduce himself through his work or, as cultural attach to the French embassy Jerome Neutres puts it, present his business card.				 																																																											So his first performance on his first tour of India took place on Friday evening at GD Birla Sabhagar. The first piece Kiki, the rose, is a variation on port-de-bas, made famous by early 20th century dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. The second, K.Danza, uses a Tamil song in its final movement. The composer, Philippe Fenelon, a big name in France, got a Tamil friend to sing it. The words are an address to a lost friend or love and can even be metaphorically interpreted as the relationship between the artist and the audience, one trying to reach out to the other, he says. 				 																																																											The man from Marseilles, who started out as a gymnast, describes his work as somewhere between conceptual and entertaining. He is open to new forms and is asking around for names of Bollywood movies with a lot of dance. One film he has finalised even before reaching India is Devdas and picking up the DVD would be the first thing he plans to do on touchdown at Paris. Before that he has a long itinerary to cover  Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Pondicherry. But Kelemenis is not complaining at all. In fact, there is little time for all that I have planned here, he says.		 Actress Rituparna Sengupta during a shopping  binge with son Ankan in the kids section at Landmark  on Friday.

The awards ceremony is slated for March 17 in New Delhi. 				 																																																											Its a great honour, says architect Jayprakash Agrawal, the man behind the malls international design solution. According to Agrawal, the fundamental agenda with Forum was to give it a futuristic and eye-catching look with appropriate materials and colour scheme.				 																																																											Rahul Saraf of Sunsam Properties, Forums young developer, equally excited with the award, puts the concept credo in perspective. The objective when we shaped the mall was three-fold, he observes. We decided to use materials easy to apply and maintain, provide adequate insulation to save on power, and shorten the visual height of the 10-storeyed structure to give it a six-storey feel.				 																																																											Agrawal says he achieved that by designing the mall as a single cube without too many characters to give it an uncluttered ambience. The Taj Mahal or the Victoria Memorial are both taller than Tata Centre. But they dont look it because of the way the elevations are designed. We tried to do something similar with the Forum faade, the architect elaborates.				 																																																											What also clinched the award for Forum was its built-in intelligence. This is only the second construction in the city after the Infinity Building (also developed by Sunsam Properties), which is fully computerised and monitored by a single software. Besides, we have incorporated in the mall predictive maintenance of equipment to forecast failure, declares Saraf. Besides 100 per cent power backup and composite aluminium panels, Forum has a host of intelligent features like a James Bond-like hi-tech burglar alarm that detects and responds to only human body-temperature movement when activated at night.

 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Spate of road mishaps
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Six persons, including two women, were killed and several others suffered injuries in three separate accidents in the past 24 hours in and around the city. 																								In the first incident, a minibus on the Jagadishpur-Esplanade route ran over a pedestrian and a cyclist before turning turtle on Saturday morning on the Howrah Bridge in the Golabari police station area. Three passengers were seriously injured. The driver was desperate to escape after running over the two. Soon he lost control of the bus, which rammed into the railing overlooking the Hooghly, and overturned, an official of the local police station said.																								The two  both in their mid forties  have not yet been identified. The injured were rushed to Howrah District Hospital and are undergoing treatment. The driver of the minibus is also injured but we have arrested him. The vehicle was impounded, Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of police of Howrah, said.																								In the second incident, a 35-year-old woman, Geetarani Basak, was run over on Saturday morning by a private bus on route 201 near Baisakhi Island in Salt Lake. Police said Basak was taken to a private hospital where she was pronounced brought dead. The driver of the bus fled with the vehicle. 																								Three persons, including two women, were killed on Friday night in yet another accident on VIP Road in the Lake Town police station area when a Ultadanga-bound private car rammed into a van coming from the opposite direction. In an irony of fate, an official of the local police station, Debasish Bhattacharya, who went to the spot for the rescue operation, found his wife, Kakoli, lying in a pool of blood among the dead.																								Officer-in-charge Sitaram Sinha said Kakoli and her friend, Puja Nandi, both in their mid-twenties, were among the dead but the third person could not be identified. The stretch of VIP Road between Golaghata and Lake Town has claimed 15 lives in the past year, Sinha added. Some of the injured were moved to a private nursing home and a few others to RG Kar Hospital. Slab falls on patient:  Shahnaz Bibi, 30, was seriously injured when a chunk of  concrete fell on her from the ceiling at Eden Hospital in  Medical College and Hospital on Saturday afternoon. She  sustained injuries on her head and neck and was transferred  to the intensive care unit.

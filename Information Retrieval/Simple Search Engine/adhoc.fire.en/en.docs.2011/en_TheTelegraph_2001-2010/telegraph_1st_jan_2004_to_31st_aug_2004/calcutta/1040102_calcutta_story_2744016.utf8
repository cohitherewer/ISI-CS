The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 02, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Bula Choudhury, swimmer.  A year for tying up loose ends. Wishes might be fulfilled.  A lot of travel is likely. Pending matters will come to  a swift conclusion. Inspiration will run high. You always  keep an eye open for the best financial deals. You seem  to get younger as you grow older.  Kusum Bhandari

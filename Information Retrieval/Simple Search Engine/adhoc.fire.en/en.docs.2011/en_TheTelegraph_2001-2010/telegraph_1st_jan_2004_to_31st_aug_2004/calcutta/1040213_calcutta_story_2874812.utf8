 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Garbage vat blocks entry into flat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Homeowners in phase III of the West Bengal Housing Board project at Dankuni have not been able to move into their new flats for a year now, as a garbage vat is blocking the entrance to the complex.																								The vat was installed by flat-owners of phases I and II before the third phase came up. They are willing to abandon the spot as long as the housing board instals a new vat for them at a convenient location. While the decision to set up a new vat was taken on June 4, 2003, work is yet to start.																								Since February 2003, the vat has stood in the way of 95 flat-owners and their new homes. Several complaints were lodged with the housing board as well as the local panchayat, but no action has been taken yet. Apart from blocking access to the flats, owners feel the vat is also a serious health hazard and is polluting the area.																								Chairman of Phase III Co-operative Housing Society Salil Kumar Sarkar said the flat-owners had approached the housing board, the Manoharpur panchayat and the officer-in-charge of Dankuni police station to take steps to resolve the problem, but to no avail.																								Finally, on January 19, we wrote to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and housing minister Gautam Deb about our plight. But we have not got any response from them till now, said Sarkar.																								The residents are also aggrieved that the housing board has not constructed a boundary wall around the phase III area.																								Housing board officials maintain that they are trying to shift the vat to a convenient spot as soon as possible.

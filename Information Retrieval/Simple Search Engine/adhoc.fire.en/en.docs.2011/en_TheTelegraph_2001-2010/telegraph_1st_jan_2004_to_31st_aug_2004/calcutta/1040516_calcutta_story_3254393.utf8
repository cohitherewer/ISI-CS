 Sunday, May 16, 2004 A white fluffy bundle of joy 
Pet PassionChipper  my friend! 27.12.1997 was when he came to me as a birthday gift, just a month-old. We had a who will name the puppy contest  amongst friends before our white fluffy bundle of joy was christened Chipper. Ours was a house craving for a four-legged canine companion. We had not had one since Chhutki (moms favourite pomeranian) died 10 years ago. Chippers first night was TIRING! He kept us up the whole night with his whining. The next morning, when mom walked in, she saw balls of cotton, newspaper pieces, a quilt, two sleepy girls (me and sis Chandana) and one happy squealing puppy!Chips (nickname) was a keen learner and Mom an experienced teacher. He learned to shake hands and three languages -- bye bye, jabe naki and jaana hai, all of which meant he was going for his walk, thrice a week on the beach. The rest of the days he spent playing ball with dad.One night, we heard Chipper whining. He was frothing at the mouth, had lost his sense of balance and was shivering. He was diagnosed with a hereditary problem of fits. But with regular medication, Chips never had an attack again. Hes hale and hearty  touch wood  and ever-ready to go for a bye bye.MUST DO: Maintain a diary to monitor diet, vaccination and deworming.Nelanjana Bhowmick, actor

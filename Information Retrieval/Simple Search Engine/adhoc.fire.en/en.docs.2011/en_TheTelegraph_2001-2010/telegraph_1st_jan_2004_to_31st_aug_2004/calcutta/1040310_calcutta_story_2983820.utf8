	It is difficult for animal lovers to find proper burial grounds in the city for their pets. Often, as a last resort, the carcasses are disposed of in garbage vats causing pollution. The civic authorities should allot enough land in all localities for burying animals. 
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 
	There has been a sudden influx of fish-mongers and meat-sellers on pavements along Lake View Road in Ballygunge. Some have even constructed semi-permanent structures to stay in. They dump all the waste near the stalls and dirty the area. The civic authorities should evict them before they settle there. 
	Sharbani Basu, Lake View Road. 
	The stretch between Race Course and Fort William has turned into an eyesore thanks to betel stains on the pavements and walls. Spitting on roads must be fined.
	 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna

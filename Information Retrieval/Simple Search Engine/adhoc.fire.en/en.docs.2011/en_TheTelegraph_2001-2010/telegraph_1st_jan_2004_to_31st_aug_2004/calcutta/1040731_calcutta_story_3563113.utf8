The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Couture set to cross the shores
 															- Calcutta designer invited to Milan Fashion Week this September MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA Sabyasachi: Autumn honourThe reigning couture king has made it to one of the most important events on the world fashion calendar. Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee has been invited to the Milan Fashion Week, come September.																								Last year, Tarun Tahiliani made it to the Milan ramp as part of an India showcase organised by the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This has been expanded to an Asian category and the city boys designs will hit Fiera Milano, the venue that has hosted the event for over 15 years, on September 25 at 3 pm. There will be two designers from this part of the world. A designer from Thailand has also been chosen, says Sabyasachi.																								The designer, who created ripples with his romanticism at the recent India Fashion Week, had sent a portfolio of the body of his work to the Indo-Italian Chamber around six months ago. After clearance from Milan, a confirmatory e-mail from the Mumbai-based industry body came through on Friday afternoon.																								Sabyasachi is already planning out his look for the spring/summer 2005 line. I think this collection will be more an exercise in minimalism, he reveals. An India-inspired western look is what he is currently considering.																								Milan plays host to around 100 top labels the world over. Last season, in March, Tom Ford chose Milan as the venue for his last-ever Gucci show. 																								It is widely considered to be just behind the Paris Fashion Week in the pecking order and so is also the perfect platform to reach the big buyers.																								Delhi-based Rina Dhaka will also be there as a delegate this time, for having won the third prize at a Liberty footwear competition on the fringes of India Fashion Week 2004. Sabyasachi came in first at that competition and so is also scheduled to attend New York Fashion Week around the same time.																								With just a couple of months to go, Sabyasachi is planning to get cracking right away. Monday is a bandh, so I plan to switch off my cell phone and start work, laughs the National Institute of Fashion Technology Calcutta graduate.																								This week has brought the man Calcutta knows as Pepsi more good luck from foreign shores. Browns has sent me their order, he smiles.

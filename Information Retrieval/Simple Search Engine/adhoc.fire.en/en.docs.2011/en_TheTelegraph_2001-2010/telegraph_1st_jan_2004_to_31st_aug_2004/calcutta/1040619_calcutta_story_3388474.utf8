The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Tuned into music medley
 Musicians from the city get together to plan out their schedule for World Music Day. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								It was some 22 years ago that the French ministry of culture decided to celebrate music day on June 21, the longest day of the year. Two decades later, it has become a world phenomenon with musicians from Madagascar to Milan and Connecticut to Calcutta tuning their instruments together to celebrate World Music Day. 																								In keeping with the age-old tradition of their country, Alliance Francaise, Calcutta, in association with the Calcutta School of Music, The Park and a music store in the city, is bringing musicians of various genres and schools together on one platform. 																								The support of music makers of this city to organise this event has been tremendous, said Nicolas Blasquez, director, Alliance Francaise. According to Blasquez, a mention of celebrating the big day got tabla player Bikram Ghosh all excited and he promised to rope in singer Anjan Dutt, too. 																								I am excited about my performance with DJ ROM at Tantra on Monday night. I am a classical musician and hes a music mixer. Jamming together will be fun, said Bikram. 																								Im glad that we are celebrating World Music Day on Park Street. This is the original place for food and music, said Anjan Dutt, who will play at Someplace Else on Monday evening. By belting out his popular Bengali numbers, Dutt hopes to break rules that associate one particular place to a certain kind of music. 																								I think its most important to bring all kinds of music on the same platform on World Music Day, he said. 																								Among those who will take part in the event are Cassinis Division, students of the Calcutta School of Music and Alliance Francaise, Orient Express, Krosswindz, Violin Brothers and New Illusion.

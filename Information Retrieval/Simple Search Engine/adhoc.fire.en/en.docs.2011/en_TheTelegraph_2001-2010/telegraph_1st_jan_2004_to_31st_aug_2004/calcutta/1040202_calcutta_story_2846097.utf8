 Monday, February 02, 2004 				 Jiva-Chakra
																								Jiva Chakra (soul cycle) are Sanskrit words. Jiva in the literal sense means a living being or the individual soul that is, in essence, one with the universal soul. Chakra is the grinding wheel of existence meant for every man-made, soul-structured cycle of life. Dipankar Mani conceived and began working on this series about five years ago. His works are based on the Vedantic spiritual tenets of space, time and causation that are applicable to universal life. Mani depicts the available formats of Time and Space gifted to life and every individual, and how divine grace and love are showered on life benevolently. Manis works are deeply spiritual in nature. He is greatly influenced by Swami Vivekanandas spiritual treaties and Vedantic lores, and he dedicates the current series to commemorate the 141st birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.

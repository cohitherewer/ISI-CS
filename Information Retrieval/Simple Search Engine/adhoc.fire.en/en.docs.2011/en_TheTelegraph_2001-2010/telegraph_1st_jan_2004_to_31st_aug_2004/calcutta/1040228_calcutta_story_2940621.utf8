 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Rare renal failure condition rectified
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It has taken a doctor from France to come all the way to Calcutta and perform a rare stent angioplasty to prevent acute renal failure in a patient suffering from a disease prevalent mostly in South Africa and Japan.																								It was the summer of 1998 when Chandra Kala Goel, 48, was first admitted to a hospital with high fever and fatigue. Doctors initially suspected it to be a case of malaria, but later concluded it was her high blood pressure that was responsible for the condition. 																								Living on anti-hypertension drugs, however, did not help her at all, as she soon developed breathing difficulties and other associated problems. My problems did not subside and I kept feeling extremely weak day after day, Goel said from her residence.																								Earlier this year, her condition worsened and to compound matters, doctors could not locate her pulse. 																								Finally, Goel was admitted to BM Birla Heart Research Centre, where interventional cardiologist Tarun Praharaj diagnosed her ailment as suspected aorto arteritis (pulseless disease)  a rare condition where the renal arteries get blocked.																								To address the difficult case, Praharaj sent an SOS to Michel Henry, a French expert in the field, who arrived a few days ago in the city to take care of the patient.																								An angiography revealed both the renal arteries were diseased. While the right renal artery was 100 per cent blocked, the left one was 99 per cent occluded. 																								In this disease, the arteries get extremely narrowed due to fibrosis, among other reasons. We knew we had a very rare case on hand, said Praharaj.																								The most commonly affected arteries are the subclavian artery, supplying the upper limbs (90 per cent), the carotid artery, supplying the brain (45 per cent), the vertebral artery, supplying the brain (25 per cent) and the renal arteries supplying the kidney (20 per cent). Since blockage of the renal arteries is not common, doctors had perhaps got confused earlier, Praharaj added.																								After a series of tests, both Henry and Praharaj finally conducted a stent angioplasty, using two balloons (inflating both side by side in the renal artery) in a marathon procedure. After a few days rest, Goel was released from the centre and is now recuperating at home. 																								Since the prognosis of the disease is fairly quick, the patient would have succumbed to total renal failure in a short span. This has been prevented and, hopefully, her condition should improve further, Praharaj added.

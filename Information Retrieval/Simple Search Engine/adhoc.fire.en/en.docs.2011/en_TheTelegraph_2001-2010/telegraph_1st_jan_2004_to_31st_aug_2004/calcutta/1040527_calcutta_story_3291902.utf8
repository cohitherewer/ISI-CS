 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Service rule flout in year-long suspension
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Flouting its own service rules, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has kept under suspension for a year a top man of its conservancy department, a deputy chief engineer who is also the only masters in town planning as well as a qualified architect in the CMC. 																								According to CMC service rules, charges have to be brought against anybody under suspension within six months.																								Asked on Tuesday why Dipankar Sinha, against whom the CMC had decided to take action, had not been chargesheeted yet, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: Charges will be brought against him soon. Things take time here.																								On May 27, 2003, Sinha received a letter signed by the municipal commissioner to the effect that disciplinary proceedings were in contemplation against him. Hence, he was suspended with immediate effect.																								Although no reason was cited in this letter, it is alleged that Sinha was being victimised because ever since he joined the conservancy department in 2002, at the behest of Mala Roy, then mayoral council member in charge of conservancy, he had brought to light financial irregularities in the department. 																								Although Roy denied comment, it is also alleged that Sinha was caught in the crossfire between her and the mayor.																								Nirmal Mukherjee, leader of the Opposition in the CMC, said: The maximum period anyone can be kept under suspension is six months. Within that period, a chargesheet has to be prepared or an inquiry committee has to be set up. Neither has been done yet. They are just throwing their weight around. Dipankar Sinha has fallen victim to the squabbles among mayor-in-councils.																								During these 12 months, Sinha has received 75 per cent of his salary. Sinha, who joined the CMC in 1989 as municipal architect and town planner, is known to be a pro-active officer of integrity, who had spearheaded the movement against illegal buildings in north Calcutta in the late Nineties. He had prepared the list of 5,000 waterbodies in the city, the first of its kind.																								Sinha had also created a new chapter in heritage conservation by drafting heritage laws. He had put a stop to the demolition of the Currency building in BBD Bag, Duff College (that is in the compound of Rajabagan thana) and had pushed for the restoration of Metropolitan Building.																								While in the conservancy department, he had exposed several instances of financial irregularities. Although Sinha tried to introduce payment of CMC salaries through banks, he was only partially successful in doing so.

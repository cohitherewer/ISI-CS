The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Fire nod on twin terms
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The fire services department will withhold the mandatory no-objection certificate if in-built fire-extinguishing systems are not installed and fire officers not appointed in highrises, minister Pratim Chatterjee announced on Tuesday. 																								After a meeting at Writers Buildings, the minister said the builders had been told clearly that the rule, applicable to buildings over 14.5 metres high (or six-storeyed) in estates that have 100 flats or more, must be implemented strictly. If the builders do not fulfil the two criteria, they will not be given the necessary clearance. And without a nod from us, they cannot get their plans cleared from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Chatterjee added.																								A senior official of the fire services department said that a notification to the effect will be issued soon. This is now necessary, considering that highrises are becoming common. There is one coming up on Prince Anwar Shah Road that is 35 storeys high. We have to see that the rules are being followed strictly, quot; the minister added.																								The problem, he pointed out, is that no ladder on earth goes up that high. So, there must be an internal arrangement  complete with underground water reservoirs  to combat a fire. 																								He agreed that many buildings do have the equipment in place, but rarely maintain them. So, we want the appointment of fire officers made mandatory.																								The government has started a six-month fire-fighting course in its Behala training institute. The builders were told on Tuesday that they were free to appoint fire officers from those passing out of the institute. The first batch of 30 is ready. Builders are welcome to conduct campus interviews, Chatterjee added.

 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Boon for ailing hearts
 A STAFF REPORTER																								AMRI Hospitals have introduced an external counterpulsation (ECP) machine for the treatment of coronary diseases. 																								The ECP is a non-surgical, mechanical procedure to reduce symptoms of angina by immediate and sustained increase in blood supply to the heart by enlarging the coronary blood vessels, opening up dormant blood vessels and creating new blood vessels (angiogenesis). 																								A series of 35 one-hour ECP sessions  once, twice or six days a week  will cost around Rs 65,000. It will benefit those who do not respond adequately to medicines and are not fit for or do not want angioplasty or bypass surgery. Medical scholarships 																								B.Braun Medical Trust Foundation has announced a scholarship programme for post-graduate medical students. 																								The scholarships will be awarded to 50 students in recognition of their outstanding academic performance in the fields of anaesthesia, medicine, cardiology, nephrology, orthopaedic surgery, neuro-surgery, cardiac surgery, general surgery and gastro-surgery. 																								To qualify, the candidate must be a final-year, post-graduation degree student; must complete the degree course and must have a history of uninterrupted course of study.

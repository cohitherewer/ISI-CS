 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Monitor for emission code
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The state government earlier this week constituted a four-member committee to oversee and monitor a range of activities related to auto emission testing, including inspection, maintenance and certification.																								Headed by joint secretary H. Mohan of the transport department, the committee will inspect the testing centres, check on the training imparted to technicians, provide assistance in procuring equipment, organise awareness programmes and take steps against errant vehicles.																								The other members of the committee include officials from the public vehicles department, the pollution control board and a representative of the auto emission testing centres.																								The transport department will issue a licence to run a testing centre after obtaining a no-objection from the pollution control board. Owners of existing emission test centres will have to apply afresh for a licence. Mohan said a government notification in this regard would be issued within a fortnight. The new auto testing norms come into effect from October 1 this year.																								The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune, is examining the quality of the emission test machines available in the market. We will issue the notification on the new system of emission checks soon after the ARAI approves the model of the machines, Mohan said.																								The auto emission test centres will not be allowed to use machines other than the one approved. Our target is to complete the changeover within September 30. We will provide assistance in procuring the machine and operating it. The pollution control board will provide technical knowhow and training to the mechanics who will operate the machines. The training will be held in batches and at several places, according to Mohan.																								Officials said the proposed campaign would include advertisements in the newspapers to make car-owners aware of the new emission checking system. 																								The Automobile Association of Eastern India has decided to instal two machines on its premises for petrol and diesel vehicles.

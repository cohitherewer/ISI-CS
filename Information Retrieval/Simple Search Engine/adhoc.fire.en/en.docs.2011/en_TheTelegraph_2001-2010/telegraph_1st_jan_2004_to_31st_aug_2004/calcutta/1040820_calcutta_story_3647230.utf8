 Friday, August 20, 2004 Pocket-friendly diamonds, pasta prize for allHimika Chaudhuri, Pratim D. Gupta Model Priyanka in Indian Gem and Jewellery ornamentsGood craftsmanship makes the difference between a priceless piece of jewellery and junk. Take off the price of the effort and you are left with a steal.Indian Gem and Jewellery, a jewellery destination in Vardaan Market, is offering quite a bargain by waiving off making charges on all diamond jewellery under the banner of Diamond Utsav. An offer on our export surplus, the discount applies on a wide range, right from a Rs 2,000 earring to more elaborate sets, explained Prayas Dugar on behalf of the store. Jadau kundan and export quality designer jewellery are other draws at the store. The offer lasts as long as stocks do, so we wont be surprised if shoppers waking up a little late in the day come away disappointed.  Chef Bill Marchetti invites all to sample Italian food at ITC Sonar BanglaFilmi fareThe Mumbai hangover in the city has finally spilled over from the world of films to the world of food. The new fast food restaurant on the ground floor of The Enclave in Alipore bears ample testimony to that. Not only is it named Bombay Bites, the food on offer is as Mumbaiya as it gets. From the staple vada pav to the typical sandwich, the 36-seater transports you to the bylanes of Mumbai.Thats the whole idea, said Amit Todi, who owns the place along with sister Nisha Shroff. I visit Mumbai all the time and have got used to the food and lifestyle there. So, we decided to open this place, which will give Calcuttans a flavour of the citys street fare.Whats most interesting is that almost every ingredient that goes into the food items at Bombay Bites comes straight from Mumbai  be it the bread for the pav or the bhujiya for the chaat. Even the chefs are Mumbai imports. So the screaming tagline on the walls of the eatery  Yeh hai Bombay meri jaan  fits in perfectly.The inauguration was as apt as it could be with Ronit (Mihir) Roy flown in from Mumbai to do the lamp-and-ribbon act along with Tollywoods heroine no. 1 Rituparna Sengupta. And the first words they exchanged were as sweet as the pastries on offer. Kamon achho? asked Rituparna to which Ronit replied in chaste Bengali: Bhalo. The two were then seen spending a lot of time exchanging their contact numbers. Thanks to Mr Todi, we have been able to meet after a really long time, gushed Rituparna. Ronit was also happy to have the lovely lady by his side, even as they caught up on what was happening in each others life.And guess what they were doing next?

Showing his culinary skills at the Eden Pavilion at ITC Sonar Bangla, he promises to make you fall in love with his native cuisine.Tell me after youve had my Crab Tortelli, he smiled at a guest when she exclaimed she didnt like pasta. On a week-long visit to the city from Maurya Sheraton, Delhi, Marchetti will toss up some of Italys most loved dishes at a nine-day festival starting August 20. From antipasti (starters) to Gran Piatti di Pasta (speciality pasta) to Dolci (desserts), each course is set to outdo the other. With at least 20 different kinds of antipastis up for grabs at the food counter, you have the option of choosing from fresh oysters to Norwegian Salmons and everything in between. The chef has also taken care to spend half-a-day at New Market to stock up on indigenous ingredients to play to the local galleries. Ive used cat fish instead of sardine which would have had to be imported and cooked in Venetian style for the antipasti, said Marchetti. In fact, the fun of this festival is that most of these dishes can be tried at home. Once youve had your fill of seafood including lobsters and tuna in pink grapefruit dressing at the starters section, you can move on to the pasta part, featuring festive Italian dishes requiring elaborate cooking procedures. You may be tempted to try all of the seven kinds of pastas on offer, but it helps if you have a guideline. A choice between Crab Tortelli, Lamb alla Cacciatora (meatballs cooked in a green sauce) and Cacciucco alla Livornese (five kinds of fish cooked in tomato and green herbs) is what well recommend. For the veggie brigade, Spinach and Ricotta Agnolotti in a tomato and basil sauce could be a good idea. If you thought the main-course is a revelation, wait till you dig into the dessert spread. Its hard to decide upon favourites in this sweet sojourn, but home-made Gelati (whipped egg yolk, sugar and wine) is as safe a bet as any to surrender to.Pictures by Rashbehari Das

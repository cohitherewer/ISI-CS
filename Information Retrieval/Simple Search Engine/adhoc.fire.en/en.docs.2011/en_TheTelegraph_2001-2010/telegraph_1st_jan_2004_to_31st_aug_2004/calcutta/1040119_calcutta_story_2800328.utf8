		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 25-year backlog in uplift
 Tanmay Mandal				 	 Tanmay Mandal, Trinamul Congress MLA of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur new township, met residents of the area to answer their queries. Participants included Partha Sarkar, Narayan Chatterjee, Dayal Banerjee, Gautam Majumdar and Babloo Chakraborty Partha Sarkar: There has not been much development in the area over the past 25 years. Can we expect you to bring about some change?																																																			It is true that nothing has been done for the areas uplift for a long time. The roads, drainage, health and education systems are in a bad shape. There were two health centres earlier, which had to be shut down for want of upkeep. Schools in the area have not been upgraded and the drainage system lacks planning. Illegal constructions are rampant. Both the state government and the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality are not performing their duties. In fact, the municipality is also responsible for filling up local waterbodies. 																																																											Anyway, in the two years since I was elected, I pushed through some projects and hope to do as much as possible. 																																																									

Partha Sarkar: The law and order situation in the area has deteriorated over the years. 																																																			The law and order situation in the entire state is in deplorable shape. The situation in our area is worse. Goons from all over find shelter here, in Baguiati and the adjacent pockets. It is not only a haven for local criminals but for miscreants from other states and foreign countries, too. I may add that soon, we may face a serious problem due to gang rivalry, as with each passing day, criminal activities are on the rise.																																																											The police are hand-in-glove with these goons. It is hard to believe that they are unaware of the situation. I had raised the issue in the Assembly but it is difficult to tackle the problem single-handedly. I seek your help in this regard. There is a nexus between the police, criminals and promoters and that is the reason why, whenever I approached the police, they seemed least bothered about rectifying the situation.																																																									

Partha Sarkar: What about the eternal problem of waterlogged streets? Are you doing something about it?																																																			You may have observed waterlogging has increased over the past few years. I told you earlier about waterbodies being filled up in the area, which has contributed to the problem. Many ponds have been filled and multi-storeyed buildings built on them. Desilting has not been carried out since the 1970s in the major canals of the area. A couple of years ago, the municipality did receive funds for desilting, but the project was only partially completed.																																																											I have taken the initiative to get the canals cleaned, at least. But as far as illegal constructions go, I can do nothing about them because the municipality is giving promoters the permission to go ahead.																																																									

Narayan Chatterjee: The area has a huge population but not too many hospitals or colleges.																																																			Each time I approached the state education ministry or the health ministry with a proposal, they turned it down, saying that they do not have the funds. 																																																											At present, I am trying to reopen Uma Shankar Mission College, closed since 1977. I have already upgraded six of a dozen primary schools to the Higher Secondary level. I am working on seven others and hope to get the permission from the education ministry soon. 																																																											As far as a hospital is concerned, nothing has come out of the meetings I held with the health authorities, but I do agree that something should be done.																																																									

Dayal Banerjee: What are your plans for the minorities? 																																																			One must realise that they are no different from any of us. They are also Bengalis and residents of the area. Whatever I do for all of you, applies to them as well. There are two madarsas among the several schools being upgraded. I may add that if anyone has a problem, he is welcome to let me know and I will try to help.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Blackout as power units trip 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Prolonged power cuts plagued Calcutta and its adjoining areas on Wednesday evening, after a giant 250-mw unit sprung a leak and had to be shut down at CESCs Budge Budge plant.																								The shortfall in the CESC-served areas shot up to 170 mw. The power cuts ranged between two and three hours. The situation was saved by the West Bengal State Electricity Board (SEB), which pumped in 330 mw to the CESC system.																								In the SEB-supplied areas in the districts, the situation was worse. The deficit stood at 353 mw, with the collapse of an 80-mw unit at Bandel and poor supply from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), both of whose 500-mw units are out of order. 																								Power department sources said the industrial pockets of Burdwan district, fed by the power units of Durgapur Projects (DPL), also reeled under power cuts as one of the DPLs 110-mw units collapsed during the day. The SEB had to supply an additional 55 mw to bail out the industrial consumers. 																								The SEB on Wednesday asked the NTPC in Farakka to get one of its 500-mw units on stream as early as possible. 																								CESC officials said repairs are on to revive the Budge Budge unit by Friday morning. It had broken down last Friday, too, but was repaired and run on Sunday.																								Vast tracts of south, central and north Calcutta were plunged into darkness in the evening. Streetlights on arterial roads went off and motorists slowed down to negotiate the potholes flooded by the daylong seasonal showers. 																								In highrises, a water crisis added to the discomfort as pumps could not be run.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Cancer concerns and clues to early catch
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Warning: One out of every eight woman will suffer from breast cancer by 2010. 																								Concerns: Sedentary lifestyle, obesity, little or no breast-feeding. 																								The alarm bells were rung by a cancer awareness seminar organised by The Body Care slimming and beauty clinic in association with Indian Cancer Society. 																								Conducted by Dr Shaikat Gupta, consultant cancer surgeon, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, for the benefit of The Body Care members, the seminar hauled up obesity as the latest culprit causing cancer of the breast, colon, endometrium, prostate and oesophagus, forming a total of 3.2 per cent of recent cancer cases.																								While the doctor offered the age-old advice of weight watch, proper nutrition and exercise to lend meat to the maxim of prevention being better than cure, other areas of concern included the seemingly simple symptoms of hoarse voice, oral tract inflammation, occasional discharge of blood in stool or urine.																								A persistent hoarseness of voice could signal larynx cancer, just as passing blood with stool could be indicative of colon cancer, cautioned Gupta. Specialised check-ups at the first incidence of the symptoms is the key to an early detection and subsequent successful treatment.																								Usually patients either neglect these symptoms or go to a general physician who invariably gives a wrong diagnosis. By the time the patient discovers the problem to be otherwise, it is usually too late, rued Gupta.																								A second opinion is what he recommended in case of even a slight suspicion. Cancer is curable, provided it is detected early. Once a malignant tumour starts to spread, forming colonies in other parts of the body, even complicated procedures like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and gene therapy are often unable to cure it successfully, said Gupta. 																								Another myth the seminar sought to dispel was that cancer strikes after a certain age. More and more young people are getting afflicted today, said Gupta citing changing lifestyle as the key cause of the demographic shift. Playing the better safe than sorry plank, Gupta advised an annual mammography for women above the age of 35 along with a weekly self-examination. Rising incidence of oral cancer was another area of concern.																								Fifty-five per cent of all cancers in India are oral cancer as opposed to only one per cent the world over, said Gupta. The yawning gap is due to a huge number people in the country given to chewing tobacco and pan masalas. In other countries, people just smoke tobacco but here people eat it, exclaimed Gupta at the conclusion of the talk.

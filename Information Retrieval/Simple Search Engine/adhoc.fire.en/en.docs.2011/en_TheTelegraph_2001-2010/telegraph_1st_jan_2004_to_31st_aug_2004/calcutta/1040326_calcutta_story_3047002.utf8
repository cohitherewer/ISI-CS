 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Case-eve inability plea on Bharat II
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERThe state government finally filed a report on Thursday before the green bench of Calcutta High Court, expressing its inability to carry out the order of the court to implement Bharat Stage II norms in all vehicles plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) from April 2, 2004.																								The green bench, on April 3, 2003, had directed the state to make arrangements to convert all vehicles plying in the area to Bharat II within a year.																								In its report, the state said it had followed the guidelines framed by the Union government with regard to control of pollution through auto emission of the vehicles. But due to lack of infrastructure, it is impossible for us to convert all vehicles to Bharat Stage II system, the report explained.																								There was no mention of when the government would be in a position to carry out the court order, nor was there any time-barred plea in this regard.																								According to a spokesperson for the state transport department, advocate-general Balai Ray had been instructed to pray for at least another year from the court to convert vehicles in the CMA to Bharat Stage-II.																								The report also highlighted the non-availability of gas kits for conversion in the state and said that the Union government had failed to assist the state in this regard.																								On Friday, the green bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, will deliberate upon the report submitted by the state.																								The Automobile Association of Eastern India, a party to the case, will pray before the court to leave private cars out of the Bharat II purview.

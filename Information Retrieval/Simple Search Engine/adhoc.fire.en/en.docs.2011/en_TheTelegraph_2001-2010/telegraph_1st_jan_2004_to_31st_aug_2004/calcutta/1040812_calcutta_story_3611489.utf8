Plan a PartyZeeshan Jawed rustles up a recipe for a bash to keep the tots happy Do Always have a theme party for kids If you are organising the party on the terrace, make sure it is fenced off Dont Rustle up an elaborate menu Keep breakable objects lying around the place Have you been feeling guilty about not spending quality time with your bundle of joy? Do you feel anguished when you socialise leaving your child in the care of a baby sitter? Stop brooding and start thinking. Cancel your weekend appointments and throw your kid a party to remember.When, whatHalf the job is finding a date when all kids are free. Then, pick a theme according to your childs age and interests. You cant go wrong with the favourite cartoon character or film star. Or, stick with that old fave, a magic party. The denSafety has to be top priority while choosing a venue. The best place would be inside your home, but be prepared for all kinds of mayhem to break loose. A nearby community centre could be a good option, for its open space and easy maintenance. If you decide to go with a terrace, though, ensure it is completely fenced off and there are guardians around.Fashion factsWhen it comes to party dressing, avoid those frilly dresses you love but your growing girl hates. A trendy pair of denims and shirt would do for the boys, while the girls might prefer a short skirt and top. In case of a theme party, plan well ahead of time, in case you need to get creative with the outfits.Sound checkKids are happiest dancing to songs they know and love. Arrange CDs with the reigning chartbusters, whether you are thinking Hindi or English. Menu mattersFor kids, food will always play second fiddle to fun. Keep the lunch or dinner light, or skip the serious meal altogether and throw together some easy-to-eat snacks. Mini pizzas and burgers could be a good way to go. Ice cream and soft drinks are welcome, and slightly older kids might appreciate a phuchkawala at hand.Take careAmid all the fun and frolic, take some precautions. If its an indoor party, shift all the breakable objects out of harms way. If its an outdoor bash, a Plan B is well advised in case rain plays spoilsport. Keep loads of napkins handy (its amazing what kids can do with ice cream) and, most importantly, set a strict deadline for parents to cart their wards away, so you can get some sleep at the end of what is sure to be a rough day!

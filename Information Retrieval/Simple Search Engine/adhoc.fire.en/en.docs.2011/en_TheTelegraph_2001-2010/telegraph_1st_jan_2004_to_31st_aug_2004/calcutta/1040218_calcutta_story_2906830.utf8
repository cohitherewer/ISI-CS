The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Gas firm eyes Haldia depot
 							 - Scurry for options on Bharat II deadline eve A STAFF REPORTER																								Help from California could be at hand to clean up the Calcutta air. To implement the Calcutta High Court order on Bharat Stage II compliance for vehicles plying in and around the city, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government on Tuesday started negotiations with a California-based company on having a storage unit of compressed natural gas (CNG) set up at Haldia.																								According to the court order, all vehicles plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) will have to conform to Bharat Stage II norms within April 2004, either by changing their old engines or by switching over to CNG or liquid petroleum gas (LPG).																								Announcing the move, state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Tuesday that the firm, C amp;L Engineering Inc., has evinced an interest in setting up a CNG storage unit, which would enable diesel-run vehicles to switch over to CNG. We had a discussion with company officials today and they said they wanted to set up a storage unit on five acres, with an investment of Rs 100 crore. Officials will visit Haldia on February 25, the transport minister said. 																								Chakraborty refused to divulge details, saying C amp;L Engineering has a presence in Dubai, Assam and Gurgaon. The CNG they will market in and around the city will be brought in from Dubai, he said. The state government, Chakraborty held, would not have any responsibility, but would offer all necessary help. However, there will be certain conditions  for example, the price of the CNG should not be more than that of petrol and diesel, he added.																								Transport department officials said the California-based firm plans to supply the gas to different outlets through tankers the same way that petrol and diesel are supplied. Even 15 days ago, we did not think it would be possible to have CNG in Calcutta, but the good thing is that the company might be able to supply CNG six months from the time it gets the plot. Though the details have not been worked out, it can be hoped that the supply will be available from petrol stations, the minister added. 																								Some officials expressed doubts about the feasibility of the project because CNG price is likely to be high if imported. The proposal is at an early stage, and nothing can be ascertained without a detailed project report, the official said. Subhas Chakraborty, however, insisted that the price should not overshoot that of petrol and diesel. 																								Told about the problems in Delhi over switching over to CNG, the minister said: Pollution has now come down in Delhi, and there should not be any scarcity, as other options will be available in the market. For its own pool cars, the government is eyeing both CNG and LPG.

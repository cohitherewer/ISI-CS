The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Meeting deferred in sleaze backlash
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								This months board meeting of the Salt Lake municipality has become uncertain after the recent raid on Hotel Merlin Park and the subsequent arrest of Avtar Singh. 																								Fearing that the Avtar Singh issue might place them in an uncomfortable position, municipal officials decided to defer the meeting.																								Some CPM councillors were planning to raise uncomfortable questions at the board meeting, party sources said. We had planned to hold the board meeting earlier, but since there was no agenda, it has been deferred, a senior official of Bidhannagar Municipality said on Sunday by way of explanation.																								Sources said the ruling party was buying time to draw up a strategy on facing questions on how a completion certificate was given to Singhs hotel, although it was alleged that it was built illegally by filling up a waterbody. 																								There are many complaints about this hotel among local party supporters, a CPM leader of Salt Lake said, on condition of anonymity. A final decision will be taken on August 25. Municipal chairman Dilip Gupta will neither confirm nor deny the news.																								How can officials say there was no agenda? The incident could have been the agenda, said Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor. 																								Some CPM councillors have already voiced their grievances against Singh and his wife, CPM parliamentarian Jyotirmoyee Sikdar. She should not have kept the civic body in the dark about the activities in her husbands hotel. Even after the incident, she should have clarified her stand, said a woman councillor.																								Soma Pramanik, CPM councillor of ward 14, where the hotel is located, was threatened by Avtar Singh and his men after she had opposed the opening of the bar.																								In the Avtar Singh aftermath, Salt Lake police have been asked to step up vigil on hotels, homes and parks. Weve been asked to identify the places where such rackets operate, said a Bidhannagar police officer on Sunday. 																								Sources said some local CPM leaders and residents were exerting pressure on the police for a clean-up. According to the cops, two hotels were identified as sleaze hubs. Their owners allegedly enjoy CPM backing.

	There are thousands of hawkers who sell their wares on  the pavements of the city, blocking the path of pedestrians.  Since previous eviction drives have failed, the Calcutta  Municipal Corporation should collect money from them as  tax, and utilise the funds for development work, like repair  of roads and footpaths and beautifying parks and gardens.

	The level of corruption at the motor vehicles department  is such that one must pay a bribe even to file taxes to  the government. Recently, I had to shell out an extra Rs  300 to pay the five-year tax on four-wheelers. To register  a second-hand car that I had purchased last month, I had  to pay Rs 1,000 over and above the prescribed Rs 120 to  ensure that I get my registration certificate and blue book  on time. Significant reforms have taken place in many areas  of the state. I wonder why motor vehicles dues cannot be  paid through banks, post offices or the Internet.  
	R.N. Bose, Salt Lake City.

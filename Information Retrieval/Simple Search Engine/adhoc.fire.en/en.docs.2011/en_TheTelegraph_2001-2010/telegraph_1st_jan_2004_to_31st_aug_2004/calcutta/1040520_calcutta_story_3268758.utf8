 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Reflection of lifes mission
				 	 Naushad Alam																								A somewhat difficult childhood was what inspired this resident of Metiabruz to make working for the underprivileged his mission in life. Naushad Alams rudimentary voluntary services gained a direction with Ram Nagar Lane Forum of Revolution for Communities Education (RNL FORCE), an NGO he established in the Garden Reach area in 1991.																								RNL FORCE continues to work for the downtrodden in areas such as Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Santoshpur, Shaktigarh, Akra, Rabindra Nagar, 24-Parganas, Mallickpore, Suri and Bolpur. It extends a helping hand to child-labourers, street and slumchildren and weaker sections of women. It tries to identify the abilities and latent potential in them and provide training in their respective fields of interest, helping individuals to become financially self-sufficient. It also organises health check-up and awareness programmes in slum areas regarding health hazards and social taboos, such as drug abuse, HIV-AIDS, malaria, polio and environment pollution. 																								The extension of its work to the villages and towns of Birbhum has been a recent move. However, it has already seen large-scale participation from hundreds of villagers, councillors, doctors, police and local self-government heads.																								The social work hasnt clashed with Alams pursuit of higher education. After graduating from Maulana Azad College, he is currently completing his PhD at Calcutta University, specialising in Post-independence development in Urdu One-act Plays in Bengal.																								Theatre is another passion for the 32-year-old. A regular on stage since his student days, Alam has participated in national youth festivals and won himself awards both for acting and direction. He now uses the medium as a social awareness tool through the cultural wing of his NGO, called Aks (which means reflection in Urdu). Aks focuses on social issues and their remedies, trying to imbibe a healthy attitude towards life. Aks also trains talented children from the financially weaker sections of society through theatre workshops.																								Alam is continuously thinking about new ways in which to help society. The latest is giving shape to the concept of mobile theatre, where a group of travelling actors would visit the rural areas and stage plays and skits on social issues. 																								A blueprint for an animal hospital in Garden Reach keeps him busy at present. Money is certainly a problem, but Alam plans to generate the initial amount through a fundraiser featuring Bollywood bigwigs. He firmly believes the stars would not refuse help for such a cause.

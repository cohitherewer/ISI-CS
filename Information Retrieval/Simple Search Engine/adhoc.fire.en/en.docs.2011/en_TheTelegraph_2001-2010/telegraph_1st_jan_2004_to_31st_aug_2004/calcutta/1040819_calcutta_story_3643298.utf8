 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Dither over truth team
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The CPM seems in a dither over instituting the promised inquiry into the role of party functionaries in the Merlin Park sex racket headed by Avtar Singh, husband of party MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar. 																								Singh was arrested on August 15 in his hotel, along with several businessmen and call girls, who knew that the bar would be open and other facilities available, in defiance of a government ban on public sale of alcoholic drinks on Independence Day. 																								The next day, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas announced the partys decision to set up a truth committee to look into the allegations. Three days have elapsed, the committee is yet to be set up.																								We are determined to get to the bottom of the incident. There is no reason to believe that we are having second thoughts about the committee, said Biswas. 																								The truth committee, it is learnt, will be given final shape at the upcoming meeting of the CPM secretariat, as well as of the state committee, slated for August 20. 																								The state leadership has assigned the task of setting up the committee to Amitava Bose, secretary of the partys North 24-Parganas unit. Bose is also a member of the partys state committee, that will have a say in the constitution of the truth committee on Friday. 																								Some party leaders, known for extending patronage to Singh and Sikdar, are of the opinion that Singh, though Sikdars husband, is not a party member himself, and so the party need not feel embarrassed about the development. 																								This stand does not go down well with Benoy Konar, a CPM central committee member and influential member of the partys state secretariat, who, on behalf of the party, oversees the working of the fractious North 24-Parganas district unit. Known as a hardliner, he reportedly told senior party leaders that he wanted to handle the issue himself.

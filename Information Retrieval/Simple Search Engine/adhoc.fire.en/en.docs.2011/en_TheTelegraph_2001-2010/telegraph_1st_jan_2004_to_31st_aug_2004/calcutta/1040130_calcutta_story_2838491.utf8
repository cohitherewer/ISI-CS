	The agency, which has been assigned the job of aligning  tramlines and widening the road between Gariahat and Park  Circus, has made a complete mess. It is not being able to  execute the two tasks simultaneously and is causing problems  for both motorists and pedestrians. The footpaths should  have been dug up only after the tramlines were laid.  
	Sunil Garodia, Sushil Sen Road.  
	A friend has recently invested in the monthly income scheme  (MIS) of the postal department. He took two certificates  from different post offices and found they had varying interest  rates (eight per cent and nine per cent).  
	T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	A permanent cycle stand has been erected on the eastern  side of the AE block municipal market in Salt Lake. A fast-food  stall has already started operating from one half of the  shed. More such stalls will come up soon.  
	Madhabi Ghosh, Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Citizen is sovereign, civic staff taught
 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA																								Citizen is sovereign. That is the belief the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is now trying to instil in its 38,000-odd employees.																								Docon, a city-based management consultant, has started a series of workshops with Corporation officials who interact with the public  their indirect bosses.																								After all, the CMC exists for the Calcuttan, running on its tax rupees, making the citizen top dog, stressed facilitator S.M. Devadason.																								Part of the capacity-building project undertaken with the  28.3-million grant from the Department for International Development, UK, the training is meant to cover 10,000 employees who interface with the city over the next two years.																								Our brief is to train 700 staff members by the Pujas this year, after which the results will be evaluated by the CMC, explains Devadason.																								Last week, the two-day workshop series started off at the CMC headquarters conference room with members of the assessment department. On Monday, the sessions continued with their colleagues from the licence division.																								While it is no secret that the public perceives civic services and the officials behind them to be less than congenial, next month, the first step is being taken to qualify the exact nature of consumer complaints. AF Ferguson and Company, the international agency acting as human resource consultant to the CMC, will start a survey of how 10,000 of the stakeholders  the citizens  perceive civic services and amenities.																								Monday started with the presentation of the model municipal management on the outskirts of Mumbai. Then came the process of internalising the action points. They have to believe that change can happen, says Devadason. 																								While the top bosses at SN Banerjee Road may be aware of this, the will to change has not yet swept through the musty, file-ridden offices of those entrusted with implementation.																								People in our city have to be far more disciplined if any changes are to be made in civic services, pointed out one of the men at the workshop.																								Still, most are in agreement that there is space  and the urgent need  for improvement. And the response has been surprisingly positive, is Devadasons preliminary view.																								The mission is on to espouse the ethics of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, responsiveness, financial sustainability and quality delivery at every level. One hopes, for the sake of the city, it turns out to be mission possible.

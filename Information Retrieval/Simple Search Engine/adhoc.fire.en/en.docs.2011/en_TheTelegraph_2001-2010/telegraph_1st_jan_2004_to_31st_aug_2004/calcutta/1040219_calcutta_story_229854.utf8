The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Mini coup cements canal-bank ouster
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bypassing feuds within the party and leader Mamata Banerjees no-eviction stand, mayor Subrata Mukherjee spearheaded a grand alliance between the Trinamul Congress-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the ruling Left Front on Wednesday to execute one of the biggest ouster drives in recent times along Tollys Nullah. 																								More than 4,000 families will be evicted from the eight-km stretch on Saturday. The modalities of the eviction drive were finalised in the afternoon at a meeting with municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya at Writers Buildings.																								While the mayor hushed up attempts within the Trinamul to stall the ouster drive, the municipal affairs minister turned down requests from his Left Front partners for a deferment of the drive, citing a high court order on this count as a compulsion. 																								Mukherjee, too, toed the same line to justify his stand, which is in sharp contrast to Mamatas no-eviction-without-rehabilitation dictat. I am just executing the Calcutta High Court order, he asserted.																								To clear any misconceptions, Mukherjee has resolved to show his leader Mamata Banerjee a copy of the all-party resolution draft, signed by councillors of the Trinamul Congress and the Left Front, in favour of the eviction drive.																								With Mukherjee joining hands with Writers Buildings, the unauthorised settlers are banking on the internal strife within the Trinamul to put the drive on hold. Naxalites have already banded the people facing eviction in Mamatas south Calcutta constituency.																								The eviction of encroachers along the banks of Tollys Nullah between Kudghat and Garia is necessary for the Metro Railway extension from Tollygunge to Garia. Metro authorities had earlier threatened to pull out of the project unless the stretch was cleared of illegal settlers.																								This apart, the drive will also facilitate the laying of a road, south of the canal, from Kudghat to Garia, which will take some load off the clogged NSC Bose Road.																								Mostly commercial establishments will be razed in the first phase of the drive, which will comprise owners of the 100-odd shops of the Purba Putiari market, near Kudghat. Small industrial units in the Garia area will fall in the last leg of the drive. 																								In between, especially in the Khashmahal area, are residences of several families from erstwhile East Pakistan, South 24-Parganas, Bihar and Orissa.																								Though Mukherjee has promised logistical support to the government in evicting the encroachers, minister Bhattacharya  wiser after the NRS Hospital fiasco, when an ouster drive was stalled at the last minute for lack of CMC payloaders  has convened a meeting of senior CMDA officials on Thursday to chalk out logistical back-up.																								The municipal affairs department minister said at Writers Buildings that the CMDA would have to spend at least Rs 80 lakh, of which Rs 2,000 will be given to each of the 4,000 families as transportation cost. 																								A 1988 CMDA survey conducted by director, socio-economic planning, Animesh Haldar had put the number of illegal occupiers on the Garia-Kudghat stretch at only 600.

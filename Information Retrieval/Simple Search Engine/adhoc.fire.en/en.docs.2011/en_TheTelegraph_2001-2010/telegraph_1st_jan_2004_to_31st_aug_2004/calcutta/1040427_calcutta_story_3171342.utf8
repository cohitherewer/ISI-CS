				 	SIDDHARTH WADEHRA																									Siddharth Wadehra																									Is this 19-year-old, able to tackle queries on a range of topics, from nature and environment to cyberspace and sports. The former Don Bosco student  till last month  has participated in more than his fair share of quiz contests in the intra and inter-school circuit.																									Is no big deal for Siddharth. First in a nature quiz organised by Assembly of God Church, open house quiz on World Environment Day at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, second in a quiz organised by the Cyberspace Club of Don Bosco, leader of the scouts quiz team Thats just for starters.																									Is this Aquarian, in keeping with his zodiac sign. Apart from winning swimming competitions, this free-style pro also takes time out for karate camps, table tennis and basketball tournaments. Varun, or IIT  as hes known by his friends  also has a few essay-writing and inter-house debate laurels under his belt.																									Is just one of the caps the boy from Park Street is known for. Member of several school clubs, participating in inter-school fests, taking home trophies for singing, dancing and even flower decoration  no wonder Siddharth was awarded for over-all efficiency in curricular and co-curricular activities in school in 97-98.																									He is, too, from being the vice-president of the school science and nature club to a member of the Good Friday Walk in aid of suffering humanity organised by Seva Kendra. A memento is a certificate of appreciation from the Bishop of Calcutta.																									Means more than just words to this former patrol leader and assistant troop leader. Proof  the best patrol award. Scoring 90 per cent in value education classes is not his only academic forte. He has a ninety per cent in Hindi in ICSE to show as well. As for future plans, he has his sights set on the hospitality industry. With, maybe, a part-time job of writing Hindi prose and poetry.

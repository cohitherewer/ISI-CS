	There are no public toilets in the vicinity of Kalighat temple. A large number of pilgrims who pour in everyday face a lot of inconvenience as a result. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has constructed pay-and-use toilets in several parts of the city. Some more should be constructed in this area.
	 Priyanka Dawn, New Alipore. 
	Post offices often run out of post cards, inland letters and envelopes. Revenue stamps and money order forms are also in short supply. The authorities should ensure a sufficient stock. 
	B.N Bose, Dum Dum. 
	Some public sector banks have declared their offices non-smoking zones. But one can find customers and even the staff defying the rule. As most offices are centrally air-conditioned, the smoke makes the place very suffocating. Passive smokers are the worst sufferers.
	 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road.

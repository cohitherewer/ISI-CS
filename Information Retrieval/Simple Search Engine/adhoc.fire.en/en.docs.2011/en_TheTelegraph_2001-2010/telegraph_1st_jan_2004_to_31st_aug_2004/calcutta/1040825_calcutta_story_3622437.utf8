The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 Next step for food stopZEESHAN JAWED One Step Up, the Continental cousin of Bar-B-Q (located bang opposite the multi-cuisine restaurant and sharing the same owners), was truly a step above the rest in its category when it opened a while ago. Cant say the same anymore. Now, though it has expanded and taken up the whole ground floor of the Park Street premises to expand into a 70-seater eatery, the food quality has dived down a bit in the past months. Krosswindz performs at Crossword bookstore as part of the ongoing Music MelaAnd while now it offers Indian cuisine as well, its the Continental fare that remains the forte. In fact, the restaurant recently launched a new menu in which it included quite a few new Continental delicacies, while retaining the old favourites. The Prawn Cocktail or the Vegetable Cocktail, along with Garlic Bread serves as the perfect appetiser here. Moving on to the main course, there are specialities like Chicken Stroganoff (chicken with mushrooms and capsicum cooked in herbs, served with a ring of buttered rice), Chicken in the Basket (crumb fried breast of chicken, with French fries), Chicken Mexicana (juliennes of chicken with mushrooms, cooked in a spicy tomato sauce, served on a bed of spaghetti) and all-time favourites like Chicken Tetrazinni, Chicken A La Kiev and Fish  Chips. For the veggie brigade, there is the Vegetable Au Gratin, Vegetable Tetrazinni, Spinach and Corn Delight (corn kernels and spinach cooked in creamy sauce on a bed of garlic rice, topped with tomato concasse and baked), Paneer Shashlik, Spinach amp; Cheese Cannelloni (cannelloni stuffed with spinach and cheese, served in a tangy tomato sauce) and lots more.Sandwiches and burgers have always been the strong points of One Step Up and the Club Sandwich, Chicken Burger and Crispy Chicken Burger do not disappoint. Caffeine kick Living up to its energy-boosting name, Caffeine, the eight-month-old coffee shop on Elgin Road, has launched a kebab and coffee promotion. The kebab-coffee spread at Caffeine. With competition hotting up, the local player is trying to mix things up a little.We have some regular customers who visit us at least twice a week. We cant dish out the same stuff every time they come. Moreover there are other eateries near by to lure them in. So we try to provide a lot of variety, said Rajdeep Ghosal, owner of Caffeine.The menu which boasts of a wide array of coffee, tea and sandwiches will be bombarded with a deluge of kebabs during the month-long promotion. If non-veg is not your cup of tea, you can sip your coffee with Tandoori Aloo or Achari Aloo Kebab. Otherwise, try a variety of mutton kebabs, or if you are watching your cholesterol, go for Chicken Tikka, Chicken Reshmi and Chicken Pahari.Usually, coffee would be consumed with sandwiches but I wanted to Indianise the concept a bit. So we have introduced a variety of kebabs with the coffee range remaining the same, added Rajdeep. And the price tag is also reasonable with veg kebabs coming for around Rs 50 and non-veg for Rs 60.Bauble bestCollecting jewellery from various parts of India could be a hobby worth the effort, but who really has the time? So, an exhibition bringing high-quality jewellery from various parts of India under one roof has to be a magnet for most bauble buffs. Deboleena Dutta inaugurates the Cottage Industries exhibitionOn Tuesday morning, the Central Cottage Industries Corporation of India launched a jewellery exhibition and sale with works from far off Delhi to closer home Orissa. The line created by master craftsmen includes stone-studded jewellery, oxidised silver and old silver jewellery. Pick up the intricate filigree work from Orissa, or a colourful, jazzy kundan set from Rajasthan and Delhi if you will. Thewa from Madhya Pradesh and Mercasite from Delhi are among the other kinds of jewellery available.Actress Deboleena Dutta inaugurated the exhibition, slated to run till September 2 at the Cottage Industries Esplanade store.Besides the range of finished jewellery sets, semi-precious stones from Rajasthan will also be available for those who wish to put together their own designs. With Rakhi just a knock away and Durga Puja soon after, this is the perfect time to coax shoppers out of a few bank notes.Pictures by Rashbehari Das

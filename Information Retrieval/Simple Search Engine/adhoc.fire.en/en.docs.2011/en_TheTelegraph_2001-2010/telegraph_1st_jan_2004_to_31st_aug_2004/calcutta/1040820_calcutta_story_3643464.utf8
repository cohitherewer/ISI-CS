Its time to shift focus to the digits. Good ol nail polish has received a thorough overhaul and nail art is the hottest fashion statement to flaunt right now. From piercing and painting to surface embellishment in various forms  nail decoration is happening like never before.And parlours around town have geared up with the right tools at their fingertips. Says Darshini Sanghvi, nail and tattoo expert at Tressbay, a salon at the Enclave, Alipore: People used to look after their face and hair, while nails would be neglected. They would at best go for a manicure or pedicure. So, we started a nail bar at our salon.Right from the basics of nail-care to the more elaborate artistic endeavours, those who fancy flirty fingers now have somewhere to go. Tressbay has found that the trend has been quick to catch on.So, the next time you are headed for a party, keep your make-up subdued and make a statement with your flashy fingers instead. But if you dont have time to trek to the parlour, or dont want to part with Rs 600 for the nail job, let your imagination flow and try painting your own nails with whatever motifs come to mind. All you need are a few bottles of fabric paint in various hues and liberal doses of creativity.Fake itDont sulk if you dont have finely-shaped long nails, the acrylic ones are just as good. If your are going for a makeover at the parlour, you can opt for nail extensions, if you dont mind dishing out Rs 800 for both hands. Once the deed is done, you can hardly tell the difference. Attached with a special nail glue, they are sturdy enough to stay on for a couple of months and dont harm the natural nails beneath them. Cut and shaped according to the size and shape of your natural nails, they are filed in a manner that they gel with the real thing.French fareBefore any kind of nail art, it is best to go for a French manicure. You can pick up a French manicure set from the market. Any nice nails are just begging for a coat of plain transparent polish with the classic opaque tips.Brush strokesProfessionals will use nail art colour, but you can make do perfectly with some fabric paint. Colour the base evenly with any one shade and then just dream away and unleash a riot of hues. The patterns can be just about anything  from landscapes and human figures to objects and cartoon characters.At our parlour, the common designs are landscapes, sunsets, hearts, asymmetrical patterns, Dalmatian prints, toothbrush and toothpaste sets and many more, explains Darshini. For young people, we also do cartoon characters like Mickey, Donald, Tweety and Archies. Messages like I love you can also be imprinted, she adds.The hole storyThis should be done only by an expert, so dont try it at home. A visit to the parlour is a must. Never even dreamt of a ring for your fingernail? You can now have one pierced to wear a small dangling bauble. Match it with your outfit and the rest of your jewellery, with a choice of silver, gold and bronze.All that glittersIf you are looking for a classier look, stick to a single colour on the base and paste simple surface embellishments like stones, glitter, sparkling stars and even Swarovski crystals on them with nail glue. In fact, single white crystals on bright red polish looks absolutely stunning.SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

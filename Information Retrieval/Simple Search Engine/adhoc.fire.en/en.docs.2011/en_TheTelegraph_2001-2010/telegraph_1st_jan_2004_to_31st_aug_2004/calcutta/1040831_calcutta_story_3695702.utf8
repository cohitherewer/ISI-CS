GUHA ROY (From top) Sivamani, Louiz Banks and Shankar Mahadevan, Sridhar Parthasarathy, Sabir Khan and Karl Peters perform at a concert in City Centre on Sunday. Pictures by Aranya SenThey call themselves Silk, but they take you on a sonic journey combining subtle harmonies with thumping grooves that leave you a little out of breath at the end of it all.																					The Indo-jazz-fusion-World Music group comprising Sivamani, Louiz Banks, Shankar Mahadevan, Karl Peters and Sridhar Parthasarathy treated Calcutta to a delectable evening of music and showmanship at the City Centre Ballroom on Sunday.																					The two-hour concert organised by Shoppers Stop kicked off with the Silk theme song, Sivamani on drums, Banks on keyboards, Peters on bass and Parthasarathy on mridangam, showing off their skills in a live jam session.																					Mahadevan joined them on vocals with a piece fusing Carnatic, jazz bass, funky bass and Indian classical elements. Sivamanis mastery over a plethora of drums, hi-hats, cymbals and a host of percussion instruments stunned in the sheer energy with which he hammered his gear.																					Experimenting with a range of body sounds, the performance was complemented by Banks deft control on keyboards, while Peters and Parthasarathy held the groove.																					The camaraderie between the stalwarts was evident in the way they vibed on stage, instruments and feats overlapping with consummate ease. While Mahadevan lent a hand at the drums alongside Sivamani, catching his breath between incessantly long vocal pyrotechnics, Sivamani returned the favour by joining the singer on back vocals.																					Ustad Sabir Khan made a special appearance, joining them on the tabla. What followed was a competition of sorts between Sivamani, Khansaab and Parthasarathy as Banks and Mahadevan decided to take a break. The percussion side show had the three virtuosos pegging their skills against and with each other, flaunting fiery solos and improvisations to match each others music.																					The crowd loved every moment of it, and joined in on claps and foot stomps much to the amusement of the musicians. Bilkul sahi ja rahein hain aap log, itni achhi tali sirf Calcutta mein mil sakti hai (Such perfect timing and applause can only be expected from Calcuttas audience), commented Sabir Khan.																					A guest appearance by Bollywood playback Prashant was well appreciated before the concert closed on a fitting note with a performance of Mahadevans hit single Breathless, on request.

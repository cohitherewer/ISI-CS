The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 28, 2004 Home-style eatery on spread-out spree 
 Actor Arjun Chakraborty and wife Nilanjana dig into the Shradha buffet.Overwhelmed by the resounding success of its first outlet, Bhojohari Manna has opened its second Bengali speciality restaurant in the city. This one near the Hazra four-point crossing is a franchisee of the main restaurant opened in Gariahat about a year ago, but the spread is the same with the food being cooked in one central kitchen.																								We got several offers from people wanting to take franchisees of our restaurant, explains Siddhartha Bose, one of the five partners owning the original restaurant. But we wanted to rope in someone who shares our passion for good food.																								So, the offer from entrepreneur Ranjan Sengupta, who is not only a connoisseur of food but is an excellent cook himself, was hard to resist and up came the 22-seater eatery. 																								While the food fare is the same as the original, the dcor is totally different. We wanted to break the rule that all outlets of a particular chain have to look the same. Each of our eateries will have a different dcor theme based on its location, added Bose.																								Here, the proximity to Kalighat temple led to the temple theme. All accessories of the goddess  trishul, sword and dhol along with original Kalighat paintings adorn the walls. Cane and glass furniture and bamboo ceiling with a namabali panel complete the look. All the artefacts including the paintings are for sale.																								We have a stock of around 200 original Kalighat paintings which are more than 100 years old, Bose said. 																								As for the food, a host of Bengali delicacies are on offer with nostalgia food being the focus. There is an array of vegetarian dishes straight from grandmas kitchen. Along with the specialities that the restaurant has been dishing out for the past year, around seven styles of Ilish have been introduced especially for the season.																								There are signature items like the Jumbo Ilish Padma-Ganga (a combination of East and West Bengal cooking), Ilish Meghna, Ilish Barishali, Dhakai Ilish and Shonali Ilish (Senguptas secret recipe which no one has been able to guess). Apart from Hilsa, other fish specialities include Bhetki Rongpuri Fry, Bhetki Madhuri, Fowl Cutlet, Parshe Ganga-Jamuna and Chine Chingri (an Indianised version of the Lobster Thermidor). For those not keen on fish, there are meat dishes like Mutton Dakbangla, Mutton Rajshahi and Sylheti Mutton Chaap.																								Our USP with the food has been established. So, now we want to take it a step further and offer a fine dining experience to our customers, reveals Bose. 																								So, the third outlet coming up on Hindusthan Road in August will have live performances of Bengali folk music and also a lot of other value-addition. The 45-seater eatery will stick to Bengali cuisine, but with some variations.Other franchisee outlets and take-away counters in the city are also on the simmer.Buffet biteIf experience is the key to success, the reason for Shradhas steadily rising popularity isnt hard to digest. In the business of food for the past seven years, this multi-cuisine restaurant has grown from a roll centre to a fine-dining standalone outlet that serves some amazing Indian, Tandoori, Chinese and coastal fare. 																								This 115-cover well-appointed eatery at Park Circus has now introduced a buffet for lunch to help foodies in a rush have a quick but sumptuous meal.

Pictures by Rashbehari Das 																								The menu lists about 14 different kinds of dishes in both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections, starting with two different kinds of salads, eight snacks or starters and three dishes on the main course along with options of roti, rice and chowmien.																								The starters, with a mix of Indian kebabs and Chinese yummies on offer, include innovative items like Singara Fish and Paneer Spring Roll. But leave enough space for the main dishes, which include chicken, fish and prawn (on weekends).																								People have different tastes and we wanted to make sure that everyone gets something of his choice, said Sanjay Madan, owner, Shradha. Weekend menus promise even more. 																								Wrap up the huge lunch with a choice of at least four desserts. The buffet has been priced at Rs 249 (inclusive of taxes) on weekdays and Rs 349 on weekends.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Tribute shuts out film fans
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Confusion was the order of Sunday as almost all cinemas downed shutters, leaving weekend cine-goers stumped.																								With word about the Citu-affiliated Bengal Motion Pictures Employees Unions (BMPEU) decision to keep halls across the state closed on Sunday as a mark of respect to veteran leader Hiren Mukherjee not being circulated effectively, most movie-goers learnt of the shutdown when it was too late.																								Adding to the confusion was a contradictory statement issued by the Eastern India Motion Picture Association (EIMPA) on Sunday, announcing that all halls would remain open. The statement was issued inadvertently. Keeping the halls open would imply being insensitive, said EIMPA president Arijit Dutta.																								Only those halls without a strong BMPEU presence  of which Mukherjee was president  kept the doors open. Among these were Menoka, Navina and Basusree in south Calcutta, and Mitra, Minar and Talkie Showhouse up north. While Priya opened only for the noon show, all halls in central Calcutta remained shut.																								Movie buffs who had trooped into Elite, Globe, Metro, Hind and Paradise for the Sunday matinee were in for a rude shock. The lucky few phoned in to find out the status and steer clear of the closed halls.																								The worst hit were those who had dropped into Elite, hoping to catch the noon show of Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, the weeks big-ticket release. Instead of the ushers, they met a police picket, said industry sources.																								The only screens running smooth on Sunday were those at the three multiplexes. INOX (Forum and City Centre) and 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi) boasted the normal Sunday house-full for the mixed film fare.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Open sesame, shutdown season
 															- PLEASE, MR MAGICIAN, MAKE THE BANDHS DISAPPEAR OUR BUREAU				 	 After suggestions to improve the traffic situation in the city, magician PC Sorcar Jr was back to his street stunts, rehearsing a disappearing act with daughter Maneka on a deserted Bijon Setu, in Gariahat, on Tuesday afternoon. Actress Arunima Ghosh and a group of children watched in wonder as the lamp post doubled as a magic prop for the rope trick. Now all thats left for the magician with a mission to do is make bandhs vanish. Picture by Aranya Sen																								If only PC Sorcar Jr could wave a magic wand and make bandhs disappear!																								This could be the collective sigh from Calcutta the day bandh season 2004 was kicked off by Mamata Banerjee.																								If the 12-hour Trinamul Congress bandh slowed down life to a crawl on Tuesday, an action replay could be enacted before the month runs out. For, an all-India strike called by most trade unions belonging to the Opposition on February 24  and spearheaded by CITU  is likely to make its full impact felt on the city.																								Thats not all. The SUCI and the CPI-ML (Liberation), a Naxalite faction, have threatened to call two separate bandhs, probably in February, to protest the rise in hospital charges and the upward revision of taxes on motor vehicles and other items.																								SUCI leaders are busy conducting a survey to gauge the popular mood before announcing a bandh date. We took the opinion of the people when we were thinking of calling a 48-hour bandh last August. During our survey, we found that the people wanted only a days strike and so we called a 24-hour bandh, said Provas Ghosh, SUCI state secretary, attempting to provide a popular twist to the paralysis call.																								The Congress, however, seems to be the odd one out when it comes to political parties jumping on to the bandh bandwagon. The last time we called a bandh was in 2000. Since then, we have realised that peoples problems are not solved by bandhs. We dont have any plans for a bandh in the near future, said Pradip Bhattacharya, state Congress working president.																								Tuesdays bandh had little impact on flight and Metro Railway schedules. But there was a drop in passenger count, on both the international and domestic sectors, according to an official of the Airports Authority of India. 																								The Trinamul-sponsored shutdown, described by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as irresponsible, found 228 bandh supporters being arrested. Ten vehicles were damaged between 10 am and 1 pm, police said. At around 11.45 am, about 100  Trinamul supporters led by Sanjay Bakshi set up a roadblock  on Howrah bridge, stopping passing vehicles and even smashing  the windshield of a state bus. Two policemen sustained injuries.  Trinamul supporters later demonstrated in front of the Lalbazar  police headquarters to protest the arrests.																								Chetla, CIT Road, Amherst Street, Central Avenue-Eden Hospital Road, Harish Mukherjee Road, Chetla Central Road and Rashbehari Avenue witnessed stray incidents, while at Howrah Maidan, processionists damaged three state buses, four private buses and ransacked five shops that were open.																								At the end of the years first bandh day, inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said no major incidents were reported from the districts.

 																											- Trade body proposes ombudsman to take health benefits to the poor A STAFF REPORTER																								Showcasing excellence through health fairs is one thing, but ensuring that the benefit is passed on to the patient is of paramount importance.																								That is the medical missive from the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI). The health sector needs to grow in the right direction, with the right motives. Here, profit should be looked upon as a by-product and service to the ailing should be the sole aim. Once the patient benefits, the industry automatically will, observes urologist Amit Ghose, chairman of BCCIs health committee.																								The chamber has kicked off a damage-control initiative to ensure that perception of the medical fraternity improves and the economics of healthcare is geared for the middle-class and not for the rich.																								To protect the interests of the critical mass of patients with very little paying power, the chamber has also proposed a regulatory body, comprising citizens and government officials.																								There are a host of issues, ranging from rates to insurance claims, where the industry can do with an ombudsman, and we are trying to reach a unanimity on this with other chambers, says Ghose.																								To improve perception of the health industry in Bengal, the chamber is setting up a task force consisting of representatives from various walks of life.																								The image of the entire medical fraternity has taken a beating of late. While infrastructure in both the private and public sectors is seriously wanting, its also pertinent to focus on our inherent strengths  the skill and intellect of doctors  to bail the industry out of the morass, feels BCCI president Biswadip Gupta.																								First, financial exploitation of patients has to stop. Despite being located at the epicentre of a huge hinterland, the private health sector has been terribly under-achieving for lack of long-term focus. All the private beds in the city put together will barely equal the capacity of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital alone, points out Ghose.																								The BCCI health panel will be hosting a series of lectures on health economics, along with other awareness-building tools, as part of its efforts to put the industry back on track and halt patient drain.																								The need for more NGO-run and doctor-led hospitals is being stressed. A central blood bureau, old-age homes, an AIDS platform, a project on paediatric ailments and a special initiative for the mentally challenged are also on the BCCI agenda.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Fears allayed with flu-fight regimen
 OUR BUREAU Precaution, not panic, was the  byword as the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Wednesday  put in place measures to prevent an outbreak of bird flu  in Bengal.																								We have received a Central guideline and formed a five-member panel to safeguard against bird flu and combat it, if the need arises. But let me state that there is no need to panic, as neither the chicken nor the feed in our state is imported from other states or countries. We have checked with the Bangladesh high commission and the disease has not affected that country either, said animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman, after a series of meetings with senior officials.																								Union health secretary Xavier Prasad Rao will be arrving in Calcutta on February 9 to meet chief minister Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Ashoke Gupta to take stock of the situation in the state, Rahaman added.																								The director of the animal resources development will head the committee on poultry vigil. Other members will be from the directorate, the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and the University of Animal and Fisheries Sciences (UAFS). S. S. Ghosh, UAFS vice-chancellor, will lead another team of specialists to study the causes behind the deaths, if any, of chicken in government and private poultry farms in the coming days. Rahaman said the agencies concerned were also keeping a special watch at the airport.																								In Calcutta, where approximately 150,000 kg of chicken is consumed every day, most of the bird population is sourced from the 22 government-run poultry farms and large private hatcheries, like Arambaghs and Venkys, mostly in the districts. We will be sending copies of the guidelines (see box) to them on Thursday, with instructions that they be strictly followed. We are particularly worried about the high-yielding varieties of chicken, as they are more susceptible to diseases, said Rahaman.																								The management at Arambagh Hatcheries  which accounts for 30 per cent of the citys chicken consumption  said it had already taken necessary precautions and was maintaining a strict vigil. We have kept a team of experts ready to combat any eventuality. At our farm in Ilambazar (in Birbhum), we are even restricting the entry of vehicles. There is no real tension, as there has been no outbreak of bird flu in Bengal, stressed P.K. Roy, managing director of Arambagh Hatcheries.																								The health department has convened a meeting on Thursday, where expertise will also be sought from virologists of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases and the All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health. We will open a special ward at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata, just like we had done during the SARS scare, said director of medical education C.R. Maity.

 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Driver steers sleuths to hitman door 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Kick-started by the chief minister last week, the probe into the murder of gynaecologist Susil Pal picked up pace on Monday with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arresting a contract killer from Serampore.																								Pankaj Dhara, alias Pankhi, was netted from a hideout near Serampore ferry ghat in connection with the murder of promoter Sushanta Som two years ago. But suspecting a link with the disappearance and death of Pal, CID officials have brought the hitman to the Bhabani Bhavan headquarters for interrogation.																								Pankaj has at least a dozen cases, including murder and dacoity, pending in different police stations, sleuths said.																								The supari killer was picked up  though officially for another case  on the basis of information provided by Lakshman, an ambulance driver at Serampores Walsh Hospital, who had been helping Pal scout for a suitable chamber in Bally.																								Lakshman had also provided sleuths with the tip-off on the basis of which Gabbar was arrested on Sunday. Gabbar was a cleaner at Walsh Hospital and a close associate of Lakshman.																								He also owned an Ambassador which, sleuths believe, was at some stage used to transport Pal  either before he was murdered or to dump his body in a Sankrail canal. Gabbar, incidentally, sold off the suspect car within two days of the doctors death.																								A CID team, meanwhile, spent the entire day in a nursing home at Bally. Preliminary investigations revealed that Pal had plans to start a chamber in a nursing home in Bally. Accordingly, we made a list of three nursing homes on the banks of the Ganga, said an official. We have reason to believe that Pal spent several hours in one of these nursing homes He might have been confined and tortured there, he added.																								Officers on the case have also put Pals proposed property deals under the scanner. The doctor had booked a flat in Singhi Park, south Calcutta, and applied for a loan of Rs 14 lakh. A multinational bank had allotted the loan amount. We are also investigating any possible real-estate dispute, said the official.																								Kanika Pal, meanwhile, has stepped up efforts to track down her husbands killers. If anyone provides me with information about my husband when he was travelling from our Bright Street residence to Bally, via Bandel, he or she will be rewarded, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Weekend river high 
 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI				 	 Last touches being applied to Jahaj Park, before its launch on Saturday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								What happens when a city just wants to have fun and space jam is a ground reality? Simple, head for the river to make waves.																								An entertainment park, floating on the Hooghly, is the next thing thats going to happen to the chill-out scene in Calcutta.																								A three-hour cruise on the lavishly-decorated deck of a vessel, complete with a dance floor, DJ music and a sumptuous dinner buffet will possibly keep quite a few Calcuttans occupied over the next few weekends.																								Starting June 11, this Jahaj Park will be seen whistling off from the Man-o-War jetty at 7 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.																								With a carrying capacity of 150 people, its the concept of a breezy evening spent on a ship with a nightclub and restaurant with set menu to choose from that would be the USP, feels Pulak Bardhan, director of Idea, the company spearheading the project. The price for the cruise is Rs 300, inclusive of a non-vegetarian dinner spread.																								But thats not all. If Calcutta parties right on Jahaj Park, it could well go places. We are going to run this project on a trial basis for the next 10 days, with investors from Singapore coming in to see the prospects of investing in entertainment and tourism projects on the Hooghly, said Bardhan.																								According to the Bangladesh national, investors from Singapore are ready to invest over Rs 50 crore on various projects within the next six months, after testing the waters of the Hooghly.																								If they are convinced that there is a market in Calcutta, luxury vessels from Singapore will be seen cruising here by Durga Puja, claimed Bardhan.																								Talks are also on to set up an Iron Island in the middle of the river, too. If and when completed, this would be the first project of its kind in India, according to the young entrepreneur. 																								The grand plans for the island involve 10 barges  being practically sold as scrap adding up to an area of 50,000 sq ft. This would create a one-stop shop for dining, drinking, dancing, sports, and even a large-screen movie show.																								That is then, but for now the focus is on Jahaj Park, which will head off into the waters with the party people at 7 pm on Saturday.

Dibyendu Das or Choton as he is popularly known, kick-started the evening with a medley of baul songs. His melodious renditions spoke of the beauty of nature, the scent of the earth, the truth about love and the purpose of life. The performance was enlivened by the accompaniment of percussion instruments, harmonium, flute and synthesiser. 																					e all five baul numbers were greeted with warm applause, popular band Orient Express took centrestage next. Formed in 1997, the band specialises in Afro-music and claims to be the only Indian band drawing influence from Africa and the Middle-East. Orient Express soon had audience members swaying in their seats with their lively Afro numbers which were followed by a salsa tune and even a Bengali song. 																					With the rhythm of music still ringing in their ears, guests were then treated to a fashion show that had a bevy of beauties including Joy, Pinky, Jessica and Tina walking the ramp. Leading the show was Shantanu Goenka with his spring collection. Revisiting traditionalwear with a touch of folk, Shantanus line included saris and ghaghra- cholis. With an emphasis on flaming reds, oranges, fuschias and yellows, the clothes captured the true spirit and fervour of spring.

Chef Henry Rajgopal, Sulagna and Chef Sarita (left to right) with some of the specialities from the Goan food festival at the Hyatt Regency 												Goa calling																					If you thought Goa was only about golden beaches, frothy waves, beach bums and bikinis, its time to do a re-think. Consider golden curries, fragrant spices, pork and prawns and always, but always, a stomachful of satisfaction. The good news is that you could indulge your appetite for all this and more at Guchhi, the Indian speciality restaurant at the Hyatt Regency, thats looking westward to the tiny state of Goa for some culinary inspiration. Continuing till February 29, the promotion at the restaurant takes in some of the most popular Goan preparations as well as an equal number of uncommon ones that are sure to hit all the right buttons. 																					The two master chefs working their magic in the Hyatt kitchens especially for the festival are Henry Rajgopal and Sarita Carvalho  all the way from the Park Hyatt Goa Resort and Spa. While Henry brings with him 15 years of experience as a speciality Goan chef in a number of five-star hotels across the country, Sarita specialises in home-style Goan cooking. 																					At Guchhi, starters including stuffed poppadums (with delicious fillings), Goan Cheese Fluffs (deep-fried potato and cheese puffs), Fof As De Peixe (minced fish and potato fluffs) and Rissoise De Camarao (minced prawns in pastry parcels) are an ideal way to kick off your meal. Main-course temptations from the sea come by way of the delectable Prawn Balchao (prawns cooked in shrimp paste and spiked with feni), Pomfret Rechaeiado (pomfret dipped in special masalas) and the traditional Goan Fish Curry (bekti cooked in a coconut and coriander gravy). Other meaty affairs featured on the special menu are the must-have Lamb Vindalho, Lamb Xacuti (baby lamb cooked in roast coconut gravy) and Chicken Cafrael. 																					For the goodness of vegetables, try the Bhindi Solantulem (ladyfingers tossed with onions), Cauliflower Cauldeen (cauliflower florets in garlic gravy) and the Chounli Ros (white chounli beans in a coconut-flavoured curry). Goan red rice and sanas (steamed rice pancakes) make great accompaniments. Finish your Goan sojourn with the famous Bebinca (layers of coconut, sugar and egg) or Crme Caramel even as you wash everything down with any of the cocktails available such as the vodka-based Vasco Wave and Goan Honeymoon (a blend of feni, pineapple juice and tender coconut water).																					At the festival, a meal for two could translate into a slightly expensive affair what with prices ranging between Rs 150 and Rs 590. For a slice of the Goan pie, contact 2335 1234.

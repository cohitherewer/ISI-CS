The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Road rules on revamp route
 																											- Rs 20 lakh to make travel safer for pedestrian and motorist DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAYTRAFFIC GUARD  Installation of signals (auto/manual) 
 Installation of signboards giving bus routes
 Pedestrian guard rails (median/sides of a road)
 To offer technical help to the authorities (police/ municipality, wherever applicable) to instal and run the computerised signalsSlow and chaotic it is; swift and safe it will be  at least on paper.																								To address the traffic system in the city  or maybe the lack of it  the state transport department has recently sanctioned Rs 20 lakh to the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC), with strict instructions to use the money to make a difference, by March 2005.																								Dhiman Mukherjee, managing director of WBTIDC, said on Friday: Our motto is to ensure free and smooth flow of traffic and instil a sense of security among commuters, as well as pedestrians.																								Topping the list of proposed revamp plans are the setting up of signboards, more traffic signals (both automatic and manual), and guard rails along pavements for pedestrians at a number of important intersections.																								Taking a leaf out of the traffic rulebook in at least three other metros, the WBTIDC plans to put up signboards at about 350 locations throughout the city.																								These signboards will bear specific details, like the route numbers of busses that will stop at a particular point. This will ensure that any commuter waiting at a bus-stop will know exactly which bus will be passing by.																								The WBTIDC also wants to put up additional automatic traffic signals at major city intersections to make traffic management easier for the police.																								What about the numerous traffic signals reduced to useless showpieces? 																								The signals are put up by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and, thereafter, they are handled by the police. It is their duty to keep it functioning, said Sitanath Goswami, a senior official of the WBTIDC.																								The traffic signal at Bagha Jatin, in the Jadavpur police station area, for instance, has not been functioning since its installation.																								When this was pointed out to D.K. Ganguly, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police, he said the signal could not be operated for lack of staff. Usually, the traffic system is looked after by a deputy superintendent of police. But in our district, the post is lying vacant, he complained.																								Pedestrian safety also figures prominently in the WBTIDC plans. Pedestrian-guard median rails will be put up along city thoroughfares prone to vehicle-pedestrian accidents. This will safeguard both pedestrians and motorists from mishaps and curb road fatality.																								If these steps are implemented, traffic conditions in the city will improve, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). Pedestrians and commuters will be able to reach their destinations far more easily, he added.

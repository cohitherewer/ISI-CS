The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 College entry guide on error note
 JULIUS GOMES			Just out of school, students doing the rounds of colleges in the city with a guide in hand have discovered to their dismay that most of the information provided in the book, published by state university teachers, is incorrect.																								Uchcha Madhyamik-er Por  Ki Porbe, Kothai Porbe (Post Higher Secondary What to Study and Where), published by the West Bengal College and Universities Teachers Association (WBCUTA), is selling like hot cakes from city bookstalls. With the Higher Secondary Examination results expected in July, students gearing up to seek admission in undergraduate courses are becoming victims of misinformation dished out by the WBCUTA.																								The 92-page book, which is selling at Rs 10 per copy, lists 68 colleges affiliated to Calcutta University, from page numbers 9 to 15. The mistakes, some glaring and others more subtle, are not difficult to detect. For instance, it lists Charuchandra Evening College as offering subjects of the Arts stream (BA), but the corresponding subject column lists only accountancy. 																								When Metro called up the colleges listed in the book to find out which streams of study are actually offered, the anomalies became apparent. 																								According to the book, Surendranath Evening College, located on Mahatma Gandhi Road, offers BA, BSc, and vocational courses. The corresponding subject column lists only Bengali and accountancy, when the latter is not an arts or science subject. The college actually also offers BCom courses.																								The book further states that Prafulla Chandra College, located on Gariahat Road, offers BA and BCom courses, but the corresponding subject column lists only accountancy. The college also offers Bengali, Hindi and political science. 																								Anil Bhattacharya, general secretary of the WBCUTA, admitted the mistakes only after conducting a crosscheck, and cautiously blamed the erroneous information on government reports. The information was compiled from documents like the annual report of Calcutta University, and some errors crept in, he said. I am sorry that the publication carries incorrect information. 																								Some of the courses listed in the book were recommended by the university, but not implemented in some colleges, he said, shrugging off responsibility.bloomers on page

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 TALENT POOL: Samrat Mukherjee (rear, in black), with Sharad Malhotra (white shirt) and teachers and students of his academy. Picture by Aranya Sen																								A decade ago, it was one of the first modelling-cum-grooming schools in Calcutta. Having started off with a handful of students who could barely manage to pay their way through the six-month course, Samrats Modelling amp; Performing Arts Institute (SMPAi) now has nearly 2,000 ex-students well on their way to making a name for themselves in the glamour industry.																								Among the list of credits that Samrat Mukherjee  former model and actor, and the man behind the modelling mission  has garnered for his school are famous teachers and students, and several firsts, in technology and on television. From former catwalk coach Bipasha Basu to ex-student Fllora Saini (heroine of Love in Nepal), SMPAi has come a long way.																								There are around 1,800 ex-students pursuing careers in modelling and acting, whose faces can be seen on national advertisements, or in Oriya, Tamil and Tollywood films, says Samrat. Our success lies in the fact that there are several eminent photographers and film-makers who visit our institute to recruit students.																								The institutes USP is the digital portfolio and computerised grooming software offered free to students. It gives aspiring models and actors the opportunity to test different looks before going in for the one most suitable  be it hairstyle or colour  plus an individually-tailored fitness regime.																								But the runaway hits were the two first-ever TV programmes, Models.com and 360 degrees, for private Bengali channels, with expert guests providing tips and advice to youngsters on how to make a career in the industry. Calls and letters just kept pouring in, smiles Samrat. The result is two more in the offing  Actors.com and Dancers.com.																								There are many talented young people here, but the reason Calcutta lags behind Delhi and Mumbai is lack of knowledge and awareness. So, we teach a bit of everything, from technical to practical. Dancing, acting, personality development and even media management is part of the course, so that our students know how to handle almost every situation, explains Samrat.																								Proof of SMPAis success  Sharad Malhotra, a first-year B.Com student, the face of PC Chandra to National Insurance, and now, after one Bengali telefilm, is sitting on more offers. I have a future in the industry, he signs off.

 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Silent vows for screen couple
 Jaya Seal and Bikram Ghosh after the wedding on Sunday evening. Picture by Aranya Sen 																								The occasion: A low-key wedding																								The groom: 37-year-old percussionist Bikram Ghosh																								The bride: 32-year-old actress Jaya Seal																								After six months of a hush-hush affair, the couple that met on the sets of Subrata Sens Hothat Neerar Jonyo tied the knot on Sunday evening in a room packed with very close friends and family at the Ghoshs Behala address.																								No rituals, just a signature on the dotted lines. We will have a simple malabadal later, on the request of friends and family, and all of us will have dinner together, said Bikram, dressed in a maroon kurta.																								So, who proposed to whom and how? After I went back to Mumbai, we used to chat for hours on the phone and Bikram broached marriage one day, said Jaya, draped in a flaming red benarasi, in traditional Bengali-style. And no one on the sets had any inkling that Rani and Abinash were seeing each other off-screen, smiles Jaya.																								Just when we got to know each other, I had invited Jaya out to dinner one day, but she promptly turned me down. And I knew I had a hard nut to crack here, laughed Bikram, who will soon be off to Barcelona for a concert.																								Jaya, meanwhile, will fly back to Mumbai to wrap up her role in Ekta Kapoors Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki. The wedding bash and honeymoon can wait.																								I will start my dance classes once I am back in Calcutta and will take up acting assignments only if they are interesting, said she.																								Jaya is very home-bound and isnt fond of parties at all. So, I will cut down on my party-hopping, admitted the groom, as the bride pottered around the room, chatting with her in-laws.

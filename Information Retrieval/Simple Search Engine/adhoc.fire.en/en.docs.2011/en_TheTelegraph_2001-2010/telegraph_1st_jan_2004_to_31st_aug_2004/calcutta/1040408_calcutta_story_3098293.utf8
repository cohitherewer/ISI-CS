The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 08, 2004 For abode or office, youll get it all here 
				 	 An architects impression of the mall coming up on Elgin Road																								From samples of floor tiles to fittings and fixtures; the perfect interiors to Vastu and Feng Shui consultants; home finance facilities to architects. In other words, the A to Z of homemaking, all under one roof, in an integrated format.																								Homeland, the countrys first one-stop homemaking mall dedicated exclusively to homemaking accessories and allied resources, coming up near the Chowringhee-Elgin Road crossing, promises to deliver an international lifestyle experience that is unparalleled in India.																								Work has already begun on the 100,000-sq-ft, five-storey mall conceptualised by the Merlin Group, and the Rs 50-crore project will be completed by mid-2006. The genesis of the Homeland concept actually lies in my own experience, which mirrors the ordeal faced by most in this city. Times without number, I have had a harrowing time, scouring different corners of Calcutta to find the right finishing materials for my projects, says Sushil Mohta, managing director, Merlin Group.																								The swanky mall, with provision to house nearly 150 outlets, will offer multi-brand choices and convenience to the customer. From building materials to electrical fittings, marble and ceramics to stock furniture fixtures, home accessories, kitchen equipment and cabinets, household items, upholstery, tailoring, furnishing, drapery, leather products and accessories  the homemaker can source all needs at a single point.																								Even speciality furniture like cane and childrens furniture, mattresses and carpets, paintings/wall hangings and a wide range of white goods will be available at the outlets. Homeland is being built with the objective to help people set up beautiful homes and inspiring offices, minus the clutter, congestion and limitation of street shopping, adds Mohta.																								The focus is also on the home-office segment, which accounts for a growing proportion of organised retail off-take in the city. Homeland will also offer space for consultancy services, like interiors, architects, Vastu and Feng Shui experts, home loan facilities, property dealers, all on the fifth floor.																								The speciality mall hopes to generate business transaction of around Rs 2 crore every day, which would yield daily revenues worth Rs 10 lakh to the state exchequer. Promotional discounts, product launches and allied events will be very much the norm, say Merlin officials.																								A separate lift for goods, free office space for big showrooms, ATMs at convenient corners, information kiosks, a permanent display counter, an art gallery, a resource caf with a library having the latest books and periodicals on homemaking, will all be key areas in this shopping mart. Homeland will be a preferred destination for home-making agencies like architects, contractors and landscape experts, feel the developers of the mall.						 A STAFF REPORTER

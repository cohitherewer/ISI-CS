The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Bypass access chaos crucible
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Bypass and beyond is what life in Calcutta may be all about, but the stretch leading into the city is now a death zone.																								The Park Circus bridge no. 4 is a crucible of chaos, with three people having died in the past six months and several accidents having occurred after the widening of New Park Street and restructuring of traffic flow.																								Widening of the road leading to the bridge proved to be a curse for us, cried Abdul Karim, whose daughter and son-in-law were killed on Friday morning at the junction after the two-wheeler they were on was crushed by a private bus.																								Residents of the area said the speed of vehicles had increased following the felling of trees and narrowing of pavements but there was an inadequate number of traffic police personnel even during peak hours.																								Till about eight months ago, additional traffic police personnel were being deployed at the crucial junction, a traffic police official said on condition of anonymity. However, for some unknown reasons, they have been withdrawn.																								The four-point crossing has emerged as one of the busiest in the city, with the city expanding eastwards and the Bypass being the most popular link to the airport.																								Also, according to traffic police officials, close to 100 VIP cars pass through the zone every day. This just compounds the chaos at the crossroads.																								Residents also rued the narrowing of pavements. The footpaths have been cut short from five feet to three feet, forcing pedestrians to step on to the road and risk being run over, said a resident of Park Circus.																								Police, however, said steps were being taken to make the crossing less perilous. Additional traffic personnel will be deployed at the crossing from Saturday to monitor vehicular movement, said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic).

 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Adding dimensions to a dream
				 	 Ranendra Nath Banerjee It was the urge to come down from the ivory tower and work with people that spurred Ranendra Nath Banerjee to get involved in areas that touch peoples lives. 																								A graduate in fine arts, specialising in life, nature and murals; creative director of a cluster of top-notch advertising agencies and publishing houses around the country. But these identities were not enough. I could have carried on with my life behind air-conditioned closed doors. But my dream was to enhance the quality of life through art.																								The dream made Banerjee quit his cushy job in Delhi and start his own outfit, Graphix Impex Moulded Product, in hometown Calcutta. 																								The dream made him take on research on the end use of jute in a bid to add a lease of life to the dying business in the yarn of the golden fibre. I faced initial resistance as people are loathe to accept painters as capable of hardcore research. But later the National Centre for Jute Diversification, a ministry of textiles unit, helped me out with UNDP funds and NGOs followed suit. Now he supplies a variety of colourful ware  ash tray to table lamp to waste paper basket  all made of jute, to other states and abroad.																								The dream, again, is what led him to associate himself with the local puja organised by Badamtala Ashar Sangha since 1999. 																								Puja pandals were becoming increasingly dependant on medium  clay cups, bottle caps and the like rather than the structure. Since my specialisation is in dimensional creative solutions, I wanted to widen the scope of possibilities. The results have been the fishermens village with even the characteristic stink in the air in 2002 or the ruins of a castle complete with a temple, towers, and natmandir in 2003. 																								The dream has now made him take on his latest challenge. As the creative advisor to a Rs 65-crore mega project taken up by the International Foundation for Sustainable Development, to beautify the century-old Kali temple and its vicinity, His sketches and graphics promise to reinvent this dingy area and if the ambitious project is finished on time, Calcutta will get the status of hosting the first eco-tourism heritage spot in India. I plan to highlight on the atchala form that has been a part of our architectural heritage. Everything around the temple will follow a vision of parity  the lighting, the colour scheme, the gardens, the vehicles plying in the area, and even the uniforms of the security guards.																								Despite having such a busy schedule, Banerjee loves to see kids sketch. I love attending sit-and-draw contests. Children have a freedom of perspective that we lack, being bound by constraints of reality, says the painter-at-heart.

 SWATI SENGUPTA																								The idea of all work wouldnt really work. So, some play and some work will be the way forward for the Toy Park in Salt Lake, ready for inauguration in just over a fortnight. And the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), currently developing the park, is pinning hopes on the new concept clicking.																								The 2.48-acre plot close to Nicco Park will be an education-cum-entertainment centre, explained WBIDC managing director Gopal Krishna. Apart from being the eastern India hub for toy production, it will also have enough attractions to call in the children. There will be more than a patch of green for the kids to play on, fascinating toys on display for them to gape at and even grab, plus a chance to watch how some toys are made.																								The park was initially conceived as a factory for toy production, along with some displays. We later thought of developing it as a complete park for children and their parents. The earlier focus was more on business, but now it is more people-friendly, said Krishna. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to inaugurate the Toy Park, built at a cost of Rs 8 crore, on February 14.																								All kinds of toys  stuffed, wooden, plastic and even electronic  will be manufactured and sold on the premises. A six storeyed standard design factory will house 24 manufacturing units, each 3,500 sq ft in area. All 24 modules were booked by November 2003, clarified Krishna.																								Another common facility building has been constructed, with the ground floor housing a business centre with facilities like a canteen and display counters. The first floor will include an exhibition centre for toys and handicrafts; the second floor a WBIDC facilitation centre, with space for a proposed training institute. Entrepreneurs will be handed over their units on the day of inauguration, and its up to them when they want to start production, said Krishna.																								The park will primarily act as a manufacturing centre and a centre for trade. It will be a meeting point for entrepreneurs, where they can book their orders for large-scale production, Krishna said. It will also be possible for individuals to buy a toy or two from the display counters.																								The Toy Park will mostly cater to the domestic toy market, though some exporters have also booked space. The domestic sector in toy-manufacturing is largely unorganised and the park will offer huge employment generation opportunities, observed the WBIDC managing director.																								An open space within the centre will be turned into a childrens park before the monsoon. There will be provisions for tours by schoolchildren and toys could emerge as a major tool for elementary learning.																								This is the first phase. There will be a second standard design factory, housing another 24 modules. Construction will start in four months, said Krishna.

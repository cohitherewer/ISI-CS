The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 15, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Railway tracks from Sealdah to Bongaon, Barrackpore and Diamond Harbour are very old and require maintenance. Recently, some problems with the tracks paralysed rail traffic for more than six hours on the Sealdah-Bidhannagar route. Thousands of office-goers and students from the suburbs were highly inconvenienced due to the disruption of rail service. Railways must ensure that passengers get the service they pay for.

	We have to travel far to reach the nearest Mother Dairy booth. Nor is there a post office in the vicinity. This, despite the fact that the authorities have included the area under the purview of the Calcutta Metropolitian Area.

	The flyover leading to Vidyasagar Setu has been defaced with poll graffiti. When will these be removed?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Monsoon sets in 5 days late
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The monsoon is here at last, behind its June 8 schedule by about five days. The Met office said the rains arrived in Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal on Sunday afternoon. A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal, near Puri, helped drag the monsoon currents into south Bengal.																								The south-west monsoon has now covered all of Bengal and most parts of Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar and we have issued a warning for Calcutta and the districts for the next 24 hours, said K.K. Chakraborty, director of the weather section at Alipore.

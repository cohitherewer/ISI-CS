 Thursday, February 05, 2004  Guide to City Living MRS SEN OFFERS SOLUTIONS TO YOUR DAY-TO-DAY PROBLEMS				 																																												Q: I am a 35-year-old single man and I live alone in a multi- storied building. I am rather shy and have had only a couple of relationships in the past, both of which ended rather disastrously. Recently a young woman moved into the building and she lives alone as well. Although we have never spoken to each other, I am really attracted to her and would like to get to know her. How do I approach her without scaring her off? Do you have any simple solution? 				 																																												M.D, Santoshpur				 																																												A: Its best to break the ice without looking as if you are really trying. Thats best achieved by running into her accidentally rather than accosting her purposely. Observe her comings and goings for a while and then contrive to run into her in the lift. Thats the most opportune moment to strike up a conversation. Ask her if shes new in the building or just visiting. When she says that she has just moved in, ask her if she needs any help with the furniture etc. She will say no, but at least you will have established yourself as a helpful soul. 				 																																												 The next step would be to arrange to leave for work around the time she does. Ask her if she would like a lift. Have the occasional conversation about books and movies; offer to lend her some. Invite her to come over the next time you have a dinner for your friends. By then, you will have established enough of a relationship to be able to ask her out for a real date. Of course, there is a distinct possibility that she may not be interested and say no. But that wont be for lack of trying on your part, will it?

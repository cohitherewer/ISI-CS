 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 In step with Kathak
																								When a trained classical singer decides to put on her dancing shoes it is never too late. Gourie Verma received a relatively late initiation into the world of dance but having sung Ghazals and Thumri for years, she is a natural exponent of the Kathak dance form. Her movements are strikingly beautiful; slow and subtle, sometimes so delicate in their nuances that unless keenly observed they are missed. Her execution of fast and vigorous footwork and pirouettes can be immediately recognised as rhythmic abandon. Vermas forte is a unique combination of several gharanas which is enhanced by her singing. Hers is the quintessential amalgamation of two facets of art that serve to enrich the persona that is born out of a marriage of the two. Presented by Spandan.																								Event: Kathak recital by Gourie Verma																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

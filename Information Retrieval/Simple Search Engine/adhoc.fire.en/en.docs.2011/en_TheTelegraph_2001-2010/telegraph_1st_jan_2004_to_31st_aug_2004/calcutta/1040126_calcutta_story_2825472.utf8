The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 26, 2004  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The backyard of Nandan, particularly the stretch connecting the Academy of Fine Arts with the ticket counter, is a litter dump. There are several eateries but not a single garbage vat in sight. The ground always remains strewn with paper and plastics. 				 																																									Sunil Garodia,				 																																									Sushil Sen Road.				 																																									Barricades, erected on either side of Red Road with steel pipes painted in white for the Republic Day ceremony, have made the stretch look good. The authorities could retain the barricades for safety, as crowds from the football grounds cross the road from wherever they like. 				 																																									Govind Das Dujari,				 																																									Diamond Harbour Road.

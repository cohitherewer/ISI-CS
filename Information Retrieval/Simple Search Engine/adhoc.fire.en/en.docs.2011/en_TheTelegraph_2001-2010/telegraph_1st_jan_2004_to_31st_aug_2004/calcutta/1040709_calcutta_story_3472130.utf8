 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Schedule shift in two hours
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sushil Pal had left home for Serampore on Friday, but not for Walsh Hospital, where he was attached as a gynaecologist. He was scheduled to visit a private clinic in the same locality and examine patients.																								Two days after the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was asked to probe Pals murder, sleuths drew up a tentative route that Pal might have taken on Friday. Pals mud-caked body was found on the bank of Saraswati canal at Sankrail, in Howrah, 24 hours after he had left home. The post-mortem report, two days after the body was recovered, confirmed that he was murdered. 																								It seems Pal left his Bright Street home around 8 am for the clinic. He changed his schedule, but did not inform the clinic, said a CID sleuth, adding: Pal confirmed he wouldnt go to the clinic only after the management got in touch with him.																								Shankar Agarwal, owner of the health clinic, said: He was scheduled to come here by 10 am. Accordingly, patients were given appointments. I contacted Pal around 10.15 am, when he told me he wouldnt come. He asked me to tell the patients to come on Saturday morning.																								Investigators on Thursday stressed this point. The conversation with Agarwal proves that Pal decided not to go to Serampore by 10 am, that is two hours after he left home, said a sleuth.

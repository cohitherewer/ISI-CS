 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 Govt frames 20-point guideline for school buses
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A fresh set of guidelines for school bus operators, framed by the government to check the spurt in accidents involving such vehicles, will be announced within a fortnight. 																								A 20-point guideline for school bus operators has been drawn up by the transport department, in collaboration with the traffic police. The government notification will be issued within a fortnight, said director of Public Vehicles Department (PVD) H. Mohan on Saturday. He was addressing an awareness camp organised by the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners and Operators Association.																								Affirming the government stand that no bus without a valid permit will be allowed to ferry schoolchildren, Mohan said: We will, under no circumstance, allow anyone to ply just by fixing a sticker on the vehicle. Bus operators will have to obtain a permit from the PVD, which will be issued only after the school concerned gives it approval. We will soon hold a meeting with various schools to make them aware of the new rules. 																								Additional director-general of police Tapan Chattopadhyay said the association would have to shoulder the responsibility of ensuring that no bus can ply illegally. We are worried over the spurt in road mishaps, the main reason behind which is rash driving. We have decided to intensify police patrol on the roads and book errant drivers, he added.																								A school bus found flouting traffic rules would have to cough up a heftier penalty than a regular bus, said joint commissioner of police, traffic, Banibrata Basu, adding that school buses could not be compared with other buses.

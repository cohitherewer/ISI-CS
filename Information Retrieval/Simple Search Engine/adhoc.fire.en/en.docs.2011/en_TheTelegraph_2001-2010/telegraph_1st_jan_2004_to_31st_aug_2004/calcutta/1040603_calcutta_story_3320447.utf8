				 	 APU BANDOPADHYAY																								From decrying the open slaughter of animals and the ferrying of poultry birds upside down in appalling conditions, to a tableau showcasing the power of e-governance, he has left his mark on campaign designs addressing a wide array of issues. For graphic artist Apu Bandopadhyay, the thrill of exploring new frontiers knows no bounds.																								So, the state pollution control board (PCB) green-lighting his anti-pollution visual project for posters and badges on World Environment Day has got Apu all excited.																								With an artist father  Dilip Banerjee from the Government Art College and London Slade School  the 33-year-old graphic designer grew up with the waft of linseed and turpine oil alongside the palette and the paintbrush at home. However, he never really taught me anything hands-on, and I have never had any formal training, Apu declares.																								The creative urge, which was always there from his schooldays at Taki House, was stoked further when he first discovered the genius of Satyajit Ray as a graphic artist. Inspired by the masters sketches, he got involved in designing brochures and awareness stickers for animal welfare NGOs Compassionate Crusaders Trust (CCT) and People For Animals (PFA), with themes like sterilisation of stray dogs and the anti-urban zoo campaign. Visual campaigns for pesticide units in regional publications to raise awareness in rural belts proceeded side by side.																								A turning point came on July 17, 2001, when Governor Viren J. Shah inaugurated the website animalcrusader.org, designed and evolved by Apu. Today, it is among the top 10 Google sites in terms of hits registered, he proclaims.																								The portal traces the growth of CCT and PFA, with all relevant information on their activities and programmes like the rabies-control initiative, besides fact sheets on the animal shelter Karuna Kunj and the animal hospital Ashari.																								Apus design solution for the PCBs World Environment Day campaign poster focuses on vehicular pollution and depicts a child trapped in a choking traffic snarl at a congested junction, with the colour fading from the visage with the noxious fumes. The message in Bengali says: Let us take an oath to bring colour back into the childs life.																								Among other treasured milestones are the two floats he designed for the Republic Day parade, one for CCT on the law against performing animals in 1999 and the other for Webel in 2001 on e-governance.																								I would love to make an animation film using the old and livelier Disney technique, says Apu.

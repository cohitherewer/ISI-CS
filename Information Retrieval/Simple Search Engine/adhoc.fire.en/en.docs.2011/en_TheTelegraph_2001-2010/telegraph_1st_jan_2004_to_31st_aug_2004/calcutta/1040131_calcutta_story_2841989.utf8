 																											- Colleges in limbo after affiliation refusal by umbrella university  A STAFF REPORTER																								At a time when the state government is trying to lay greater emphasis on improving and expanding its homoeopathy colleges, the fate of post-graduate courses in two state-run homoeopathy colleges in Calcutta is uncertain.																								Mahesh Bhattacharjee Homoeopathy College and DN Dey Homoeopathy College cannot introduce post-graduate courses because the West Bengal University of Health Sciences (WBUHS) is refusing to grant affiliation to the states homoeopathy colleges. 																								Sources said some of the post-graduate courses  in homoeopathy medicine and paediatrics  are in great demand.																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, at public gatherings in Calcutta and elsewhere in recent months, has repeatedly spoken of the governments keenness to develop homoeopathy education and treatment facilities.																								The WBUHS has refused affiliation to the 13 homoeopathy colleges in the state, and its refusal has prompted the National Council of Homoeopathy (NCH) to block permission to the two institutions to launch their post-graduate courses. 																								An NCH inspection team had visited the two institutions and found their infrastructure suitable to run post-graduate courses. But it can only give the colleges its final nod after their affiliations are taken over by the WBUHS, explained Ramkrishna Ghosh Mondal, homoeopath and a member of the NCH.																								Ghosh Mondal said the state health department, which controls the two institutions, has already cleared the courses in the two colleges. The WBUHS Act makes it mandatory for all medical institutions in the state to come under its jurisdiction. All degree courses in allopathy, homoeopathy, ayurvedic medicine and nursing were to be taken over by the WBUHS after its formation.																								But so far, it has granted affiliation only to the allopathy and nursing colleges. The 13 homoeopathy colleges  five of them run by the central and state governments and the rest by non-government bodies  are still affiliated to the universities of Calcutta, Burdwan and North Bengal.																								M.M. Choudhury, WBUHS vice-chancellor, however, says the takeover of homoeopathy colleges is awaiting a final clearance from the state government. Preliminary reports indicate that the hospitals attached to the homoeopathy colleges do not have proper infrastructure. Once the hospitals are upgraded, affiliation should follow, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004  Calcutta Column
The number of people opting to travel in autorickshaws is on the rise as there is not much difference between bus and auto fares for short distances. In order to augment their revenue, autorickshaw drivers carry as many as six passengers at a time without paying heed to safety regulations. They also charge whimsical amounts, especially on days when buses are off the roads. They behave rudely with passengers who protest. Authorities must take measures to discipline autorickshaw drivers. Rimli Datta, Salt Lake. I found our local post office closed on April 3 without any intimation in writing, to inform the public about the reason of closure. Many customers, like myself, had to return disappointed. The postal authorities should put up a notice regarding the day of closure and the reason for the same outside the post office a few days in advance. This may also be announced in newspapers beforehand.Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road

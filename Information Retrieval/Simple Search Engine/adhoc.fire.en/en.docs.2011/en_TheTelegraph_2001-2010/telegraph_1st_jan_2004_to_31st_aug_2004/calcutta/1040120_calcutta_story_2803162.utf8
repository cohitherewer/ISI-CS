The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Clinics new entrants to power-pilfer club
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Its no longer the household or the para club that are tampering with meters or hooking electricity. A large number of private nursing homes, restaurants and hotels have become a major cause of worry for the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC).																								The power utility has stumbled upon the fact that several institutions of repute are pilfering power by using new techniques.																								Its no longer the conventional power-tapping. The thieves are now attaching thin wires to the poles and driving them underground. The wires are pulled out close to the building and then used to tap power, explained Santanu Chatterjee, executive director (corporate development), CESC. He told Metro on Monday: At first sight, it is impossible to detect the hooking, but with experience, our employees, too, are learning quickly.																								The CESC has now zeroed in on 200 nursing homes, hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, rolling mills and rubber factories that are pilfering power.																								Last month, the CESC had disconnected the supply lines of eight nursing homes and medical diagnostic centres for power theft. Only one has deposited Rs 3.25 lakh as pilferage charge.																								By moderate estimates, the CESC incurs an annual loss of Rs 100 crore for power pilferage, but with nursing homes and other institutions hooking on to the power theft bandwagon, the workload of CESCs loss control officials is becoming heavier.																								According to Chatterjee, who heads the CESC loss control cell, talks are underway with the government to intensify the vigil on the identified units. We have to be very careful when we disconnect the lines. Our officers are informed not to disconnect lines when a marriage is in progress or when an operation is underway at a nursing home. But we are now left with no choice but to disconnect their lines, he added.																								Last year, between April and December, the CESC disconnected over 10,746 meters, compared with only 845 between April 2002 and March 2003.																								CESC officials say most cases of power pilferage exist in places that are air-conditioned for customer comfort. In many places, a mechanic tampers with the meter to ensure that electricity bills do not shoot up because of the air-conditioner, they said.																								To put an end to the menace, the CESC has intensified its vigil and asked officials to run a check on suspected consumers. At the moment, CESC has over 18 lakh subscribers. Apart from Tiljala, Topsia and Garden Reach, large areas in south and north Calcutta, including Alipore, Cossipore, Chitpur and Howrah, have been identified as the pilferage zones.																								As part of its efforts to clamp down on power theft, the CESC also recently requested air-conditioner dealers to inform customers while selling their gadgets that strong meters are required to ensure proper power supply, and also the fact that electricity bills will shoot up once a machine is installed. However, the dealer response has been very negative, officials said.

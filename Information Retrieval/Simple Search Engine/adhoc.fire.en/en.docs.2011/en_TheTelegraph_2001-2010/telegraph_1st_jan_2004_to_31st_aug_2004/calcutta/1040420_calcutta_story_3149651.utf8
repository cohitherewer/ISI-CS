 The king at his oppressive best in a scene from Bolo Kya Banoge Tum. Picture by Aranya SenIts the tale of a king and his slave, but without a message. There is no black-and-white moral of the story, nor is there a definitive end. The point of this unique play is to make the audience think about ethics, values and the realities of life. Split into three episodes, with a discussion after each, the aim is to get people talking, often raising more questions than answers.				 				 																															Six members from Jana Natya Manch (Janam), a street theatre group from Delhi, were in Calcutta from April 15 to 17, performing Bolo Kya Banoge Tum, a Hindi play, in 15 Calcutta schools, as part of the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centres PeaceWorks project. The result was different points of view from students, with no right or wrong.				 				 																															In the first episode, the king punishes the slave for taking a mango from his garden, by burning down the entire garden, which the slave has created and tended. In part two, the childless king wishes a visiting fakir to bless him. But the fakir refuses, and visits the slave instead. Once again, the king punishes the slave. In the final episode, when a tantrik tells the king to sacrifice a girl child in order to get a son, he chooses the slaves daughter. And the slave gives in.				 				 																															The reason we chose this play is because discussion works very well, particularly with children. They have so many things to say, and their own experiences enrich their responses, explains Molyashree Hashmi of Janam. For instance, at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, although they couldnt always clearly express themselves, they all wanted to be the slave. Kaj korbo was their reason.				 				 																															While a tea-stall owners son from Future Hope identified with the oppression of the slave, another youngster said he wanted to be king because he was thin and small, and didnt want to get beaten up. The girls from St Teresas were very organised and articulate. And like most, they all sympathised with the slave but wanted to be king, adds Hashmi. In the case of the sacrifice, the under-privileged children arent very emotional about it, because many of them have been abandoned by their parents.				 				 																															Sometimes, I can literally feel the antagonism in waves from the silent audience of children, when I am beating the slave, says king Sudhanva Deshpande.				 				 																															The sense of duty, however, was very strong among the Calcutta students. One child felt the slave agreed to the sacrifice of his daughter since it was his dharma to obey the king. Others of St Xaviers College  watching with rapt attention in the heat of a shed on the school grounds  felt it was the slaves duty to follow his masters orders.				 				 																															Once a student told me he was afraid to answer a question, because then there would be more questions. Thats the point of this play. Although it is outside their realm of reality, the theme has a bearing on their lives. Like in St Xaviers, the conversation shifted to George Bush and the moral conflict of the US stand on Iraq. As one slum-child in Delhi told me, Raja kya jane mehenat kya hoti hai, sums up Hashmi.				 				 																
	 Chipping in				 				 																															Modern High School for Girls and the Ballygunge Society for Children in Pain (CHIP) joined hands to usher in the Bengali New Year on April 14 for the destitute youngsters of ward no. 55 in the Tangra-Dhapa area, where CHIP works.				 				 																															The two-storeyed CHIP House was bedecked in the colours of spring and the day began with Tagores Aamraa Sabai Raja, a chorus recital by CHIPs children. Newcomers to CHIP, an NGO that looks at the global environment of a child in pain, were introduced to the kind of work that it does, by founder-member Dr Chandra Shekhar Mukherjee, a neuro-psychiatrist.				 				 																															At the programme, Bappa Sardar, a budding artist from Tangra who creates works of art with cheap crayons, spoke on what life is like with CHIPs help. Sisters Tumpa and Rama Rana, who are a part of the computer club, also spoke about their hopes and dreams.				 				 																															Then, students from Modern High School for Girls handed over two cheques for health and education, which were accepted by Anu Adhikary on behalf of CHIP. Finally, a session was held with the parents of the children who are sponsored by CHIP, helping them understand how to make life better for their kids. Everybody chipped in to make the new year brighter for those who need a little bit of light.

A Telegraph file picture				 				 																															Breath of cheer				 				 																															This Bengali New Year, members of the Art of Living organisations youth band Mantra marked the occasion by spreading a bit of cheer amongst those less fortunate than themselves. They gave the children and women of the Harijan Kalyan Samity, from the slums in Garcha Road, Gariahat, a reason to smile.				 				 																															Satsang was a celebration of the New Year, as well as the birth anniversary of B.R. Ambedkar, from whom the NGO derives inspiration. The two-hour programme featured Amit Teriwal on the tabla, Shashank Jaiswal on the guitar and the voices of Akshay Murarka and Shraddha Patel. Everyone had an enjoyable day, as the band belted out its trademark popular bhajans as well as old Bollywood hits.				 				 																															Art of Living has been involved with the development of the Samity for the past four years and regularly conducts healing through breathing free of cost. The idea of such programmes is to get youth from privileged backgrounds to reach out to the underprivileged. 				 				 																															The morning also saw the young volunteers spend time with the in-house patients of their patron drug rehabilitation centre on Kona Expressway.

	 Cyber dreams				 				 																															The recent Foundation Day at Udayan, a residential school for children of leprosy patients in Barrackpore, was memorable for more reasons than one this year. For around 300 children aged between five and 19, a future with computers is no longer a distant dream.				 				 																															Apart from education and vocational training, the youngsters will be taught basic computer skills to arm them with technical skills required in todays world. In a tie-up, IT institute Aptech will provide courseware to students and teach the trainers of Udayan, besides monitoring the classes regularly. Courses will be delivered in four levels, employing the laddered approach in learning.				 				 																															This means a lot to us, and its a big step for Udayan, says Father Stevens. Udayan, patronised by former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh, provides free food, medicine and education to children in Bengali and Hindi, to give them self-confidence and the skills to make a living. 				 				 																															We believe that technology has the power to bridge cultural and social chasms prevalent in society, says Pramod Khera, CEO and MD, Aptech Limited. As part of its corporate social responsibility programme, Aptech has previously worked with other NGOs and Rotary Clubs, through community IT literacy projects.

Also, at 16, she was in Class XII, not Class X.

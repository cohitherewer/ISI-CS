 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Postmans bail order set aside
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday set aside an anticipatory bail order, granted by Alipore court, to a postman who was fearing arrest in connection with the alleged defalcation of public funds. 																								The high court directed the petitioner, a Group-D staffer of Cossipore Head Post Office, to surrender immediately before the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court at Sealdah.																								Postman Ramesh Ram was allegedly involved in the defalcation of Rs 5.29 lakh. 																								For some time, postal department officers had kept tabs on the peon, who behaved suspiciously. On August 8, 2002, the senior postal officer of the North Calcutta division lodged an FIR against Ram with Cossipore police station, complaining that he had failed to submit certain funds taken as deposits from subscribers of different government policies at the post office.																								Thereafter, Ram moved an anticipatory bail petition in the Alipore sessions judges court. 																								As the public prosecutor did not oppose his bail prayer, the judge granted his plea for anticipatory bail. 																								The state government moved an appeal before the high court against the order of the trial court to facilitate investigation into the alleged defalcation of public money. Then, the division bench rejected the petitioners anticipatory bail prayer and directed him to surrender.

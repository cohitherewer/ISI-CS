Pet Passion Nelanjana BhowmickIn case you missed it last Sunday, we were delving into the aggression in animal behaviour, the grumble behind the growl. Heres to understanding our pet tantrums betterFear-motivated: This is a defence mechanism that comes into play when a dog believes he is in danger of being harmed. Its your dogs perception of the situation, not your intent that determines his reaction.Redirected aggression: This happens when a dog is provoked or attacked by a person or another animal and he is unable to hit back. He then redirects his aggression to someone else. Case in point: Stray dogs chasing cars.It is important to identify the exact circumstances that result in your dogs aggressive behaviour before working out a therapy for it. Here are some holistic remedies: Aroma therapy: The use of aroma oils to calm the nerves.Touch therapy: Aggressive dogs grow calmer when you trace circles with your fingertips on their ears, mouth, tail or stroke them gently from head to tail for a few minutes everyday.Put him at ease: Dogs are extremely intuitive. They can tell when you are upset. And their concern may come out as aggressive behaviour. Try saying this aloud to him: Im upset, but its not your fault. It works.Workout: Some pets get aggressive because they have too much energy and not much to do. Go for long walks and jogs, and play ball.

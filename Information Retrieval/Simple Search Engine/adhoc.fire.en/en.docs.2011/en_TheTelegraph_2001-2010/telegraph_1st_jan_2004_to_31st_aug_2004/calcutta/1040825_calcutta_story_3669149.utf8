Tip to ToeFrom mother of pearl to feather, glass to thread, antique to futuristic earrings in various materials and shapes are doing the rounds of malls around town. Himika Chaudhuri checks out the danglers and the loopsNow there is more reason for you to smile from ear to ear. The snazzy and decidedly sexy collection of fashionable earrings dotting malls across town could give enough reason for veteran cricket commentator Henry Blofeld to camp in Calcutta and keep commenting on the exciting options available to the splendid women of the city  in terms of earrings, that is.Indeed, from mother of pearl to feather, from glass to thread, women here could find themselves spoilt for choice when they decide to play it by the ear.The perfect formula to incorporate a dash of funk, attitude and style to what you wear, these earrings are just right for those who can carry them off without a care in the world.The styles in the earring segment change very fast and even before one has comfortably set in, a new range comes into the market, observes a spokesperson for Space in Metro Plaza, which stocks the latest trends in fashion jewellery from Hong Kong and Thailand.So, while you could still be boasting about that fascinating collection of chandelier earrings that you possess, it is probably time to stuff them deep into your locker and wait for the style to bounce back to pull them out. Chandeliers have all but made way for the antique-look studs with drops and the copper earrings that are now ruling the roost.We are selling our last stock of chandelier earrings; the newer imports are already here, reveals a spokesperson for Mohabbatein, another fashion jewellery store in Metro Plaza that not only imports from Southeast Asia but also manufactures some really innovative pieces with coloured cotton thread. Some styles, however, are here to stay. We are still sold out as far as silver-loop earrings go, even though these had come into fashion a long time ago, admits a spokesperson for Elegant in Vardaan market.Double bubbleThe hottest thing right now is possibly the double-earring that is almost six inches long. With two distinct parts to it, this earring has a metal J-curve that goes behind the ear and a bunch of danglers attached to it that gives it the dressy look. The danglers are in various colours, but the common ones now are metallic blue, pink and silver. These are suitable both for when you really dress it up and for times when the earring is all the embellishment you have on you.e the double-earring can be the showpiece for the ear, a small diamond stud on the lobe will only add to the effect. The latest import from Hong Kong, these earrings are priced at Rs 150 a pair and are available at Space in Metro Plaza.Copper crazeChic and stylish, various shapes in copper are in. From dainty danglers to divine drops, there is a lot that you can choose from. Also a new addition to the citys shopping malls, these earrings are right for the formal look and promise to go well with an office suit or a range of salwar kurtas in pastel shades. Priced between Rs 25 (for the tiny ones) and Rs 150, this range is available at both Space and Mohabbatein.Antique auraThe essentially ethnic fare that can be worn only with heavy saris and dressy outfits. Strictly prescribed for the evenings, these studs in metal set with semi-precious stones come in various shades  from ink blue to soft pink (you are likely to get something to go with all your expensive saris). The design on the metal is intricate with the handwork reminiscent of the olden days and Mughal artwork. The cost of the semi-precious stones catapult the prices to a cool Rs 250 for a pair. These are available in both Metro Plaza and Vardaan.Feather fareThese lightweight and soft danglers are just right for the minimalistic look with a chic evening gown. Available in black, brown, pink and blue, these earrings come for Rs 100 a pair and are available in Space.Class giftThe college kid could do well with these. Apples, bananas, grapes and peas are among the choice of fruits and vegetables that you could hang from your ears. The bright colours and shapes give the pieces a novel look, which is why you could shell out Rs 100 for one.In the loopJust like most things classy, silver-loop earrings are still in and doing brisk business. From tiny two centimetre diameter ones to those with 10 centimetre diameter, the loop gets as large as you want it to be. These are available in all shopping plazas across the city.

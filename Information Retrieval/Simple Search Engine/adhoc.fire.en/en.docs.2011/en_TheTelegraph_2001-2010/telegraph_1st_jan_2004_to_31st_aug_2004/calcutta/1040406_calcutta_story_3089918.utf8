 																											- SSKM stymied: Staff few and unwilling to take on extra work  A STAFF REPORTER																								This is one hospital that never ceases to surprise people. 																								After a string of deaths due to alleged negligence at state-run SSKM Hospital, a fact-finding team from the health department has learnt for itself the bitter truth  that work culture has reached an all-time low in the healthcare institute.																								Inquiries have revealed that many units, including a round-the-clock malaria detection centre in the hospital, do not function after dark  because of indisciplined staff, more than anything else.																								Two months ago, the government had opened with great fanfare the first 24-hour malaria detection centre in the hospital. 																								The clinic was to cater to the common people, throughout the week for 24 hours, and give results promptly, so that patients could get timely medication.																								But, within a very short time, the situation changed dramatically, and several patients who rushed to the malaria detection centre were turned back after dark. Some of them lodged complaints with the health department, prompting an inquiry by the government. 																								An internal probe revealed that limited manpower and unwillingness by the existing staff to take on extra workload lay behind the refusals.																								Next, the government wanted to try and see if the ultrasound facilities in the hospital could be extended to Sundays as well. 																								We want to keep the ultrasound facilities open even on Sundays for the benefit of a larger number of people, said a senior health department official. 																								At the moment, the unit shuts down on Saturday afternoon and efforts by the SSKM authorities to keep it open on Sundays have all but failed. 																								Despite the odds, we have concrete plans to provide this facility to the public on Sundays, too. We have to think about patients on Sundays also, not only on weekdays, said Santanu Tripathi, SSKM superintendent.																								Hoping that differences will be sorted out soon, the government last week decided to start an emergency 24-hour ENT facility in the hospital. 																								But that, too, has run into rough weather, as the cardio-thoracic department, which was to supply the bronchoscope machine when it does not have any scheduled operation, has decided against it. 																								In the absence of a proper emergency set-up, most ENT patients are referred to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital and other places. The SSKM superintendent has called a meeting of both departments on Tuesday to try and sort out the problems before it reaches Swasthya Bhavan.

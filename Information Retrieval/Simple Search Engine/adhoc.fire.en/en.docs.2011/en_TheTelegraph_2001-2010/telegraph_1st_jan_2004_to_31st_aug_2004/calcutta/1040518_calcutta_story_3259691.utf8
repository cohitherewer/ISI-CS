 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A Calcutta High Court judge on Monday empowered the special officer appointed by it to break open the lock of the strongroom of Thakurbari, in Jorasanko  if necessary, with help from the police  and make an inventory of the articles kept there.																								The court order followed a petition by the Rabindra Bharati Society, which feared that articles and mementoes of Rabindranath Tagore, kept for a long time in Thakurbari, the poets ancestral home, may be missing.

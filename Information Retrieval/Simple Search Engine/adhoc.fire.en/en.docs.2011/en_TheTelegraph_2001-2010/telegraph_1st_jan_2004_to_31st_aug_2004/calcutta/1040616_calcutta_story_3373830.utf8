 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Swifter and higher lies the route forward
 SWATI SENGUPTA																								Calcutta traffic, believe it or not, is beginning to fly high. If a survey conducted by the state transport department is anything to go by, the city has shifted gears and hit the fast track.																								A survey  conducted this March by the transportation planning and traffic directorate, under the state transport department  shows the number of vehicles taking the AJC Bose Road and Gariahat flyovers growing beyond expectations and the movement under the flyovers picking up pace, too.																								The earlier study was carried out in 1999. The rise in the number of vehicles taking the flyover route is all too evident (see chart).																								The transport department, during a survey in 1999, had estimated the number of cars that would take the high roads once they were completed.																								The survey took into account that the rise in vehicle count per year would be two to three per cent. But since the flyovers have become functional, the transport department has observed that the number of vehicles is more than estimated.																								That is because people are getting attracted to the flyovers by the comfortable drive they offer, as compared to the other parts of the city. So, those who would avoid these routes before the flyovers were constructed also seem to be using them now, explained B.K. Sadhu, chief traffic and transportation engineer, transport department.																								According to the report submitted by the transport department to principal secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, if moving along the 2.2-km stretch below the AJC Bose Road flyover took 30 minutes before the work was taken up, it now takes only three minutes to zoom from Park Circus to the Race Course.																								Similarly, it takes far less time now to traverse the stretch of the Gariahat flyover. If would earlier take eight to 10 minutes, on an average, to move between Ballygunge Phari and Gol Park. The same distance can now be covered in four to five minutes, without taking the flyover. Taking the flyover ensures an even swifter passage 1 minute and 45 seconds from the Pantaloons store end to Gol Park.																								With several business meetings being held at ITC Sonar Bangla and Hyatt or at Taj Bengal in Alipore, the AJC Bose Road flyover has helped us a great deal. We can reach the destinations faster and better, said Sanjay Budhia, former chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), eastern region.																								Swifter and higher is, after all, the way forward.

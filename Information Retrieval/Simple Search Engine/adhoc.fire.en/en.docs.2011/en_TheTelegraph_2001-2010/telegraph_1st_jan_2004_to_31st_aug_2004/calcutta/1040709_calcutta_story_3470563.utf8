The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 09, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Automobile designers worldwide work overtime to design low and blunt attachments to car bonnets. Such accessories minimise the extent of injury to a person if he is hit by the car. World Health Organisation, in a recently published document entitled World report on road traffic injury prevention, 2004 emphasised on this point. It has already become legislation in the European Union. In sad contrast, car owners in Calcutta merrily add fancy but dangerous metal fixtures to the front portion of their cars. How long will it take for the law-makers and enforcers to see reason? Tapan Pal, Batanagar. 
	The Lake Gardens railway crossing gate is closed upto 10 to 15 minutes before the arrival of the train whereas at other busy crossings, like Bondel Gate and Brace Bridge, the gate is closed for just a couple of minutes. The railway authorities should either construct an overbridge or else reduce the time for which the gate is kept closed.Jagdish Kumar, Chittaranjan Avenue

 Thursday, March 04, 2004 Life- A Thought for FoodA taste of spring 
 SHOVONA MUKHERJIPoodina Kaju Kebabs and (top) Anaar Paapri Chaat  two delicious recipes to enjoy this Holi Pix courtesy: The Park 																								Holi, a carnival of colour, represents spring. The festival Holi gets its name from Holika and the legend of Prahalada, the son of Hiranyakashipu. Drunk with power, the diabolic king Hiranyakashipu forced his people to worship him. But his son Prahalada staunchly claimed that Vishnu was supreme. To get rid of the rebel, Hiranyakashipu plotted with his sister, Holika. She enjoyed the boon that fire would not burn her. She sat on a pile of wood with Prahalada on her lap. The pile was lit. When the flames died down, it was found that Prahlada had remained unscathed while Holika had been reduced to ashes. She had forgotten that fire would not burn her only if she sat alone in it.																								The bonfires made on the eve of Holi symbolise the burning of Holika and the colour throwing the next day stands for the triumph of good over evil. Of course, Holi also celebrates the frolics of Krishna with the cowherd boys and maids in Brindavan, as is evident from the very lively Holi songs.																								Though basically a north-Indian festival, Holi has overcome its narrow confines and now belongs to all Indians. It is the perfect day for friends and family members to come together and indulge in some sumptuous food. The food served during Holi is traditionally vegetarian. Along with the much-famed Thandai, a variety of snacks and sweets are served.

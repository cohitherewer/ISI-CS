The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Fun classes for the real you
 NISHA LAHIRI																								Theory without practice will wither and die A preconceived notion is like a tape-recorder playing in your head, it doesnt give you power Wisdom is the ability to share appropriately, dont caste pearls before swine Pause before you make a commitment, learn to say no																								It was a classroom with students of all ages, from the teenager to the 30-something, recapping what they had learnt in the past week at the personality development workshop, organised by Jyotirmai Club, on Garcha Road. Most had signed up without knowing what it was all about. Some thought they would learn etiquette, others assumed it would be a career-counselling course, and a few had no idea.																								By Thursday evening, however, they had nothing but words of praise for each other and gratitude for teacher Shikha Rai Sapru. The Calcutta girl, now based in Guwahati, has been conducting these workshops in both cities since 1990, for school students and aspiring models.																								I have been trained in fashion choreography, interior decoration, event management, theatre and spirituality, all of which I have combined to structure this course, says Shikha. 																								So, through activities such as theatre techniques to get rid of inhibitions, music, dance, flower and essential oils therapy, chanting Om, meditation and other motley group projects, she helps participants transform from caterpillars to butterflies.																								The breakthroughs within this group came in communication skills and relationships, because they all created their own space  enough to be comfortable while sharing their feelings, without the fear of being judged, explains Sikha. And if what they had to say about the workshop is anything to go by, they picked up plenty of tips.																								I used to be late. I have learnt to be punctual, and my mother says I have become more affectionate since the course began. The best part was learning to light a candle and getting over my fear of fire, says Aditi, a participant. Kavish, another, admits he enrolled for the workshop because of the girls, but he now has more confidence than he could have hoped for. 																								As has his friend Nitesh, an under-graduate student in a California university. We had to make presentations almost daily, and I used to be very nervous. Now I can look people in the eye when I talk to them, he feels. Confidence made all the difference.																								Leadership qualities to the importance of trust  it was all part of the training, to help understand ones own potential. The power of keeping ones word, the ability to laugh at oneself and the advantages of leading a team  all that and more were part of Shikhas workshop. 																								But before the parents and relatives joined in to find out what had transpired during the week, Neha, a young participant, piped up with a question: Is it okay to expect someone to love you back when you love them? Shikhas answer was brutal, but honest: Its not an appropriate response to expect something in return. It amounts to emotional manipulation. Class over.

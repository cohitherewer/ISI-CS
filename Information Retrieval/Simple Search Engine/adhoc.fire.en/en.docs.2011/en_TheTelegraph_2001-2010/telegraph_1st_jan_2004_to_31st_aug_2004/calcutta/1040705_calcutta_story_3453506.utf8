 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Oil pump burgled twice in 2 months
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fuel Point, a pump at 46, Shanti Pally, opposite Ruby General Hospital, in the Kasba police station area, was burgled early on Sunday for the second time in two months and the fourth time since 2002. 																								At 5.05 am, a yellow taxi entered the pump with six men inside. Four of them, all armed, got off and within 15 minutes, cleaned out cash to the tune of Rs 3.02 lakh and drove away in the direction of the police station, said manager P. K. Mishra. Three members of our staff were seriously injured, he added. 																								As the taxi was speeding out of the pump, a staff member managed to catch a glimpse of the number-plate. He fell short of two digits, but disclosed the number as WB-- 1977.																								Two employees and a security guard were present in the pump when the burglars struck. Rajeev Thakur, 21, was tending to the only open point of the four in the pump, when the taxi arrived. Rajeev asked the driver to get into the correct lane, and was surprised when the car stopped midway and the four miscreants got off. Three toted revolvers, the fourth a chopper. 																								Guard Bimal Bhowmik, 55, ran up and was attacked from behind. The burglar with the chopper struck Bhowmiks lower back with the butt of the weapon, rendering him unconscious. 																								The gunmen turned to Rajeev. After dealing him a blow on the head with a revolver butt, they proceeded to empty the cash box, containing mostly small change at that time. 																								Rajeev was then taken into the managers office at gunpoint. Mahendra Gupta, the other employee, was turned upon. Blows were rained on him. Mahendra suffered a deep head injury and lost a number of teeth. 																								The gang of four proceeded to snap the telephone lines, ransack the office and break into the cash box, which yielded about Rs 50,000. The burglars then headed for an inside room, where the main safe is located. 																								They woke up employee Gagan Thakur, made him unlock the safe, and after emptying out all the cash, leapt into the waiting taxi and sped away.

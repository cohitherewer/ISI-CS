 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Life term plea sent back to governor
 R.VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI																								The Supreme Court on Friday referred back to the governor of West Bengal the pardon plea of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, handed the death sentence for the rape and murder of a schoolgirl in a Calcutta highrise 16 years ago. Chatterjee was a security guard of the apartment block.																								A division bench of Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice B.N. Srikrishna said the governor should consider afresh Chatterjees petition for pardon and whether his death penalty could be reduced to a life term.																								Chatterjees death sentence has not been executed for 13 years now. His appeal says the 13-year delay in executing the death sentence should be taken into account for his release from jail without capital punishment.																								Senior counsel A.K. Ganguly contended that after 13 years of non-execution of the sentence, the petitioner deserves to seek remission of his sentence. Chatterjees advocate on record, Chanchal Ganguly, said: The inordinate delay in the execution of the sentence... merits commutation of sentence of death into one of imprisonment for life. 																								The apex court judgment said that if the governor decided to grant pardon to Chatterjee under the Constitution and convert the death sentence into a life term, the 13 years should not be taken into account. This means if granted pardon, Chatterjee will have to undergo another 14 years imprisonment.																								Each days delay in the execution of the death sentence has caused the petitioner (Chatterjee) a great deal of anxiety, anguish and agony, advocate Ganguly contended, while pleading for commutation of the death sentence into life imprisonment. 																								Now, the West Bengal governor will have to consider Chatterjees mercy petition afresh.

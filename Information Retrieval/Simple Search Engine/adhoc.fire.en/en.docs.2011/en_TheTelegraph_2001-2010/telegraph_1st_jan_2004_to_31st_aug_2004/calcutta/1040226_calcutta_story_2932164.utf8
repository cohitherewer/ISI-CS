 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 New cell to monitor solid waste disposal
 JAYANTA BASU																								The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has created a new department  the solid waste management, sewerage and drainage sector  during its last board meeting earlier this month.																								Four solid waste management projects, calling for investment of around Rs 20 crore, were cleared at that meeting, said state urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, also chairman of the CMDA. Solid waste management is a priority area now for the urban authorities, said Bhattacharya, and the new sector will help the CMDA work in a more comprehensive manner.																								The creation of the sector  or the re-christening of the old sewerage and drainage sector  will help the CMDA look after and coordinate state and externally-funded solid waste management projects, said chief executive officer, CMDA, Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 																								We have been exploring the possibilities of getting funds and other support from the central government and international agencies, added Bhattacharya.																								The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has already sponsored a feasibility study and a concept paper on solid waste management in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. Once approved, a detailed project report may follow, with the concurrence of the central government. Once the project report is cleared, the JBIC is expected to provide financial support in the form of soft loans, for which the state has to go through the Centre.																								Japanese experts have been working on the problems faced in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area and in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area for over a year. They have already submitted their draft proposals, said Tapas Ghatak, of CMDA environment cell, who has been coordinating with the Japanese team.																								The JBIC recently presented their findings to the state finance and urban development ministers and mayor Subrata Mukherjee. Three models of solid waste management have been currently attempted within the CMA. The first is the Bhadreswar model, where the waste is segregated at the source with a high degree of public participation and then disposed of within the municipality boundaries. 																								In the second model, as in North Barrackpore and North Dum Dum, two municipalities share land for disposal. This project has been co-funded by the central pollution control board and state government. However, the third model is the most modern, where a number of municipalities share the same disposal site.																								The shared model has been conceived for the six west bank municipalities of Baidyabati, Champdani, Rishra, Konnagar, Uttarpara and Serampore, in the Dirghangi mouza of Baidyabati, said a CMDA official.																								We are also trying to utilise funds available for solid waste management under the Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor (CUSP) project, said Bhattacharya, who added that the Planning Commission has not shown adequate interest in supporting a comprehensive urban solid waste management project, though it had agreed, in principal, that there was a need for one.

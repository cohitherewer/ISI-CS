Abhishek GhoshBest man...Is something he knows how to be, from man of the meet awards at school and college fests to best actor, singer and more. Abhishek has plenty of prizes under his belt. This 21-year-old mass communications graduate of St Xaviers has had his degree film, The End  declared the best of the batch  selected for a student film festival in Nandan this month. Having topped the university, he is now looking to win an Academy Award.Sweet success...Chhotu has had with bands, on the keyboard and as lead vocalist, since school. With Circle, he performed in JU, Someplace Else, MusicWorld and at other events. Rizzyrkonium was a launchpad for original music. Of five compositions, one was number seven in Australian charts through www.mp3.com. Now hes in Zero In, a Bangla metal band. Was also music director for ad films and directed and acted in a Lakkhichhara video.Amateur actor...The ex-DBPC student might be, but its something Gulda (to friends) is good at. School stage, Bhopal gas tragedy, Caesar, I am Hamlet and a Bangla natak competition... hes been there, done that. Although hes continued with acting, appearing in four College degree films, editing and directing are his calling, Abhishek asserts. And hes currently in charge of post-production in the ad production company he works for. That was after the bosses liked his work enough during an internship in the first year. Juggling work with everything else for two years he managed smoothly. It comes naturally to this scorpio.Passion and profession...Are two separate entities for Abhishek. Music is a passion, but not a profession. The film industry is where he wants his career to be. Next step in that direction is admission into FTII. Quizzing, debating, winning umpteen awards in western music from childhood... just practice to gear up for the ultimate prize  an Oscar. With his eye trained on the target, hes going great guns towards his goal. And till it happens, keep trying is the motto.

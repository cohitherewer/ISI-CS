 							 - Rattled NRS sets up probe committee A STAFF REPORTER																								The state-run Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital was sucked into yet another controversy on Monday, this time over alleged negligence leading to death. 																								Twelve-year-old Rekha Das died early on Monday at NRS, barely two-and-a-half hours after her family was given the assurance that there was no need to get her admitted if she were administered the medicines prescribed. 																								The victims father, Sunil Das, of 46/2, Barowaritolla Road, in Beleghata, has lodged a complaint with the hospital authorities claiming that his daughters life could have been saved if she were admitted to hospital late on Sunday. 																								Rattled, the authorities have set up an inquiry committee to probe the incident.																								Rekha was running a high temperature, with swollen legs and arms, and complaining of severe pain. 																								Not sure where to go, Rekhas parents and neighbours rushed her to the nearest state hospital, NRS, around 9.30 pm on Sunday.																								At the emergency outdoor, the medical officer on duty checked Rekha and referred her to the female medicine ward on the third floor of the UNB building. 																								The girl was placed on a trolley and rushed to the medicine ward, where doctors on duty went through her case history. The doctors then asked Rekhas parents to take her away and administer the prescribed medicines. 																								They assured her parents and those who accompanied her that Rekhas condition was not serious enough to demand admission. 																								Back home, Rekha was put on the drugs that the doctors had prescribed. The girls condition started deteriorating. After an hour, blood started oozing out of her nose. She started sinking. 																								Around 12.20 am, not sure whether to continue with the medicine or seek medical help, her parents returned to the hospital, with Rekha gasping for life. This time, she was immediately referred to the medicine ward. But even before she could be treated, she died.																								The hospital authorities, caught on the wrong foot, have started an inquiry to find the senior medical officer who was on duty when Rekha was first brought to the female medicine ward. 																								Since the senior medical officer decides on admission, it is imperative for us to know who was on duty. The interns or the post-graduate trainees cannot be held directly responsible, said Dilip Jha, deputy superintendent of the hospital. 																								What has made matters difficult for the hospital is that the patients ticket and number are missing. Rekhas parents claim the ticket was taken away by the doctors when they first turned up. 																								The authorities, on their part, claim that without the ticket it is difficult to identify the signature of the doctor concerned. 																								The inquiry committee, besides identifying the doctor who was on duty at night, will also check Rekhas prescription to find out what drug was prescribed. 																								The committee would like to know what were the exact clinical manifestations of the girl that had prompted the doctors to decide that she was not a fit case for admission and, instead, prescribe a drug that may have caused the bleeding from her nostrils.

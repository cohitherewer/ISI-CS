 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Songkran special
 Some Baan Thai festive dishes. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Here is another excuse to feel festive: it is Thai New Year! Baan Thai, the Thai speciality restaurant at The Oberoi Grand, is stirring up a perfect summer treat, infused with fresh, palate-cleansing tangy flavours. 																								New Year, or Songkran  celebrated over three days in April  usually brings with it a rich array of seasonal dishes. So the restaurant has put together an extensive festival menu (which started on Friday and is on till May 2) to incorporate as many choices as possible.																								A few staple items remain in the a la carte menu, but the rest are dishes special to this time of year, explains chef George K. George.																								With mangoes coming on to the market, they feature in the Yam mamuang, kai sod, a raw mango salad with chicken and cashews. This is a refreshing start to the meal. Kaeng jued sapparod phak rue kai rue moo  Thai clear soup with pineapple  is a mild soothing blend in a light broth.																								From the curry section, a delicious vegetarian option is the Penaeng phak ruam mit kib nay kaeng  a red curry of vegetables with homemade cottage cheese, sweet basil, crushed peanuts and fresh chilli.																								The selection of stir fries is elaborate. Leading the list is the deep fried prawns with a garlic and tamarind sauce, or Koong thod som makhampiak. You cant go wrong with the Kai takrai  a traditional Thai favourite  of chicken simmered with lemon grass and spices.																								Go easy with a staple of steamed rice, and you are set for the day.																								The heritage hotel also has a number of exciting dining options coming up over the next few weeks  a Thai thali, a high-tea evening menu at La Terrasse and proper British pub-style food, like Shepherds Pie, at The Chowringhee Bar.

  Rage uncorked: A demonstration against  the liquor policy Apropos the horrifying story From the fairways, hungry fangs and fatal forays (Dec. 15), I am a resident of Golf Club Road since 1978 and have worked on wildlife. The jackal population is resident to Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) and Tolly Club through generations. In the past 25 years, such incidents have never taken place. Often I have seen jackals coming out in the residential areas fringing RCGC at night. They were there before the management trouble broke out; they will be there if they do not get mercilessly killed by mindless citizens.  Granted, some people have been bitten by jackals in the past two months. At least one person died, possibly due to rabies or tetanus. It could be a single jackal affected with rabies. As claimed by some residents (among whom one was bitten), this particular jackal has been killed. No fresh incident of jackal-bite has taken place. During this period, at least one major tournament has been played safely at RCGC. Rabies is quite common in the canine family. Even street dogs acquire rabies. Do we think of killing all dogs because some day they might spread the disease? It will be unjust and anti-conservation to think of exterminating the entire population of RCGC jackals. Certain steps can deal with the situation: Find out the people bitten by the jackal(s) in November and check whether they have completed the course of vaccine; find out whether fresh cases are being reported. If not, we can forget about the hungry jackals. In case of fresh bites, the particular jackal should be spotted and captured; keep a watch on the pariah dog population in the area. It is the duty of every citizen to conserve these truly wild urban animals.  Heerak Nandy, 
 Golf Club Road.  The fracas created by the Opposition against the increasing number of off-shops (Fiery protest over off-shops, Dec. 10) is meaningless. The policy of issuing one licence per 12,000 population is risky not on the ground of more people becoming addicted but on the question of viability of the shops. The government is bound to abide by the legal requirements in regard to proximity to educational institutions, places of worship and healthcare establishments. Rather such licences should be given only to unemployed youth to sustain their families.  Santosh Chakravarty,
 Unique Park.  It is a shame that a peoples  government is planning to boost revenue by issuing licences  for liquor shops. Will it not lead frustrated unemployed  youth to take to the bottle? Why not set up new industries  instead to earn revenue? Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  Mayor Subrata Mukherjees call to all councillors for beautification of vacant plots in respective wards is praiseworthy (City Diary, Dec. 8). But who will listen to the mayors call? Not the Opposition councillors surely. Let the mayor implement his own decision.  Chandan Ray,
 Sarsuna. At last the Calcutta Police has woken up to the problem of traffic snarls (Spot-fine replay to stop jaywalkers, Dec. 6). But will there be proper signals and markings? Even if there are signals, hardly any time is given to allow people to cross. They have to sprint. A few pedestrians are going to be penalised in the process as there is no organised association to support them. This attempt is also going to flop like the earlier attempts.  S.K. Ray,
 Address not given.  It is heartening to learn that  the city police will reintroduce spot fines to teach jaywalkers  road rules. Given the number of accidents escalating in  and around the city, the proposed fine would surely work. Prahlad Agarwala,
 Nadia  The report Ban sought on dubious Chhattisgarh varsities (Dec. 9) brought to focus the condition of the private universities in the city. These people are here to cash in on the faith of students. Its the governments duty to check the mushrooming of such institutions.  Kunal Ray,
 Santragachhi.  The article Forget it, thats the route to dementia was interesting (Dec. 10). My 91-year-old mother has this problem, but at times she speaks of incidents which happened almost 50 years ago! Please publish more such articles.  S. Basu,
 Address not given.

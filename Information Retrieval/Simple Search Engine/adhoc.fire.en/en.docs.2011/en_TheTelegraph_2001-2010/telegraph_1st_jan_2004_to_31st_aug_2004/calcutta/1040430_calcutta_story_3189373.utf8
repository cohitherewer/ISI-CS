The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Behind hospitality, the responsibility
 SUBHRO SAHA																								Water-saving taps and showers, energy-conservation lamps, solid-waste management and recycling of garbage, rainwater harvesting. A room for the physically challenged, ramps with anti-slip floors and handrails, wheelchair-access with suitable table to at least one multi-cuisine restaurant																								Star hotels are not just about luxury living and expansive fine dining. Beneath the marble-and-glass veneer, a lot of work has to go on to satisfy these lesser-known parameters, which must also be met to stay in the elite league and qualify for reclassification by the department of tourism, government of India (see chart).																								From discouraging the use of plastic to efforts towards rainwater harvesting, non-CFC refrigeration and air-conditioning to ensuring special low-height urinals in public restrooms for the physically challenged and audible and visible fire and emergency alarms the evolved star checklist carries much more than meets the eye.																								And right from the grand old lady of Chowringhee to the newest player on the Bypass, all five-star deluxe hotels in the city are ready to walk that extra mile. We were the first hotel in Calcutta to have pre-designated rooms for the physically-challenged and as a group, are totally focused on the needs of society at large, says Amitabh Rai, general manager, Oberoi Grand.																								Eco-friendly measures and special facilities for the physically-challenged are equally important at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers. We have a special flue-gas scrubber, which filters pollutants before the air goes out into the environment from our property. Water from the effluent-treatment plant is recycled and goes into horticulture, landscaping and flushing, reveals Ranvir Bhandari, general manager.																								The ITC Group hotel on the Bypass, which recently received its maiden classification norm, also boasts microbiologists working in a sophisticated lab to check contamination in ambient air and water, besides the food cooked and served on the premises.																								This germ-check initiative was kicked off by Taj Bengal on its Belvedere Road premises four years ago. We need to meet demanding standards, and as part of the environment-friendly Tata Group, there are efforts and processes like the state-of-the-art water-treatment plant with the latest reverse osmosis technology, says Taj Bengal general manager Sanjay Sethi.																								At The Park, which has been reclassified as a five-star deluxe hotel, energy-efficiency, water management, effluent treatment and facilities for the physically challenged are prioritised. Says S.H. Rehman, regional director, sales amp; marketing: As we look into the future, hotels must show concern to sustainable development, respect for ecology, community and people. Our efforts in environment management and energy conservation is part of this method.																								Optimisation of power usage is also top on the Hyatt Regencys agenda. Hence, special energy-efficient metal halide lamps and a bank of computers in the cockpit control room to detect malfunctioning and an intelligent timer-controlled illumination system, which responds to the intensity of sunlight. 																								These devices help us save nearly 75 per cent of our energy bills, observes Arun Tandon, corporate head, technical services.

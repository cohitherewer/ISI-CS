The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Inept planning makes a mockery of border-blur film show 
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								The idea of having a panel discussion before the screening of Matir Moina (The Clay Bird) at Gorky Sadan last week was bad enough. The chosen subject, All Fiction Films are Documentaries of Their Time, was arguably even worse and more suited to a different time and place. 																								The discussion, therefore, despite the presence of Samik Bandopadhyay and Ashok Vishwanathan, meandered pointlessly out of control. Mercifully, it was brief. The only significant contribution was made by the films director, Tareq Masud from Bangladesh, who provided the context, background and the fallout of the film.																								But undeterred by the disastrous discussion, organisers committed one more faux pas by announcing that Masud would reply to questions from the audience at the end of the screening. In the event, not a single question was asked, although more than one film critic was present in the auditorium. 																								It became embarrassing as the audience shuffled to the exits while organisers pleaded that they stay back and, well, ask questions. It was embarrassing for Masud as well, who stood holding a microphone on the stage and smiled helplessly at the audience staring silently back at him. Poor planning had once again spoilt an otherwise extraordinary experience.																								The silence, though disconcertingly rude, wasnt because the audience did not like the film. On the contrary, the film is so well crafted that it possibly cast a spell from which the audience took time to come out. Eisenstein Cine Club amp; Drik India do deserve thanks  not just from film buffs but from others too  for allowing a select audience to watch this extraordinary docu-feature involving a madarsa and a family in rural Bangladesh in the backdrop of 1971.																								Extending to just about one-and-a-half hours, the film won an award at Cannes in 2002 but was banned in Bangladesh till recently. Ironically, while Bangladesh has lifted the ban and the film is being screened for the past four months in commercial cinema halls in Dhaka, it has not been possible to allow commercial screening of this film in India so far. The Indian film industry surely cannot be so insecure so as to oppose the screening of films from neighbouring countries.																								The haunting music for Masuds film has in fact been provided by Calcuttas very own Moushumi Bhowmik, who, surprisingly, has not received the kind of recognition here that she so richly deserves. Those who have listened to her two albums would vouch for her stupendous talent and range. But possibly because she spends a lot of time in London, where her husband works for the BBC, or partly because she would not agree to market her talent, she still remains largely unrecognised here. A city that takes pride in chiselling musical talent should surely have been able to utilise her talents better.																								Masud also acknowledged the contribution made by a cinematographer from the citymaking it a kind of Indo-Bangladeshi joint production. If only the city had at least one cinema hall devoted to screening, for simplicitys sake, only award-winning films from abroad for two weeks at a time, it will not only provide a learning experience but also cement bonds between neighbours. It will probably require the intervention of the chief minister, himself a film buff. Watching Matir Moina underscored that whoever takes the initiative to free good films from cine-club and festival circuits would do a great service to the people.																								Much of the film revolves around a decrepit madarsa, its starkness offset by childrens laughter and the breathtaking beauty of the rivers and the countryside. Children come up with the kind of spontaneous performance that only children are capable of.																								The role of the staunchly Islamic Kazi, moulded after the directors own father, is played by a Bangladeshi Hindu and despite the grim story, the script allows space for humour and laughter. The outstanding film throws up many such surprises. Its a pity, indeed, that more people could not watch it here. One of the television channels perhaps can invest some money and bring it back to the viewers. Tara Bangla, especially, appears to be making an effort to cover Bangladesh better.																								Masud acknowledges the autobiographical elements drawn from his life. His father, he hinted, was a staunch Islamic Kazi who till the end did not believe that a Muslim army could butcher Bengali Muslims. In real life, as in the film, Masud lost his sister because she was denied allopathic medicine. But unlike the protagonist in the film, who refuses to leave his house even after a marauding army burns it down, in real life Masud and his mother managed to persuade his father to leave with them and become refugees in their own homeland.

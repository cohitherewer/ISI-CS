																																																		After being shut for over two weeks, Lighthouse cinema is set to reopen on Wednesday. Calcutta High Court has ruled in favour of the cinema hall, which was closed down by Calcutta Police on February 20 on charges of unauthorised changes made to the premises, owner John Mantosh said on Tuesday. The problem was regarding Citimart, a shop on the ground floor of Lighthouse. The shop had been functional for about two years before the police decided to clamp down on this illegal construction. The court held that there were no restrictions in doing up the downstairs area, said Mantosh. It also felt that an establishment running for so many years and employing around 100 people could not be closed down overnight, he added. Till the next change on Friday, some old English movie will be screened, said Mantosh, but failed to specify which new release would hit the hall first.																																																		A constable of Calcutta Police, Swapan Roy, was arrested on Tuesday for accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from Srikanta Kar, a resident of Uluberia, whom he promised a post in the force. A resident of Sambhunath Pandit Street, Roy was picked up from near Bhabani cinema hall in south Calcutta, where he was waiting to collect an instalment from Kar. Police said Kar had met Roy at a social gathering about a month back. Roy had promised Kar a job and shown him several documents including a letterhead of the police commissioner to convince him. He had also introduced Kar to a man, who was later identified by police as his nephew, as one of the cops he had helped get a job. Over the past 15 days, Kar had paid the stipulated sum in instalments. But when Roy demanded more money, he became suspicious and alerted the police.																																																		Police seized four fake gun licences and guns, and arrested four persons on Tuesday, unearthing a racket based in Barasat. Sakshi Gopal Halder, an employee of a security agency with its offices in Watgunge, was apprehended on Red Road in the morning when he produced a fake licence for the gun he was carrying. Upon interrogation, Halder first stated that the gun had been bought from a central Calcutta dealer, but the proprietors of the gun shop denied having sold any weapon to the man. Then Halder confessed that he had paid a tout in Barasat to get the licence and the gun. He named three others who got their guns and licences from the same person. Raids were conducted and the other three men with fake gun documents were arrested from Amta, Chakdah and Hasnabad. Police suspect the involvement of an insider from the Barasat district magistrates office in the racket who provided the relevant forms.																																																		Two more persons in the Shankar Pal murder case were picked up on Tuesday, raising the total number of arrests to four. Pal was murdered on Saturday and the police had earlier arrested Puchkai Das and Tapan Das who were remanded in police custody for three days. On Tuesday, Bishu and Kyabla were arrested on the basis of information provided by those arrested earlier.																																																		Bappa Mullick, a salesperson with a private company, was arrested from Shyampur of Budge Budge on Tuesday for his alleged involvement in the murder of 21-year-old Anita Roy, who went missing from home on February 28. Roy, a resident of Thakurpukurs Biren Roy Road, was a salesperson with the same company and a close friend of Mullick, police said. Roys mother had lodged a missing persons diary on March 7. The body was found on March 1. Roy had been strangulated to death.																																																		The police on Tuesday recovered Rs 3 lakh out of the Rs 9 lakh that two cheats had stolen from a businessman. Mohd. Hussain Ali, 40, and his associate Naushad had been arrested on February 26 from Burrabazar. They had cheated Kalna-based businessman Pratap Pal by replacing his suitcase containing the money with an identical one full of old newspapers.

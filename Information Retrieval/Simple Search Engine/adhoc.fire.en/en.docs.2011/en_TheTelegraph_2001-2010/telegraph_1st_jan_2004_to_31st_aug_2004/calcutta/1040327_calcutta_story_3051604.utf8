 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Woman slain by son, another by burglars 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two elderly women in two parts of the city fell victim to assailants driven by diverse motives. 																								If one murder was sparked by a sons rage, the other was fuelled by greed.																								An out-of-work, middle-aged man hacked his mother to death on Friday. He was, apparently, enraged by her constant criticism of his drinking habit, police said.																								Brihaspati Mukherjee, 65, died in hospital an hour after being attacked by her son. Doctors said the wounds inflicted on her neck with a kitchen knife had killed her. Son Chand was later arrested by the airport police.																								According to initial investigation, Chand had slipped into a depression since he lost his job with a private firm a year ago. The family had a single-storey house in Sahara, Madhyamgram, and his daughter got married a couple of years ago, but the burden of mother, wife and school-going son was proving too much for Chand.																								He tried to commit suicide three months ago by consuming acid. He was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital with a throat problem a few weeks ago. He was under several medical restrictions since returning home, but he kept on drinking heavily.																								It was this problem that caused Thursday nights angry altercation between mother and son. Chand was drinking at the dinner table, which his mother objected to. The issue flared up again on Friday morning, with Brihaspati berating her son for his behaviour.																								Around noon, Chand rushed into the kitchen, pulled out a large knife and attacked his mother.																								At another end of town, 68-year-old Aparna Ray was smothered to death with a pillow in her Thakurpukur bedroom. In the adjacent rooms, her son, daughter-in-law, daughter and granddaughter were all asleep when the assailants struck and escaped with some cash and valuables.																								Around 5 am on Friday, son Kingshuk went down to open the main door for the bhishti (water-carrier), only to find it ajar. 																								The murderers had probably used it to get away after entering the house through a window that was found with a broken grille.																								Kingshuk rushed upstairs, called out to his sister Bani Das to find out if she and her three-year-old daughter were okay and then rushed into his mothers room. 																								She was found lying lifeless on her bed, with her legs tied together and the pillow that had been used to suffocate her placed beside her.																								Missing were Rs 5,000 from the almirah, the ornaments she was wearing (bangles, rings and ear-rings), a cellphone and a camera.																								The two domestic helps, Durga Mandal and Asheda Bibi, were detained for interrogation

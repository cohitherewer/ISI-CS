 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Kith cameo in all-star clash
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees wife Meera with CPM candidate Mohd Salim. Picture by Pabitra Das Didi Meera Bhattacharjee, wife of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is escorting bhai Md Salim on his poll-day trail and passing him biscuits, clove and water. A red Toyota Qualis is zipping around Calcutta Northeast carrying Moushumi Chatterjee, who is vociferous about countering CPMs booth-jam tactics and ensuring free and fair polls. From the basement control room of his residence on Chittaranjan Avenue, Ajit Panja is keeping tabs on polling and poll management																								The savvy face of the CPM, the Balika Bodhu-turned-Congress hopeful and the veteran of 14 elections  an all-star line-up in an all-action poll showdown, which even saw the wife of the states chief minister playing a cameo.																								I was with him throughout the campaign process and I joined him today immediately after casting my vote early in the morning, smiled Meera Bhattacharjee. Just outside Sarada Prasad Institute, off Ultandanga Main Road, Salim was growing hot under the collar of his spotless white kurta. Take care of the law and order situation. Dont try to play the role of election commissioners, the state technical education minister admonished a police officer.																								As the temperature soared and a crowd gathered, Meera Bhattacharjee, in off-white cotton sari, stepped in to defuse the situation, before hopping into a Tata Sumo and steering Team Salim to destination next.																								Another sports utility vehicle was criss-crossing the length and breadth of the constituency, sprawling from Entally to Cossipore. Though the security guards and the convoy were missing, there was no dearth of drama. 																								Moushumiiiii, shrieked a young lady waiting at the gates of Surah Kanya Vidyalaya, on CIT Road, as the red Qualis screeched to a halt. The bejewelled Bollywood actor, also in off-white sari, jumped out of the vehicle, spewing venom at the poll machinery, reacting sharply to a few snide remarks from bystanders, flouting election norms by chatting on her cellphone inside the booth and pulling up the presiding officer for deliberate delay.																								The ex-heroines exit line: This is not a free and fair poll. I am visiting the booths and trying my best to stop the malpractice.																								Far from the poll fever and the fret, reigning champion Ajit Panja was taking it easy. I have been fighting elections since 1971 and I believe it involves management of a lot of things. We keep track of everything centrally, said Panja, in bright yellow kurta.																								The soft-spoken Trinamul leader said he was sure of winning despite all the dirty tactics used by Salim, who is even accompanied by the chief ministers wife and his Congress rival, who used to be charming.																								Mixing stage performance with politics, Panja had some sagely advice for his party workers: Be patient and tolerant. CPM goons have laid traps for us, but we will not fall into them. We will win without doing anything like that.																								Thursday the 13th will prove Panja  and the rest  right or wrong.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Boys back from adventure
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There are five of them. But instead of becoming famous for the right reasons, everything has gone wrong with their plans. 																								Five schoolboys of Thakurpukur between 10 and 15 years of age desperate for adventure, to visit Darjeeling and to settle down amid its scenic beauty, did not stop either at picking their fathers pocket or selling off a brand new bicycle  a birthday gift  to pay their fares.																								However, the dreams of these five students of a school in Thakurpukur were shattered as they had to return home from Siliguri after being stopped by police.																								The youngest of the Famous Five is in Class III. Another is in Class VI, and three others are in Class VIII. Their parents were anxious that their identities should not be revealed. 																								Realising that without cash their dreams will never come true they took desperate measures. One of them picked his fathers pocket and helped himself to Rs 500. Another sold his birthday gift, a bicycle, and collected Rs 900 for the journey. 																								A third dipped into the family jewel box and took away his mothers gold chain. Yet another boy, a topper in his class, sold the ornamental fish in his aquarium. One of the five, who happens to be the maternal uncle of one adventurer, could not raise any cash and tagged along with the others.																								The plan was masterminded by a Class-VIII student of the same school, who backed out at the last moment. 																								We used to gather during recess and chalk out plans for the adventure, said one of the boys, sitting in the security of his home at Sodepur in the Thakurpukur police station area. We wanted to go to Darjeeling. We had heard so much about the place, he said.																								So they gathered at a local playground on the evening of March 1. After waiting for a while for the mastermind, who stood them up, they flagged a taxi, went to Esplanade and boarded a Siliguri-bound bus.																								Next morning they reached Siliguri and after breakfast discovered that they were running short of cash.																								Worried parents, meanwhile, had lodged complaints about their missing sons at Thakurpukur police station.																								We worked as waiters in a local hotel, said the baby of the group. I was feeling homesick and called up home to say that we would be back within a couple of days, he added.																								His homesickness was infectious and they all decided to return home. Desperate to raise funds for the return journey, they went to a man who lived there to sell the gold chain. 																								The man realised there was something wrong, and after getting the details of where they came from he went out and informed the police, said Salil Bhattacharjee, officer-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station.																								One of the adventurers called home to say they would return the day after. They were escorted to the city by the man who had informed the police. 																								The relieved family members received them at the bus terminus and took them back home.

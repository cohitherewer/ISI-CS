The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 22, 2004 All that load on little heads
A lookback at the work with students that drew warm words from todays Prime Minister triggers off a critique of the system that refuses to let kids remain kidsEye on Calcutta Barry OBrienThe gentle sardarji shook my hand warmly as he walked on to the stage. Thank you, sir, for all that you have done for our country, was my welcome remark to him. Thank you for this marvellous and meaningful expression of caring, was the modest Sardarjis reply.The professor-Sardarji was touched by The Telegraph Education Foundations effort to reach out to young fighters who had battled the odds and come out on top. The humble Sardarji said he felt humbled when he heard the inspiring stories of the children who were being presented scholarships at the Science City auditorium that morning. The erudite Sardarji complimented us for highlighting the pressure we put on our children today via the weight of their schoolbag and the extreme competitive edge in examinations.The gentle, modest, humble, erudite, professor-Sardarji takes on a huge responsibility today. Thats happening hundreds of miles away, but his words of encouragement still ring in my ears: Keep it up. You are influencing young boys and girls in such a positive way.Nine months ago, none of us had ever imagined that he would go on to become the Prime Minister of our country, though many of us occasionally allowed ourselves the liberty of visualising an ideal India headed by President Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. A few seconds with him were enough to convince me that he was an extraordinary man with an extraordinary vision.I suddenly started thinking of our chief guest at last years School Awards for Excellence ceremony, for two reasons. One, because everyone has suddenly started thinking about him and two, because of the pressure-on-students reality being highlighted yet again, as school-leaving results hit the headlines.

A file pictureParent pressureAs parents, we often think we know whats good for our children, little realising the harm we may be inflicting on them. Sometimes, we want them to follow in our footsteps and live the dreams we have already fulfilled. Often we want them to do as we say and live the dreams we couldnt fulfil. If only we could let them live their dreams and help them get there.Over the past few days I have had more than one hysterical friend wondering how his son will go on to become a doctor with such average marks in his ICSE science paper. I have had many a panicky acquaintance dropping in for advice on, What now? Shes got only 82 per cent!Its that time of the year again when the media stop to find out whos tops; its that time of the year again when principals and parents are preoccupied with percentages and positions; its that time of the year again when cut-off marks in colleges stamp out careers even before they have begun to bloom; its that time of the year when we must ask ourselves: who is to blame? Surely not the poor principal or the parent! Certainly not the poor pupil! Its got to be the system.Sure it cant change overnight, but weve got to start somewhere. At least one college in the city has started giving the same weightage to extracurricular activities, discipline and deportment (via interviews) as it does to the school-final marksheet.At least one educationist wants to change the system and is showing the way  Dr Ashok Ganguly, chairman, CBSE. His immediate targets are abolishing homework and examinations at the primary level, his broader vision is getting children to care and excel, not cram and excel.Coming of ageAs I turned the clock back and made my debut on the Tantra dance floor last week, I couldnt help but feel good. I was rubbing shoulders with teenagers at the TTIS Class of 2004 party. They had come of age and we were telling them to go for gold. As I pried into their futures via a question-answer round in the Mr/Ms TTIS Contest, I got clear-cut answers in laid-back style.They were cool, confident and a cut above what we were at their age. Here was a bunch of tomorrows people telling us they knew when to chill and when to turn the heat on; when to compete and when to care. Here was a bunch of tomorrows leaders telling us that they knew their results were important but there were other equally important things too in their lives.It was a proud moment for us. At TTIS we encourage them to work together, not against one another; we encourage them to excel alongside, not at the expense of one another. We tell them that there is room for everyone to progress and perform. Going by how they egged each other on at their coming-of-age party, we felt that the message had sunk in. We believe we are on the right track, because they are on the right one.What concerns me is, as parents we are often not on the right track. Over the last few weeks Ive encountered at least one hyped-up parent wanting to know what her 11-year-old should read to become the smartest kid and Indias child genius. Her ambition and feel good factor left me feeling anything but good.Give me a break! Forget me, give the poor kid a break!Of course I welcome Siddhartha Basu, a friend I admire and Indias most telegenic quizmaster, hosting a TV-quiz show for kids; of course, Im all for healthy competition and mental callisthenics; but of course Ive got a major problem with educators, role models and corporate houses who selfishly bully children into becoming far too competitive, far too aggressive, far too early. How cruel it is to pump up parents, who in turn, pressurise their children to mug-up quiz books and encyclopaediae to beat the stuffing out of other stressed-out, little Einsteins!Isnt the schoolbag already too heavy? Isnt too much of homework already depriving them of the outdoors? Arent they already mini geniuses in their own right? Dont they know much more than what you knew at their age? Arent we cheating them of the joy of childhood? Shouldnt they also have the time to feed birds and get stung by bees?Believe me, before we realise it, in a world that is whizzing by, they will know all about the birds and the bees and the precious gift of childhood would have passed them by. Believe me, its time for us to take a step back, hold their hands, show them the way, yet give them the space that our parents gave us.

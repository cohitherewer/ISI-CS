 Monday, May 10, 2004 Small talk over seafood
Thought for Food Bikram Ghosh and June Maliah sample delicacies from the seafood buffet spread at La Terrasse, The Grand. Picture by Pabitra DasEvery Bengali worth his salt leaps to the bait of a stimulating adda. Add some seafood to it and he is ready to forgo his machh-bhaat for a while, more so if the gathering includes globe-trotting foodies like Bikram Ghosh and June Maliah. Seen experimenting with oysters and octopuses at the coffee-shop at The Grand on Friday were actors June and Tota Roychoudhury, tabla player Bikram, danseuse Tanusree Shankar, socialite Oindrilla Dutt and model Amrita perking up the glamour quotient. The small talk veered from the inane to the vain as the sober evening slurred to a close. Tota  and not the lithe ladies  was the nibbler at the table, as he gears up for the haggard look he needs to portray in the forthcoming Bhalomanush where he plays a lower middle class jobless youth. The actor from Tollywood seen mostly in supporting roles is quite charmed by Bollywood we hear. Ab Tak Chhappan is among his favourite flicks and he attributes the sleek production quality of Hindi films to organised muscle power. Good film-makers and corporate backing is making all the difference today, asserted Tota, when Oindrilla got a brain wave. Why dont you shift base to Mumbai? she suggested. The level-headed actor obviously knows better. Now Im a small fish in a big pond. There Ill be a tiny fish in a very big pond, he shrugged. So for the moment he is content playing women (Totas version of small roles which generally go to female actors) in dance dramas like Chandalika. Bikram seemed to have had a better time composing music for the project. I would surround myself with all kinds of percussion instruments and just play from early morning to late night, he smiled. Though now Tota and Bikram seem to hit it off well having worked together, the first impression Tota got of Bikram was not very flattering. I thought Bikram was very snooty, Tota joked. It was Bikrams turn to pull the actors leg when he noted that Tota wasnt drinking. Guess its because you are married! guffawed Bikram who had already downed a few and was clearly game for more. June chirped with gay abandon about her first boyfriend and about her oldest crush in the industry  Victor Banerjee. Oh, I flirt with him left right and centre! June announced gleefully. She, however, had many contenders as everybody around the table agreed that Victor is quite a darling. In fact, Tanusree looking chic in a pink sari was quite nostalgic about the fact that they share the same marriage anniversary and went on a spiel about his punctuality among other qualities. Ananda and myself once had a dinner appointment with Victor. He said hell arrive sharp at 8.23 and he did! As if on cue, people went about the business of wrapping it up and got down to desserts. Tota opted for the most unusual combination of iced tea and malpoa. You are blowing hot and cold, teased Bikram. Oindrilla thought that was very funny and gagman Bikram got one off the bat again, Im a punny man!  Chef Devied Cananzi looks on as Piu Sarkar and Churni Ganguly get a taste of the new Italian spread at the Hyatt Regency. Picture by Rashbehari Das  Pasta fiestaItalian food is apparently the second most popular cuisine all over the world, the first being home food. And thats probably one of the reasons why Hyatt Regency, Calcutta, has flown in speciality Italian chef Devied Cananzi to pamper the taste buds of avid foodies. A select gathering got a taste of Cananzis cooking on Friday. This was also the first of a series of trial runs of the new Italian menu, which will become a fixture once the hotel comes up with a speciality Italian restaurant in the near future. We will probably be able to launch it by August, said general manager Praveen Chawla. Once operational this will be the third food outlet in the hotels kitty, the other two being the speciality Indian restaurant and the coffee shop. As expected, the menu for the evening flaunted Italian delicacies like Carpaccio di Tonno (thin sliced tuna fish marinated with lemon and balsamic vinegar), Scaloppina di pollo (chicken breast escalope with porcini mushrooms and white truffle oil), Filetto di bekti (bekti cartoccio style), as well as the traditional Italian Pasta (Cannelloni ai frutti, which is pasta filled with shrimps, squid and ricotta cheese), the sweet ending drawn with the classic Tiramisu. In the vegetarian segment one had options of Pomodori Farciti (tomatoes filled with spinach and fontina cheese) and Risotto with mushrooms, parmesan cheese and saffron sauce. For anyone who has a penchant for the spicier version of Italian food, Cananzis style might seem a little too bland. Spicy food is from the south of Italy, but what I cooked today were Milanese and Tuscany specialities, Cananzi explained. In fact, Cananzis personal liking is bland food which he says if cooked properly retains the original taste of the ingredients used. The guests were seemingly delighted with the spread. Try the Tiramisu, its perfect, not too sweet and tastes great, designer Abhishek Dutta, who has been invited to participate in the Bridal Asia in Delhi later this month, told model-turned-painter-Piu Sarkar. Painter Wasim Kapoor seemed to enjoy the risotto, taking an extra helping before hopping over to the Scaloppina di pollo. Actress Churni Ganguly and director-husband Kaushik Ganguly were among the others who dropped by to be a part of the Italian evening. Sangita S. Guha Roy and Himika Chaudhuri

 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Clubs clash over cricket match, 7 hurt
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Seven persons were seriously injured and one of them had to be admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition on Sunday night after a fight broke out between two clubs at Jelepara, in Howrah. 																								District police officials said the clash erupted over the outcome of a cricket match a week ago between the two clubs. We rounded up four men from the spot for hurling bombs and terrorising residents, they added.																								Howrah police superintendent Mihir Bhattacharya identified the clubs as Shanti Sangha and West Bengal Telugu Youth Organisation. Nandalal Shaw, 32, lost an eye in the clash.																								Witnesses said members of both clubs hurled bombs and fought each other for two hours from 10.30 pm on Sunday. They claimed that Shanti Sangha is backed by the Congress and the Telugu Youth Organisation gets support from the local CPM.																								Inquiries revealed that Shanti Sangha holds a Bajrangbali puja every year and on Sunday, after immersion of the idol, its members spotted a man who had caused their defeat in last weeks match. The man ran into the Telugu Youth Organisation club.																								A gang of 20 Shanti Sangha members demanded that we hand him over, said a member of the rival club. We refused. So, they started to threaten us and assaulted us severely.

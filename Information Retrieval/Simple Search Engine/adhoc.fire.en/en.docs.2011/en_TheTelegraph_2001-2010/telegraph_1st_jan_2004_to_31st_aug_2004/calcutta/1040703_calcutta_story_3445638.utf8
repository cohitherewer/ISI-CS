 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 The return of Elektra
																								As part of Hutchs annual festival of plays, ODEON 2004, Swapna Sandhani presents Kolkatar Elektra, a deeply introspective play whose protagonist is based on the Greek tragedist Aeschyluss character of the same name. Elektra is the daughter of King Agamemnon, the hero of Aeschylian tragedies. Hers is a complex personality that has been moulded from the scars of her lifes experiences. What is interesting about Elektra is that she is now a denizen of modern-day Calcutta, called upon to encounter challenges no less daunting than the ones she has already faced. Written by Buddhadeb Basu and directed by Kaushik Sen, the cast comprises Anasuya Majumdar, Sudipa Basu and Reshmi Sen among others. This play promises to provide theatre connoisseurs an evening of absorbing, intelligent entertainment.

and (above) Astad Deboo performs at the same eventSapphire Creations Dance Workshop added another feather to its cap with the inauguration of a five-day dance event called Interface 2004. Interface, the International Festival of Alternative and Contemporary Expressions is a biennial event covering the disciplines of music, dance, theatre, visual arts and fashion and interactions among these disciplines. Kala Mandir came alive with Interface 2004  a ready platform for the interaction and reinvention of the contemporary arts. It is about breaking barriers, to bridge the gaps between people, genres and cultures. 																					Thanks to the untiring efforts of Sudarshan Chakraborty and Paramita Saha, Sapphire has grown from strength to strength. On the opening day of Interface, Sapphire awarded art patron Russi Modi, dancer Astad Deboo, theatre personality Bijoylakshmi Burman and painter Suvaprasanna. 																					Astad Deboo, the most phenomenal modern dancer of India opened the festival with three solo dance performances. Recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Creative Dance and the only contemporary performer to participate in classical festivals like the Elephanta and Khajuraho dance festivals, Astad has carved a niche for himself in the world of contemporary dance. His dance is a rare blend of ancient classical art forms and modern artistic styles. Exposing himself to a bewildering variety of traditions, styles and techniques, Astad has created a style that celebrates the exuberance of narrative forms and the intensity of contemporary abstraction. 																					Next to take the stage was the Thresh Dance Company from USA. Thresh is known for creating projects revealing crossovers and exchanges at cultural boundaries. Comprising independent artists, designers and choreographers, the Thresh form of dance-theatre expresses a dialogue with the present yet remains in constant conversation with the past. Under the aegis of artistic director Preeti Vasudevan, Thresh presented Strings Unattached. A series of three performance pieces with the stringed instrument as the main musical accompaniment, Strings Unattached explored techniques, passages, cultures, relationships and dialogues through its texts, choreography and music.																					Interesting performances to watch out for include Silesian Dance Theatre from Poland, Shunya Se from Ranan Dance Company and a performance by Srishti Dance Works. With performances, seminars and open workshops scheduled at Kalamandir, the culturally conscious Calcuttan will be kept busy over the next few days. Actress Reshmi Bhattacharya enjoys delicacies on offer at the Rajasthani food festival at Mirch Masala and (top) Jaisalmeri Ker Sangri, one of the hottest draws at the festival												Spice route																					Mirch Masala, the theme restaurant resembling a roadside dhaba at 49/2 Gariahat Road, turned four and spicier. On offer as a birthday treat is a Rajasthani food festival, albeit at a price. The Rajasthani dcor achieved with colourful chunaris all around whets ones appetite for some desert delicacies, but its a good idea to take it easy and first cool off with a glass of Khado (a unique combination of corn flour and buttermilk flavoured with cumin and black pepper), Raabadi (bajra flour cooked in butter milk with a pinch of cumin and peppercorns) or Tamatar Mangodi Ka Shorba (tomato broth garnished with lentil dumplings, cumin powder and fresh coriander), as they do in the arid lands of Rajasthan. 																					Thus relaxed, you can then follow the spice route and take your pick from a host of vegetarian dishes, notable among which are Jaisalmeri Ker Sangri (desert beans cooked in Jaisalmeri style), Jodhpuri Gatta Curry (spiced gram flour dumplings cooked in tangy gravy), Rajasthani Kadhi (gram flour cooked in buttermilk tempered with cumin and mustard seeds) and Paneer Methi Dana Jaipuri (chunks of cottage cheese cooked with spicy Bikaneri papadams).																					One does not normally associate Rajasthani cuisine with non-vegetarian food, but there are a host of delicacies in this segment also, mainly consisting of game meat that the Rajput royals were extremely fond of. On offer at this festival are Laal Maas (a popular Rajput preparation of lamb), Methi Maas (lamb cooked with fresh fenugreek, flavoured with bay leaf, cloves and peppercorn), Murgi Shekhawati (saffron-flavoured chicken blended with cashewnuts), Machali Ramgarhi (fresh lake water boneless fish cooked in rich yellow Ramgarhi gravy) and more.																					There are quite a few options in the main dishes as well. Whereas rice lovers can pick and choose from Jodhpuri Pulao (Basmati rice cooked with chick peas and gram flour dumplings with a dash of cloves, cumin and peppercorn), Mangodi Pulao (Basmati rice cooked with lentil dumplings and flavoured with cloves, cinnamon, green cardamom and peppercorn), and Aloo Ki Tahri (rice preparation with potatoes, fresh coriander, green chillies, ginger, peppercorn, black cardamom and red chillies), you can break bread with Naan, Missi Roti, Bajre Ki Roti, or Bati. 																					Round off with some delicious Rajasthani Mal Pua. The festival will be on till March 16. For further details, call: 2475 9991. June Maliah checks out designerwear at an exhibition-cum-sale at the Ice Skating Rink 												Woman power																					The buoyant mood of I nternational Womens Day is still on, as is evident in a gala exhibition-cum-sale on at the Ice Skating Rink, organised by an all-womens group, Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta. Titled Temptations Plus 2004, the exhibition is drawing a sizeable crowd with its eclectic array of designerwear, jewellery, home furnishings, electronic goods, artefacts and other knick-knacks. 																					Said actress June Maliah at the inauguration, It is an impressive array Inner Wheel has put up. I love the festive air that these amazing women have managed to blend in with the whole show. Apart from biggies such as Pitambari, Kavya, Kenwood, Aquagard and more, the organisers have also roped in small entrepreneurs, especially women, working from their homes or one-room shops. The proceeds of the exhibition will go towards the construction of a primary school at Ramkrishna Ashram, Neempith. 																					The Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta is a social service organisation with membership restricted to the womenfolk of Rotarians. What started with an amateurish exhibition-cum-sale at a friends place in 1989, acquired enough professionalism by 1991 to host huge annual showings at the Ice Skating Rink. At present, Inner Wheel is the worlds second largest womens organisation. There are roughly 3844 clubs in 98 countries with over 1 lakh members. The Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta in particular, has been generating funds towards the building of blind school rooms, toilets, libraries, running vocational training centres, providing aid to thalassaemia care organisations, donating ambulances, providing drinking water, organising eye-operation camps, donating artificial limbs and more.																					The exhibition will be on till March 12. Timings: 10 am to 8 pm.

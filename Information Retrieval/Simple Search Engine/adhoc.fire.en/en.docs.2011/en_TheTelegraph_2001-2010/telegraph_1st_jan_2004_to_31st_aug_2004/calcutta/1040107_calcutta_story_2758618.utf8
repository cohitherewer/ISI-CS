The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004  Calcutta Column
 
	Why do VIPs consider it their privilege to bend rules whenever  it pleases them? On Tuesday afternoon, around 2.30 pm, in  front of the martyrs column on Red Road, a white Ambassador,  bearing a red light and the insignia of the chairman of  the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, slowed down at the red  signal. While the other cars halted, it suddenly picked  up speed, and shot ahead. The sight brought to mind the  mornings transmission from Sydney where Australian Prime  Minister John Howard applauded Steve Waugh from the stands,  without any attempt to take the stage on the ground. Power  fits only those who use it well.

	Several foreign language centres have come up in the city,  which are important for students in this era of globalisation.  However, most of these institutions are situated in south  Calcutta. For those living in the north, the travel is a  waste of time and energy. Foreign language centres should  be opened in north Calcutta as well.

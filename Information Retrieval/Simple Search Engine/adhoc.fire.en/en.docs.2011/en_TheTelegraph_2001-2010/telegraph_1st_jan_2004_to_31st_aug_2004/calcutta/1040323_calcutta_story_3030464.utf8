The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Case count up as free aids find black market
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE AND JULIUS GOMES				 	 Filmstar Debashree Roy at an HIV/AIDS awareness drive at Sonagachhi. A Telegraph picture																								With unsafe sex being the most common reason behind the spread of AIDS globally, the HIV prevalence in the city has taken an upswing since the free condoms distributed by government agents in the red-light areas are not trickling down to the end users: sex workers and their customers.																								The West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society claims that NACO and the state government are spending more than Rs 10 crore on AIDS management, part of which involves the free distribution of condoms among sex workers. But sex workers at Sonagachhi complain that they dont receive the caps, which they regard as their life jacket.																								If a customer wants to use a condom, we have to go out and buy the cap with our own money. Thats why generally, we dont work with condoms, and most customers dont mind, said Gitanjali, who has been at Sonagachhi for a year.																								AIDS society officers seem to be unaware of the fact that the aid they have directed towards the safety of sex workers and their customers is, in fact, being sold off in the black market. We distribute nearly 300,000 to 400,000 condoms (Jeevan brand) on a quarterly basis among the sex workers of Sonagachhi. On an average, a total consignment of about 1.4 million rubber sheaths are distributed to them annually, said B. Gupta of the society																								Contradicting Guptas remarks, sex worker Sohini said, Nirodh condoms cost between Rs 2 and 4 per piece here, depending on the season. In the festive season and on holidays, we get more customers, and the risk of contracting diseases is more. But in summer, the lean season, customers dont ask for caps and that means our income remains intact.																								Added colleague Mithu: When a customer asks for a cap, it means he understands the risk of AIDS and sexually-transmitted diseases. But there are hardly any men who demand a condom.																								The AIDS prevention society reaches out to the sex workers of Sonagachhi through Durbar Mahila Samanyay Committee, an association of sex workers that demands economic empowerment for its members but refuses rehabilitation. 																								Going by the statistics, the Samanyay Committee rakes in a minimum of Rs 14 lakh a year by endangering its own members, by selling free condoms at the rate of Rs 2 each. Not to mention being directly responsible for the surge in the spread of AIDS in the city.																								In West Bengal, there are 2,397 AIDS patients (undergoing treatment) and 5,090 HIV-positive cases recorded by AIDS prevention society till May 2003. The rate of growth, according to the societys figures, is 33.3 percent: from 221 AIDS cases detected in 2000 ( 207 in 2001, 969 in 2002) to 611 AIDS cases detected in 2003 (till May).

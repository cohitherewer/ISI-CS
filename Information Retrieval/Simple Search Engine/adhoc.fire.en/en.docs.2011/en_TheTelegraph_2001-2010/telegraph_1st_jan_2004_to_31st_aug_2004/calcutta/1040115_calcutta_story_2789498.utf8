  Game for the greens: A match played for the camera on the Maidan It is really alarming that fake currency notes worth several crores of rupees are in circulation in India (Fake note flurry spurs cop swoop, Dec. 15). The economic policies of the country cannot produce the desired result if such a huge amount of fake money remains in circulation. This makes the economy weak.  The common man may be cheated as the fake notes cannot be easily identified. The Reserve Bank of India has suggested introduction of hidden marks in notes of higher denomination to check the supply of fakes. But unless a very easy method of identification of genuine notes is chalked out and circulated widely, the risks will remain. The fake notes will not only make people lose financially, but will also cause them harassment when they produce the same for settlement of any dues. They may be required to explain the source of the money to the police. So, financial institutions like banks, post offices etc, should not force any customer to accept 500 or 1,000-rupee notes when the transaction does not exceed, say Rs 5,000.  The fake notes generally come from Karachi or Dhaka. The police department is taking steps to weed out the notes from circulation. But cooperation from the Pakistan and Bangladesh governments is needed to unearth the agencies at the root of the fraud.  The fake notes must be thrown out of circulation at any cost and the sooner, the better.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
 Behala.  It is interesting to note that the state government has taken necessary action to clean the Maidan after being rapped on the knuckles by the high court (Maidan clean-up dubbed a miracle, Dec. 13). The move suggests that the government can rise to the occasion to perform its duties when the situation so demands. However, all this would not have been necessary if the Maidan was kept clean, in course of normal civic duty.  Rabindranath Kar, 
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  The road tax fixed by the public vehicles department is too high (Road-tax load steers scurry to sell old cars, Dec. 19). The state government and the PVD should reduce the tax.  Prahlad Agarwala, 
 Majdia, Nadia.  How many people do you think remember the brave Bapi Sen after one long year? (Distress waves in death wake, Dec. 19) We must be ashamed of our government that has forgotten the heros family, which is languishing in neglect. Yes, the government will keep its word. It will put up a statue some day in honour of the famous Bapi Sen in some government-owned amusement park. That will be all. However, I am proud to be a reader of The Telegraph, which remembered Bapi Sens family unlike the others, including the government.  Soham Gupta,
 Anil Roy Road.  Kudos for highlighting the sufferings  of the family of sergeant Bapi Sen, who sacrificed his life  to save a woman from drunken cops. We appeal to the authorities  to provide a suitable job for his wife, as well as educational  support for his son.  B.N. Bose, 
 Dum Dum.  The state governments attitude  is inhuman. We demand that Bapi Sens family get social  justice.  Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
 Beleghata.  Apropos the report Govt mulls CAS March (Dec. 16), it is sad how the government is dilly-dallying over the implementation of CAS, thereby leaving consumers at the mercy of cable operators, who discriminate against consumers. There is little rationale behind charging different rates in different localities. CAS will do away with this anomaly.  Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
 Nayapatty Road.  To the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters,  We, the students and staff of the department of English, Jadavpur University, have been deeply shocked and grieved by the terrible bus accident that claimed the life of Swagatam Dey, a student of this department. Keeping in mind your co-operation on the day of the accident (January 13), we would earnestly request you to take all appropriate measures against those responsible for this tragic death. We also request you to take proper action to prevent such accidents in future.  Sajni Mukherjee, 
 Head, department of English,
 on behalf of students and staff of the department, Jadavpur  University.

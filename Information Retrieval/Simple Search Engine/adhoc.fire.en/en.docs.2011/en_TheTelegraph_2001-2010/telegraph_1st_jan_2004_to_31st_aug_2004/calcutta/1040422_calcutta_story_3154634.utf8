The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Face-saver shift in flyover
 																											- Halfway high road remodel plan with original structure retained A STAFF REPORTER																								First, make the mess. Then, mull over the mess. Finally, scramble to minimise the mess.																								The day after The Telegraph highlighted the plight of the ill-planned and ill-fated Kidderpore flyover, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) said the existing structure of the halfway high road would be retained, as far as possible.																								HRBC, a wing of the transport department, had taken up the project to ease traffic congestion in the area. Work will begin afresh before the monsoon.																								Construction of the Rs 20-crore flyover began in 1997 but the work was suspended in 2000 after a portion of the approach road was put in place on the Kidderpore side. From then on, the flyover has been kept hanging.																								Following criticism from various quarters, the transport department initiated a move to resume work, only for officials to pronounce that its design was flawed and so it must be rebuilt.																								The HRBC subsequently prepared a Rs 34-crore modified scheme for demolishing the constructed portion and starting construction anew.																								We know some portion of public money has gone down the drain, but we can assure the tax-payer that the reconstructed flyover will be a unique one, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Wednesday.																								The minister added that the flyover plan had been modified in order to benefit a greater number of people in the congested area and ensure smoother vehicular movement between the southern suburbs and other parts of the city, as well as Howrah.																								Ground realities have prompted us to modify the scheme. It will provide a facelift to the area and enable more vehicles to use the flyover. We also want to ensure that a greater number of people are benefited from this, said minister Chakraborty, adding that parallel roads would now be constructed under the flyover.																								The minister conceded that the reconstruction would be undertaken at a higher cost, but blamed it on the escalation in prices of building materials.																								HRBC officials claimed that the Kidderpore flyover was not the only project that had hit a roadblock. 																								There are many other projects taken up by different departments and agencies that could not be finished on time due to various reasons. Our project was delayed for technical and some other reasons beyond our control. Another major hurdle was the dearth of funds, they said.																								The Assembly subject committee on transport, which hauled up the HRBC for the unfinished flyover, will submit its review report shortly. 																								We will send our findings to both the Speaker and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. We feel the inefficiency and callousness of some officials and engineers have resulted in the wastage of public money, said Sadhan Pande, chairman of the committee.

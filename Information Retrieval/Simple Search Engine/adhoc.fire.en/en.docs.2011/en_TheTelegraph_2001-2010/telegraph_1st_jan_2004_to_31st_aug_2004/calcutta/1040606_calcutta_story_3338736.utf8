 Sunday, June 06, 2004 Snap up the future
- DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL CAMERA TechTalkDigital camera is the future of photography, say pundits. And with prices plummeting, more and more non-professionals and home-users going for the digital variant, the future is here.A digital still camera does not use film like the analogue one. Instead, the pictures are stored (hundreds of them) in built-in memory sticks. The images can be transferred on to a compact disc for archiving, and even uploaded to the Internet or e-mailed to family and friends.Nikon D1
	 2.74 megapixel3D digital matrix image control
 Shooting speed of 4.5 frames per second for up to 21 consecutive shots
 31 custom settings 
 Weighs 1.1 kg Linking the camera to the PC is easy, with a connecting cable that is usually bundled with the camera. Attach the camera like any other device (printer, scanner etc) and set the camera to PC mode. Software, also bundled with the camera, helps you to view detailed information on the PC screen about the snaps youve taken, and also saves them in the computer.In a digital camera, you can also check the photos on the camera screen itself, delete the ones you dont like, and print those you want to. Printing is easy and can be done at home with a regular inkjet printer. Only special photo-paper  readily available  needs to be put in. Colour labs across the city will do a more professional print job, sharpening and enhancing your photos in the process.The price of digital cameras was prohibitive until a couple of years ago. But now, models are available for as low as Rs 3,000 in the grey market, and can go up to over Rs 1 lakh. But the average home-user can safely look at a range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 30,000 for reputed brands sold over the counter. Accessories1. A good battery-charger or a set of spare batteries when on the move and for emergencies2. High-capacity flash cards (up to 12 gigabyte) are now available. Get one to store moreCanon PowerShot

The sensitive lens may get scratched otherwise2. While archiving the images on a CD, ensure the media is of good quality to last longer3. Clean the insides of the camera regularly and dont leave the batteries inside when not in useShoppers stops1. A home-user should look at a camera with two to three megapixel output.

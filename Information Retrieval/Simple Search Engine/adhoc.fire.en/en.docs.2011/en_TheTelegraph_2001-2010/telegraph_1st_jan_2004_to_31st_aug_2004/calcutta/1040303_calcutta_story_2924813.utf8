 A STAFF REPORTERVisitors at the exhibition. (Above) King and Morgan pore over a magazine. Pictures by Pabitra Das																								The design of a book should be true to the content, but dont write off pictures as unintelligent and unnecessary. While words have the power of speech, images are often worth more than a thousand words, revealing volumes about the style of work. The look and feel of a book are as important as the subject matter.																								These trade secrets and more were revealed at a workshop at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on Tuesday, organised by the British Council, on the designing of books. About 50 participants listened in rapt attention, as Emily King, design editor of Frieze magazine and a graphic design historian, and John Morgan, a book designer, explained the intricacies of making a book, not writing one.																								Pocket-sized and coffee table books, typography and colour schemes, presentation and paper quality All the factors that make a book are the topics at the two-day book design workshop, and the purpose is for the participants to think about the content and design of a publication on Calcutta.																								The workshop is being held in conjunction with a series of activities this month, with the focus being The Book Corner, a travelling exhibition put together by King in 2002, which began its journey from Milan. Since, it has been to London, Tallinn, in Estonia, and Vilnius, in Lithuania. Having opened here on Monday, it will be on till March 9, along with In Print, an exhibition of the history of prints in Calcutta, at Seagull. 																								I wanted to create an exhibition on design, but only in the print format. So, the focus is on books, explains King. However, the furniture, shelves and even the carpets were designed specifically for the travelling exhibition. The shelves are of cheap material, so they can be pulled apart and rebuilt easily, but they have a solid look. Even the rugs are marbled, to give a sense of permanence, to help people come in and feel cosy and settled, she adds.																								Everything in The Book Corner is about design, from the 300-odd books themselves to their being catalogued according to size and the colourful kids section. The London A-Z map, too, is a part of it. It was first compiled by a woman who was a painter and needed to make money, so she travelled the streets on a bicycle and compiled it. The eclectic collection includes a photography book about aspiring models and another by a Japanese designer on rejection letters he received from various art projects in the UK.																								Although in Milan the exhibition was more about furniture, which was really frustrating, in London it was a meeting place for designers, and in Eastern Europe, the books were devoured, English not being a barrier. In Calcutta, people are surprised about the lack of content, feels King.

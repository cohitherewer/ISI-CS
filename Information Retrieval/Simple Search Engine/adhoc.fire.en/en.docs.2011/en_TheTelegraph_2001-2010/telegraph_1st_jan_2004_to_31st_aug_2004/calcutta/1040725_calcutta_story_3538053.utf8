The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 25, 2004 Steered by the cell 
Make Calcutta BetterRing, ring or The Ketchup Song or Bin tere sanam Out comes the cell phone and finds its way to the right ear  the traffic around be damned. Driving, after all, bayen haath ka khel hai (the left hand is good enough for the steering wheel). So what if youre speeding down the Bypass or meandering through the city centre? The man at the wheel these days, talks, listens, smiles, laughs and also drives.Everywhere from Garia to Girish Park, Rajarhat to Ramgarh, cops look the other way while our cell-savvy drivers weave their way in and out of dreadful Calcutta traffic, gadgets glued to the ear. All this, when the West Bengal Motor Vehicle Rules prohibit people from taking a call while driving.Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police, traffic, told Metro on Sunday: If caught, you have to pay a fine of Rs 100. If the same offender is booked for the same offence, Rs 300 is charged. But Basu acknowledges that very few people have been caught since the rule was enforced a couple of years ago. It is very difficult to catch them in the act, he admits.In areas like Park Street (picture above) and on the EM Bypass, the traffic police have put up boards warning people of the dangers of talking on the phone while driving. Basu, however, feels Calcutta runs a lower risk on this account as the speed of vehicular traffic here is rather slow. Calcuttas traffic speed, except maybe on the Bypass, does not exceed 30 km per hour. But even then, this habit should be condemned.If you notice anyone talking on the phone while driving, you can get in touch with the traffic control room at Lalbazar.

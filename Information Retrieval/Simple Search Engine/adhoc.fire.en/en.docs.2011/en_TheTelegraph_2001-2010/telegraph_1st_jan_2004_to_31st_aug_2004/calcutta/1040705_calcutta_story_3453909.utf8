 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Another duo in net for teen murder
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barely 24 hours after the arrest of two youths for the murder of 18-year-old Kuntal Sain in Howrah on Friday night, two more arrests were made on Sunday for connivance in the killing.																								Manjusha Mukherjee and Jyotirmoy, mother and brother of Sampad Mukherjee, one of the teenage killer duo, knew fully well that the two youths had planned Kuntals kidnap and murder for the past month. But they never tried to stop the two till the last moment. They even misguided us and the police about the incident, claimed Surojit Sain, the victims uncle on Sunday. 																								All the four persons were presented in the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court on Sunday afternoon, where the two main accused, Sampad and Arijit Pal, were remanded in police custody. 																								The other two were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. 																								Sampad and Arijit had been badly in need of cash. So they kidnapped their friend Kuntal and killed him on Friday. 																								It was a different scene in the Howrah court on Sunday. Though it was a holiday, hundreds of people gathered there to see the two killers. Once they saw them leave the court premises, the crowd roared to demand capital punishment for the duo. 																								Dhananjoyer thekeo ora beshi aparadhi, oder guli kore mere dao, (They are worse criminals than Dhananjoy. Shoot them) shouted a neighbour of the Sains outside the court. 																								The police officers present on the spot managed to whisk the prisoners away in a van. 																								Public prosecutor Chinmoy Chowdhury said in the court that the two young men had confessed to the police that they had killed their friend with a da (chopper). 																								They have specified in their confessional statement to the police that Sampad had held Kuntal, while Arijit hacked him to death. The wound on Sampads wrist was caused when he was hit with the chopper, said the public prosecutor in the court.																								Inquiries revealed that Kuntal fell asleep after his two friends forced him to take sedatives purchased from a medicine shop in the Ramrajatala area. 																								And then he was taken to Pakuria bridge, where he was hacked to death, said a neighbour of the Sains. 																								We have learnt this after a shop-owner told us about the purchase, he added.																								Until the post-mortem report comes, we cant confirm whether Kuntal took the sleeping pills or not, said a police official.

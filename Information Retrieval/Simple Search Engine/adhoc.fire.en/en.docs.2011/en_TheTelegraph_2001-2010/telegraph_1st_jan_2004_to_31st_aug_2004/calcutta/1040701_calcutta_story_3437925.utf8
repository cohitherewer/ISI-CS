The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Barracks glower, HQ glows
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Anger simmered at 6.05 pm at Sulekha Building, on BB Ganguly Street, the Calcutta Police Reserve Force (RF) barracks. In the dingy main hall, 30 pairs of eyes took in the news being telecast on a Bengali private channel: the conviction of five RF constables.																								There were murmurs of disapproval and dismay. The verdict was unjust, said a constable, shaking his head. The woman, the key witness to the case, could not be traced. So how was their crime proved? he asked. Others nodded in agreement. 																								One of the constables, who refused to identify himself, said: We are under strict orders not to give vent to our feelings . But it was strange to see our colleagues in court. We worked together, stayed under the same roof, gossiped together and now, suddenly, they are convicts!																								They (the guilty quintet) were always nice to us, said one of the canteen boys on the first floor of the barracks. Three of them  Shekhar Mitra, Pijush Goswami and Mujibur Rehman  were regular customers.																								The mood a stones throw away was quite a contrast. At Lalbazar, commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty said: I had made a promise to Soma (sergeant Bapi Sens widow) and I kept my word (of ensuring exemplary punishment for the constables). 																								Soumen Mitra, former sleuth chief overseeing the probe, said: As far as the investigation goes, the police have been successful. The fight Bapi started against eve-teasing achieved its final victory with the verdict. 																								The mood at Tollygunge Traffic Guard, to which Bapi was attached, was buoyant. We are very happy, said an officer.

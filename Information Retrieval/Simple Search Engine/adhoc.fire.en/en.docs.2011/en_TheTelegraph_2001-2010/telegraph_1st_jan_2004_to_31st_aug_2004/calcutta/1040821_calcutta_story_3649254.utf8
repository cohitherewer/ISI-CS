 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 A critical boundary
																								We live in a progressive world; advancements in science and technology have enabled us to surmount spatial boundaries, making us proud denizens of a global community. Yet, within this world without boundaries, we have created invisible barriers that prevent us from communicating with our loved ones, no matter the proximity of our intersecting lives. Bohurupees Nisidhha Thikana laments this growing trend in our society. The play, dealing with the story of a nuclear family comprising a husband, wife and their only son, shows us how the present generation feels a sense of insecurity and rootlessness, stemming from their having been torn apart from their greater families. Leading cloistered, suffocating lives, children feel detached from their family, even suffering an identity crisis. Though ending on an optimistic note, the play, conceived by Kumar Roy and directed by Debesh Roychaudhuri, raises questions of an existential nature, and is bound to provoke serious thought amongst a discerning audience.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Nisiddha Thikana, produced by Bohurupee																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

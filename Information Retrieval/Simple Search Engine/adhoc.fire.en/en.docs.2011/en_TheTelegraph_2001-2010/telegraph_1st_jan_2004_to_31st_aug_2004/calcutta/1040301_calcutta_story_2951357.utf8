 A STAFF REPORTER																								Confusion over ownership of a plot  where a garbage vat remains in a dilapidated condition, posing a serious environmental hazard for residents  has led to a clash between the Salt Lake municipality and the urban development department. 																								Trouble started over renovating the garbage vat, on the green verge of Salt Lakes DE block. 																								The renovation work, taken up by Bidhannagar Municipality to appease residents, was stopped by police after state urban development officials lodged a complaint against the local councillor and some other municipal officials. 																								Things took a new turn with the municipality asking the urban development department immediately to resolve the issue. The garbage, which is spilling on to the road, is causing a serious health hazard for residents, said Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. We wanted to repair the vat but urban development officials stopped us, he added. 																								In its letter, the municipality sought either a suitable place or to allow them to renovate the vat at the same spot. However, urban development department officials said they were yet to take any decision. We are looking into the matter, a senior official of the department said.																								Municipality officials were surprised at the urban development departments move. Although earlier, there was a difference of opinion, there was no such complaint, a municipality official said. 																								The garbage vat, adjacent to the Bidhannagar telephone exchange, served the residents of CE block, too. It has been in a state of disrepair for long, and residents submitted a memorandum to the municipality. Accordingly, a contractor was assigned the job to renovate the vat a few months ago.																								However, after the contractor started work, some criminals stopped him. A coordination committee member was behind this, said Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor from ward 10.																								Later, residents once again requested the authorities to start renovation work, as the garbage had started spilling on the road. But again the work was stopped, and this time the urban development department officials lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar North police station. 																								Officials of the urban development department claimed that the land on which the vat was constructed belonged to the department and so the municipality did not have any authority to take up any work there. But the councillor said the land was transferred long ago.

 Shuktara LalShuktara Lal																									Sleep theatre and think theatre is the motto of this budding stage director. Last weekend, at Gyan Manch, Shuktara left the audiences spellbound, calling the shots, from behind the scenes, for The Red Curtain play Rhinoceros. With the packed auditorium spilling over, theatre enthusiasts even plonked down in the aisles for a view of the all-youth troupe.																									Is something the 22-year-old has nurtured since childhood, when she would cling on to father Ananda Lal to take her to stage shows. The penchant snowballed into passion with our girl co-scripting and co-directing a play for the British Council Drama Festival. If Wishes were Horses bagged the first prize in 1999. 																									For this first-year Masters student of English literature in Jadavpur University, who has been acting since her under-graduate days. Alongside stints in JU departmental productions like The Way of the World, Massacre Game, For Coloured Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf and Sakuntanla, she also bag-ged roles, small and big, in Theatrecians Hayavadana and An Epi-sode in the Life of an Author. Shuktara did the costumes for Red Curtains Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead last December.																									In the making could she be as well, learning Rabindrasangeet for the past 15 years and training in classical music under Swapna Ghosh. The Bob Dylan and Beatles buff loves to spend her leisure with Tagore songs rendered by Nilima Sen and Suchitra Mitra. 																									She has, too, no doubt. The Virginia Woolf fan took part in several essay-writing competitions in school and made bringing home prizes a habit. She edited the school mag in GD Birla and won a prize for a short story, as well.																									And sailing abroad for higher studies she may be if everything goes well. A course in performance studies or drama therapy could help the Libran take up counselling using drama therapy as the medium.

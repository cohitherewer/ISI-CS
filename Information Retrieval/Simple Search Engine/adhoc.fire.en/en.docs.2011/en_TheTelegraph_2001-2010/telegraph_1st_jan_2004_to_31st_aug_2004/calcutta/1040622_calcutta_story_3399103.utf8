 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Three key no-parking zones in Salt Lake
 							 - Crackdown on autos for smoother traffic A STAFF REPORTER																								The planners of Salt Lake have drawn a roadmap for the township with no-parking zones and one-ways. A high-level meeting was held on Monday for proper traffic management in Salt Lake.																								Plans were drawn up for smooth traffic movement in Salt Lake, Debi Prasad Chattopadhyay, sub-divisional information and cultural officer of Salt Lake disclosed.																								Three no-parking zones have been identified at PNB island, in front of City Centre and the stretch between water tank no. 4 and the green verge on First Avenue (between BD and BE blocks).																								With the number of vehicles rising sharply, traffic chaos has also shot up. Adding to this are vehicles being parked at random, causing severe traffic commotion, said an official of Bidhannagar Municipality. 																								Traffic snarls were regular in front of City Centre due to wayward car-parking. So, we have decided to mark the area a no-parking zone, he said.																								Three sides of the City Centre are fee-parking zones, but the front of the complex, on Third Avenue, is a no-parking pocket. It has been noticed that people are not using the fee-parking zone and, instead, parking their cars on Third Avenue, which is a busy road, a civic official said. 																								This is disrupting traffic movement and so, no one will be allowed to park vehicles on the road, he added.																								Vehicles coming towards Sech Bhavan and Bikash Bhavan along Third Avenue will now have to take the Second Crossroad (EC island) and then follow Second Avenue towards Karunamoyee. Also, plying of autorickshaws and taxis will be prohibited on the road leading out of the township through gate no.1 near Ultadanga. 																								Signboards, indicating turns and speed limits, will be put up at identified spots for the benefit of both driver and pedestrian. 																								Parking of vehicles will be strictly prohibited, except for the places earmarked for the purpose, a senior police officer of Salt Lake said. No vehicles, buses or autorickshaws will be allowed to stop or park within a distance of 50 m from road crossings or islands.																								The meeting also decided to crack down on unauthorised autorickshaws and rickshaws plying in the township. Officials said more than 400 autos ply in Salt Lake, of which at least 200 had no proper documents. 																								Earlier, Salt Lake police had taken up several drives against unauthorised autos but they are back on the road. We are planning another major drive soon as a part of this plan, a police officer said. Next month, another meeting will be held to review the situation. 																								Officials also hinted at new fee-parking zones in the township. Plans are underway for parking zones at all the major markets. Details are being worked out, revealed Banibrata Gupta, executive engineer of Bidhannagar Municipality. 																								Presently, the civic body earns nearly Rs 8 lakh from various parking zones across the township.

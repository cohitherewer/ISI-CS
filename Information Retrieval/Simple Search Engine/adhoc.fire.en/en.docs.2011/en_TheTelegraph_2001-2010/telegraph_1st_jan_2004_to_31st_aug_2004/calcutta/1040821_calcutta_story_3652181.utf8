And you dont have to pay a fortune at a star spa to wallow in the exotic mud. Park Tropicana, the unisex salon on Park Street, is hosting a 15-day festival called Mineral Line Beauty Fest offering a host of mineral treatments culled from the Dead Sea. Mineral Line is a range of products that use minerals and water from the Dead Sea. Since it has been a big hit with customers in the city, we decided to have a fest that would not just allow Calcuttans to try the treatment but also get attractive discounts, said Jayshree Shah of the salon. A Mineral Line manicure free with a treatment worth Rs 250, a pedicure for a bill of Rs 500, a facial costing Rs 1,100 free with a bill of Rs 750 and all three free if you spend Rs 1,000 on packages, are the top draws. The minerals are meant to exfoliate dead cells, while the mud helps rejuvenate the skin. Packs are as varied as their uses. While we have a hair mask and a black mud shampoo, we also have a muddy treat exclusively for the face, arms and feet, explained Jayshree. Besides basic trimmings like manicure, pedicure and facials, a body polishing treatment is also available. The body massage uses a combination of minerals and mud, said Jayshree. A stray treatment, however, is not enough, warns Jayashree. One has to follow up at home for long lasting effect, she said, displaying as many as 33 products to choose from.

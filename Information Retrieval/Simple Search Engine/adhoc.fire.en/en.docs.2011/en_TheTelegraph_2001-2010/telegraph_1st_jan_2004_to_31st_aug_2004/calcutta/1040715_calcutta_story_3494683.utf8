 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Feeling the pulse of humanity
																								It took a death and two decades thereafter for the works of Saadat Hasan Manto to receive the respect and recognition that eluded them for so long. It is one of lifes ironies that the stories that were repeatedly condemned during Mantos lifetime were the very stories that were subsequently translated into several Indian languages by dint of their social and aesthetic relevance. In a fitting tribute to the brilliance of an artist, who was doomed to meet death in exile, Rangakarmee presents Badnam Manto, an assemblage of three collages. The first collage has been woven out of two stories, namely, Kali Shalwar and Hattak, both of which are realistic portrayals of life in the lower rungs of society with humanity surfacing through the strangest expressions, more often than not in a melange of pathos and triumph. The second collage centres around Mantos stories of the Partition and throw light on the trauma it had on his psyche. The third and final collage focuses on Saadat Hasan Manto the man and the writer.																								Event: Play in Hindi, Badnam Manto, produced by Rangakarmee																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

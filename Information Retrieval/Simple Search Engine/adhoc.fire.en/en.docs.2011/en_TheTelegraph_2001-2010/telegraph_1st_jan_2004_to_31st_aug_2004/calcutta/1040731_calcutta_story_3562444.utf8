 KINSUK BASU 																								How does one make sure that blood from the bank is absolutely safe? If it is from a government hospital you would want to take a harder look. One may want to check the condition of the blood bank, the quality of blood and the life-span of the sample being handed over. But how can one be sure of the quality of the kit used to check the presence of the HIV virus? 																								What with stray cases of accidental HIV infection during blood transfusion being reported, mandarins of the health department, for the first time, are considering the idea of taking a fresh look at the quality of kits in use across the state-run hospitals. Under consideration, since cheap kits are favoured owing to budgetary constraints, though, as insiders will tell you, not all of them are fit for conducting the tests imperative to ensure safe blood.																								Kits recommended for use at state-run blood banks are supplied by two companies. Each single-use kit costs something between Rs 7 and 8. Once the kit is selected, a sample is sent to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases at Beliaghata for a test before it is recommended for use, says a senior officer of the West Bengal AIDS Prevention and Control Society. On the face of it, there is nothing wrong with this system. 																								But think of those who use it on a daily basis to screen between 12,000 and 20,000 blood samples every month at their blood banks/testing centres. Officers and technicians will tell you a frightening story. 																								For an HIV test, a kit-plate is prepared with 96 micro-wells  minute U-shaped well-like holes  filled with serum samples. Each of these samples is first washed and then treated with the necessary reagents to get the changing colour that typifies the nature of the samples  yellow, pink and so on. This change of colour is registered in a printer attached with the plate. The colour printer offers a specific reading with a specific value. After tabulating the outcome with the readings, it is known whether the sample is positive or negative. 																								The problem lies with the lining of the micro-wells. Between the two types  HIV-I and HIV II  there are 17 sub-types starting from A. In India, with sub-type C being the most prevalent form, the kits in use have an antigen coat that only detects the C-sub-type. It automatically excludes the other sub-types, and herein lies the problem, explains a senior medical officer of the School of Tropical Medicine. According to virologists and haematologists at the SSKM and NRS hospitals, a kit with the necessary antigen coatings costs between Rs 38 and 40. 																								The problem lies both with the system of checking the kits and the budgetary limitations of the state. Companies send their best sample for the kit test. But when it comes to bulk production, often the kits are not up to the mark. Owing to the funds crunch one cannot go in for the best, says an officer of the Calcutta Medical College Blood Bank. So thousands whose lives depend upon the serum continue to run the risk of contracting the deadly virus.

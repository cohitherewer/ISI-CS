The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Bus bandh in fuel bill blow
 																											- Gherao marks Day I of taxi strike, Subhas firm on no-rollback stand A STAFF REPORTER		 Foreign visitors to the city are stranded  outside Howrah station on Tuesday, the first day of  an indefinite taxi strike called to protest the high  courts Bharat Stage II deadline, rising taxes  and police excesses. Picture by Amit DattaIf Tuesday was bad, Wednesday will be worse. About 30,000 taxis and 18,000  luxury taxis went off the city streets on Day I of an indefinite  strike, leaving commuters stranded, at the station and in  the city centre.																								There was some confusion over how long the strike would continue, with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty claiming at Writers Buildings that Bengal Taxi Association (BTA) president Bimal Guha had assured him of operators calling off the strike late on Tuesday.																								But Guha and the other taxi associations denied any talks with the minister to this effect and pledged to carry on with the stay-off-the-road protest.																								The ground reality is likely to go grim on Wednesday, as a section of private bus and minibus operators, under the banner of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, embarks on a days token strike. Over 15,000 private buses and minibuses will go off the roads, council president Sadhan Das said.																								They have called the strike to protest the hike in fuel prices. Such hikes should be opposed. Moreover, it is only a days token strike, said minister Chakraborty. The Bengal Bus Syndicate, however, is not taking part in Wednesdays strike.																								As far as cabs go, the BTA, Calcutta Taxi Association, Progressive Taximens Union and the Luxury Taxi Association have all pitched in to protest the unreasonable hike in motor vehicle taxes, the unrealistic Bharat Stage II April 2004 deadline and the indifferent attitude of the state machinery.																								Nearly 2,000 taxis, many plastered with protest papers, laid siege on the public vehicles department (PVD) office at Beltala for over three hours on Tuesday afternoon. They even stopped people from paying their taxes, disrupting work at the office.																								The transport minister said he had asked the PVD director and the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) to meet the public transport operators in order to address their grievances.																								I also made it clear that the government, at the moment, cannot roll back any taxes, as the new structure has been framed as per law. So, if we are to make any changes in the tax structure, the relevant Act needs to be amended. But I assure the public transport operators that I will look into their other grievances, like police excesses. Even after this, if the taxi operators continue their strike, let them do so, Chakraborty told Metro.																								The transport minister went on to claim that the taxi trade in the city would collapse if the operators held such strikes and insisted on inconveniencing commuters.

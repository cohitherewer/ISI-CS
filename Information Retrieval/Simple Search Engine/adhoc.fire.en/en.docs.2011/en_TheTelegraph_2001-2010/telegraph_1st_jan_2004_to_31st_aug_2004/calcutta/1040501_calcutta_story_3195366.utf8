 Models at the Kyra display. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															 Kyra, the label launched by Komal Sood, opened a new outlet at Tollygunge Club earlier this week.																					The shop stocks sporty westerns and Indo-westerns with a bit of luxury. Clubbing is associated with lighter moods, said Komal. So the clothes at Kyras new address can be best described as simple on the cuts, bright on the hues, experimental in character and chic in appeal.																					Its a great honour to be able to sell from here. The club has a very distinct character and I can expect a loyal clientele from among the members.																					The inauguration saw members trooping in to take a look at the clothes and listen to the talk delivered by photographer and stylist Swarup Dutta from the National Institute of Fashion Technology.																					Touching upon fashion trends this summer and influences behind them, the presentation focused on four movements: placement prints, the Chinese look, a touch of luxury and crochet. Models Sreshtha and Jenny walked the store in outfits representing each of these trends.																					The placement prints constitute Oriental geometrics and airship motifs. Mandarin collars, wrapover tops with straight trousers, lightweight cottons, delicate tie-up tops make up the Chinese look. Beads, sequins, embroidery, cherub prints, graphical shirts and patchwork are the interesting elements of the luxury line. The girly, tie-up and stringed define crochet.																					Prices at the store range from Rs 450 for khadi kurtis to Rs 950 for a pair of corduroy capris. 																																													Fabric show																					 Hectic trading was on at The Oberoi Grand on Wednesday, where wholesalers, representatives of authorised retailers and stockists of Vimal converged for the East Zone Trade Meet of Reliance Industries Limited, textile division.																					In an effort to stay abreast of customer preferences, K. Narayan, president, textile sector, Reliance Industries, unveiled 2,000 designs of saris, which were the result of extensive market research conducted by the company. Priced between Rs 199 and Rs 1,200, the saris come in fabrics ranging from chiffon to georgette, brocade and jacquard.																					He singled out the polyester and cotton shirtings, and border pallu designs as those in maximum demand out of the vast Vimal range. For the puja rush, the company registered orders from retailers and wholesalers to the tune of Rs 30 crores, he revealed.																					The ready-to-wear collection, comprising formal shirts and T-shirts for men, to be available at select showrooms, is worth a look. We do 25 per cent of our total business in suitings and saris in eastern India, so it is important to keep track on the trends in this region, he explained.

 Thursday, June 03, 2004 Bangle bonanzaSocial Register Model Pinki showcases Gold Factory bangles. Picture by Rashbehari Das  The yellow-metal magic continues on Wednesday. Quite a few of the big jewellery houses are hosting some gold festival or the other and the latest to join the fray is Gold Factory, which unveiled a new range of bangles.The Gariahat showroom launched its first range of bangles, the speciality of which lies in the weight of the pieces.We have introduced a range of balas which are extremely light-weight, ranging between 15 gm and 20 gm for a pair, explains Vrinda Ganguly Sirkar, designer at Gold Factory.These are lac-filled balas, 22 carat gold. It is extremely difficult to make such light-weight bangles, but we have managed because we concentrated more on simple designs which dont require much gold, but are nice to look at. These balas can be worn daily, she adds.A variety of nakshas have been combined with screwpaak, a traditional art form used in bangles, to create a modern look which goes with the preferences of the modern day woman, informs Vrinda. The store has come up with around 30 designs to start out with. The line is affordably priced between Rs 9,000 and Rs 12,500 for a pair. They are also sold as single pieces, the prices coming down accordingly, starting at Rs 5,000.

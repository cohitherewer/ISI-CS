 																											- Repeat offenders face prosecution for overcharging on beer, water SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The government, which has been sharpening its knives for a while, is now ready to dig into a couple of eateries for over-charging customers while serving packaged drinks, including beer and bottled water.																								Consumer affairs department officials said the two bar-cum-restaurants  Badshah, on Lindsay Street, and Jimmys Kitchen, on AJC Bose Road  had failed to follow their repeated directives regarding mentioning the prices of packaged items and service charges separately on the menu card and on the bill.																								The two addresses were also asked not to charge a single paisa over and above the maximum retail price (MRP) printed on the bottles, going by the Packaged Commodities Act. Hotels and restaurants, however, do claim service charges for serving packaged drinks.																								We had earlier imposed a cash penalty of Rs 5,000 on both the bars for overpricing and warned them not to repeat the offence. We had also asked the owner to change the menu card, but they did not pay heed to our pleas, said Ashok Bhattacharya, controller of legal metrology of the consumer affairs department.																								We then found that both the eateries were making customers pay more than the MRP. As the eateries concerned have committed the same offence for the second time, they will be prosecuted, he added.																								Under Section 33 of the Standard Weights and Measures Enforcement Act, 1985, punishment for second-time violation of the MRP is imprisonment up to one year. Law officers have been instructed to move the high court, he added.																								The first complaint about overpricing against Badshah was lodged by some consumers a month ago. The second complaint came from consumer affairs secretary Pradip Bhattacharya himself. He had gone to Badshah last week for lunch, and then brought the bill to the notice of the legal metrology department. 																								The bill showed the cost of a bottle of beer as Rs 70 (MRP Rs 38) and a bottle of mineral water as Rs 16 (MRP Rs 10), officials in the consumer affairs department said.																								They added that Jimmys Kitchen charges Rs 100 for a bottle of beer (MRP Rs 36 to Rs 40).																								The proprietor of Badshah, Usha Ranjan Duttagupta, said he would appeal to the consumer affairs department for time. We have no problems charging the MRP for packaged items and have decided to change our menu card, but this will take some time, said Duttagupta.																								Jimmys Kitchen manager Ayan DCosta said: It was just a mistake. We request the government to give us another chance for rectification.

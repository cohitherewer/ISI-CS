 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Swansong from dawn
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Is this his swansong? Friday the 13th began with a pleasant surprise for inmates of Alipore Central jail: they woke up to the strains of music. 																								In keeping with one of Dhananjoy Chatterjees last wishes, the authorities had ensured that the man condemned to death could enjoy some music. Microphones were set up in all corners of the prison and music was played.																								This is quite unusual. Except for the Pujas, such arrangements are a rarity for the inmates of this jail. In the past decade, I dont remember having heard songs over a microphone, said a senior warden on morning shift. 																								Excitement ran high during lunch time, when a few inmates came out of their cells and tried to go near the office of the social welfare officer to catch a glimpse of Dhananjoy in cell no. 3. That was the closest one could go. Before too many inquisitive souls could reach, the wardens sent them back to the queue for lunch.																								Lunch over, it was life as usual for all, including those in the double-storeyed cells far off, and the closest ones in cell nos. 1 and 4. Late in the afternoon, more wardens were posted outside cell no. 3, and it was announced that no one would be allowed to walk close to a small stretch of asphalt leading to the cell. 																								Dhananjoy, by this time, had accepted his fate and even smiled and talked with those on duty outside his cell. This was soon after he had had a sumptuous lunch with the social welfare officer Sikha Roy, while songs played.																								Around 2 pm, the authorities suddenly decided to cancel all interviews of inmates with their relatives. With the prison top brass not willing to take chances, all inmates were barred from approaching the gate outside the jail superintendents office to peek through the window. 																								Then, the officers told us selective interviews were fine. We immediately called some and the interviews wrapped up by 3.30 pm, said a guard on duty outside the jailers office. Those who turned up late were asked to return on Saturday. 																								Visitors who did not get to meet the inmates did not regret it, for they witnessed jail officials erecting a makeshift cover over the gallows. We learnt that photographers were planning to shoot from afar, from the top of a highrise off Bhavani Bhaban. So, it was decided to cover the gallows with tarpaulin, said a jail official.

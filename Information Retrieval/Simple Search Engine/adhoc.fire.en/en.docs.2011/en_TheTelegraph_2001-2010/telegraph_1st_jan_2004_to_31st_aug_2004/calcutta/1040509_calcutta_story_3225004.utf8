The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Last pitch for ballot blessing halts traffic
 A STAFF REPORTERPersonal touch: Moushumi Chatterjee, Congress candidate from Calcutta Northeast (top), and Sushma Swaraj, campaigning for BJPs Tapan Sikdar at Agarpara, on Saturday. Pictures by Pradip Sanyal																								Decibels soared, promises rolled and wheels jammed as campaigning reached fever pitch in every corner of the city. 																								Saturday witnessed the final pitch for Calcuttas support as candidates, leaders and star campaigners hit top gear to woo voters in the last few hours before campaigning for Mondays elections came to an end.																								Traffic police had a tough time keeping track of the meetings and processions through the day. Braving the sweltering heat, leaders of political parties assembled at various road intersections, disrupting traffic for hours. Those attending programmes to mark Tagores birth anniversary got stranded on their way back.																								Officials said rallies that affected life totalled in triple digits. Ballygunge Circular Road was a centre of action for all the parties, and innumerable processions passed the stretch between 9.30 am and noon. Consequently, traffic at Ballygunge Phari, Hazra, Sarat Bose Road and AJC Bose Road was affected.																								The situation was the worst in central Calcutta as both Trinamul Congress and Congress supporters laid a virtual siege at the Central Avenue crossing for hours in the morning. The problem was compounded after a huge CPM procession wound its way through various lanes and bylanes and converged at the CR Avenue crossing.																								The Trinamul Congress-organised processions held up traffic during peak hours. From 10.30 am till noon, the MG Road-Rabindra Sarani-BT Road-Sinthee More area bore the brunt as a procession passed by. Another rally started at 11.30 am from the Lake Market area, headed for Gariahat. A third procession walked south along Brabourne Road, disrupting traffic to and from Howrah.																								An Independent candidate backed by the Congress took to the streets with his supporters between 1.30 pm and 3.30 pm, halting traffic from Beadon Street to Haryana Bhavan via Hazra.																								Two CPM processions started simultaneously at around 4 pm, from Central Avenue and Creek Row. While one set off for Shyambazar, the other moved to SN Banerjee Road.																								For those caught on the campaign trail, the only escape route lay underground. There has been a spurt in passengers by almost 20 per cent since Thursday, a Metro Railway official confirmed.

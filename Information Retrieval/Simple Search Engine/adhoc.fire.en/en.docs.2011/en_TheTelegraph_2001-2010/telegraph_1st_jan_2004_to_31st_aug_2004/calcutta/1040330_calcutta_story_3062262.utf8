				 	 E-reminders for special days: A friends best friend. (AFP)																								If you are one of those black sheep who always forgets everyones birthday, you are fast running out of reasons.																								There is one e-mail that everyone who is connected is getting nowadays. Its not a virus, its not spam. It is a request from a friend or acquaintance to fill out their birthday details. www.birthdayalarm.com, a free birthday reminder service, is the biggest thing going around, but cyberspace offers other options, too.																								Birthdayalarm is a user-friendly, colourful and fast site. After a simple registration process, you can send out mail to friends (particularly handy for Yahoo mail users, as it gives direct access to your address book), asking them to fill in their birthday details.																								The site will e-mail you a reminder about all listed birthdays well in advance, if you prefer, leaving enough time to buy a present, too.																								While ordering gift baskets and flowers is also possible through the site, the California-based company only delivers to addresses in the US and Canada. But you can send an e-card for special occasions apart from birthdays as well  from April Fools Day to anniversaries. These can be personalised with uploaded pictures.																								And for those bothered about being on the wrong side of the age hill, disclosing year of birth is not mandatory! 																								While filling in information on a friends request, the site does its best to guilt you into registration with harsh sarcasm. I never forget a birthday and never need to send a card it says, if you choose to ignore the offer for reminders of your friends birthdays.																								I always forget birthdays, and it would become quite embarrassing. I dont know how far using the reminder service will help, but at least I am making an effort, feels Deepa, a new user.																								Thoughtfulness made easy is the promise held out by www.BigDates.com, which provides a similar service. This is also a colourful site, which has the added feature of cellphone alerts. Other options are www.happybirthday.com and www.candor.com.																								An interesting variation to this theme is available on the chat software ICQ, where you have the option of reminding your friends about your own birthday.

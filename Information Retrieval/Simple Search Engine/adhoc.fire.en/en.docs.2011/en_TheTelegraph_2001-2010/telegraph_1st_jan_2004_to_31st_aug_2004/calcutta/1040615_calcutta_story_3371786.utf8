The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 No trace of glacier victims
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday said the bodies of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel killed in the mountaineering expedition to Sunderdhunga glacier in Uttaranchal have not yet been recovered. The bodies are buried under almost 14 feet of rocks. The weather conditions are such that the bodies havent even been sighted, let alone extricated, from underneath the rocks, Bhattacharjee said.																								Seven of the survivors will board the Bagh Express on Tuesday for Howrah and will be back home after a 36-hour journey. The remaining two members of the expedition will stay back in Uttaranchal and coordinate with the rescue teams.																								According to DC (North) Ranvir Kumar, rescue operations were hindered by poor weather conditions. Two rescue teams are on the job, one comprising the Indo-Tibet Border Police while the other comprises the district administration.																								The survivors have identified the accident site. But, there is no space even to stand. The ground is covered by over 14 feet of rocks. To extricate the bodies, the rocks will have to be removed. Its snowing there everyday and stones are hanging overhead precariously. This makes the possibility of the recurrence of a similar accident very real, Kumar said.																								The 14-member team had set off on a trekking expedition to the glacier on June 1 from the city and was scheduled to be back on June 13. The RAF team on an unofficial trekking trip had pitched their tents near Sukhram Cave last Wednesday night and were headed for Pindari Glacier. 																								Five RAF personnel were killed in a landslide, while nine sustained injuries. The five dead include sergeants Chandan Bhattacharya and Jibon Chand and constables Tarun Mondol, Partha Sarathi Das and Uttam Debnath. The other seven members escaped unhurt. The team was resting for the night in a makeshift tent when they were first hit by an avalanche followed by a landslide.																								Mountaineering experts termed it an irony since this glacier is considered one of the most accessible of the Himalayan glaciers. A Calcutta Police team reached Nainital the next day and co-ordinated rescue operations.

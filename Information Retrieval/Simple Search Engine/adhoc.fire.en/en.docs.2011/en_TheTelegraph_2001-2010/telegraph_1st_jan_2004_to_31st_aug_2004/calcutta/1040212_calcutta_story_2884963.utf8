The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, February 12, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Christina Ricci, actressYou never hesitate to help people and expect the same from them. A little less pride will make you more likeable. Beware of being a victim of someones machinations. You like to rub shoulders with the successful. Relationships with friends and family will be harmonious. Go for green, purple and yellow.   Kusum Bhandari

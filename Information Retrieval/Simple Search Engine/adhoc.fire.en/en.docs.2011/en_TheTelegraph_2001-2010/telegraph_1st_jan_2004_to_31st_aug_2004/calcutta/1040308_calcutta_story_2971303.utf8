 															- GLASGOW STUDY vindicates pill therapy efficacy A STAFF REPORTER																								A combination of homoeopathy and allopathic medicines is extremely effective in the management of diabetes and there is no conflict between the two modes of therapy in combating the sweet killer, according to Mukesh Batra, one of the pioneers of modern homoeopathy in the country.																								Clinical trials worldwide have vindicated the efficacy of homoeopathy in the treatment of diabetes, and contrary to common perception, it can be safely administered alongside allopathic hypoglycemic agents, said Batra. The professor emeritus at the College of Homoeopathy, USA, and Hahnemann College of Homoeopathy, UK, was in town as part of a whistle-stop national tour to raise awareness on the disease.																								Batra felt Calcutta, which has the largest number of homoeopaths in India and where the method of treatment is well accepted, should use this resource pool to help its soaring diabetic population cope better with the curse. West Bengal alone accounts for 24 lakh of the countrys nearly three crore diagnosed diabetics.																								Apart from being evidence-based, cost-effective and compatible with allopathic medicine, homoeopathy is very useful in dealing with long-term side-effects of diabetes, like coronary artery disease, retinopathy, kidney failure, neuropathy and diabetic foot disease, said Batra, CMD of Dr Batras Positive Health Clinic.																								The clinics Calcutta branch now has a patient base of 6,786, growing 53 per cent from last year. With the increasing prevalence of the silent killer in urban environments due to stress, unhealthy diet, lifestyle and obesity, we have decided to enhance our focus on diabetes at our clinics, including Calcutta, he said.																								Batra, governing body member of the Central Council of Research in Homoeopathy in the Union health ministry, pointed out that the Rs 630-crore homoeopathy market in India is growing at 25 per cent every year. The science, which now forms approximately 14 per cent of the total alternative market, controls diabetes by treating the root cause of the problem and by increasing the bodys resistance power, he explained.																								To illustrate that the methodology is totally evidence-based, Batra referred to a clinical research study conducted at the Glasgow Homoeopathy Hospital, UK. In the study, 100 non-insulin dependent patients, between 40 and 62 years old, with diabetic complications, were treated constitutionally with homoeopathy.																								Blood sugar levels were normalised in 84 of the cases, the rest having dropped out. In a follow-up of 65 cases for a further five years, the sugar level was always normal in 32 cases and drugs were needed from time to time for 33 cases. There is also this misconception that homoeopathy pills are sweet and hence, not suitable for diabetes. But diabetics can always have aqua-based homoeopathy pills, Batra said.

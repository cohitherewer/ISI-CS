 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 A dash of Ash for Oberoi grand
				 	 Vivek and Ash up close in Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... releasing at INOX, 89 Cinemas, Priya, Navina, Paradise																								Vivek Oberoi is not your typical Bollywood big boy. You keep messaging him for an interview over one whole week and draw a blank. And then, with just a day to go for his acid (read: Ash-id) test called Kyun! Ho Gaya Na he calls up and coolly says: Hi, this is Vivek Oberoi from Bombay. I was on my promotion tour and couldnt reply. Can we do the interview now?																								Perhaps thats what gets Ash to make a dash for this stylebhai  in Sameer Karniks directorial debut, that is.																								Kyun! Ho Gaya Na is a lovely light romantic comedy and it has shaped up really well, says Vivek. It has a fresh feel to it and whosoever has seen it has liked it immensely No one really goes out to make a flop film. I feel, you just have to give your best and hope that the film is able to speak for itself.																								Its difficult to talk to the man and not ask about the prized Company he keeps in the film, and otherwise. I think the chemistry between Aishwarya and me has worked in the film very well. A BBC correspondent saw the film a couple of days ago and wrote back saying how good we look in the film, he states.																								But as soon as you try and link the on-screen chemistry with the much-publicised real-life romance, Vivek takes off on a tangent. I tell you what, whether it is gin or whiskey or rum that you mix with water, you are bound to get high. I am that water. First, everyone spoke about the chemistry between Antara and me (Company and Road), then they went ga-ga over Rani and me in Saathiya and then no one could stop talking about the Yuva song featuring Kareena and me. Guess I look good with everyone. Time to pause and flash the trademark Vivek grin.																								But does the very mention of Yuva still bring back the horrors of the bike accident on Vidysagar Setu? It conjures up a wide spectrum of memories ranging from a whole lot of happiness to acute pain, says the star on a sombre note. 																								But had it not been for that pain I would have never known the love and support the city has for me. Many major metros have a very disconnected lifestyle but not so with Calcutta  the doctors, the nurses, the people who waited outside the hospital praying for me  they were all so wonderful and caring. I would love to go back and shoot there again.																								Then why didnt he come to town to promote Kyun! Ho Gaya Na while going to places like Amravati and Lucknow? One should understand it is not actors who make these tour plans, he protests. It is the actors job to give dates to his producer and from there on it depends on him how he wants to use them.																								While Vivek may sound a touch touchy about his producer(s), he is in absolute awe of his directors. I have been really, really lucky to have had the opportunity of working with such fine directors so early in my careers. I do not believe in being stuck to a set image and would rather be known as someone who can do different kinds of roles. And to achieve this versatility, if I have to do multi-starrers (like Masti), I do not care.																								For now, its one step at a time for fast n furious Vivek. I am finishing Subhash Ghais Kisna and then I will do a thriller jointly produced by Karan Johar and Shah Rukh Khan. Only after these two will I consider new projects.						PRATIM D. GUPTA

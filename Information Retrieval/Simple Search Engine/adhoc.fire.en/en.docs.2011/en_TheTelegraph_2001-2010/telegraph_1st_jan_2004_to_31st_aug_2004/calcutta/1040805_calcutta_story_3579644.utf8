 Thursday, August 05, 2004 Have a bash with a splash
Plan a PartyZeeshan Jawed works out a formula for some wet and wild fun this season
	Do
Arrange for an artificial sprinkler as back-up
Have a barbecue counter in one corner 
Peppy music is a must to get you into the groove Dont Wear elaborate clothes. This is not a good occasion to show off designer labels If you are at home this weekend, it could mean two things. Either you are bored partying out every weekend, or simply you have not been invited to any bash! In either case you need not worry. The enforced leisure can be well utilised. What you require is an idea (and if you dont have any, keep watching this space!), some basic infrastructure and loads of attitude and you just might have a rocking party on your hands.Now that the monsoons are on in full swing one must make most of the brief window of opportunity. The idea is to have the bash with a splash. Let down your hair, get rid of all inhibitions and get soaked in the droplets (and just in case the windows disappoint, read on). Invite some friends over who share your passion for getting wet and look forward to a rollicking weekend raindance.The venueHit your backyard or terrace, if you have the luxury of having a spacious one. A rooftop that is partly covered is an ideal option, because its possible that there would be members in the group who would not like to get wet. Dont forget to throw in some plastic chairs for those who prefer to laze around.Style talkTo begin with, you have to be in the right frame of mind and the right attire. So bring out your capris and shorts to flaunt that figure that is usually hidden away. Pull on a snazzy T-shirt, or something more see-through, if you dare. For the feet, floaters are just perfect. Whatever you are wearing should be colourful enough to be in sync with the mood.On the menuRemember a party should start in high spirits and with the right spirits. For the beach-bum ambience, beer fits in fine. Punch or some Breezers might work well for the rest of the gang. Dont forget about the grub, either. Stick to finger food here  it will all get soggy, after all. Cheese balls and kebabs, and maybe a barbecue (on a well-protected side) could be just the combo you are looking for. Tune talesYour choice of music is the most critical to set the mood. The emphasis, explains DJ Harish of Dublin, should be on the oomph element. Music with sex appeal, exotica and colour is perfect for a high-energy event like a raindance, he says. His top pick this season would be a remix of Bheegey Honth Tere. A couple of hip hop numbers like Turn Me On by Kevin Little, Yeah by Usher, R amp;B tracks like Superstar by Jamelia and a dose of wacky funky house like Make Love by Room 5 could be the perfect monsoon melodies. Remixes like the naughty Chhod Do Aanchal could add to the excitement.Watch outThere are certain things that any party-thrower should guard against. Make sure the crowd gels with the theme. A hydrophobic person, for example, would be best kept far away from your bash. Keep him on the guest list for your next indoor party. Also, be prepared to clean up after one huge mess. Your backyard is likely to be a muddy heap and your terrace will be, at the very least, strewn with some leftovers.And finally...All your plans can go down the drain if it does not rain on D-night. So, in case the rain gods decide to play truant, have a back-up ready. Artificial sprinklers are the best option. If you dont have them, they can be hired from event managers or even film studios. If all else fails, just keep a hose handy and gallons of water stored in buckets, ready to be splashed. And then, be prepared for absolute mayhem

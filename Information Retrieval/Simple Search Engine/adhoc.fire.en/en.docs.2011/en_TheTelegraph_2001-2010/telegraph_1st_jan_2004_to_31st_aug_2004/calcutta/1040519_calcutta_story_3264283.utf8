The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Weekend for fun or franchise
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should polling be scheduled only for weekends?				 Time no bar: A long queue in front of a polling boothSeraj Alam, 
																		Bansberia																																																														Yes, polling should be restricted to weekends. It hinders the daily routine of students and office-goers if held on other days. Work comes to a standstill in most schools and colleges as educational institutions are earmarked as polling centres. Public transport becomes scarce, making it an ordeal to reach ones workplace on time. Polling on weekends will ease the whole democratic process. 									

B.N. Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														This is a good idea indeed. Several schools, colleges and private organisations remain closed on Saturdays. If polls are held on Saturdays, people can cast their votes comfortably. 									

K.L. Ghosh,
																		Kalindi																																																														In my opinion, the solution to the problem lies in the question itself. Polling should be scheduled for weekends to prevent loss of precious man-hours. Also, the total number of days taken to complete the election process in the whole country should be reduced. 									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia, Nadia																																																														No. The electorate should not be deprived of the pleasure of having the weekends to themselves. Polling should be scheduled only for working days. 									

Piyal Mukherjee, 
																		Lake Town																																																														In India, parliamentary elections are held in phases as a considerable number of polling personnel is required for conducting the electoral process. So, if elections are scheduled only for weekends it will take at least a few weeks just to get it over within the whole country. The proposition, therefore, is not feasible. 									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park																																																														Polling booths are usually housed in educational institutions and public. And the polling day is generally treated as a holiday. Thus, on one hand, there is a loss of classes causing a backlog of the academic syllabi and on the other, there is a huge loss of man-hours across the country. To prevent such irregularity, the proposed polling schedule will undoubtedly go a long way. It is always wiser to make use of a holiday than to turn a working day into one. 									

Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna																																																														The polling schedule is drawn up by the election commission as per its convenience. It has no compulsions to fix elections on weekends. But ideally, weekends should be reserved for personal work and under no circumstance should it be turned into a polling day. It suits us best when the government declares a holiday for the election. Satyen Biswas, 
																		Behala																																																														It is best to choose the first day of the week for polling.									

Prasanta Dutta, 
																		Barrackpore																																																														Yes, it would be better if polling is scheduled for weekends. Many routine chores can be done without hassles on a working day than on a holiday. Besides, our economy loses a huge amount of revenue if routine work is stalled even for a single day. Although polling is an integral part of the democratic process, it should not be scheduled on a working day. When we have the option of using the weekend, why not use it? 									

Tanmoy Das,
																		Address not given 																																																														I would say no. Weekends are reserved to cultivate our hobbies and for other forms of recreation. So, it makes no sense to have polling on weekends. Moreover, each day in a daily-wagers life is a battle to put together two square meals for his family. Losing a working day means he and his family going without food. An official holiday should not be declared in schools, because in remote areas lured by the party workers even school students, below the age of 18, turn up to cast votes. If classes are held on the polling day at least these children will desist from such practices. So what if the elections take place in four to five phases across the country? If people are trustworthy enough, then even seven to eight phases can be simultaneously conducted. 									

Atif Ayaz, 
																		Serampore																																																														I am definitely in favour of polling on weekends. It would be beneficial for students because polls are held in educational institutions. The proposal, if implemented, will save them from missing precious classes. When major competitive examinations and important cultural events can be held during weekends then what is the problem in conducting polls on a Sunday?									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
																		Behala																																																														Polling should be scheduled only for weekends. There will be no loss of work and the average production level of the country will remain stable. Pressure on the transport system and power supply is comparatively less during weekends. The electorate has to be sanctioned a paid holiday on the poll day. However, Lok Sabha polls which are generally held in phases cannot be stretched over too many weekends as this process will be time-consuming. In such cases, it becomes necessary to utilise a few weekdays along with a weekend. 									

Arijit Ghosh, 
																		Shyamnagar																																																														Polling is a useless activity as it doesnt help in the betterment of the country. Whichever party comes to power is bothered only about the personal aspirations of its leaders and not of the well-being of the citizens. So, it simply does not matter whether polling is scheduled on a working day or during the weekends. 									

Kunal Ray, 
																		SantragachhiI would rather debate the idea of polls being scheduled only for weekends. In the present times, we hardly get an opportunity to meet friends and family. The need to relax and unwind is often lost in the rat race for success on the professional front. Thus, after a hectic week, we eagerly await the weekends and if polls are scheduled on such days it will mar our plans. Especially, the youngsters may not turn up to cast their votes as they may be unwilling to let go of a chance to have fun on their off days.NEXT WEEKShould candidates be penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days?Send your views to The Telegraph (Metro),

 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Mrs. Soriano
																								Based on Filumena Marturano by Eduardo de Fillipo, Mrs. Soriano is Dolly Basus adaptation of this play revolving around the life of an elderly couple faced with the old mans senile decision to marry a younger woman. It is a story that bears a pressing social relevance in times when morality and commitment are dangerously poised on the edges of society, a society that is home to a milieu drunk with a heady liberation that has infected it to the core. The play refrains from imposing authoritarian statements on society and its functionings, but it does set the mind thinking on the primal emotions of mankind. Mrs. Soriano is a dramatisation of the importance of love in the life of Man and his instinctive battle to preserve its existence.																								Event: Play Mrs. Soriano by Choopkatha																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 EXTRAAA SPECIAL: Mandira Bedi stars in an impromptu antakshari session at one of the residences she visited on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 																								There are some 900 messages in the belly of her trusty Nokia Communicator. And around 300 of them are yet to be replied to.																								An indication of how busy Mandira Bedi is these days. She tries to hide the tiredness with a dazzling smile each time shes asked to pose for photos, but it shows nevertheless.																								In between flights and hotel rooms Im sometimes losing track of whats going on around me, she admits, but hastens to add that shed rather be this busy than sit at home doing nothing.																								On Saturday, Mandira was in town for less than 12 hours, having to cut short a longer trip due to urgent family matters that needed tending back home in Mumbai.																								She rushed off in the evening, but not before spending time with three families (winners of television channel SET Maxs Mandira aapke Ghar contest), sit pretty at a press conference and field calls on live dial-in programmes for two local cable networks.																								But the prime focus was on Mandira hopping homes. And it was no touch-and-go affair. I ensure that I spend some quality time with the family Im visiting, she stressed. 																								That meant, among other things, performing a small puja at one of the houses and playing antakshari in two of them (despite being a self-confessed besura).																								The scenes were much the same at the Tejwani home in Park Circus, the Banthia residence on Gurusaday Road and the Salt Lake Sector III address of Nikita Gupta.																								At every stop, as soon as the Tata Sumo carrying Mandira and the Max team arrived, neighbours, friends and curious onlookers craned and jostled for a glimpse. And Mandira ensured that her fans, particularly the shy ones, were not left out of the fun.																								There was this very shy boy of about 16 at one of the houses, Mandira later recalled, who was standing in a corner though he wanted to meet me. When I went and dragged him into the middle, he smiled so much that his mom said hes exhausted the quota of a years smiles.																								And smile they all did. Shes a big favourite of mine, said a middle-aged neighbour of the Banthias. I really didnt expect her to be so down-to-earth and friendly, she gushed.																								Calcutta wrapped up Mandiras 11-city tour for aapke Ghar. Shes been in and out of cities as far apart as Ludhiana, Nagpur, Surat and Hyderabad since January this year.																								Her third visit to the city in less than three months was made extraaaa special by the warmth (which is always there in Calcutta, she adds) and the efforts at every home to make this memorable.																								In the meantime, along with hubby Raj, shes managed to wrap up and promote Shaadi Ka Laddoo, and commence shooting for her next feature film, Divorce (no, not a sequel).																								A champion for womens cricket, Mandiras plans also include travelling to Sri Lanka for the Asia Cup final.																								And lest we forget, Lahore rocked, man!  her face lights up as she recalls the trip to watch two India-Pakistan matches of the ODI series. The people were incredibly friendly and hospitable, and there were absolutely no (security) concerns.																								For the present, its back to the grind of travel, shooting and promotions. But Im still loving every minute of it, she smiles, as the cameras go crazy.						SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

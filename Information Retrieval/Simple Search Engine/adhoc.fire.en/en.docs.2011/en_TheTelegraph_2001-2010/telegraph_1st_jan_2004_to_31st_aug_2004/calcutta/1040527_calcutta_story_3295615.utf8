 A STAFF REPORTER																								The first monthly meeting of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) after the Lok Sabha election on Wednesday had to be adjourned, amidst pandemonium, within 30 minutes of its start. 																								This followed mayor Subrata Mukherjees derogatory comment on a CPM councillor who had inquired how the reconstruction of Firpos market had been approved. The session resumed only after Mukherjee regretted his remark.																								Earlier, while entering the house, Mukherjee, who lost a Lok Sabha seat to CPM candidate Sudhanshu Sil, had remarked: In this country, one is punished for the theft of a cow or property, but no one is punished for the theft of votes.																								It was first time in any monthly session of the civic house that the CPM lent support to a Congress proposal. When Congress leader of the Opposition Sailen Dasgupta demanded that local councillors be consulted before carrying out any CMC work in his ward, CPM councillor Sukumar Sarkar strongly backed the demand.																								Later, CPM councillor Provakar Mondol, at a press conference, alleged that reconstruction of the gutted Firpos market had been approved though property tax of over Rs 25 lakh remained unrealised from it. According to him, the plot originally belonged to the trustees of Raja Rajendralal Mullick.																								In the CMC assessment register, the building is owned by Jitendra Mullick and Dhirendra Mullick, trustees of Raja Rajendralal Mullick. 																								It was leased out for a term of 38 years in 1973 to former Ritz Continental Limited. But the mailing address on the tax bill is given as Auto Distributor, 36, Jawaharlal Nehru Road. 																								Mondol said the Poddars had made an appeal for repairing the building and the CMC had allowed them to reconstruct it.																								Mayor Mukherjee said the Poddars had to pay Rs 50.85 lakh to clear the property tax dues. Since Firpos market is a heritage structure, the CMC cannot allow it to be razed. Whats the harm in allowing reconstruction if the Poddars restore at their own cost the heritage structure gutted two years ago? asked Mukherjee.																								He said the CMC had made it a policy to allow reconstruction on an as-it-was-built basis for markets and buildings with many tenants in the city proper. 																								Firpos market, when it caught fire two years ago, was basically a two-storey building, though in some parts it was a three-storey structure. Till 1960, Firpos was classy restaurant. In the late 60s, it turned sick and later reopened as a market.

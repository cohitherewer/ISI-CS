  Floored by fast life: Making merry  on a dance floor The report Home alone, and murdered (Dec. 26) is a cause of concern for housewives, who live in apartments and are left in the company of servants when the male members of the family are out on work.  The brutal murder of housewife Gayatri Singhal by her maid servant has put a question mark on the trust bestowed on maid servants or helping hands by employers. Another alarming example is Dhananjoy Chatterjee, the liftman of an apartment, who raped and murdered a schoolgirl when her mother trusted him with the flat keys, and went to a temple nearby. Calcuttans are worried as the murder of housewives by maid servants or other helping hands is on the rise. The problem is that housewives cannot do without helping hands, who mostly come to work when they are alone at home.  Perhaps the only way out is forming a close rapport with the local police, furnishing them with details and photographs of the servants before employing them. This will make the miscreants in the garb of servants think twice before striking.  Sunil Banerjee, 
 VIP Road.  Apropos the report Party hard, police at hand (Dec. 29), it is a matter of concern that liquor and loud music make some people lose all sense of proportion. The Bapi Sen episode is still vivid in our memory. Eve-teasing and committing nuisance in a drunken state have reached alarming proportions. The cops must keep a close watch on the party crowd.  Rabindra Nath Kar, 
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  It is sad to read that few officials attended the batsarik ceremony of Bapi Sen who gave his life fighting for a cause (Homage to a hero in uniform, Dec. 27). It is hoped that the police force will do better this time than what it did for the family of Vinod Mehta, another hero in uniform who was killed on duty. His wife Pinky had to run from pillar to post for her dues.  Purnima Vasudeva,
 Rowland Road.  This is a matter of shame that people armed with fake below-poverty-line (BPL) certificates take the advantage of free treatment at SSKM Hospital. (Treatment at SSKM will not come free, Dec 26). The ones to blame are peoples representatives who issue BPL certificates at random for their vested interests.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,
 Budge Budge.  It is interesting to note that  patients who can afford to pay will no longer be offered  free services. This is a correct approach in these days  of economic crisis. Affluent people, after availing of high-cost  services from private healthcare units, come to the state  hospitals to get the tests done at low prices. Public hospitals  are meant to render free services only to those who do not  have the means to foot the bill. Piyal Mukherjee, 
 Lake Town.  Hurrah! The progressive Left Front government has erased our backward status with one sweeping announcement by which English will be made compulsory from Class I and Bengali till Class VIII (English return with Bengali dose, Dec. 30). So what, if the remedies are too little too late compared to the advancements in other states.  Chandan Ray, 
 Sarsuna.  Hats off to the Left Front government  for both decisions. So far, a non-Bengali student had the  advantage of choosing a language other than Bengali. But  Bengalis staying in other states are forced to study the  language of that particular state.  Rimli Datta,
 Salt Lake.  In our country development projects are rarely completed within the target dates. But the four flyovers or the roads below thereof have not been completed even after a revised deadline (Flyovers miss date, SOS on funds flow, Dec. 29). Does it not speak of a shameful lack of planning?  Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
 Behala.  The dismal employment scenario in Bengal is the reason for the sorry state of affairs (Lower posts, higher learning, Dec. 26).  Diptimoy Ghosh, 
 Salt Lake City.

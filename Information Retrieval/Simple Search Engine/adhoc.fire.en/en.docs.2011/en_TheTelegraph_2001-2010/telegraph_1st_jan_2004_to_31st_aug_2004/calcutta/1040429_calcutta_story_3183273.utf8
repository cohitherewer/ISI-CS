The Department of Culture, Government of Andhra Pradesh, and Reflection of Another Day (RAD), a city-based NGO concerned with conservation of nature, jointly host an exhibition of paintings and sculptures by artists of Andhra Pradesh. Featuring works by eminent painters like K Rajaiah, Narendra Rai, Padma Reddy (one of her paintings appears along), Chinta Narappa, Narahari and others, this exhibition brings together a body of art that transcends the traditional limitations set by subject, style and medium. The vibrant, iridescent colours, used in most of the paintings, depict the artist in an ecstatic state of mind, experiencing the sheer joy of creation. Transcending ideas into forms of great sublimity, the sculptures offer a new perspective to our understanding of structure and substance. Combining artistic genius with simplicity and rhythmic charm in all the works, the inaugural exhibition of Samokal Art Gallery promises to offer intelligent stimulation to the senses.

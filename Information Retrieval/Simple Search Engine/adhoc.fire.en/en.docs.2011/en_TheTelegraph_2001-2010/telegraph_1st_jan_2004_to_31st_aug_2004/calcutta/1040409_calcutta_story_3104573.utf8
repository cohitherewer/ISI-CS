 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Cash for storm victim kin, traffic in a crawl
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government on Thursday announced assistance of Rs 70,000 to the kin of three people killed in Wednesdays Norwester. Of the sum, Rs 20,000 will be given by the state and the rest will come from Delhi.																								We will release the money as soon as we receive the post-mortem reports and applications, said Hafiz Alam Sairani, state relief minister. Government officials and police continued to disburse relief  dry food and medicines.																								In the city 36 hours after the storm havoc, peak-hour traffic slowed down to a crawl in several pockets. The civic authorities sent out a thoroughly inadequate number of men to remove the trees felled by the thunderstorm, that blocked many an artery. 																								Among the roads where cars moved in slow queues were Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, Short Street, Loudon Street, Park Street and Queensway. 																								According to civic estimates, about 5,000 people in the city had been affected by the Norwester. 																								The Circular Rail could not run services on Thursday as tracks near Tallah Bridge are under water. The Eastern Railway authorities could not confirm when services would resume. 																								Railway officials said water is released through the circular canal. Since the irrigation department has started dredging it, all the outlets are choked. As a result, the tracks are under two feet of water. 																								Silt dumped on either side of the canal has choked all the outlets. New outlets have to be made to release the water. The irrigation department has to take the responsibility. It has been informed, said a railway official.																								The civic body, too, pointed to the irrigation department. Mayoral council member (drainage) Mala Roy said: It is to blame for water not draining into the canal and the suspension of Circular Railway services. The department was silent about when the water would be cleared.

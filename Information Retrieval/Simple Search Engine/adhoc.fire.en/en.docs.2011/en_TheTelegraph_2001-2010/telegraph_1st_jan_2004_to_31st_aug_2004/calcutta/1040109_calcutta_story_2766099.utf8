 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Rapist denied life term plea
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected a petition by rapist-killer Dhananjoy Chatterjee for commuting his death sentence to a life term. 																								The petitioner was awarded the capital sentence by both Calcutta High Court and Supreme Court for the rape and murder 16 years ago of schoolgirl Hetal Parekh. The 14-year-old was killed in her parents apartment in a Sarat Bose Road highrise, of which Chatterjee was a guard. 																								A division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice S.P. Talukdar rejected the petition and also refused the prayer of Chatterjees lawyer for a three-week stay on the operation of the order. State government sources, after delivery of the court order, said a date for the execution of Chatterjees death sentence will be fixed within a week. Chatterjees lawyer Partha Bhattacharya, however, said he would move the apex court again.																								Chatterjee, in a letter to Chief Justice A.K. Mathur, said he had had to suffer mental agony for the past 16 years because of the delay in executing the order. The agony, he added, was no less than death itself. Both the Centre and the state government were still contemplating the mode of executing his capital sentence. At this juncture, he said, it would not be fair on the part of the court to pass an order asking the authorities to hang him till death. Public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah opposed the prayer. 																								On November 11, 2003, Justice D.P. Sengupta of Calcutta High Court had vacated a stay granted by Justice (late) N.K. Mitra, in February 1994. The stay had been obtained against an earlier order handing the death sentence to Chatterjee, caretaker of the Puddapukur building where his victim, Hetal Parekh, lived. 																								Nine years have elapsed since the stay, with no attention being focussed on the case, and Chatterjee continuing to live outside the condemned cell in Presidency jail designated for prisoners on death row. 																								In March 1990, Chatterjee raped and then murdered the Class IX student, whose mother had left for the nearby Laxminarayan temple after handing over the flats keys to him. Chatterjee had been told to give the keys to Hetal when she returned from school in the afternoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 19, 2004  Calcutta Column

	While the main roads are washed regularly, the civic body takes no steps to clean the narrow streets, lanes and bylanes in the city. Lower Rawdon Street, which is a closed lane, is an example of the Corporations neglect. Even garbage is not cleared on a regular basis from certain stretches of this street. Another lane in the vicinity of Hindustan Club shares the same fate. What is the use of cleaning up some sections of the city if the dirt and stench stay on in the neighbouring areas? S.S. Almal,
Lower Rawdon Street 
	This is with reference to the complaint of Soumya Dutta published in this column on May 5. The power supply was interrupted from 1 pm onwards on April 20 on Haji Mohsin Road following an underground cable fault. Subsequent to our repair work on the distribution mains, the supply could be restored at 4 am on April 21. We regret the inconvenience caused to our consumers in the area. Biswarup Mukherjee, 
manager, public relations, CESC

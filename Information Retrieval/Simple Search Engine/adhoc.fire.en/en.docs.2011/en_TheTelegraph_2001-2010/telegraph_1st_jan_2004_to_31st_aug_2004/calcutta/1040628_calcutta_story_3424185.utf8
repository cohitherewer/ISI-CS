The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Hi-tech check for crooked cabbie
 FLEECE FLEET: Taxis in the city are notorious for their fixed meters. A Telegraph pictureG.G. Bhattacharya: Several taxi drivers in the city tamper with their meters. Why dont you take steps to check their meters?																																																													Nearly 100 taxis are checked every day. They are made to queue up near the Eastern Metroplitan Bypass. We take a reading of the meter and check the kilometres covered, then tell the drivers to make a round and come back to the spot. When they return, other taxis have queued up, and we cannot check the earlier ones. Another problem is that we cannot check their engines unless the vehicles are running. But the situation is set to change. We are starting a state-of-the-art, multiple-vehicle apparatus-checking unit near the Bypass. In this new workshop, we are installing gadgets that can check meters even with the engines shut down. Since the entire process will take hardly five minutes, we can check at least 500 taxis a day and, thereby, book more errant drivers.

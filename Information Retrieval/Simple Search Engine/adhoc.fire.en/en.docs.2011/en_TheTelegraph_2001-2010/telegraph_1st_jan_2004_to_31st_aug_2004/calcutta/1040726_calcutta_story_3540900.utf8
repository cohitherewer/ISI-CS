The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Power of sun, wind and tide
D.P. Jana				 	 D.P. Jana, member-secretary and project director of the Sunderbans Development Board (SDB), met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included Kalyan Chakrabarty, Paritosh Ghosh, Ananga Ghosh, G.Laha, Avijeet Sinha and Sunanda Basu				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Sunanda Basu: What are the problems of the Sunderbans?																																																			The major problem is erosion. You may be aware that an entire island has been lost to erosion. Another problem is the flooding of the inhabited areas because of constant erosion of the embankments. And this involves not only the loss of meagre agricultural products and fisheries but also human lives. The major vulnerable area is the 3,500-km coastline. It is not possible for the state government alone to tackle the problem as it involves expenses to the tune of several hundreds of crores. With aid from the Centre, we hope to tackle the problem.																																																									

Paritosh Ghosh: Water is another problem. Most residents have to drink saline water.																																																			True. But the salinity is not present in water in the interiors. We have installed 257 tubewells in the past three years and plans are afoot for a few more. Some of the tubewells are 100 ft deep, so even the threat of arsenic contamination is minimised. All this apart, we have started some rainwater harvesting projects. We store the water in a dead stretch of the river, to turn it into sweet drinking water and water for pisciculture, specially of prawns.																																																									

Avijeet Sinha: Power is crucial to the development of any place, but most places in the Sunderbans are still without electricity.																																																			Though many parts of the Sunderbans are still dark, the power situation has improved. Pockets on the outskirts, like Gosaba, Basanti, Sandeshkhali and Hingalgunge now have power lines from the West Bengal State Electricity Board. Our experience is that it is not possible to connect 19 blocks, covering 190 gram panchayats and 19 panchayat samities, of the mangrove terrain with conventional power lines. Moreover, we have to think of the environment, too. As a result green power came as a good alternative. We started using renewable energy sources  solar and wind  and more recently, tidal power to generate electricity. We had already installed large solar power-generation stations on some islands. Sagar island, too, has a renewable energy power-generation unit to cater to its residents. A major advantage is that this energy can be generated from isolated units, unlike conventional energy sources, that need to be connected by cables with the distribution centres.																																																									

Avijeet Sinha: How many households can afford it?																																																			Every household can avail of renewable energy units. Our primary interest, however, lies in providing electricity to schools, hostels, health centres and such user categories. We also plan to provide power to some cottage industries.																																																											Recently, we had taken power cables to some islands of Gosaba via the Durgadewani river. To ensure smooth power distribution, we divided the entire area under the SDB in 10 sub divisions, with three working divisions. One superintending engineer will coordinate the functioning of these divisions. With funds pouring in from the central government, the power situation appears bright.																																																									

Kalyan Chakrabarty: Which part of the Sunderbans is included in the biosphere reserve category?																																																			The entire 9,630 sq km of the Sunderbans. Of this, the core area comprises 930 sq km. This pocket was declared a biosphere reserve area by the United Nations in 1989. It is a highly-protected zone and crucial for maintaining environmental balance. It is difficult for the government alone to preserve this vast tract of land. Hence, we work on a tripartite formula where, along with the government, we, the SDB, involve non-government organisations and other government departments, like tourism, power and so on, to formulate policies for the development of this island.(Concluded)

 JAYANTA BASU																								Thirty-nine industrial units were recently slapped with closure and disconnection of electricity orders by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB), following Supreme Court directives on hazardous waste management.																								Senior PCB law officer Biswajit Mukherjee said in his order that the offending units were operating without authorisation and failed to take proper steps for storing hazardous waste, as required under the provision of the hazardous waste (management and handling) rules, 1989. The penalised units  predominantly galvanising, chemicals and metals-related  are mostly located in the Howrah, Bally, Uluberia, Barasat and Tiljala areas. 																								The units, however, feel the state government should be held responsible for the development, not them. The government has failed to build even a single hazardous waste dumping site in the past 15 years despite support guaranteed by central agencies, claimed the management of one of the closed factories. The closure could be a big setback as many new plants coming up in the state are in the same boat.																								The Supreme Court directives, communicated to the state board last November, stated that apart from having proper authorisation, the hazardous waste processing units need to display information relevant to the public on notice boards and in newspapers and communicate through the radio, TV and Internet. This is to be monitored by the state pollution control boards.																								The apex court ordered the units to display data outside the factory gates about the quantity and nature of hazardous chemicals being handled in the plant, including wastewater, air emissions and solid hazardous wastes generated within the factory premises. However, the PCB feels it is virtually impossible to implement the apex court order regarding online data as most of the units dont have the required infrastructure.																								We have now closed only those units which did virtually nothing for storing hazardous waste. If one has to implement the order in totality, then the number of offending industries will run into hundreds including many from the public sector, said a senior environment department official. It has not been revealed if more units are to be blacklisted.																								The Supreme Court has ordered that the inventory of hazardous waste dumping sites has to be completed within three months.																								Industrialists are aghast at how the government has handled the problem. The government is merely acting like a messenger, communicating the court order to us. What were they doing in the past 15 years after the hazardous waste rules were constituted in 1989? asked one of the factory-owners, not wishing to be named.

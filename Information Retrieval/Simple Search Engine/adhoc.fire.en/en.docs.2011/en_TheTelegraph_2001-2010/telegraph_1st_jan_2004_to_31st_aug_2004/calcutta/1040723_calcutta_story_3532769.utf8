He can deliver a haircut in five minutes flat and that too, blindfolded. This is no magic show, but the expertise of hair stylist Zahid Khan, who has come down from Delhi to the Habibs Hair and Beauty Studio on Ho Chi Minh Sarani to demonstrate the magic strokes of his scissors.																					Zahid touched down in Calcutta on Thursday to launch a new range of hair colours that Habibs has introduced especially for the monsoon. Hair colouring is the in thing right now. But there are different sets of colours for different seasons. Whatever looks good in summer doesnt necessarily look good in the monsoon because, in the rainy season, the sun is not bright enough to make your hair shine, he says. His advice is to use brighter colours. While introducing the new colours we have kept this in mind, he adds, with hues like light blonde, gold reflect, natural gold and magenta red just right for the season. 																					However, he stresses that while choosing a colour one has to see whether it goes with his or her skin tone because hair colour is supposed to complement the complexion.																					For a fair face he recommends a light blonde shade with bright red streaks, while a dark complexion would look fairer with a pale shade, he says. A brownish tint is his suggestion for a medium or wheatish skin tones.																					On Thursday afternoon Zahid showcased his hair-cutting and colouring skills on a few city models like Bindu, Tanvir and Lopa among others, where he gave Lopa a haircut with his eyes blindfolded. I have been working with Habibs for the past 17 years and have mastered the art of hair styling, he says, when asked about the secret behind the stunt.																					His next goal is to finish 501 haircuts in 24 hours. I want to break Javed Habibs record of 500 haircuts in 24 hours in another five or six months. Till now, my highest is about 50 in eight hours, he signs off. Vidisha Pavate flaunts an outfit by designer Krishna Mehta												Bar-top fashion																					Friday night, the bar-top at Tantra will double up as a ramp with some of the best pirouetting beauties of the country sashaying down in creations by designer Krishna Mehta. The Park will be hosting a fashion evening once a month on aFriday called High Street Fashion, and the first one sees the diva of classicism, Krishna Mehta, coming down from Mumbai to showcase her creations.																					This is the first time I will be showcasing in Calcutta and I am looking forward to it. I believe the market is quite happening now and the concept of the show is quite good too. The collection I will be showing is my Fall 2004 line, which I am unveiling with this show, informed Krishna from Mumbai on Thursday, while she was busy giving finishing touches to the dresses.																					The collection she will be displaying is an Indo-western one, where the cuts and silhouettes are predominantly western while the fabrics and surface embellishments are ethnic. There are tunics, pants, short and long skirts teamed with tops. The fabrics used are georgettes, chiffons, denims, brocades and silks with a lot of texturisation and treatments on the basic fabric. The ornamentation is in the form of threadwork, various dyeing techniques and prints. Colours like aquamarine, turquoise, royal blue, purple, pink, red and lime green lend a vibrant feel to the line. quot;A play of contrast colours breathes in life into the garments. Various elements like embroidery, prints and dye have blended to form one story. The collection is playful, joyous and elegant at the same time, said Krishna. The designs will be flaunted on the ramp by catwalkers Vidisha Pavate, Jesse Randhawa, Sanjukta, Joy, Sreshtha and Amrita. Lee Alison Sibley hands over old clothes to Concern for India at the Shoppers Stop in Forum on Thursday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Charity callCalcutta has come out on top, beating Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore to begin with. At the Shoppers Stop outlet in Forum, Calcutta has beat the competition to the charity charts. 																					A promotion held earlier across 15 Shoppers Stop outlets nationally had invited people to exchange their old but useable salwars, kurtas and dupattas for new outfits at a discounted rate. The final results have revealed that both the Shoppers Stop outlets in the city are among the first three outlets nationally to have collected these old clothes. 																					The clothes collected in both the Calcutta stores were handed over to Concern Indian Foundation, an NGO. Wife of US Consul General Lee Alison Sibley handed over the clothes to representatives of the NGO on Thursday afternoon. 																					This is going to be of major help to us, said Sanchita Ghosh on behalf of Concern India Foundation. 																					The clothes collected will be distributed to the various homes for the destitute run by the organisation. A part of these will be sold to raise money for two of their projects, New Life and New Hope, which take care of children of women living in red light areas. 																					Though customers who donated the old clothes were offered discounts on new salwar suits, a small but significant section of the donors did not even avail of the discounts. They just wanted to help a cause, and I think the response to the event has been phenomenal, said Naveen Mishra on behalf of the store.

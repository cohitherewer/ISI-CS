The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Studied effort to see home truth behind bars
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mahasveta Devi with Kanchan at the BNCCI auditorium on Friday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Two reasons  rational and emotional  prompted Kanchan Gabas latest efforts to climb yet another peak. Having established herself as mountaineer, lawyer, social activist despite being blind since childhood, a year ago, Kanchan embarked on a new crusade, finding out more about the injustice faced by a section of society most believe have no claim to human rights: prisoners.																								On Friday, the young woman presented the findings of her year-long research, supported by the Scholar of Peace award from Foundation for Universal Responsibility, an NGO headed by the Dalai Lama.																								Her work on the plight of women prisoners in the state was received with significant interest. The seminar, also part of the Rs 141,000 project, was attended by writer Mahasveta Devi, chairman, human rights commission, Shyamal Sen, inspector-general prisons Joydeb Chakraborty, DIG prisons Ashok Dhar and president, Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries, S.K. Chakraborty.																								Kanchan toured seven jails in the state to get a clearer picture of the living conditions. I have a background in both sociology and law, and womens issues always interest me, explained Kanchan. The second reason for her choice of subject was more personal. There is a belief that disabled people only work for disability. But given a chance, we would like to serve society as a whole.																								Of the main findings of Kanchans study, the most alarming perhaps was the staff situation in the 54 jails of the state. Only 27 teaching posts have been sanctioned, of which 13 are currently vacant. A total of five psychiatrists are permitted in the correctional homes, though only one has been appointed. Most of the buildings, found the study, are in a dilapidated state. Prisoners are not provided with mosquito nets. The food is inadequate in terms of nutritional value. In most cases we found the women are not even given toothbrush and toothpaste, said Kanchan.																								While the law states different types of prisoners should be segregated (undertrials from the convicts, serious offenders from petty criminals), in most jails, this was not the case. There are also 26 children who are behind bars with their mothers. What have they done to deserve such a life? she asked.																								But Kanchans message is always more powerful than facts and figures. She has proved that physical handicap is no barrier at all. She has given us all something to aspire towards, summed up Mahasveta Devi.

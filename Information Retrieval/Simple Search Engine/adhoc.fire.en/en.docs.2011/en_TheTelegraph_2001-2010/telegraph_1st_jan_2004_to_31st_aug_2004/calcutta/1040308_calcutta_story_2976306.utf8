The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Hooch makes a grand splash
 The entrance to an illicit liquor outlet in Kasba, close to the police station. Telegraph picturesSanat Dey: Trade in illicit liquor is flourishing here. Earlier, the vendors would at least stay away from the main road. Now, it is sold openly from private houses. At Nandibagan in Kasba and Barapukur in Haltu, the bottles are handed out from the windows of some houses.																																																													We are aware of the situation. We are also aware that the racket comprises some big names. What happens is that the vendors change their hideouts too often for us to keep track of them. 																																																													 When we round up some, the others go underground for a few days. I would request residents of the area to inform the police station immediately (at 24420164 or 24411592) if they find illicit liquor being sold in the locality. Otherwise, it is difficult for us to root out these traders.

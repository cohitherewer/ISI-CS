 Sunday, August 15, 2004 Aim right with sporting might
ClubsandwichSwimming to billiards, squash to tennis, pool to bowling, rock-climbing to kayaking and even horse-riding Sport, conventional and off the beaten track, is the common thread that runs through Space Circle, Circle and Vedic Village and the fulcrum on which all the three institutions developed by the same stable stand.We feel sports will drive all clubs in future and our effort has always been directed towards providing the members with a wide array of options on the sporting front, observes M.J. Robertson, CEO of all lifestyle units of the group, back at the helm after a brief absence.In keeping with its commitment to the field of sports, The Circle felicitated eight top billiards and snooker players of the country on Saturday. Billiards legend and four-time world champion Michael Ferreira led the list of cue kings including Manoj Kothari, Subhas Agarwal, Yasin Merchant, Ashok Shandilya and teenage sensation Pankaj Advani.Space has also been the hub of a plethora of sporting activities. The only city destination with indoor cricket, a rifle and pistol-shooting range, rock climbing and an AMF four-lane bowling alley (picture below), the new-age club has already hosted the state championship for rifle and pistol shooting. We are also planning to host tennis tournaments and swimming competitions in future, says Robertson.With the sleek Rajarhat Expressway adding new zip to the area, the two clubs on either side of VIP Road are exploring the possibility of jointly holding an inter-corporate sports meet.Since we have so many disciplines between the two facilities, a multi-event tournament for corporate houses should be very much in order, the CEO feels. Space has already become a favourite haunt for off-season cricket, hosting the third edition of the indoor corporate cricket championships this season with more than 36 outfits in the fray.At Vedic Village, the focus is more on offbeat and adventure sports. The management has tied up with Himalayan Footprints, which also does team-building exercises for corporate houses through adventure sports. So, while Burma bridges, flying foxes, kayaking and archery are already in place, paragliding is on the anvil, along with campsites and snag golf (for first-time putters).Corporate execs seeking de-stress doctrines can look forward to challenging tasks like sowing a field or thatching a roof on the Village premises. The idea is to make them realise the value of sporting activities as a tool of relaxation  something most people can do with in todays high-stress scenario, Roberston stresses.SUBHRO SAHA

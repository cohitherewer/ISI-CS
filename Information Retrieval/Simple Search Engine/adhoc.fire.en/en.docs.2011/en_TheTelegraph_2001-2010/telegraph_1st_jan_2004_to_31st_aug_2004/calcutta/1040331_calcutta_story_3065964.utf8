	Ambulance hooters should be switched off when the road ahead is clear. The patient being transported might not be able to bear the noise. It might further deteriorate the health of patients suffering from cardiac disorders. Can the green bench take any action? 
	Mohan Lal Sarkar, Budge Budge. 
	A concrete bridge on the Kidderpore approach road (from Babubazar) has not been readied despite assurances from the mayor. Moreover, the stretch from Hastings crossing to St Thomas school is very filthy. While an old roadside urinal has been a nuisance for long, even the footpaths are now perenially littered with garbage.
	 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna. 
	Pet-owners allow their dogs to soil pavements, parks and city streets early in the morning. Pedestrians are inconvenienced because of this. The CMC should take action. 
	Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia.

 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Green monitor slaps shut rap on clinics
 JAYANTA BASUMarking a first in the citys medical mess, five units have been ordered to close down for failing to clean up their act.																								Islamia Hospital, Rahamatbai Vadnagarwala Maternity amp; Nursing Home, Matri Seva Sadan, South Calcutta Maternity Home and Port View Nursing Home amp; Diagnostic Research Centre are to stop admitting patients from August 5, with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) slapping them with closure notices.																								The units have been operating without authorisation of the state board, in violation of the Bio-Medical Waste (Management amp; Handling) Rules, according to the PCB order issued by the senior law officer last week. 																								The five have failed to take proper steps to treat the bio-medical waste generated from their units, it added.																								On June 28, they were directed not to admit any more patients without first complying with the statutory provisions, said PCB officials.																								Next in the line of filth fire are 38 errant units. If they continue to flout the directive, we will be compelled to take action, stated PCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar.																								Going by the order, the healthcare units should not be allowed to operate further without prior permission of the board. Officers-in-charge of the police stations where the centres are located have been directed to execute the order after August 5.																								We were warned by the PCB at the last hearing that action could be taken. We will look into the matter, said Muzaffar Ahmed, deputy superintendent of the 200-bed Islamia Hospital, on Wednesday.																								The PCB directive states that hospitals and nursing homes have to either treat biomedical wastes generated themselves or at a common treatment facility in Howrah, where hospitals are charged Rs 270 per bed, per day.																								Already, 228 of the 264 private hospitals and nursing homes have started using the common disposal facility. Thirty-six government medical centres are using it, while 15 others are in different stages of compliance, said a senior board official.

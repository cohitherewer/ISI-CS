 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 High-risk flood at blood banks
 JULIUS GOMES																								While a variety of factors may be responsible for the spread of AIDS across the globe, the 1.2 per cent jump in the citys HIV count is mainly because of a lack of curbs on private blood banks in collecting the fluid from high-risk zones.																								Over the past year, government institutions like the Institute for Immuno-Haematology and Transfusion Medicine (Central Blood Bank) have stopped accepting blood collected from high-risk pockets, such as red-light areas, to minimise the risk of getting contaminated blood, pointed out Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services.																								But a health official said the order had not been passed on to the private blood banks. Representatives of private blood banks admitted that blood was still being collected from high-risk zones, and put the blame on government institutions.																								Police sources confirmed that at least three blood donation camps had been organised since January in the Sonagachhi area alone. 																								A poster on a wall outside a Sonagachhi brothel says Life Care Blood Bank had been involved in one such camp. Life Care representative A. Ganguly, however, denied that his organisation had accepted blood collected from risk-prone areas. Its true, unfortunately, that blood is collected from red-light areas, but some government institutions are responsible for this, he alleged.																								Any individual or group can organise a blood donation camp, barring those intending to benefit financially. Camp organisers are usually not aware that the blood collected from high-risk areas has more chances of being contaminated with HIV.																								To organise a camp, one has to apply to the authorities of a blood bank, specifying the date and venue. Officials scrutinise the application and finalise the date. A team from the bank goes to the venue and stores the blood pouches in a thermostat-equipped box. Within 24 hours, nine mandatory tests are conducted, including the ones for for HIV A and B, and Hepatitis B and C.																								An HIV-positive donors blood is easily detected. But the blood of those donors going through the window-period (21 days to six months), during which the virus goes undetected, cant be identified as positive. 																								For the test to be positive, there has to be enough antibodies in the blood sample. And the time taken by the antibodies to develop differs from one infected person to another.																								Washing hands off the onus of making private blood banks fall in line, a health department official said: We dont control the functioning of private blood banks.																								Government blood banks, he asserted, dont accept blood collected from high-risk areas, since there is no effective method to screen the samples and be absolutely sure that it is not infected.

	 I am khallas. One more 50 per cent and I will never make the JEE. No more being a doctor. Sab khatam. How to study? I hate to sit at home with books when there are so many things to do. Didnt even go to Barista today with Shalini :- ( Time management. Study for an hour before school. Two hours after school and two hours before bed. In-between, free. Without tuitions, of course. Must get 80 per cent. Sigh 
	 Heard something interesting today Britain is about to follow in Americas footsteps and start summer camps for schoolchildren. Cool. When will WE get to do it? Imagine camping in Ladakh with Abhishek... : - ) Baba would have a fit!!!
	 Wet, wet, wet. LOVE splashing in the water, but got a cold afterwards. Had to shampoo my hair and wash my legs with Dettol. No maths tuitions : o ) Miss Banerjee couldnt come.
	 Read that the killer of Hetal Parekh will be hanged on Saturday. Its his birthday. He did something horrible, so he deserves his punishment. But its his birthday... Whats on your mind this week TV troubleThese days, children have a third parent  TV. So, a young girl braves death hoping Shaktimaan will save her, and a boy starts smoking to copy his hero, Shah Rukh Khan. Sitting in front of the TV for too long is also a health risk. Although the idiot box has its advantages with regard to spreading knowledge, it should be controlled by parents, because it leads to obesity and related diseases. Instead of worrying about the next episode of one of the K-serials, wouldnt it be better if the family sat down to dinner together and had a chat?Suchita Sahal				 				 																															
	 Channel changeAfter the introduction of WWE, TNA and other forms of wrestling on television, young people have fallen prey to violence. Often in school Ive noticed one boy hitting another described as fun. They fail to realise that the actions on television are faked and it is a highly-skilled dramatised version of uncouth behaviour. So why are these programmes shown on television? Violence looms larger than life in todays society. Movies influence students of all ages, so are they shown in order to stimulate more disharmony? A childs mind is moulded according to his environment. When he is witness to it on a continuous basis, at some point he loses self-control and a sense of reality. The impact of such violence is causing a lot of harm to the youth, yet no action is being taken to stop it.Tanmoy Das Lala,
St Xaviers Collegiate School 				 				 																Poets cornerI smoke a lot of smoke...
Vomit in my nail,
I wait for someone, 
(Dont light my tail) 
Someone to fulfil my poem, 
My bed is soft 
In a dark stem, 
I left my retina Inam Hussain Mullick				 				 																End of daysThe hours are ticking and the final verdict is in. The stage is set and the hangman is ready. Dhananjoy Chatterjee and his family are counting the hours till his death. I thank the President for saying yes to the execution of the man who raped and murdered Hetal Parekh. Capital punishment will set the right example to prevent such crimes. But after his execution, the state and society should help his family. Rajorshee Banerjee,
Mitra Institution				 				 																Didactic dilemmaClass XII board exams are over, and its time for students to bid farewell to books and enjoy life. Unfortunately, this does not extend to science students. While their commerce and humanities counterparts are busy working, partying and scouting for courses, the education system demands that they study 18 hours or more a day, shell out thousands of rupees to appear for entrance tests and still have no guarantee of a secure future. Apart from the lucky minority who make it to engineering and medical courses, the rest are left with obscure courses, or to try their luck next year. The determined tour the length and breadth of India in the hope of getting admission somewhere. And the returns  politics and oppression in the medical profession and drudgery as engineers, with starting salaries on a par with drivers. Is this the way it ought to be?Vijay Kumar

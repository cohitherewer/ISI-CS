The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 20, 2004  Touch wood Actress Arunima Ghosh inaugurates the furniture fair at the Central Cottage Industry emporium on Monday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															 There is no beating the elegance of wood, even though new-age materials like wrought iron and steel are the rage in modern home decor. An exhibition of exclusive wooden furniture from various parts of the country was inaugurated by actress Arunima Ghosh at the Calcutta chapter of the Central Cottage Industry Corporation of India on Monday. The exhibition-cum-sale, on till July 28, features mahogany, sesame and walnut furniture from Kashmir, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab and of course, West Bengal. 																					The top of the draws is a regal white metal sofa set from Rajasthan with a matching table. The white metal set inlaid with intricate meena work overlaid on wood would look more apt in a palace. More so if one considers the princely price tag of Rs 36,014 for the sofa set and Rs 8,050 for the table. 																					For humble urban homes there are sesame sofa sets priced between Rs 18,000 to 27,000, jute knitted chairs with wooden frames at Rs 1,072 a piece, mahogany chaise lounges with detailed carving priced at Rs 27,518, teak wood rocking chairs for Rs 2,913 and a mahogany double bed priced at Rs 62,000 among others. 																					Worth special mention is the walnut furniture collection from Kashmir that includes a writing bureau priced at Rs 34,339, nest of tables for Rs 6,480 and a bar cabinet for Rs 21,197. Plastic inlay furniture from Hoshipur, Punjab, are the other show stealers. Blending ethnic chic with contemporary needs are a variety of dining tables, coffee table sets and low settees.

 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 School a three-day trauma
 																											- Four-year-old complains of being thrashed; denial by headmistress  JULIUS GOMES																								Aami school jete chai, kintu ora marbe (I want to go to school, but theyll thrash me), says four-year-old Sarika Sultana, hesitantly.																								My daughter was beaten by one of her teachers the day she joined school because she could not understand what was being taught in Hindi or Urdu, claimed Mamlot Hossain, 49, Sarikas father.																								The authorities of Modern Collegiate School, on Karaya Road, affiliated to the Madhyamik board, contested the claim. The question of beating such a small child does not arise, said headmistress A. Alam.																								The problem is that the child understands only Bengali. Ours is an English-medium school, drawing most students and staff members from non-Bengali families, and most of them cant speak Bengali, the headmistress added.																								Sarika was admitted on April 26 to the lower nursery of Modern Collegiate School, at 103/C, Karaya Road. She returned home crying after her first day at school, complaining that her classteacher had punished her.																								The second day was no different from the first. A reluctant Sarika did go to school, but later complained of pain in one of her ears while being tucked in for the night.																								Sarikas anxious parents asked her how she had hurt her ear. The child then complained that her classteacher had beaten her when she failed to answer a question addressed to her in Hindi or Urdu.																								She hit me here, with a cane, said Sarika, pointing at her knuckles, her head and her back.																								Her parents confronted Alam the next day, but the headmistress denied the caning.																								When Sarika returned home in tears after her third day in school, Hossain decided to take the matter to the police.																								We have received a complaint from M. Hossain and an investigation into the matter has been started, an officer of Karaya police station said on Friday.																								I personally think this is a case of over-reaction. Most children cry when they first come to school, said headmistress Alam. We do encourage children to be disciplined but our teachers do not have reason to beat up any child. In eight years, we have never had any such problem. We are aghast at the allegations, she added.																								Sarikas mother Hasna Hana Begum sounded distraught: Sarika is our eighth child. We have lost seven sons under tragic circumstances, and it was my husbands wish to see our child go to school. Im sure our concern for her well-being will not be seen as unwarranted.

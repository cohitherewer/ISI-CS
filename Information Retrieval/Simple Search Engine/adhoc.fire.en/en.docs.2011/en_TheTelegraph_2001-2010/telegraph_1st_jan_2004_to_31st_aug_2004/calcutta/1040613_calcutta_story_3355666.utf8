 Sunday, June 13, 2004 P for patience and praise
pet passionHeaven goes by favour. If it went by merit, you would stay out and your dog would go in  Mark Twain.Patience is the greatest of all virtues. Not quite. Especially not when last year Chipper (my dog) gobbled up an entire chocolate, metallic wrapper and all. The chaos that ensued was crazy  rush to vet; shot in posterior; expulsion of wrapper; relief!Last month, Mingles (jr cat) and Minimow (sr cat) decided to raid sis Chandanas cupboard. Interestingly, they chose a very crucial day. She was leaving for the outdoor schedule of her travel show. They spent the whole day meticulously munching Chandanas clothes.Last week was the pits. Bhanu, our local fishwali, paid us her weekly visit. As always, mom put the two cats in the bedroom to prevent them from driving her away. Imagine our horror when we saw Minimow sitting on top of the AC, outside the window of our living room. He had walked on the outer window ledge of the bedroom to the living room. Patience? Anyone?All this pales in comparison to Sir Issac Newtons story. Newton had a pom called Diamond who knocked over a candle sitting on Newtons desk. The ensuing fire destroyed the records from years of research. Newton, surveying the damage, remarked: O Diamond, Diamond, thou little knowest the damage thou hast done.Dog training is not  never has been and never will be  an exact science. Especially since it involves two of the worlds most unpredictable species: humans and dogs. Patience! Without this, both you and your dog will be frustrated. Pets learn at their own pace; they dont have to follow time-tables. All you need is to give them endless doses of praise, persistence and patience.

- Parking Fleece Make Calcutta BetterLate for a show at the Academy of Fine Arts and you are grateful for the friendly face that emerges from the shadows to help you find precious parking space. After 90 minutes of Nandikar magic, as you ease out of the parking lot, enter the parking man, but this time more as foe than friend.Kuri taka (Rs 20), he barks out. You argue that for an hour-and-a-half in any Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) fee-parking lot, Rs 8 is all that you have to pay. O shob jani na, taka ta deben, naki (I dont know all that; pay up or else) comes the threat. You pay up and get out.Havent we all fallen prey to the parking devil? Havent we all demanded an official rate-card and been denied? Havent we all wondered how to solve the mystery of the missing parking-fee board? Be it in Calcutta south or central, north or north-east, tout trouble and fleece fights are a way of life in the parking lane. The official CMC rates for cars in the heart of the central business district read like this: Rs 3 for half an hour, Rs 5 for an hour, Rs 8 for two hours, and Rs 2 each for every hour after that.But who can solve the parking-fee puzzle? Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic), brings some method to the madness.In every fee-parking zone, there is bound to be a board in the vicinity with the name, address and other details of the CMC-appointed parking agent licensee. In case the person harassing you does not have proper identification on him, you can immediately notify me or anybody else in the traffic department (22145950/23353344). We will take action.

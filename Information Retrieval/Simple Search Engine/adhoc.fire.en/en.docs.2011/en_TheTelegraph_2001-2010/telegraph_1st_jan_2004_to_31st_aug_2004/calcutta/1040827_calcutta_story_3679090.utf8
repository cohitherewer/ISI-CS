																								Greenpeace, in association with Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, hosts an exhibition of photographs by Raghu Rai, titled Exposure: Portrait of a corporate crime. Featuring images of the aftermath of the gas leak disaster that hit Bhopal two decades ago, the photographs on show capture without sentiment, the horrors of a city in trauma. More significantly, the exhibition attempts to highlight irresponsible corporate behaviour, where companies fail to accept responsibility for or adequately compensate victims for the outrageous crimes they commit upon them with the excuse of industrial activity. Greenpeace, an organisation committed to the cause of ensuring a safe and clean environment for all, hopes this exhibition will campaign for an international liability instrument whereby corporations shall be held accountable for causing damage to the environment and to people.																								Event: An exhibition of photographs of the Bhopal disaster by Raghu Rai																								When: Till September 4; 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

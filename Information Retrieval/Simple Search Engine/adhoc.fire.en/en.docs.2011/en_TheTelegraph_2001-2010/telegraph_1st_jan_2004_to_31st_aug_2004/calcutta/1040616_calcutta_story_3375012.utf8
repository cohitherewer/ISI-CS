The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 																				RajEEv Kumar								Deputy commissioner, central, Calcutta Police																																							A woman colleague of mine who was posted earlier in Lucknow and Delhi says how much safe she feels here in comparison. I feel it is the society of Bengal that provides security to women. People here have a lot of respect for women. In fact, any disrespect shown to them is regarded as a serious crime. If a girl is teased in say, Delhi, people would look the other way. But here if a case of harassment happens on a bus, everyone, from the conductor to the passengers, will intervene. This attitude is ingrained in society. It certainly helps us lawmen.

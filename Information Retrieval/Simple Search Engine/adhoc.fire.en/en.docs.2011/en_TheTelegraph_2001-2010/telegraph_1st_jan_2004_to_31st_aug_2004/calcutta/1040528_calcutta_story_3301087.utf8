 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Blow in the stomach leaves mother dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 45-year-old woman, Hema Das, was killed when her only son, 25-year-old Raju, hit her in the stomach on Thursday morning at their Deshapran Sashmal Road residence, in the Charu Market police station area. 																								According to police, Raju, a daily labourer, often demanded money from his mother. This morning, he approached his mother again. When she refused to give in, he picked up a gold chain around the neck of a deity and tried to run away with it. He told his mother that he would sell it off, said an officer of the local police station. 																								As Hema struggled with him for the chain, her son hit her in the stomach. The blow was enough for her to collapse on the floor. When Raju discovered that she was not responding to his calls, he fled. His father, Sasanko, a fruit-seller, was going to work when the incident occurred. He saw his son leave in a hurry and went into the bedroom, only to find Hema lying unconscious on the floor, police added.																								Sasanko took her to MR Bangur Hospital, where Hema was pronounced dead. He walked out of the hospital when he learnt that his wife was dead, and headed straight for Charu Market police station, where he lodged a complaint against his son. Raju is absconding, the officer added.																								Deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Soumen Mitra said the youth could face charges of culpable homicide. It seems that Raju did not kill his mother intentionally and would not face murder charges, but would certainly be booked under section 304 of the IPC. We have already asked the police to find out the possible places he could take shelter in, Mitra said.																								He was, perhaps, keeping bad company. So he needed extra cash. He used to earn a good deal himself, which should have been enough for him. He did not have to contribute to the family, as my income is sufficient. Hema had told me several times that he would ask her for money, but I never thought that this would one day result in her death, Sasanko told police. 																								Hemas body was sent for post-mortem and will be handed over to Sasanko on Friday. The aggrieved husband told us where we could find his son. We are trying to find out if the son was on drugs, the officer said.

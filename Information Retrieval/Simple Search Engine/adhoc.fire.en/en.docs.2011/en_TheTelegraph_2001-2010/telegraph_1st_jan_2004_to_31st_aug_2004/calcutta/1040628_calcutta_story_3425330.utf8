 															- Rapist-killer waits for the inevitable, jail awaits Delhi missive OUR BUREAU Amar kandh theke ekta bhar neme gelo. Ami jantam amar phansi atke jabe (I am relieved. I knew my hanging would be stalled)  Dhananjoy Chatterjee on Thursday, minutes after he came to know that the Presidents office had decided to review his case Amar phansi hobei. Keu thekate parbe na (I will be hanged. No one will be able to stop it)  Dhananjoy Chatterjee in Alipore jail on Sunday morning, as public opinion in the city swelled against him																								A deputy inspector-general (DIG) of prisons said late on Sunday that Dhananjoy looked disturbed. Only three days ago, Dhananjoy appeared confident that the execution would not take place. But today, he said he thought the hanging was inevitable, said the DIG. 																								The sudden change in Dhananjoys attitude, jail officials said, could be a fall-out of growing public clamour for his execution. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his wife Meera have used forums, governmental and non-governmental, to call for Dhananjoys death sentence to be carried out.																								And the change in the condemned man is evident from his actions, jail staff said.  I want to forget the terrible past and be at peace with myself, Dhananjoy is learnt to have told some jail warders and inmates on Sunday morning.																								We have seen him praying at night in front of a small picture of Kali in his cell, added a jail official. However, no visitors, not even his relatives, were allowed to call on him.																								Waiting for a directive from Delhi, jail officials are ready for Dhananjoys execution. The hangman is expected to visit the jail in a day or two to oversee the preparations, particularly the gallows where he is scheduled to be hanged till death, said officials.																								Engineers from the public works department supervised the arrangements inside the jail, specially the scaffold where Dhananjoy is be taken for hanging, provided the President rejects the mercy plea. The room where hangman Nata Mullick, along with his associates, will stay overnight if the dawn execution is ordered, is also being refurbished. Generator sets and lights around Dhananjoys cell and the scaffolding are being tested and kept ready.																								The jail authorities have also intensified security around the jail. Even the movement of visitors for other inmates and life convicts is being restricted.

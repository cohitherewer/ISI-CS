 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Wedding dinner poisons 70
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Around 70 persons, including 30 children, were taken ill after consuming food served at a wedding in Garpha, in the Jagachha police station area of Howrah, on Thursday.																								Ten children, 10 women and five men have been shifted to the Howrah District Hospital, where their condition was stated to be serious. 																								According to Kalyan Palodhy, the attending medical officer of the hospitals emergency ward, the meal served to the invitees was of poor quality. We have started treatment of the ailing. Until and unless they respond to the medication, we cannot say how long they will take to recover, he said.																								The main dishes on the Thursday night wedding menu were fish kalia and vegetable curry. People complained of stomach aches within two hours of consuming the food. Continuous vomiting and numbness of the limbs were the other symptoms. 																								We had never imagined that we would suffer such pain after eating at the ceremony, said Teenkari Das, one of those admitted in the hospital.																								A medical team, including the assistant health officer of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), has visited the victims and distributed preventive medicines like ORS and halogen tablets. 																								Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said the patients would be treated free by the HMC. 																								The situation is under control. We will check the quality of food served at the ceremony, he added. The mayor confirmed that caterers had not been hired for the celebrations. 																								Drinking water samples, too, will be analysed in a laboratory. Howrahs residents dont heed our requests of informing us about poor-quality food or drinking water, mayor Mukherjee complained.

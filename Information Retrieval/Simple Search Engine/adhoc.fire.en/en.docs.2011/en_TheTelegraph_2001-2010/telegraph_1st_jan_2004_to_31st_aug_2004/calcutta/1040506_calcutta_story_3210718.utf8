 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Fake gold fetches five bank loans, man jailed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Gold assessor Nishikanta Mondal of a cooperative bank in Uluberia was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for certifying fake ornaments as gold and taking huge loans from the bank a number of times.																								Public prosecutor Tapan Kumar Singha Roy told the Howrah court that Mondal, an employee of Uluberia Central Cooperative Bank, would assess gold ornaments of customers seeking bank loans against jewellery.																								He also managed to certify some fake ornaments as gold, against which he himself took a loan from the bank. He did this not once, but five times. 																								The bank wanted him to repay the amount and called him for a settlement on August 5, 1998. Mondal didnt bother to show up.																								Another lawyer argued that Mondal, perhaps, had been waiting to blame the bank for duplicating his ornaments in the locker with the fakes.																								He took five loans from the bank against the same set of fake ornaments, public prosecutor Singha Roy said. When Mondal stopped paying the instalments, the bank warned him it would auction the ornaments. 																								Mondals silence led the bank authorities to arrange to sell the ornaments to regain the loan amount with interest. But on the day of the auction, the special assessing officer, deputed by the bank, discovered that the deposited ornaments, wrapped in a polythene pack, were fake.																								The bank then lodged a first information report with Udaynarayanpur police station on November 25, 1998, and a case was started in the court of first special judge in Howrah, Roy said. Mondal was charged with breach of trust by a public servant.																								The public prosecutor asked the court how an employee of a bank, entrusted with such a responsible post, could indulge in such misdeeds. If such things prevail, how can one trust any public servant? he demanded.																								District sessions judge Haraprosad Chatterjee, in his verdict, admitted that in many cases, the culprits are acquitted because of inadequate proof. But responsible employees of public institutions should desist from unscrupulous acts, because it involves a breach of trust.

																																																																																		The state government is interested in private participation for providing municipal services. With the Centre clearing the decks for a feasibility study in Bidhannagar Municipality, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the civic body and Seureca Consulting Engineers, a French consultant, to explore the possibilities of private-public participation in providing water supply, drainage and solid waste management facilities. The Rs 3-crore proposed study was cleared in the form of a grant after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met Union finance minister P. Chidambaram in Delhi and pressed for clearance of a number of foreign-aided projects. The feasibility study, proposed by the Embassy of France in January 2002, is slated to be complete in about 11 months. The study will indicate whether private partnership is viable and how much investment would be required. Then we will invite investors from France, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said.

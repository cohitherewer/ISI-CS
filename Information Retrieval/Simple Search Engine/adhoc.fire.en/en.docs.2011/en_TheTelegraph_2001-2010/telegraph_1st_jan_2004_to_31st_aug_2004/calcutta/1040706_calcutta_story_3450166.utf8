 Tuesday, July 06, 2004 				 Sorting centre for export flowers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Flower power might be the new buzzword for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, with blooms worth Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh being exported to Holland, London and New York every month. But poor infrastructure is still a deterrent to expanding business. 																								The situation, however, may change for the better very soon. For, the West Bengal State Food Processing amp; Horticulture Development Corporation, under the state government, plans to develop a centre close to the city airport for better sorting and packing of flowers for export.																								The corporations managing director N. Hazra said: We export nearly 50,000 flowers, mostly tuberose and gladioli, every month. But there is no proper facility to sort and pack them. It is done at our office, in Salt Lakes Mayukh Bhavan.																								The state government is already in talks with private entrepreneurs on developing  as a joint venture  a centre close to the airport where the sorting and packing, apart from storing, can be done professionally. 																								We are planning to get a five-hectare plot close to the airport, which a private company should be able to provide, and invest the money required to develop and run the centre. The government, on its part, will provide the administrative support, technical assistance and help in marketing the product, Hazra added. 																								The corporation buys flowers from farmers and exports them. The government started exporting flowers a year and a half ago. We are doing rather well, and developing this centre will be an essential step for the business to expand, Hazra said.																								Once the centre comes up, sorting and packaging of flowers can be done in air-conditioned chambers that will help retain the freshness of the flowers. We will be able to supply more, as the demand is likely to increase. Better storage assures longer shelf-life for flowers, he added.

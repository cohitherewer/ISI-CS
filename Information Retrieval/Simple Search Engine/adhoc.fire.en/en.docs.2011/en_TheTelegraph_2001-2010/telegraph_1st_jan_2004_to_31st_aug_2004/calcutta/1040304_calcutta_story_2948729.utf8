 																											- Endowment awards in jeopardy after abolition of merit lists  MITA MUKHERJEE																								The governments decision to abolish the system of publishing merit lists for Madhyamik and Higher Secondary (HS) has stymied the boards conducting the two school-leaving examinations.																								Scrapping of merit lists  a policy aimed at discouraging the practice of awarding students for individual attainment  has robbed the sheen of the endowment awards of the two boards.																								The awards went to students scoring the highest tally or for being the highest scorers in separate subjects. In the new system, instead of individual attainment, the government has introduced a system of identifying a group of students as the best performers  for instance, all those who score between 85 and 90 per cent in a particular subject.																								This is also the basis of replacing the marks system with grades, a proposal under consideration of the government.																								Slapped with the recent order that says the boards will not be allowed to identify a single student for being the best, the authorities of the two examination bodies are planning to modify the terms and conditions of the endowment awards.																								With Madhyamik (March 5) and HS (April 1) knocking at the door, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education have started hectic parleys on the endowment awards with their donors and sponsors.																								We have awards for students scoring the highest in almost all major subjects in HS, like mathematics, physics, chemistry, Bengali and English. We will have to drop all these awards, as in the new system, we cannot identify any particular student for being the best performer in any subject, explained Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, president, West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education.																								Mukherjee and other Board officials are now negotiating with the sponsors of the awards to rework the terms and conditions. We have to think of some solutions before the results of the 2004 exams are announced, because the terms and conditions stipulate that we cannot keep the endowment prizes unused for even a single year, elaborated Swapan Chakraborty, secretary, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.																								The system of publishing merit lists has been abolished by the government in line with the recommendation of the Ranjugopal Mukherjee education committee, which submitted its report to the government a few months ago.																								HS council president Mukherjee said a number of donors are willing to modify the agreement in accordance with the present policy of the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 26, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The Indian Tricolour is in demand among youngsters on special occasions. A day after, however, flags are found strewn on the roads, as was seen in many areas after the night of celebration for the Lahore victory. However careful they might be, pedestrians are sure to trample on the flags as they pass by. This is an insult to the symbol of our national pride. School authorities and guardians must direct children not to dispose of the flags in this disgraceful manner.

	Two bus stops, just a few yards from each other on the southern side of the VIP-Lake Town intersection, are creating confusion for passengers. While one stop is where it ought to be, the other is right in the middle of the road where a divider has been built. People are unsure where the buses will stop. Can the traffic authorities do away with one bus stop?
	 Biman Saha, Lake Town.

 Irfan Ahmed / MixologistThe martini is the James Bond of cocktails. Not only is it 007s drink of choice, but served in a chilled glass with a twist of lemon or a single green olive, its as suave as the man with the license to kill.The true martini, though, is made with gin. But whether you prefer yours with gin or vodka, the bottom line is that the drink should be made with the highest-quality brand of either spirit that you can afford and always include vermouth (the drier the martini, the less vermouth is added). A martini comes in many a form; dry or drier, sweet or naked or with just a whiff of vermouth.Through history, the martini has been and still is the drink of the rich and famous. It is also responsible for the 50s and 60s phenomenon of the Three-Martini Lunch. It is a drink that shouts urbane sophistication, and a dash of mystery, Bond-style.The martini is certainly an acquired taste, often ignored by those with a sweet tooth. A complex drink  adjust the garnish and you have something altogether different. Wherever one is in the world (Bond never had any trouble getting a martini in London, Russia or some nameless tropical island), the quest for the perfect martini continues.The classic martiniIngredients:60 ml premium quality dry gin, 2-3 drops of dry vermouth, green olive or twist of lemon, iceMethod:Pre-chill a mixing jug with six cubes of ice and drain out the liquid. Pour two-three drops of dry vermouth. Add the gin. Stir gently and pour into a pre-chilled martini or cocktail glass. Cut a twist of lemon rind  try to cut it as thin as possible, discarding the pith. Place the twist upside down over the glass and twist it to release its essential oils and flavour, run the twist around the rim of the glass and drop it in. Instead of the twist of lime you can add a green olive.The variations:  Vodka Martini: Replace the gin with vodka. Gibson: Replace the twist of lime or olive with cocktail onion. Bucks Eye Martini: Replace the twist of lime with black olive. Naked Martini: It is the classic martini without the vermouth. Cloudy Martini: To the classic martini add a teaspoon of olive brine solution.

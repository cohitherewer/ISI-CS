	In spite of repeated complaints by people over the years, garbage trucks of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are still not covered. Not only do they leave a trail of unbearable stench in the localities through which they pass, they also spill one-fourth of what they carry on to the road, effectively making the whole road a garbage bin. This creates hygiene problems as well. Therefore, it is high time that the concerned department of the CMC puts in a concerted effort to improve its method of garbage collection.

	The State Bank of India, Budge Budge branch charged me Rs 50 for my bank signature to be endorsed in a form. When I had to go through the same endorsement at the Budge Budge branch of UCO Bank, the officials there did not charge me a single paisa. What could be the reason behind such discrimination at nationalised banks?

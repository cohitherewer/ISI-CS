	There was only one letter box near the base of bridge no 4, where Park Street ends at the Park Circus seven-point crossing. The letter box was removed to facilitate the widening of the road and for relaying the tram tracks. The work is almost complete now but the postal authorities have not reinstalled the letter box. As a result, residents of the area are forced to go all the way to Jhowtala post office to post letters. We appeal to the postal department to put up a letter box in the area at the earliest for our inconvenience.

	Traffic jams have become a regular feature at Salkia Chowrasta in Howrah. The one-way traffic system on GT Road does not seem to help much in easing the congestion. Though adequate number of traffic policemen and home guards are deployed at the intersection, during rush hour, vehicles queue up bumper to bumper on all the four roads that meet at the junction. The authorities should take concrete steps to check this slow movement of traffic.

 Model Pinky flaunts the latest line of jewellery from Trendsmith at the store. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 Chandeliers  not the ones that hang from your ceiling, but those that tickle your shoulders  are the fashion accessory that has been going strong for quite sometime now. From saris to spaghettis and kurtas to capris, these earrings can be flaunted with any outfit if the colour is co-ordinated well. 																								We see them hanging in the stalls at New Market as well as classier ones in Forum, in all kinds of hues and designs. For women who wouldnt settle for fakes, there are options in gold and precious stones as well. 																								Trendsmith, a jewellery store on Loudon Street, launched an exquisite range of chandeliers on Thursday, along with a line of bracelets and bangles. The line comprises earrings embedded with diamonds and other precious stones in a variety of colours like aquamarines and tourmalines on 18 carat white gold. The bangle and bracelet collection is in 18 carat white and yellow gold embedded with diamonds and aquamarines. 																								While the chandeliers are priced between Rs 20,000 and Rs 2 lakh, the bangles and bracelets are priced between Rs 8,000 and Rs 2.5 lakh. 																								Samrat Zaveri, managing director, Trendsmith (I) Ltd, said that the speciality of the new collection is that the chandeliers along with the bracelets or bangles are enough to make a statement. Usually, one needs a set of earrings, necklace and bangles to complete the look. But, with this collection, one wouldnt need the neckpiece, as the chandeliers are long enough to serve the purpose, he said. 																								Along with the new lines, the store also launched a gold exchange scheme. In our country gold is usually handed down from one generation to the next. But the new generation seldom wears the old designs and hence the jewellery is kept in the bank lockers most of the time. So, we launched this scheme where one can get old gold jewellery exchanged for new and trendy designs, added Zaveri. The scheme, which is on at the store till July 28, offers one the opportunity to pick up any jewellery from Trendsmith which is equivalent to the value of the old jewellery, evaluated in terms of weight and purity of the metal. Herbal rush 																								 Be it cosmetics, home care or healthcare products, going herbal seems to be the rage right now. So when RASA, a trust run by the NGO Sasha, launched a range of herbal products at Nice Fresh on Wednesday morning, our city celebs turned up in hordes to check out the new line. 																								Actress June, actor Barun Chandra, singer Indrani Sen, musician Nondon Bagchi, beautician Julie Sen, and Nandita Pal Choudhuri were among those who dropped by to support the cause of RASA.																								The products have been produced by various womens groups under RASA (Ruro Agro Services Association), a trust formed by Sasha 12 years ago to train underprivileged women to manufacture herbal products as part of their livelihood. This particular label has been developed under the aegis of Nice Fresh, the supermarket on Ballygunge Circular Road, and will be available exclusively at the store.The Nice Fresh collection has products in three categories  personal care, food products and household products. The personal care line has a shampoo, hair oil, bath oil, moisturiser, cleanser, night cream, face pack, hair pack and six kinds of bath salts. In food products there are herbal digestive, ginger preserve and six types of herbal tea. There is a citronella floor cleaner in the household range.Bday bonanza																								 Palki, a boutique owned by designer Lata Haralalka, celebrated its first anniversary last Monday. And as an anniversary gift to Calcuttans, the boutique opened a second branch at Bakulbagan Road in Bhowanipore. 																								Spread over 1,200 sq ft, the plush boutique houses a wide range of formals, semi-formals, casuals, ethnic and fusion wear.																								Over the last one year, Palki has made a name for itself in the fashion world of the city with its ornate saris and lehngas, especially bridal wear. A combination of embroidery like resham, badla, sequins and stones are used on the lehngas which are teamed with heavy blouses. Kurtas, kurtis and salwar suits are as much a part of the collection as the more elaborate ensembles. The printed saris in various styles like hand art, batik, block and discharge are worth a look.																								As a special anniversary offer, the store is giving a 20 per cent discount on the collection till July 24. The kurtis start from as low as Rs 400, while the organza saris are priced at Rs 1,000 upwards.						SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

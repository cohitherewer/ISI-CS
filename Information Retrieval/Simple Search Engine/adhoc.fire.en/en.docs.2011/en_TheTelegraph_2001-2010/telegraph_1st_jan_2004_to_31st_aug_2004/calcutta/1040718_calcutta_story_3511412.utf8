The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

AdLibSHILOO CHATTOPADHYAYDravidian humour marks the ads starring Mr Dependable and draws a quiet chuckle, not loud laughter I must confess at the outset (otherwise I may get into trouble) that this is nothing but hearsay. You see I am not much of a ladies man. Some of my younger friends who enjoy such privileges have passed this information on to me. Ladies of Calcutta are going ga ga over Rahul Dravid. Thanks to the recent Hutch campaign.Big deal. Men rave about Ash, women are crazy about Sachin. These are surreal things; what is so great about it. True, except that the object of worship is someone named Rahul Dravid, a cricketer who still prefers the forward defensive stroke to an upper cut over the slip cordon. He is solid, dependable and unflappable. He rarely shows any emotion on the cricket field. Off it, his interviews are sensible rather than smart; his photographs are portraits rather than group snaps taken at a boisterous party in close company of pretty young things. In short, he is antiseptic, perhaps a trifle boring. More Steve Waugh than Shane Warne.Yet, he is a celebrity. Many regard him as the best batsman in what is arguably the best Indian cricket team ever. Many adore him for his cricketing qualities alone. Perhaps it is a bit of a Catch 22 situation.(Top) Rahul Dravid in a Hutch ad. (Above) Sachin and Sehwag: different strokesIt is a bit like his cricket. Three overs left in a One-Day match, 23 runs required by India to win. Runs are obviously welcome any which way. Dravid is batting with a tailender; many of us are having a nervous breakdown. Yet, in the same match, India had lost Sachin, Sourav and Sehwag with 13 on the board inside the first five overs. Werent we glad that Dravid was the next batsman in? This is the dichotomy in the image of the cricketer and the man.His popularity will make him a natural choice for a celebrity ad. The traits that he will impart to a brand, however valuable as they are, will all be Mother Teresa variety. An automobile tyre placed on a safety platform, an anti-smoking campaign, a washing machine that sells a never lets you down story ideal platforms for using Rahul Dravid, one would imagine.This is the beaten track. The latest Hutch campaign has gone off it. Dravid has been used in a campaign that says Dial 123 for Jokes and so on. It is essentially a fun campaign. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that they have not attempted an image makeover. Instead, the staidness of Rahul Dravid has been used as a base to create humour. It is not slapstick. Yes, Rahul wears an orange nose mask. It still is Dravidian humour quiet, dignified and worth a quiet chuckle rather than loud laughter. All too often we see celebrities in situations contrary to their own image; this is one ad that swims with the tide and makes the most of the character of the star image.You want to know the final score in that match? Let the mothers and their daughters tell you 23 needed in 3 overs; Rahul hits three sixes and a four; Hutch takes the final single!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004  In the mood for jazzMADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA AND SOMA BANERJEE Usha Uthup. Picture by Pabitra Das 															 For the nostalgic, it was an evening of fond remembrances and romance. For the average, uninitiated lover of music, it turned out to be an evening well spent.																					Summertime was more than a celebration of jazz and blues. It was a walk down memory lane to a few decades ago, when all the action was on Park Street, and Calcutta was the birthplace and the nurturing ground for good music.The Monday evening concert, held at G.D. Birla Sabhagar, saw Usha Uthup make a comeback, of sorts, to the genre, after a long silence having not performed jazz in Calcutta for a number of years.																					Anjum Katyal, best known for her handling of R amp;B, opened the show, ably accompanied by veterans of the music circuit  Nondon Bagchi on the drums, Sumit Ramachandran on the guitar, Willy Walters on base and Debabrata Mitra on the keyboards. 																					Her soulful strains hit home with songs such as Hold On, Im Coming, by BB King and Eric Clapton, a jazzy rendition of Angela Hagenbachs Hit Me With a Hot Note, and Coco Taylors I am a Woman.																					More a mix of R amp;B classics, Anjum revived the old rhythm in one of her rare performances for the show, part of the proceeds from which went to Chip, an NGO working with children. 																					Ushas segment followed. Punctuated with breathy declarations of love for her audience, it was a healthy mix of old favourites. The singer started her performance with a tribute to all the musicians who are no more and all the musicians who are here tonight. 																					She gladly admitted to being a completely mainstream singer of jazz, though there was a time when names like Bagchi, Ramachandran and least of all Iyer or Uthup would be considered unlikely masters of this American tradition. Then things changed, she smiled. Im in the Mood for Love, Blue Prelude, Love Me or Leave Me and All Too Soon were a few of the songs Usha chose, Sumit and Nondon adding to the effect with their energy as much as their skill.																					The numbers were those everyone knew, she stressed, trying to drive home the fact that jazz was for everyone. Usha, who has had jazz gigs in other cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, feels her long gap in Calcutta was because of fear and lack of funds, not flagging interest of music lovers. Backing up her belief, the auditorium was nearly full and the audience all involved.																					As Usha put it: The music never died, at least, in Calcutta. It is where it all started, where it will always be, forever. 																					In a fitting finale, Usha sang everyones favourite Summertime, with Anjum joining her on stage to bring it to a bluesy close. Model Pinky shows off a Couturewala creation on Tuesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Summer stock																					 For those who crave a touch of couture in their closets, the city offers few choices. Ogaan, the south Calcutta boutique run by Kavita Bhartia, has been known to bring some of the finest and freshest labels from the fashion industry to the Calcutta customer, as well as the designers own range.																					And the spring-summer 2004 collection unveiled on Tuesday is no different. Splashes of beiges and blues, violets and pinks, greens and yellows stood out at the display at the Lake Road extension showroom. 																					Kavitas summer line is dominated by khadi, georgette and crepe. She has embellished the colour-happy palette with light hand embroidery and texture. The formal Omana range consists of saris with aadi work, gota and sequins. Prices start at Rs 10,500. To her classic cuts, she adds a touch of class with silk piping.																					Couturewala by Ayan and Preetika Sarkar comes in with saris featuring interesting ornamentation and applique work. The store also houses Mynak by Renu Tandon, which consists of salwar kurtas and Indo-westerns with dazzling Swarovski crystals and mirror-work, the price tag reading Rs 10,000 upwards. Colourful bead-work pieces are priced at Rs 5,500 upwards.																					Sonia Jetley with her Indo-westerns in light pastel shades seem a good bet for the scorching heat. Simar Dugal, with her georgette kurtis and ponchos, is likely to attract partygoers. Freefalling, Aparna Wangdis line, offers a heady mix of mulmul skirts and kurtis. Deepika Gehani, a Mumbai-based designer, has added colour with her butterfly-printed tops and flowing skirts in georgette. Anju Modis AmPm collection consisting of stretchable crochet tops will put you back by at least Rs 4,000. 																					Mayura Kumars series on kalamkari deserves special mention. An ode to the rich textile tradition of Andhra Pradesh, each outfit is meticulously hand-painted using vegetable dyes.																					Themes include the religious, flowers and fruits. Crushed skirts with kalamkari panels are expected to do well, priced Rs 4,200 upwards, kurtis, bags, T-shirts start from Rs 4,000, Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,200.

They are the heritage jewellery creations by Jaipurs Jewels Emporium, which made a splash in JJ Valaya and Arun Khannas shows.

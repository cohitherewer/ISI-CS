 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Troubled water over tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic authorities continue to refuse accepting property tax minus water charges from house-owners, despite mayor Subrata Mukherjees announcement last month to roll back the new water tax imposed in January.																								Hence, not the water tax, but the rollback of the new water tax is bound to be a major election issue, with many house-owners being forced to cough up the levy along with the property dues. 																								The CPM Calcutta District Committee is planning a demonstration in front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters against what it believes are false assurances given by the Trinamul CongressBJP board to win over voters. 																								The mayors announcement of withdrawing water tax is a big lie, said committee member and former mayor Prasanta Chatterjee. The committee will make the rollback an election plank by calling it an official hoax.																								No order or circular has been issued by the municipal commissioner directing CMCs revenue department to accept property tax without water tax to date. 																								So, even the owners of premises that do not have water supply connections are being asked to cough up water tax if the annual valuation of their property is Rs 5,000 or more.																								Two members of a schools managing committee have complained to assessor-collector Soumen Mullick at CMCs Gariahat office that the collection officer had refused to accept their property tax without water tax. 																								But Mullick pleaded helplessness. There is nothing we can do. Until we receive a circular from the municipal commissioner to allow deposition of property tax without water tax, it is not possible to accept only property dues. The computers in the collection department have been programmed to accept data on property tax along with that on the water tax, he added. 																								When the complainants pointed out that there was no filtered water connection in their school, Mullick replied: Whatever be the source of water, the CMC is its owner. As the annual valuation of the school is over Rs 5,000, you have to pay the water tax.																								I too could not deposit my property tax without paying for water. When I reminded the civic officials about the mayors announcement, they just laughed, said CPM councillor and legislator Sudhanshu Sil.

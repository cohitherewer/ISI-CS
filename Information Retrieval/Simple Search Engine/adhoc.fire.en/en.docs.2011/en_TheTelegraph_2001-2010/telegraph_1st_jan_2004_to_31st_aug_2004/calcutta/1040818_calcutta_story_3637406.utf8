The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Lynched for shop break-in
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 22-year-old man, suspected of being a thief, was lynched early on Tuesday in Sonarpur, on the southern peripheries of the city. 																								The victim was identified as Sambhu Paik, a resident of Dhakuria, in south Calcutta.																								According to the police, Paik was killed well after Monday midnight. They said three armed youths had assembled at Gorakhanra market. They first tried to break open the grocery shop of Shyamal Debnath. Two of them entered the shop and tried to take away money. At the same time, Paik tried to break the door of another grocery shop, owned by Manik Sardar. 																								Vigilantes, drawn by the noise, came running. They cordoned off the market, and caught hold of Paik. The other two managed to flee. The mob then tied Paik to a pole and started to thrash him. 																								When Paik collapsed, they fled, leaving him tied to the pole. A local resident called in the cops, who found Paik, seriously injured, on the road. They tried to drive him to hospital, but he died on the way. 																								On Tuesday morning, residents of the area were agitated when they heard about the break-in and the death. They complained that in the recent past, a good number of dacoities and thefts had occurred but police took no action. 																								South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said a hunt was underway for the two other criminals.

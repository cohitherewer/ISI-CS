					PICTURE BY RASHBEHARI DAS Some of the items from the Power Lunch on offer at The Stadel 															Busy corporates can now take a quick break from office, have a good meal and rush back to work with renewed vigour  thanks to Heka, the bar at The Stadel, which has just introduced a Power Lunch. Salt Lake houses all the IT companies in the city and the Power Lunch could well be a boon for employees of these firms.																					Heka is all of six months old and has djs keeping the mood alive on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The choice of combo meals include Indian, Chinese and Mexican priced between Rs 165 and Rs 180. With the introduction of the Power Lunch, Heka is expected to be crowded even during the day. 																					The Power Lunch consists of a fixed menu which will change every week. Diners can opt for either an Indian or a Continental meal. To begin with, there is a choice of two soups and four salads. The main course consists of vegetarian items such as Paneer Butter Masala and Malai Kofta and a host of non-vegetarian items. Accompaniments include kali daal, baby naan and jeera pulao. To wash down all these items, there is a choice of complimentary beverages. The idea is to cater to office-goers tastes and give them a 30-minute in-and-out experience, explains Arnab Kr Sen, manager (operations), The Stadel.l the above is available for as little as Rs 110 (all-inclusive) for vegetarians and Rs 120 (all-inclusive) for non-vegetarians.

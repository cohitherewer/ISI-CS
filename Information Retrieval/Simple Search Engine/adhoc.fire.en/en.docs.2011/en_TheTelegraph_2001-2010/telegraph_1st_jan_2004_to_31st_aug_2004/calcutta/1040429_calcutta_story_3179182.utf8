 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Hospitals take speciality route
 															- Medical majors ready clinics to treat gamut of specific ailments BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Growth by specialisation is the way forward for medical majors around town. Come May, and several leading hospitals will unveil speciality clinics, not by pumping in crores, but by reorganising their resources.																								Taking the lead are hospitals like Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre and Apollo Gleneagles, which have lined up a series of sub-speciality clinics to add to their existing facilities.																								The Rawdon Street hospital is readying a speciality clinic for diabetic mothers-to-be, in response to the rising case of diabetes-related complications during pregnancy.																								Any diabetic planning a pregnancy has to take extra precautions, like leading a healthy lifestyle and reducing obesity. Therein lies the essence of opening this speciality unit, called medical obstetrics clinic, says Dr Rahul Sen.																								The hospital also has plans to make fully functional units on paediatric neurology, paediatric cardiology and dermatology by next month. Many people do not know that 50 per cent of all skin problems can be traced to the paediatric age-group, says Dr Sandipan Dhar.																								Not far behind is Apollo Gleneagles, poised to bring in a whole gamut of speciality clinics and pay special attention to preventive medicine. From a modern health spa to menopause, breast cancer and migraine clinics, the healthcare major will have it all, said V. Satyanarayana Reddy.																								Westbank Hospital, on Andul Road, is coming up with an integrated trauma-care unit, before rolling out other sub-speciality units. According to Satadal Saha, managing director of the hospital, the location of the hospital influenced the decision.																								Being close to the highway, a lot of trauma cases land up here. Preventive and effective management of trauma has become a real need, said Saha.																								The AMRI Hospitals, which recently severed ties with the Apollo Gleneagles group, has just opened two units  a child guidance clinic and the well-baby clinic (where expert advice is provided from the neo-natal to the teenage stage). A backache clinic will also be functional to address a most common problem, said physical rehabilitation expert Kamal Sinha.																								Belle Vue Clinic, meanwhile, has plans to open speciality clinics in gynaecology, ayurveda and eyecare soon.

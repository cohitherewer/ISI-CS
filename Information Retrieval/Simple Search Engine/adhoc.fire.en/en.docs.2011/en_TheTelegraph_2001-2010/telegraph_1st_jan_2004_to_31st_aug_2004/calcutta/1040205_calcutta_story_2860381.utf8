 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 40-plus, but life must go on
 															- Specialised course in menopausal medicine to guide doctors A STAFF REPORTER																								With more and more women coming forward for treatment of menopausal problems, the Indian Menopause Society (IMS) has planned a comprehensive treatment protocol, starting with a specialised course in menopausal medicine for doctors.																								The IMS in Calcutta has received word from its Delhi headquarters about a new, six-to-12-month specialised course for city doctors, to be started in the summer of 2004, to equip them to treat patients with greater uniformity. With age, a womans sex hormones diminish till the ovulation cycle ceases completely and hormone secretion stops, resulting in menopause (usually in the 40s). Women are left susceptible to a variety of illnesses, some of which, if left untreated, may be life threatening.																								With women in the 40-50 age group now coming forward with their health concerns, the IMS members in Calcutta are advocating more training for doctors. Doctors will clear an examination to ensure that treatment of post-menopausal patients is homogenous, says Ratnabali Chakravorty, secretary, IMS, Calcutta.																								In the past two years, post-menopause women have started queuing up at doctors chambers, complaining of hot flushes, sweating, urinary dysfunction and depression, as well as symptoms of more dangerous diseases like cardiac problems, urinary tract infections, bone degeneration and psychiatric disorders. From almost zero patients a couple of years ago, two to three patients a day now come forward with post-menopausal complications, says B.D. Mukherjee, gynaecologist.																								IMS Life begins at 40 campaign aims to raise awareness among women who have started showing pre-menopausal symptoms like anxiety, but choose to ignore them. We are trying to prepare those on the wrong side of 30 by informing them about the preventive aspects. It is not the end of the road at forty, but a new life must begin, adds Chakravorty.																								Hormone replacement therapy, dietary and lifestyle changes can help women make the transition smoothly. More fibres, beans, fruits and fish, replacing fatty foods, can help. Regular calcium supplements can impede osteoporosis, explains gynaecological oncologist K.D. Bakshi. This apart, counselling is a must to prevent psychological problems from setting in. Some women feel that after menopause, life has come to a standstill, says Chakravorty.

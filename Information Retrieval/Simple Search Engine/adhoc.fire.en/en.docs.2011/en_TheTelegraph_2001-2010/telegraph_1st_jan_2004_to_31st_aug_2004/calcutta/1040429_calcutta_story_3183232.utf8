 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Of marks amp; blunders
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An error on the marksheet of a candidate of Calcutta Universitys BA Part I (general) examination, 2003, and a subsequent endorsement of the error by the authorities of her college have resulted in a peculiar situation. The student will write her Part I and Part II together this year.																								The examinee, a student of Vidyanagar College, on the southern fringes of Calcutta, was wrongly declared passed in her Part I marksheet, issued in October 2003. 																								The marksheet showed she had failed in one of her compulsory elective subjects, and would have to reappear for Part I in 2004. It also bore the abbreviation Qg, indicating that she had qualified for the subsequent Part II exams of 2004.																								Instead of detecting the error and pointing it out to the university for rectification, the college endorsed the assessment and requisitioned her form to allow her to write her Part II. The university sent her the form.																								The series of errors came to light on Monday, when the student came to her college to collect her admit card for the Part II examinations from Tuesday.																								The college asked the universitys examination department why her admit card had not been sent. The department officials said the candidate could not write her Part II because she had failed her Part I.																								The denial of permission infuriated students of the college, who gheraoed the principal for several hours on Monday. They claimed the girl had spent all of last year preparing for her Part II.																								When they refused to lift the gherao till late on Monday, the university agreed to allow the girl to sit for her Part II. But she was asked to give a written undertaking that she would reappear for her Part I in June. 																								Suranjan Das, Calcutta Universitys pro vice-chancellor (academic) admitted an error had occurred, but said it was the responsibility of the college to have got it rectified by the university. This kind of error doesnt usually occur.																								Nearly a lakh students took the 2003 BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations. This was the single error of its kind detected.																								The college authorities, however, refused comment. They said the Part II exams were in progress and it would be unfair to comment, as it could put the examinee under pressure.

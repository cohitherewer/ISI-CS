 Friday, August 20, 2004 Triumph of tech tools
Theres no doubt that the Internet is the best, and fastest, way to find and spread information  or just get what you want. Its also the most democratic means of making people sit up and take notice, proof that sometimes, no limits is a good thing. Here are two examples of the virtual world gaining ground, with the young and restless leading the way. Life in Baghdad under bombs, chronicled by blogger Salam Pax in 2003, kept researchers and reporters hooked. (AFP)BloggingWeb logging has been around for over a decade. But what began as a voyeuristic pastime of delving into other peoples lives is fast turning into the tech tool of the 21st Century. Often described as the only form of democratic journalism, with absolute freedom from any kind of checks and balances, it can just as easily be used to incite violence as propagate peace. Depending on whos wielding the tech weapon.Type the word blog in Google search, and the result will be 5.5 million hits. Just an indication of the global phenomenon that blogging has become. A web log is nothing but an opinion site for any individual who wishes to talk to the outside world. The Net is brimming with diaries of people smart enough to choose keyboard over pen.To get your own blog, there are plenty of sites offering free blog-ins, in three small steps. You can play around with content and design. Let people know whats going on in your mind or your corner of the world. Sign on for an organised outfit, that even pays for your service, based on the number of hits per day. Or create a daily diary, with words and pictures, instead of tediously emailing friends and family. Check out whats available for ideas.For the career-conscious: Blogging is not just a hobby any more. Microsoft is spreading its tentacles that way, and reputed media houses are hiring good bloggers. Stay tuned.NetworkingIts social networking, but not the kind youve got in mind. This is about reaching out beyond physical boundaries to make friends, barter, trade and get what you want. Heres the deal  an online library, with a list of what is available and who to get it from. Dash off a message, and either the owner will trade it for something you own that he wants, or lend it for a few days of use. But beware, playing dirty means being blacklisted.Music, books, CDs, DVDs, games... Share just about anything that you have or want. Although there arent any India-specific sites at the moment, dont lose heart. Join some of the US-based ones, and even if it might be too much to send and receive hard copies, things like music, movies and games can be uploaded or emailed. Or just make friends with people of the same age and with similar interests. The concept is entirely legal, and economic, since almost no money is involved. Experience the advantages of the digital domain, first hand, and network away to your hearts content. Whats on your mind this week The killer isIt is time the government took steps to plug the loopholes in the Constitution, the latest victim of which is Dhananjoy Chatterjee. Severe punishment is meant to deter others, with fear. But even after the final verdict of Dhananjoys hanging, two incidents of rape took place in Bengal within a week. Execution is state-sponsored murder. Dhananjoy was not able to escape the noose like professional criminals. An example was the sentence for Bapi Sens killers. They escaped because they were young. Dhananjoy was 28 when he was sentenced to death in 1991. He deserved life imprisonment, because criminals are kept in jail so they can come out as better human beings. Dhananjoy showed signs of change. For the sake of a few, the opinion of millions was ignored.Zaki Mubarki,
Umesh Chandra CollegeNo humanityIt is unfortunate that revenge took precedence over humanity in the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee. For the ghastly crime committed by him, he spent almost 15 years in prison. The sole purpose of handing out a harsher sentence to the culprit is that others dont commit the crime. Nowhere has capital punishment acted as a deterrent. The ultimate sufferers are the poor and those who do not have political backing. Some criminals are perfunctorily punished while others attempts at reformation are ignored. Now, the killers of Graham Staines, Hannah Foster and Zahira Sheikhs family must also be hanged.Md Tarique Nisar,

	Justice grantedDhananjoy Chatterjees death is sure to dissuade others from committing such heinous crimes. What troubles me, however, is Purnimas support of her husband after so many years. She cannot grasp the fact that her husbands act ruined a child and wrecked lives. She must realise that the President was right in his verdict.Raffhat Mir,
Loreto, Eliot RoadMedia glareRecently, the talk of the town was Dhananjoy Chatterjee. From Writers Buildings to roadside tea stalls, his journey to the gallows was the hot topic, from what he ate to how long he slept. The confused faces of his family members stared out every morning from the front pages of newspapers. The trauma they went through was regular news. This seemed to influence a certain section of people, raising questions about his punishment. He committed a heinous crime by raping and murdering an innocent teenager. The castigation meted out to him was what he deserved. The real question is, did a brutal murderer like him merit so much media attention? Suparnaa SinhaPoets cornerLast week, a poem by Inam Hussain Mullick was published in this column. This is a response:Retina dries As does the zeal in dead letters And dead men With swirling smoke Why shy away into oblivion?Near mortal If immortality beckons youWhat do you answer? Joie ChatterjeeAnd the ghosts came a-calling... I should have been too scared to sleep, watching Nightmare on Elm Street. But the Olympics opening ceremony was spectacular. Absolutely amazing! Damn good show. Especially since I dont really remember much about Sydney 2000. Sourav and his team left for Holland today. This is going to be a tough series. The less said the better for now, me thinks. Best of luck... if only they could hear me.And India wins a medal! Three cheers for sharp-shooter Rathore. So the account is open, starting with a silver no less. He fumbled a little in the beginning, but managed a grand finale. Caught a repeat accidentally on DD Sports (but man, they should do something about Doordarshan  dont they know about promos!?)We did it again! Well, almost. This time, its Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupati. They are so in form. Good ol Leander is back with a big bang, post-illness and Mahima. Theyre in the semi-finals now. Fingers crossed. Wish I was in Athens...

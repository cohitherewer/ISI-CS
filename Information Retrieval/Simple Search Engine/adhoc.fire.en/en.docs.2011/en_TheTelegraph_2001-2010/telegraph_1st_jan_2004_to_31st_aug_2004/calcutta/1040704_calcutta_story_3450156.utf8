 Sunday, July 04, 2004 Life - Party HoppingBikini frock to Barbie act 
Three to tango: The Ukrainian trio at Big Ben. Picture by Rashbehari DasFrom Russia with love is the missive at an English pub. United nations is the flavour of the season, at least at Big Ben. While the pub at The Kenilworth played host to a hot Russian duo last week, the whole of this month will see Ukrainian beauties livening up the rainy nights. 																								With gorgeous bods, sensuous moves and dance steps to die for, the trio of Tanya, Lena and Leysa will be grooving their way into the hearts (or is that aiming too high?) of the citys party animals through the next three weeks of July, each night of the week. After performances in Paris, Morocco, Austria, USA and Nepal, its the city of joy that they intend to rock now. 																								The three-member team in their colour co-ordinated bikini frocks in one sequence, or a headgear of colourful feathers in the other, dressed like harem dancers in the third sequence and a final Barbie doll act, made for a great dekho. 																								On Friday night, during their maiden performance in town, the lucky guests who landed up at Big Ben got not just a view, up close, of the lovely ladies, but also coy looks, broad smiles, and flying kisses to go with the warm evening mood. If youve missed the first day first show, better book a berth for a few minutes of fun tonight. Banquet bash 																								 Calcutta now has yet another address where it can party privately. And what better way to introduce the new place to the citys social circuit than to organise a classy bash. 																								D.K. Jaiswals do on Friday evening to launch Topaz, the new banquet hall at HHI, did just that. A plush get-together that saw a mix of industrialists, consulate officials and various other dignitaries, marked the beginning of the citys private party roster for the weekend. 																								The 3,400 sq ft hall wrapped in dark chocolate carpet, with soft lighting and a dcor of orchids, created the right ambience for the rather formal evening. 																								An orchestra took care of the background music, while the rustle of chiffons and the sparkle of diamonds accounted for the glamour factor. 																								Ambuja boss Harsh Neotia, Patton chief Sanjay Budhia, US Consulate officials Bill and Sarah Smith, Italian Consul General Augustino Pinna were among the guests gracing the occasion. 																								A host of food counters and some great cocktails laced the menu for the evening. The Mexican counter was the biggest hit, while the more adventurous queued up for fresh oysters with dips at the Oyster and Shots counter. Cold Salad, Oriental and Fondue counters were the other popular ones.																								Twinkle toes
	Around 200 city school kids donned their dancing shoes at a crowded Kala Mandir on Friday evening. The occasion was Enigma 04, an annual inter-school talent show organised by the Bhawanipur Gujarati Educational Society.Party PooperNa na na na na re..... A big NO was in store for a section of the citys party brigade at the wrong end of an untimely All Fools Day prank by a nightclub last Saturday. The club had invited guests with the lure of a Russian dancer. On arrival, revellers saw neither exotic dance nor dancer and had to make do with lame excuses and a low-key fare on the flooHimika Chaudhuri Bon Appetease will be back next week

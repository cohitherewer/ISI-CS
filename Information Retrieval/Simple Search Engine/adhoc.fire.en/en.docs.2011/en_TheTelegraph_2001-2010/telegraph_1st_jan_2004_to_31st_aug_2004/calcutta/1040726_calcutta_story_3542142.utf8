																																																		Police in Salt Lake found themselves at the receiving end of residents wrath over the increase in theft and dacoity in the township. The meeting between police and residents, held at Webel Bhavan on Sunday, saw resumption of the interactive sessions that had stopped more than a year ago. Representatives of block residents committees expressed their concern over slackness in the security system, traffic chaos, the autorickshaw menace and encroachments. However, the main concern was the law and order situation.																																																								We plan to revive the monthly meetings to beef up security, improve traffic management and remove encroachments from roads by regularly interacting with the residents, said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. Another meeting will be held with the residents for getting their feedback on the measures taken. 																																																		New voters or voters who want to make any corrections in the existing rolls need not wait till September 15, when the process will begin officially, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said on Sunday. Residents of Calcutta can go to the election office in Jessop building on Strand Road for the purpose. Those in the districts will go to the sub-divisional officer on any working day. However, though the changes or inclusions will be registered, the names will be found in the published list only in January 2005. Between September 15 and October 15, the facility will be available in many more offices.

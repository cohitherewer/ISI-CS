The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Child hit with tongs for dropping baby
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Seven-year-old Regina: Battered. Picture by Amit Datta																								Anxiety over the condition of her four-month-old boy  who had suffered a fall from the bed when she was away  drove a primary schoolteacher to brutally assault her seven-year-old domestic help, under whose care the infant was.																								The incident on Saturday evening left young Regina Khatun, in Behala East Park, in the Thakurpukur police station area, with a deep gash on her head and other injuries.																								When Swati Ganguly (also known as Rehana Zadgar after marriage) returned home from school on Saturday evening, an elderly woman in the locality told her that her son had been dropped from the bed by Regina while she was away.																								This infuriated me and I have no idea what happened thereafter, Swati told Metro on Sunday. Fearing that her son had suffered serious injuries, Swati allegedly attacked Regina with a pair of tongs and mercilessly beat her up, inflicting deep wounds on her head.																								At that moment, I was only thinking of my son It is not as if I took it out on her (Regina) just because she is a domestic; I would have reacted the same way if my baby had been dropped by a sibling It was not pre-planned, is all that I can say, added Swati.																								A badly bleeding Regina was rescued by some neighbours from the balcony of the ground-floor flat on K.P. Mukherjee Road, and was rushed to Vidyasagar Hospital. The girl has now found shelter in a neighbours house.																								Landlady Mita Guha Roy said Swati had brought Regina from Habra, where she worked as a schoolteacher.																								I was glad to see that she was making an effort to teach the girl the alphabets. She would also feed the girl at times. But all that changed the day her son was born, she said.																								As she is in school the whole day and her husband comes home once in three months, continued the landlady, Swati had appointed Regina to take care of the baby. But she would regularly beat her up. She recently hit the girl with a broom, inflicting a wound just below her left eye, Mita added.																								Deputy commissioner of police (town) Humayun Kabir said they had not taken action as Swati has an infant to take care of. But once Reginas parents lodge a complaint, we will take action, Kabir said.

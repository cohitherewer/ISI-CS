 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 FAUNA FRAMES: Visitors at the photo exhibition, part of the Wild Life Film Festival. Picture by Amit Datta																								A range of exciting films, information-packed panel discussions, lively demonstrations and a photo exhibition at Quest for Life, the first Wild Life Film Festival, made for an energising four days on the Nandan campus. Between Friday and Monday, thousands of wildlife enthusiasts queued up to watch films and exchange ideas on an issue that proved to be closer than expected to the Calcuttans heart.																								The organisers, Aranyak, and their collaborators, the state forest department, were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers that turned up for the event. Students too, mainly from the nature clubs of schools, thronged the free screenings.																								The Queen of the Elephant, a film on elephant tamer Parvati Barua, Ashish Chandolas Many Moods of Manas, Naresh Bedis The Gangetic Ghariyal and Mike Pandeys The Last Migration were extremely popular selections, and were repeated on demand. Indications from the ministry are that the festival will be made an annual feature, after a limited version of this one is taken into the districts.																								Next years event promises to have more add-ons. We are thinking of bringing folk artistes to perform through the festival, said Vinod Kumar Yadav, conservator of forests, wildlife. A larger number of screens will also allow for a richer spread of films.																								At this first effort, it wasnt just the onscreen action that interested the audience, with an inquisitive turnout for the discussions. A session on tiger conservation saw popular myths and fears dispelled. That tigers will be extinct in 20 years is an oft-repeated warning, but this alarm bell has been sounded many years ago. Are these real concerns, asked the crowd of P.K. Sen, former director, Project Tiger. Pradeep Vyas, director, Sunderbans Tiger Reserve, was on hand to answer questions that cropped up about man-eating tigers. It was clarified that while attacks do occur, there are few documented cases of a tiger eating human flesh. Most victims die of blood loss.																								Breaking away from the films and photography, three-dimensional animals were also part of the line-up, courtesy Deepak Mitra, who brought with him cobras, pythons, rat snakes and, for the grand finale, a king cobra. He also shared tips on how to distinguish poisonous snakes from their harmless cousins, and how to administer first-aid in case of a bite.																								The curtains came down with a talk on the role of the corporate sector and media in protecting wildlife. Need for increased accountability and coverage on environmental issues was stressed by the audience. Sanjay Budhia, managing director of Patton and director, Confederation of Indian Industry, eastern region, expressed his wish to lead a CEOs delegation to the Sunderbans to better understand the concerns.

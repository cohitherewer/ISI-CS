 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fed up of seeing wrinkles on your face every time you look in the mirror, or irritated by the mole or wart, or just want those corns removed from your feet so you can walk easier? 																								The solution was always available, but now theres a new machine in town, designed to minimise the pain, scars and surgery.																								The UM-L25 CO2 laser has arrived at Nova, a centre for cosmetic laser, dermatology and plastic surgery on Sarat Bose Road. Designed by an Indian doctor in an American laboratory in the 1960s, it emits light of 10,600 nanometres wavelength, to vaporise the offending cells and eradicate them entirely. 																								It can be used for the treatment of a wide variety of skin ailments, from the cosmetic  like freckles, scars and cholesterol deposits  to the medical, like skin cancers and other serious problems. 																								It can be used in continuous, pulsed and superpulsed modes, and can be either focused or defocused.																								When the unwanted growths are deep, the focused method is applied, because an incision has to be made. This is where the CO2 laser comes in handy, explains Dr A.K. Prasad of the clinic. It seals the blood vessels; hence, causing no bleeding. It also seals the cutaneous sensory nerve endings. Thus, there is very little post-operative pain. 																								The red light from the laser, invisible to the human eye, targets the water in the cells and converts it to steam so fast, that the rate of accuracy is 50 microns. 																								On some machines, it is 1,000 microns, so this is very accurate and causes the least amount of damage to the neighbouring area, adds physician Prasad.																								But when it comes to big or deep growths, then the surgery will leave scars. Like a nine-year-old patient, who has a birthmark from her groin to her knee, which is now causing her to limp, he clarifies.																								The cost ranges from Rs 2,000 for a 15-minute wart removal to about Rs 50,000 for full facial wrinkle repair for an elderly person. 																								We arent doing that now, because that requires general anaesthesia. Nova is concentrating only on treatments that need local anaesthesia  cream or injection  and is performed by one doctor and one attendant. This includes skin cancers, says Prasad.

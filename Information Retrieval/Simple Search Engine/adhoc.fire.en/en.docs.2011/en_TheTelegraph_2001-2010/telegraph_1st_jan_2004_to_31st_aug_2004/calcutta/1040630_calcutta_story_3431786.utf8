 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 When it rains it pours
																								The monsoons herald a spirit of revelry that is associated with them through age-old rituals and customs. The coming of the rains carries with it the symbol of fertility, prosperity and peace. This quality of the monsoons has been celebrated since times immemorial. The reason for this long-standing enchantment with this season is not only because of its being a time for a brooding sense of longing and love, but also by virtue of its presence as a backdrop to arouse our spiritual and emotional self-realisation. Megh Utsav is a fitting tribute to this very spirit of the monsoons that serves as a catalyst to revive old memories and forge newer ones, that will go down in recorded time as immortal feelings born out of nostalgia for bygone days.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings and sculptures																								When: Till today; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Samokal Art Gallery, Gol Park

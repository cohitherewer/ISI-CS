 Thursday, April 08, 2004 Life - A Thought for FoodBengali bhoj on a roll 
 June Maliah is all ears for chef Subrata Debnath at The Hyatt on Wednesday. (Below) An Easter treat at The Taj. Pictures by Rashbehari Das If the run up to Poila Baisakh is any indication, this next Bengali calendar year, you will not run out of dining options. Every restaurant in town is rolling out a special menu for the season. The Guchhi at the Hyatt Regency, is the latest in line.																								From April 9 to 15, the Indian speciality restaurant will dish out Bengali food. Chef Subrata Debnath has put together a list of over 20 items, using his own recipes for traditional preparations. Narkeli Echorer Chop is one of the best on the list while Bhetkir Kabiraji, another starter, is quite good if you dont mind the oil mandatory in this old favourite.																								The chef has tried to innovate with Korolar Paturi. But while this bitter gourd variation tastes fine, it is not much of a paturi, cooked in gravy and not steamed. The Galda Chingri Malai Curry is a good option, too. While the Guchhi spread is a la carte, on April 14 a buffet will be on at the Waterside Caf.																								Easter is being observed at The Bakery, where goodies will be available from April 8 till April 12. The Waterside Caf will have a buffet on Easter Sunday (April 11).Culture cuisineTaj Bengal, too, is cashing in on the string of festivals about to hit, cooking up everything from Easter bunnies to mammoth thalis piled high with Bangla and Punjabi food.																								While Easter goodies stand pretty at La Patisserie and The Hub in cute baskets, thats not the only thing making patrons smile. An Easter buffet will be on offer at the coffee shop, to include delicacies like caviar, smoked salmon, various cheeses and unlimited champagne to wash it down, all for Rs 850.																								Easter celebrations are no longer the sole preserve of the Christian community in the city. Calcuttans just need an excuse to party. Children especially love Easter bunnies and we keep coming up with innovations every year to cater to their demands, says executive chef Surinder Singh.																								The chef hasnt given Poila Baisakh a miss either, offering a silver thali for Bangla khabar at Sonar Gaon. While most restaurants have forgotten the Punjabi counterpart, Baisakhi, on April 13, that is not a slip Surinder would be likely to make! So April 13 to 15 will also see a spread of Punjabi fare. Unlimited beer will add to the masti, included in the Rs 475 for the vegetarians and Rs 575 for meat-eaters.																								Those bored with tradition can troop across to The Hub for chef Alex Bignottis vegetarian Italian food fest on from April 9 to 18. A lot of customers demand vegetarian food, says Alex. This apart, he is introducing Calcuttans to new ingredients like Italian plum tomatoes, fresh goat cheese, 12-year-old balsamic vinegar, truffle oil and piccorino cheese. Theres a lot of fresh tomatoes, from the tiny cherry variety to the oblong plum. Even one of the desserts features caramelised tomatoes. Not just nights Some people think we are a disco and others think we are only open at night, rues Indranil Dasgupta of Tandoori Nights. The restaurant specialising in Indian and northwest frontier cuisine, lovingly christened after Sayeed Jaffreys sitcom, has not been attracting much lunch business.																								This unexpected turn of events has led to a second baptism. We have decided to introduce Chinese and Thai cuisine and will call ourselves Shanghai Noon and Tandoori Nights from April 10, sighs Indranil.																								This is not the only measure the Hazra Road restaurant is going for. They hope Poila Baisakh will bring good luck with a Banglar Swad festival. The vegetarian thali for Rs 165 includes aloo bhaja, daler bada, sukto, masur dal, jhinge aloo posto, shorshe begun, tel potol, rice, mishti doi, rasogolla and paan. Rs 30 more will buy you the non-vegetarian platter where some of the veggies have been swapped for shorshe dim, doi rui and kosha mangsho.																								While this is a temporary feature (April 10 to 19), the permanent fixture is an exotic mix of Indian, Pakistani, Afghani and West Asian cuisine. The Pakistani selection features kebabs with a richer taste. Afghans rely on more earthy flavours.																								Mud cooking is still prevalent in Afghanistan, explains the resident chef. Meat, he adds, is covered with a banana leaf and left to marinate overnight surrounded with a layer of clay. The following day, it is put in the tandoor and the clay coat is broken. The West Asian dishes are more delicate, with fruit-based gravies and little spices. The chef, however, has no choice but to spice it up to suit the Indian palate.Claw clamour Crabs may not be easily available this time of year but chefs Pinaki Ray and Susanta Sengupta have sourced some of the best crabs to create their special Kakrar Jhaal at 6, Ballygunge Place.																								Weve used small, succulent crabs for that extra taste, explains chef Pinaki at the preview of the restaurants Nababarsher Mahabhoj.																								Other fish delights have also been lined up. Bhetki Paturi, crispy Topshe Maach Bhaja, Pathar Manghsher Jhol and red Enchor Kalia. For the vegetarians, the south Calcutta restaurant is serving up Posto Narkel Bora, Jhuri Aloo Bhaja and Potoler Dorma.																								Instead of waiting endlessly for your orders to arrive (the service was quite slow), you can make the most of the buffet, priced at Rs 350 (all inclusive) for non-vegetarians and Rs 300 for vegetarians.

 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Science show on wheels derailed by exams
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Inside the science train at Howrah station. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Its a mobile exhibition on a science train, with 12 compartments showcasing the way the world works, from nature to telecommunications, IT to agricultural methods. 																								Its packed with information and perfect for school kids, but with the annual and board exams on, few can actually make the time for a look round inside the Vigyan Rail.																								Flagged off from Delhi by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on December 15 last year, the science exhibition on wheels will be on the tracks for eight months, stopping at 56 stations. After successful stoppages in places like Lucknow, Guwahati, Patna and Siliguri, it arrived in Calcutta on March 10, and was inaugurated on Thursday afternoon. But city students seem to have lost out to the exams.																								Proposed by Vigyan Prasar, part of the department of science and technology, under the ministry of science and technology, each compartment in the train has been set up by various national organisations, chronicling its works. 																								These include the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), department of ocean development, department of biotechnology, Survey of India, The Indian Council of Medical Research and Defence Research and Development Organisation.																								Parked on platform no. 21 in the new Howrah station complex till March 18, the exhibition is open to all free of cost, from 10 am to 5 pm. 																								There are colourful posters explaining the hows and whys of diseases and surgery, models of wind and solar power stations and Indian satellites orbiting the earth, computers helping one search for data and televisions showing images of rockets taking off from earth.																								As part of its 25th year celebrations, the NCSM, through the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), has organised activities for youngsters all through the week in front of the Jai jawan, jai kisan, jai vigyan train, like fun chemistry, science quizzes and demonstrations of the magic of science. But officials admit that not many are expected.																								Some teachers did come today to see the exhibition. They said they would like to bring their students here, but most wouldnt be able to come, said a BITM official.

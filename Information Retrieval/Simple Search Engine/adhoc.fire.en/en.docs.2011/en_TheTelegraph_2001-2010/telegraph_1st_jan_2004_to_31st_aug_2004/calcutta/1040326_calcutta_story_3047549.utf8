 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Four mishaps, one killed and four injured
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A man was killed and four people, including a minor girl, were injured in four accidents across the city and its adjoining areas on Thursday.																								Three of the drivers were arrested and their vehicles impounded, but one managed to flee with his vehicle. Deputy commissioner (DC) of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh said the victim was identified as Mozzamel Haq, a resident of Barasats Kalibari, in North 24-Parganas. 																								Singh said it would not be difficult to arrest the runaway driver because bystanders had noted the number of his vehicle. 																								The mishaps disrupted traffic for some time as local people blocked the roads, demanding proper traffic guard. The blockades were lifted after persuasion by senior officers of the police stations concerned.																								In the first mishap at about 10.20 am, N.K. Maheshwari and his eight-year-old niece Sugam were knocked off their motorcycle by a private bus in front of the Reserve Bank of India on NS Road. They were taken to SSKM Hospital in a critical condition. 																								The driver fled with the bus. DC Singh said police stations across the city and its adjoining areas were alerted to keep an eye out for the driver. The mishap sparked a roadblock.																								The second mishap occurred around 11 am. Samir Basu, 35, was knocked off his motorcycle by a taxi on Mahatma Gandhi Road, near the Brabourne Road flyover. He was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital in a serious condition. Bystanders caught the driver and handed him to the police. The vehicle was impounded.																								Around 11.40 am, 60-year-old Sultan Ahmed was walking down the footpath on BB Ganguly Street when a private bus ploughed into him. He, too, was rushed to NRS Hospital. The driver has been arrested and his vehicle impounded. 																								At 12.15 pm, 35-year-old Muzzamel Haq and Habibullah were on a cycle near the airport. They were headed for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Suddenly, a private bus knocked them down. 																								Both Haq and Habibullah were thrown on the road. Bystanders rushed them to Bidhannagar State General Hospital, where Haq was declared dead. Habibullah was stated to be in a serious condition. 																								Police said the victims families had been informed. The driver has been arrested and his vehicle seized. Residents of the area prevented buses from plying on the stretch of road, protesting the lack of traffic guards and a proper signalling system.

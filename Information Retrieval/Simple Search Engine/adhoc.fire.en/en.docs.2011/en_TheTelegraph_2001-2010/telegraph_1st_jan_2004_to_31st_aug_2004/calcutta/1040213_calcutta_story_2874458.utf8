 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Consular tips for city makeover
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Clean up the downtown area to attract foreigners and pull out all stops to project Calcutta as a business destination. Look to forge stronger people-to-people ties and show more responsibility at home and away. Pledge to totally eradicate polio from the state																								Ideas flowed and thoughts were shared as the citys consular fraternity came together in a significant handholding exercise with the Rotary Club of Calcutta Old City last week. The occasion: the International Diplomats Night. The agenda: making life a little easier for the underprivileged in and around town.																								The consular diplomats, working overtime in recent years to alter perceptions of the city using golf as the driver, underlined their eagerness to carry the cause forward and help improve conditions.																								Immediate attention should be given to beautifying the city centre and curbing the chaos. A fresh coat of paint for all the structures could be a start. Points of interest must be created for foreigners, suggested Erhard Zander. The German consul general in Calcutta, who agreed Bengal was riding a second investment wave, said his office was keen to contribute if the projects were transparent and a regular feedback was assured.																								British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall saw scope for strategic alliances in sustainable development, education and culture besides home affairs, counter-terrorism and trade issues. Bengal and Britain share interests in a lot of key areas and we can look to further strengthen people-to-people links, stressed Hall.																								The purpose of such a function is not only to acquaint city-based diplomats with the projects we have undertaken, but also to lend a hand to those less fortunate than us, observed Utpal Chatterjee, director international service and president-elect of the Rotary Club of Calcutta Old City.																								Russian consul general Nikolay M. Fedyukovich, Bangladesh deputy high commissioner Tauhid Hussain and Italian consul general Agostino Pinna promised support for such activities.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Murder, with help from a friend
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The prime accused in the Lalita Devi Goenka murder case, Rabindra Nath Santra, alias Rajesh, arrested from his village near Balasore, in Orissa, confessed to his crime on Tuesday, giving details of how he had carried it out with the help of a friend.																								Deputy commissioner (detective department) Peeyush Pandey said the 20-year-old, who had worked at the Goenka residence for the past two years, murdered Lalita Devi for financial gain. At the outset, we thought a family dispute could have been the motive and a contract killer appointed to carry out the murder, Pandey admitted.																								That is why we had seized documents from Lalita Devis Alipore apartment. But when we came to know that Rajesh had proceeded on leave just days before the murder, we sensed he was our man. During interrogation after his arrest, he told us how the killing was carried out, Pandey added.																								The officer who rounded him up had not visited the scene of the crime, the deputy commissioner said. 																								However, when he called up the homicide wing with the details of what Rajesh had told him, we knew that we had the culprit. He explained in detail his movements in Lalita Devis apartment, and how he and his associate had killed her.																								Rajesh told the police that he left for his village on August 8 at 6 pm by the Jagannath Express and reached the same day. On an earlier visit, I had told my friend, who lives in the same village, about how rich my employers were. We planned to steal some money and decided that the time was right, he said.																								We left our village on August 10 and stayed at my aunts place in Narendrapur, on the southern fringes of the city. The following day, I entered the apartment in the evening through the kitchen door, which remains open in the evenings, and hid in a spare bathroom, Rajesh recounted.																								Around 3 am, I let in my friend. While I stole the cash, he carried out the killing. Then, we dragged the body into the storeroom, locked it and fled, Rajesh added.																								The police have detained Rajeshs aunt. She does not seem to know much about the incident. We also hope to net Rajeshs accomplice in a couple of days, said an officer of the homicide wing.

 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Operation flush-out at hospital hostels
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A search-and-identify crackdown on illegal boarders is set to be launched at the Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital hostels within a day or two. The hospital authorities, after a string of meetings on Friday, decided to form a committee to monitor the drive against illegal occupants.																								Hospital superintendent Basanta Khan said: We have formed two committees to sort out the problem. One will inquire into the recent assault on junior doctors and the other will identify those who are staying in the hostels illegally. The drive against the illegal boarders will be started soon.																								The Trinamul Congress-backed students wing went on a hunger strike in the hospital but was back at class on Friday. The demonstration was withdrawn after the authorities announced that a committee, comprising five teachers and two representatives from both the SFI and Trinamul-backed students wings, would be formed to drive out the illegal occupants from the hostels.																								Till Friday night, however, police help was not sought. The hospital authorities have not contacted us so far. If they seek our help for the search, we will assist them. But we cant intervene till they invite us, said Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters).																								Hospital sources said both the students wings who had lodged complaints were invited to the talks table to thrash out their demands. Neither had responded till late on Friday.																								A drive will help flush out a number of illegal occupants, the sources said. The vacant rooms will then be allotted to interns and house-staff members.

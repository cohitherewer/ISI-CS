 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 B.Ed for teachers of special children
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Jadavpur University and the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) have come together to start a B.Ed course for teachers who will deal with disabled students in various educational institutions.																								The special education course for locomotor disabilities, including cerebral palsy, which was launched on Thursday by Governor Viren J. Shah, is one of its kind in eastern India, with approval from Rehabilitation Council of India and the University Grants Commission. 																								With the governments rule to have three per cent seats reserved for disabled students in educational institutes, there is a need for teachers specially trained to teach these students, said Tandra Mitra, head of the department of adult, continuing education and extension, Jadavpur University. 																								The department, in collaboration with the IICP, has started the course with 22 teachers in the first batch. The IICP will provide the faculty. 																								Officials say, with 500 million challenged children  physically and mentally  across the country, there is a need to try to bring them into the mainstream. 																								The course prepares teachers not only for work in special educational contexts but also in regular schools that follow inclusive policies. They will also teach in regular schools that work for the integration of students with disabilities, said Reena Sen of the IICP.

 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Girls murder turns murkier
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The unidentified 12-year-old girl, whose body was discovered in an abandoned steel factory in the Taratala area on Wednesday, had been raped before being murdered. 																								While confirming this on the basis of the preliminary examination conducted by doctors, police admitted that despite an extensive hunt for clues, there was no indication of her identity yet.																								None of the police stations in and around the area that had been alerted after the discovery of the body had received any response from the people or the network of informants.																								According to police sources, no missing complaints had been lodged in the area. We found nothing on her, apart from the jeans and T-shirt she had been wearing. We suspect that her belongings were taken away by the assailant, said an officer of the detective department.																								If the Taratala crime story grew murkier, police all but cracked the mystery of the attack on the wife and daughter of a Girish Park businessman on Wednesday night. Sagar, alias Mithu, and Kanchan Saha were rounded up on Thursday for raiding the Aurora residence, along with two others, and firing at Kamala Aurora, 46, and daughter Puja, 16. The teenager was hit in the arm, while her mother suffered a shoulder injury.																								Police had earlier suggested that the goons were neighbours of businessman Vinod Aurora. But the trail of a Tata Sumo, the number of which had been noted down by a resident of Baranasi Ghosh Street, finally led the cops to Barasat, in North 24-Parganas.																								We traced the owner of the vehicle and reached the door of a Howrah resident, who told us he had sold the vehicle to Kalipada Guha of Baguiati, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra. 																								Sleuths then picked up the trail of driver Kanchan Saha, a resident of Barasat, and accomplice Mithu. Saha admitted his involvement in the assault and spilt the Swarupnagar address of the missing duo.

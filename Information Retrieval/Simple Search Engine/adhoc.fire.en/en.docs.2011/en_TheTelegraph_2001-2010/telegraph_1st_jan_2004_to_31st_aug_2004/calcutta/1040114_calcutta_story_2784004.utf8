 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Mishaps five, fatalities four
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four persons were killed on Tuesday and a four-year-old child was seriously injured in five accidents across the city. The dead included a student and a Ganga Sagar pilgrim. 																								Swagatam Dey, a post-graduate student of Jadavpur University and a resident of Kabi Nabin Sen Road, Dum Dum, slipped while trying to board a private bus on route 221 at the crossing of AJC Bose Road and Park Street at around 10.30 am on Tuesday. The identity card he was carrying in his shirt pocket helped the police identify the young man. 																								Bimala Bheit had come from Maharashtra to take a holy dip at Ganga Sagar. However, her wish remained unfulfilled, for the 55-year-old woman was hit by a car on Strand Road while trying to cross the road at around 8.30 am. 																								Traffic police have arranged for buses that arrive with pilgrims from all over the country to be parked near Kingsway, on the Strand. The pilgrims leave for Ganga Sagar from here. This is an accident-prone stretch. 																								Bimala was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. The driver of the car was arrested. 																								Angry residents blocked Diamond Harbour Road for nearly half an hour on Tuesday evening after a man was run over by a bus. Police said Tarun Mondal (24) was crossing the road near Thakurpukur at 6.15 pm when he was hit by a private chartered bus, moving towards Diamond Harbour. 																								Mondal was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. That sparked off a roadblock, with a demand for more speedbreakers on the road and deployment of additional traffic police.																								In another accident in the southern part of the city on Tuesday morning, an unidentified 40-year-old man was killed after he was hit by a pitch-melting machine of the public works department on Bijon Setu, in Kasba. He was rushed to National Medical College and Hospital, where he later died.																								A four-year-old was seriously injured after being hit by a car on Munshibazar Road, in Beleghata. Police said the girl, Pooja Chowdhury, was crossing the road when an Ambassador knocked her down. 																								Her right leg was severely injured and she was admitted to Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, where her condition is stated to be serious. Police said the driver of the car has been arrested.

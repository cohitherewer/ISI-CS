 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Vienna voices hit city high
Members of the Vienna Boys Choir at a city hotel on Monday afternoon. Picture by Pradip Sanyal It all began half a millennium ago, at the whim of an emperor, when, in 1498, Maximilian I of Austria made it mandatory for six boys to be included among his musicians, to perform exclusively for the court. After the collapse of the Habsburg Empire in 1918, the Imperial Choir was re-established as the Vienna Boys Choir. It was only then that they began singing for the world, in their now-famous sailor costumes.				 				 																															Five hundred years later, the group brought its formidable presence to the Calcutta stage. As part of an India tour  after 26 years  the group of 24 youngsters, aged 10 to 14, performed in Delhi and Mumbai before Kala Mandir on Monday evening.				 				 																															We had to come here, because when we were organising this programme, people overwhelmingly said Calcutta is the culture capital, and there are plenty of music-lovers, was the word from the Austrian embassy.				 				 																															Split into four choirs of around 30 each, the Schubert choir was in town, on a days visit. The culture is very different, so are the buildings. And it was very hot. But after a while, it was nice, smiled Christoph Bleibershnig, a chorister, speaking before the performance on Monday afternoon. But while his friend Sean Finn enjoyed seeing the temples and the ocean the most, Christoph preferred the cows and elephants on the road.				 				 																															Their Delhi trip included a visit to President A.P.J. Abul Kalam, where they sang for him along with a childrens choir from Delhi, after which they were presented with a few verses by the man himself. I loved walking through the gardens at the Presidents palace. It was very beautiful, recalled Sean.				 				 																															Part of their repertoire was a Cherokee (native American), an African song and a Hebrew song, a Marathi bhajan and a qawwali. Some Indians in Vienna taught us the bhajan and the qawwali, and helped us with the pronunciations, explained Gerald Wirth, conductor in India and artistic director of the choir.				 				 																															We want to put India every alternate year in our schedule, said general manager Eugen Jesser. We also want to include two Indian boys in the choir.				 				 																															With illustrious former choristers like Mozart, Schubert, Joseph and Michael Hayden, the Vienna Boys Choir has a heritage thats still alive among its current 100-plus young members, who perform at around 300 concerts every year, for about half a million people. The boys recorded their first CD in 2002, and have lent their voices to films and operas as well and have also performed with renowned conductors like Zubin Mehta and several orchestras.				 				 																															World music is a significant part of the curriculum at the Wiener Sangerknaben school, where almost 250 children study, from toddlers to teens. A recent project, Silk Road, featured songs from Uzbekistan, China, a qawwali from Turkey, a ghazal from Iran and field hollers from Tajikistan, sung in their original languages by the older age group, who tour about 11 weeks in a year.				 				 																															But when the teenagers voices get to breaking point, they go home.				 				 																
	 Magic memory				 				 																															The vast difference between state and private education, the traditional and the modern, the privileged and the under-privileged, and yet, the harmony between innovation and lack of resources, the old and the new, more and less This is the most striking and palpable memory that a group of schoolteachers from the UK will be taking back with them at the end of an 11-day visit to learn about Calcuttas education system.				 				 																															Ten teachers from Hertfordshire, who were in the city from April 5 to 12, as part of the British Councils Teachers International Professional Development (TIPD) programme, visited Birla High School (girls section) and Vivekananda Mission Society, including their community education centres at Ajanta, New Alipore and Chetla. 				 				 																															Led by the Local Education Authority representative, the group visited the classrooms in the school buildings, as well as those in the slum areas. And while they admitted that the contrast was stark, there was a lot to be learnt from both. The experience was very humbling, said Alison Ford, from Cuffley School.				 				 																															What overwhelmed them the most was the warm welcome and homely hospitality from all and sundry, said LEA official Lucy Connolly. We were taken on escorted temple tours and shopping sprees. On the list were saris and handicrafts, to show their students back in the UK, to help them understand Indian culture. And, of course, weve taken lots of pictures.				 				 																															The children were wonderful, smiled Ed Crummack, from Bridgewater Middle School. They had so many questions, from how we punish and praise our students, to how many fans we have in our classrooms. We had told them about heaters. But there are similarities  we shut school when theres too much snow, and that happens here due to monsoon floods.				 				 																															Some of the teachers had brought letters from their students, which the girls from Birla High have replied to, in the hope of establishing pen pals. Some of them plan to keep in touch through email.				 				 																															I will implement one thing  tiffin sounds so much more fun than break time. Ill start using that with my little ones, signs off Sue Edmanson, a veteran teacher of toddlers.				 				 																
	 A touch of spring 				 				 																															Spring, often referred to by Tagore as the king of seasons, arrived on our college campus with a big bash. Vasant Utsav, an integral part of the colleges annual calendar, was celebrated with much fun and fanfare, with abir, incense and flowers.				 				 																															The programme started with a medley of songs comprising Rabindrasangeet as well as Nazrulgeeti. Poetry left its mark, drawing perticipation from well-known writers as well as the students themselves who penned a few verses.				 				 																															Teachers, too, joined in the festive spirit, singing solos and chorus numbers and also reciting. Finally, the programme struck just the right note when the Celebration of Youth was brought in through carefully selected numbers, leaving everyone wanting more. Ranjana Das,
UG II, geography, Lady Brabourne College Students of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, take a pledge to protect the elderly, before tying suraksha bandhans on the wrists of their grandparents at a programme at Raj Bhavan last week, on World Health Day				 				 																															Future perfect?				 				 																															Is India Shining? No was the answer from corporate guru Russi Mody; yes was the reply from school students. As part of its Distinguished Speakers Series Programme, Birla High School had invited Russi Mody at an interactive session with senior students last week. While Mody felt that there are no prospects for betterment in the near future, the students overwhelmingly believed that India had progressed.				 				 																															During his brief visit, Mody blamed the older generation for the state of the country, and he felt that it was up to the youth of today to bring about change. His advice for the senior students was to create LEED  leadership, efficiency, education and discipline.				 				 																															However, the students stressed on the GDP and foreign exchange figures to support their claims of success. They felt that there was improvement, and were full of optimism. 				 				 																															But when Mody expressed his opinion that not democracy, but a benevolent dictatorship was needed in India, the prompt query from a student was: What would you do if you were the one? To this, the former corporate captain replied that he would implement one religion, one language and a uniform dress code for the people.				 				 																
	 Limelight				 				 																															It is time to doff the hat to young pensters and wielders of the brush. 				 				 																															The prizes were announced for the Fifth All India Poetry Competition Among School Children: 2003, organised by The Poetry Society (India), with the support of the department of secondary and higher education, ministry of human resource development. Inam Hussain Mullick of Don Bosco School, Park Circus, bagged second place. The Class XII student was the only winner from Calcutta in the contest. 				 				 																															A panel of judges selected the winning poems from amongst 2,013 entries from 171 schools across the country. Inams poem was titled Calcutta - Observations, Careless and Careful.				 				 																															On April 17, the winners of international and national art contests will be given their awards by artist Ramananda Bandyopadhyay at a presentation ceremony at Nehru Childrens Museum. Ekta Sinha is the recipient of The Rose of Lidice Medal for the 31st International Childrens Exhibition of Fine Arts, Lidice 2003.

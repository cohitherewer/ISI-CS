The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Escape offer from tout trap
 																											- Hassled hospitals in a huddle over volunteers to guide patients BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								The doctor is absent and the liftman is missing. The nurse is nowhere to be found and a senior official has left early But the tout is always on duty.																								Theres no escaping the tout trap at state-run hospitals. With the hospital administration and the police failing to break the stranglehold of tout raj, the government has now turned to volunteers to bail out patients and to improve the image of the health delivery system.																								Wednesday will find health chieftains from both the government and private sectors assembling to finalise details of a project with Dishari, a voluntary organisation that has promised to post volunteers in all major hospitals to guide patients.																								We want to get rid of touts and ensure smooth functioning of hospitals. So, we have decided to give serious thought to the proposal given by Dishari, said C.R. Maiti, director of medical education.																								Apart from Maiti and other senior health department officials, including hospital superintendents and senior physicians, representatives from private hospitals like AMRI, CMRI, Kothari Medical Centre and Nightingale Diagnostics are scheduled to attend the meeting.																								I am looking forward to the meeting and hope that something positive comes out of it, stressed Maiti.																								Tout menace has grown over the years and increased police vigil at hospitals has achieved little. A large number of patients, especially those new to Calcutta, fall prey to touts and end up spending a lot of money without getting proper treatment. We will try to guide such people to the right department. Patients coming from neighbouring countries are often fleeced by touts in private hospitals, too, says Mohua Sarkar, the architect of Dishari.																								Five years back, Sarkar had proposed a similar programme, but the health department had turned a deaf ear to it. That only strengthened my resolve, and I am happy that I have been able to convince them now, added Sarkar.																								Dishari is also planning to set up centres on the citys fringes and in the districts so that patients and their relatives can be given proper guidance in terms of healthcare facilities available in the city.																								The organisation will charge a reasonable fee from patients, with waiver schemes for the poor. Apart from treatment facilities, the organisation has plans to provide accommodation at a reasonable rate in the city for the patients family members.

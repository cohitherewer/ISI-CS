 																											- Jeweller who forgot to take back keys finds shop valuables looted A STAFF REPORTER																								The Jewel Thief was at it, and like his screen counterpart, he has overnight made off with 4.6 kg of jewellery, worth Rs. 25 lakh.																								This alleged Jewel Thief, however, has neither the glamour of Dev Anand in the Sixties blockbuster, nor is he the chief of a gang of thieves. He is a humble security guard of a jewellery shop in central Calcutta. 																								Mian Raaz, 35, a resident of Basirhat, in North 24-Parganas, is the prime suspect and he is absconding. 																								According to an official of Bowbazar police station, the owner of the jewellery shop on Colootala Street, Luthfal Haque, lodged a complaint with the police when he, on opening the locker of his shop on Saturday morning, discovered that the pieces of jewellery he puts on display were missing. 																								I left the shop the previous night but forgot to take the key of the locker. Usually, I carry it with me but on Friday, when I reached home, I found that I had not brought the key back. I did not bother to call Raaz up as he had worked in my shop for quite some time and I used to trust him, Haque reportedly told the police. 																								The trust placed in Raaz proved expensive for the old man. The following morning, when I approached my shop, I felt a bit uneasy as the shutters were still closed and Raaz was nowhere to be seen. Usually, it was he who opened the shutters on my arrival. I opened the locks with a bunch of duplicate keys and headed straight for the locker. I opened its heavy metal door and found it empty, Haque said in his statement to the police.																								Policemen, on arriving at the scene of the crime, tried to find some incriminating evidence against the security man. But they failed to do so, even after spending the whole day at the shop. 																								He did his job well. The only thing that goes against him and has raised suspicion is his disappearance. The original set of keys that Haque had forgotte to take with him the previous night was nowhere to be found, a member of the probe team said.																								We have sent a team to Basirhat and when we catch him, we will get the full picture. Right now, what I can say from all that I have heard is that Mian Raaz has been absconding ever since the jewellery went missing. We will be able to say something conclusive only after he is caught, said sources in the force.																								We are keeping a close watch on Haque but nothing can be said unless we get the security guard, the sources added.

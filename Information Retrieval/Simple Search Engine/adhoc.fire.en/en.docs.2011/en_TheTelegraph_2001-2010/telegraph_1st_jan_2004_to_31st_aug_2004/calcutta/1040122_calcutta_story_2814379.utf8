The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 22, 2004  Spilling the beans Rajdeep Ghoshal  (extreme left) with guests at the new Caffeine outlet  on Elgin Road				 															Its been a player for a while now and just like with any seasoned contender, things are getting better with time. Caffeine, the caf at Golpark was one of the first entrants to the coffee play-offs in the city and four years on, its still going great guns  boasting a loyal clientele and a brand new outlet too. 																																																				The all-new Caffeine at 10/4F, Elgin Road, though, hardly resembles the Golpark joint. Its bigger with a 58-cover capacity, and much brighter with splashes of violet, orange and red everywhere. Says owner Rajdeep Ghoshal, I wanted to create a place that looked young and felt young because from where I see it, were still in our youth.																																																				And while youngsters are thronging the place all right, oldies are also dropping in to taste those all-time favourite brews and bites. The beverage menu is divided into three sections  Hot, Warm and Cold  and the biggest sellers here are the Caffeine Cooler (cold coffee blended with cola and topped with ice-cream and chocolate sauce), Chocolachino (thats your basic caf mocha) and Caf Aulait (the in-house latte). A different high comes by way of such warm coffees as Irish Coffee spiked with whisky and Hot Mocha, laced with the essence of rum, chocolate and mocha cream. Then theres the sinful Mega Mocha Shake, Viennese coffee, Mexican coffee and in a concession to all the tea lovers in the city, 16 different kinds of tea. 																																																				so available at Caffeine is an array of freshly-made food taking in sandwiches, chicken nuggets, cottage cheese fritters and more. The Green Paste and Reshmi Kebab sandwiches come highly recommended as do the walnut brownies, ice-cream canaps and hot chocolate fudge.																																																				Eating out here is extremely pocket-friendly as everything on the menu ranges from Rs 20 to Rs 45. And with fun activities such as book readings, one-act plays and music performances (singer Shilajit joined forces with local act Cassinis Division for a delightful performance on the inaugural day) lined up, something or the other will always be brewing at Caffeine. For details, contact, 98311 84373. Tanuka Saha, mega-winner  of The Telegraphs Unputdownable offer, receives  the Maruti Baleno keys from Sanjay Nigam (extreme left)  and Sandip Ghose at the Machino Techno showroom in Alipore 				 															Shes got a ticket to ride 																																																				I just cant explain how thrilled I am, exclaimed an elated Tanuka Saha, minutes after the keys of a spanking-new Maruti Baleno were handed over to her. The customer service executive with American Express and the very first mega-winner of The Telegraphs Unputdownable offer was all smiles as she and her mother Ratri received the grand gift at the Machino Techno showroom in Alipore. Present on the occasion to do the honours were Sanjay Kumar Nigam, regional manager of Maruti and Sandip Ghose, vice-president, The Telegraph and Businessworld.																																																				The Telegraphs Unputdownable offer was announced on November 5 last year offering a six-month subscription for Rs 338 with a gift cheque worth Rs 100, a one-year subscription for just Rs 676 with a gift cheque worth Rs 225 and plenty of other goodies to boot. Every subscriber is entitled to participate in a lucky draw that throws up such amazing prizes as HCL Beanstalk computers, Samsung home appliances, return air-tickets to Kathmandu and Bangkok, wallets, watches and of course, the three mega prizes  Maruti Balenos. 																																																				The seven draws including two mega-draws held so far have proved lucky for hundreds of readers out there. While 1,500 people have won wristwatches and an equal number, wallets, many have also taken home HCL computers, Samsung TVs, refrigerators, air-conditioners, microwave ovens and more. But the luckiest by far have been Tanuka and Sipra Basu, the winner of the second mega-draw who will soon also be driving home her very own Baleno.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Hotel poses bane and boon
				 	 D.P. Jana, member-secretary and project director of the Sunderbans Development Board, met readers of The Telegraph at his office last week to answer their queries. Participants included Kalyan Chakraborty, G. Laha, Paritosh Ghosh, Ananga Ghosh, Avijeet Sinha and Sunanda Basu				 																																																																																																																																																																																																													

Paritosh Ghosh: Controversy surrounds the proposed hotel and tourism project by a private organisation (Sahara) in the Sunderbans. Does it pose any threat to the environment of the mangrove forest?																																																			Yes, it seems the project will have a detrimental effect on the environment of the area. But the environment department of the state government is aware of the developments and is closely monitoring the effects. The chief minister is personally looking after the matter. Recently, we held a meeting with the pollution control board authorities and the tourism department to evaluate the present status of the project. Though we have formed a nodal agency for the development of the Sunderbans, this project is being specifically handled by the tourism department. Its officials often seek our suggestions before executing the new plans and projects. But this project will generate employment, which is a major demand of the area. While very few from the area will be directly recruited for the star hotel, a lot of people will be involved in the ancillary units needed for running the proposed hotel and tourism operations. Thus, the local economy will get a boost if the project is implemented properly.																																																									

Sunanda Basu: What is the present condition of the residents of the island?																																																			The Sunderbans comprises two major areas. One is the core area, which is strictly non-inhabited, while the fringe areas  like Basanti, Gosaba, Canning, Hasnabad and Hingalgunge  are densely populated. A majority of the residents are farmers; others collect honey or work in the fisheries. Road and water transport, through mechanised boats and launches, are easily available now and have set off a spurt in business activity. With nine colleges and 447 secondary schools, the literacy rate, according to the last census, touches 82 per cent. 																																																											We are encouraging the farmers to grow watermelon, green chilli and a few pulses, which have yielded a good crop. But a good harvest needs to be sent to the mainland, and so we have modernised the village roads and built six new jetties.																																																									

Ananga Ghosh: The Sunderbans Development Board, along with the local administration, is organising many festivals in the area. What is the objective behind these congregations?																																																			Actually, there isnt enough infrastructure to bring entertainment into these areas. So, if we can organise a fair once or twice a year, it will give the local people something to cheer about. Moreover, through these fairs, we are trying to build up a forum that will help the locals  who mostly remain segregated due to the geographical characteristics of the region  to exchange ideas among themselves. 																																																											This type of village fair will help build a local marketing network, as well as provide a platform to promote awareness. 																																																											Now, we organise a yearly festival named Bonbibi Utsav and celebrate a day with a particular theme. We try to reach all classes of people through the weeklong festival, but the focus is on school students. 																																																											Our motto is: Come to the Sunderbans, care for the Sunderbans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Shopping bag spills over				 																																																											On Sunday, August 8, Pantaloons recorded sales of an unprecedented Rs 1 crore between its 22 Camac Street and Gariahat stores. The one-crore barrier was breached on that Saturday too, even as more than 200,000 people walked through the family store portals during the last three days of the end-season sale.				 																																																											Now, the multi-brand retail major, among the pioneers of Calcuttas retail revolution, is looking to mop up Rs 15 crore during the 35-day lead-up to the Pujas, with another Rs 7 crore targeted from the Big Bazaar cash tills.				 																																																											The Mumbai-headquartered apparel-centric chains phenomenal success in Calcutta is no flash in the pan. We were able to achieve the emotional connect with the Calcutta consumer from Day One, thanks to an elaborate anthropological study undertaken to understand the essential middle-class Bengali psyche, observes Kishore Biyani, chief knowledge officer, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd.				 																																																											The extensive research studied Calcuttas shopping and reading habits, religious beliefs and culinary leanings, social customs, housing preferences				 																																																											We found they took pride in carrying a shopping bag from a big store and set about mapping their core traits in a futuristic scenario, trying to figure out how they would cope with a more modern format, recounts Biyani.				 																																																											Pantaloons business strategy for Calcutta was conceived by a Bengali creative team from the stable of Dhar amp; Hoon. Its brief was to create a campaign in the language you dream and to ensure Calcuttans looked at Pantaloons as their store. The fulcrum of the strategy has been working with their emotions.				 																																																											Says Biyani: In Calcutta, the customer was never really respected by any marketer.				 																																																											The chain changed its template to match the Bengali calendar of festivals to strengthen the connect. We decided to leverage occasions like Jamai Shasthi and Nabo Barsho, offering a theme shopping experience and our sales jumped at least 40 per cent during those windows, says marketing head Sanjeev Agrawal.				 																																																											Biyani believes Calcutta was always a key retail destination with its abundant power, good communication, an imperial hangover, strong family ties and high aspiration levels.				 																																																											So, the city figures prominently in the groups expansion plans as it moves to add another two million sq ft of retail space to its stable by 2006. We want to be a dominant player in Calcutta across a basket of items from food to clothing to all home needs, he declares.				 																																																											So, Ultadanga will get a Pantaloons and a Big Bazaar, Gariahat another Big Bazaar, while Hiland Park will have a 25,000-sq ft Food Bazaar in its mall, The Metropolis. The new-age Pantaloons format, with a 30-day rack-renewal pledge, will debut at Forum II, along with a Food Bazaar. The store will have perishable fashion items, to be rolled over every 30 days, in sync with our emerging marketing policy, which has fashion as the axis, elaborates Agrawal.				 																																																											Biyani promises Calcutta a Central (the groups seamless mall format launched in Bangalore) soon, because no other city deserves one more.				 																																																											With ticket sizes in excess of Rs 10,000 not uncommon in his stores these days, the retail czar feels Calcutta has arrived in terms of aspiration shopping.Subhro SahaB-day buried, bash is back				 																																																											The birthday may have been struck off the calendar, but the birthday party is back. The annual festival that celebrates Calcuttas heritage, Sutanuti Utsab, starting August 24, will be a six-day affair this year. The highlights: a Phaeton ride, kabir larai (poet contest) and a 19-dish gala lunch.				 																																																											Governor Viren J. Shah is one of the reasons for the Phaeton riding back into the festival after a four-year gap. He had inquired whether we were still continuing with it and had expressed interest, said Gopinath Ghosh, secretary of Sutanuti Parishad, which organises the festival. The ride, though, will be a short one, confined to the premises of Sovabazar Natmandir.				 																																																											Kabir larai would also be making its debut in the festival. Rather than a real contest like the way it used to happen in the older days, it will be more of a show, explained Ghosh. 				 																																																											A group of 10 from Barasat, specialising in the dying art, is expected to script the start-up. The Parishad will also felicitate Calcuttans including cricketer Utpal Chatterjee, actor Haridhan Mukherjee and surgeon Bimalendu Mukherjee.				 																																																											On the cards is a competition for schoolchildren titled Utkarsha. Participants will have to choose four out of nine items such as elocution, dance, skits and extempore speaking, and perform them in 20 minutes. Around 20 schools are expected to participate. Festival regulars like Mahila Majlish (an adda exclusively for women) and Baithaki Adda (more adda, but open to all) will be there, too.				 																																																											The sign-off, like every year, will be with the gastronomical extravaganza. It was through the festival that the interest in traditional Bengali dishes was revived, feels Ghosh. And now they are served at food festivals regularly in city hotels and restaurants.The lunch on the final day will have a menu showcasing all the traditional dishes of the early 19th century when fish was the only non-vegetarian item on the menu. There will be fancy names aplenty, such as Beguner Basantabahar and Moogmohan.Gift of the grab: Parambrata and SamataSpoilt brat inherits a pot of gold, but with a catch. He will get the wealth  and the girl  but not before accomplishing 10 tough tasks (sounds familiar?). So, there goes cool dude Parambrata, toiling away in Sreshtha Upahar. With him through thick and thin in this five-episode serial is teen heart-throb Samata Das. Mondo Meye is history, its time for Samata to have some fun! Picture by Pabitra Das

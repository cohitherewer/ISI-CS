 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Mishra cracks must-act whip on clinics
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Private hospitals and clinics in and around Calcutta will be punished if found violating the Clinical Establishments Act, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra warned on Wednesday.																								To prove his seriousness, Mishra informed the state Assembly that strong action had already been initiated against half-a-dozen clinics in Howrah. 																								All the private health institutions will have to abide by the act and the government will not allow any deviation from it. We are investigating complaints against a number of private institutions, the minister said.																								Replying to a question on the extent of the governments control over the activities of private health institutions, minister Mishra said punishment for violating rules are cancellation of registration and licence, a cash fine and even imprisonment.																								Private hospitals and nursing homes availing of customs duty exemption for importing equipment will have to allow 40 per cent discount for outdoor patients and 10 per cent for indoor patients, he elaborated.																								Hospitals run by the missionaries and NGOs, availing of the customs duty exemption, will have to allow 20 per cent discount for outdoor patients and 15 per cent for indoor patients. Action will be taken against the hospitals violating the rules, Mishra told the House.																								Though the government does not have any direct control over the corporate hospitals, the health minister said they, too, have to follow the Clinical Establishments Act. 																								The health department will not intervene in their affairs, but the authorities will have to furnish an annual report to the government, mentioning the services provided and fees taken, Mishra asserted																								Members from the Opposition bench criticised the government for its failure to provide proper healthcare services in government hospitals. Trinamul Congress legislators alleged that patients coming from the districts do not get proper care in government hospitals. They said the healthcare system in the districts had collapsed totally and people were compelled to come to the city for medical attention.																								Rubbishing the allegations, Mishra said over 80 per cent patients are treated in government hospitals, which is much above the national average. 																								The minister cited a report prepared by the National Council of Applied Economics to substantiate his statement.																								Mishra told the House the government had taken several effective steps for improvement of conditions in government hospitals.

 Nelanjana BhowmickCaesar (Dachshund) likes his milk thick and creamy, Vincent (Labrador) will only respond when spoken to in English and Titi (pariah pet) will not step out of the AC room. This is Tootooms World, a crche run by Ranjana Mukherji, which caters to the varied needs of pets. Its important to know your pet is being well looked after when youre leaving town. So, seek: Comfort: Visit the place before you decide to leave your pet there. If you like it, take your pet along to meet the staff members.Cleanliness: Should top the list. Check on the kind of bowls used for meals. Clean drinking water is a must.Safety: There should be no possibility of your pet running away or getting hurt.Brief the crche on your dogs nature, illness, preferences and food habits. Leave your phone number and address, the number of your vet, and something familiar (your pets favourite toy or blanket).My recommendation for now: Tootooms World (24752515). Its more of a guest-house with separate spaces for pets. There is a garden where the pets can play around and relieve themselves. The rates are affordable and the staff members give personal attention.My clincher: It was Caesars first day at Tootooms. For the entire time I was there, he was plonked on Ranjanas lap.

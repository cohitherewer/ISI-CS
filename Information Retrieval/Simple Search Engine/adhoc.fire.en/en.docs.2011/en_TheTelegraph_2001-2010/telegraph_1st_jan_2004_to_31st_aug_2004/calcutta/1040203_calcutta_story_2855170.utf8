 Models show off outfits by designer Ruby Gupta at Midnight Fashion Fever at Dublin Picture by Rashbehari Das 															Swanky interiors, hypnotic music, heavenly bodies and designer togs always make for a deadly combination. Something designer Ruby Gupta knows only too well. So for a showing of her latest collection, she set her sights on Dublin, the plush nightspot at the ITC Sonar Bangla, its talented deejay and a bevy of local beauties. Billed Midnight Fashion Fever, the event kicked off near about half-past eleven and continued well into the early hours of the morning, throwing up some rather unusual and unique styles along the way. 																					Humayanie-Kabeeri, the collection zooming in on Indo-Persian and Indo-Afghan designs was by far the most eye-catching. Saris in a melange of colours and fabrics shot with silver threads dipped in oil and worked over with beads, zardosi and turquoise shells were shown off to perfection as were heavily-embellished tops and kurtas with traditional Lucknowi gharana work. Also pulling weight at the show was the Faux Fur Collection that saw fleece and fur blended together in a range of tops, pull-ons and trousers for a casual yet flamboyant look. Ruby also churned out a line of Western corporate suits for women that for once, veered away from the usual blacks and instead stuck to such earthy colours as brown, cream and maroon. 																					Sponsored by Flawa, Coca Cola and of course, Sonar Bangla, the fashion show saw such upcoming models as Srie, Shrestha, Shovona, Shweta and Tanishq strutting their stuff among others.

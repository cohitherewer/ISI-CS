 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Fast life lure as motive clue
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The lure of a lifestyle he couldnt afford could have sown the seeds for a murder most foul.																								Narendra Kumar Bagri, prime suspect in the murder of Rekha Chandok, could have been desperate for whatever money and valuables he could lay his hands on to foot the bill for life in the fast lane. On Monday evening, his sister-in-law may have come in the way of Narendra and some easy money.																								Rekha, 30, was strangled with the wire of an electric iron and her throat was slit with the broken end of a glass bottle on Monday evening in her ground-floor apartment on Haradhole Lane, in the Jorabagan area.																								The brutal attack took place when Narendras cousin Shibprasad Chandok was in his garment store. Rekha was home alone, with her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter when Narendra and some of his accomplices came calling.																								Sleuths investigating the case on Wednesday managed to piece together some of the suspects antecedents and how he had been keeping bad company of late.																								Initially, our hands were tied, as the only witness to the murder  the victims infant daughter  held the clue to the identity of the killers. But now, we have got some vital leads from friends and family members of Narendra, said deputy commissioner of police Peeyush Pandey.																								According to some local youths and traders of the Burrabazar area, who knew Narendra well, he first took to the path of crime by cheating a trader  handing over a false cheque for Rs 45,000 for some goods he had purchased.																								 He was always in need of money and had sold off many household goods... When we found out that he was doing the same while he was visiting relatives and friends and had fallen into such bad company, we drove him out of the house, a family member told police.																								An officer of the homicide wing of the detective department said Narendra was a frequent visitor to the citys red-light areas and some nightclubs.																								On Monday evening, he had come with some friends to pressure Rekha. But things must have gone wrong when he tried to leave with the jewellery and cash, worth about Rs 13,000, and she resisted. He must have murdered her in a fit of rage, the officer added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Post-fire, phones stay dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) officials are yet to fix the remaining 18,500 telephone lines that went dead after the fire at Chittaranjan Telephone Exchange, on CR Avenue, last Saturday. Of the 27,000 lines affected, 8,500 have been restored.																								They are working round-the-clock to set things right as possible, BSNL officials said. 																								We have restored 8,500 lines, including the connections of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, on an emergency basis. But as the underground cable lines were badly damaged, it will take some more time to restore the remaining connections. By the first week of September, we should set things right in phases, said S.K. Bhaduri, BSNL general manager (customer service).																								Officials said the damaged cables had been removed and a new set was being installed. The switch boxes of the telephone exchange, that control connections to the lines, would also have to be replaced.																								The telephone exchange was paralysed last Saturday when a fire broke out in the third-floor wiring of the four-storey building. The fire damaged the entire underground cable network of the exchange and the adjacent Burrabazar Telephone Exchange. Preliminary investigations revealed that all 35,000 lines were affected but officials said 27,000 lines went dead after the fire.

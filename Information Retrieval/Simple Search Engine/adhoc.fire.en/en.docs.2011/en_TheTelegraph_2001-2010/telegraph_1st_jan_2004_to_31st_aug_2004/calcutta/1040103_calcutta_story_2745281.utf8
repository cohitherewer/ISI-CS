The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Positive portrait of a maligned metro Faithful to ethos of dynamic Calcutta
 AMIT ROY IN LONDON				 	 Durga puja in Calcutta: A tradition traced																								The city of Calcutta  not Kolkata  is to get a huge PR plug when author Krishna Dutta delivers an important lecture on the much-maligned West Bengal capital to the prestigious Royal Geographical Society on January 12.																								Dutta, author of Calcutta: A cultural and literary history, published in Britain by Signal Books of Oxford in its series, Cities of the Imagination, told The Telegraph on Friday that she intended to paint a very positive portrait of her native city  without, of course, fibbing.																								Its very daunting, she admitted, in response to the sudden request from the Society, which normally gets its view of India from another author, William Dalrymple. The Royal Geographical Society asks William Dalrymple a lot, commented Dutta, who said she was heartened by several favourable reviews of her book. One by Mark Tully, in a Catholic weekly called The Tablet, had reflected her own view that Calcutta is not a dying city, its a living city.																								To be asked to deliver the lecture in the Societys large auditorium at 1, Kensington Gore, in Knightsbridge, is another indication that Duttas book has been well received. The invitation came from Dr Rita Gardener, director of the Society.																								The event is billed as Calcutta: City of the Imagination, with an explanatory note for old colonial types who associate the city more with the Black Hole of Calcutta: A city of paradoxes and extremes, where refinement and warmth rub shoulders with political violence and commercialism. Krishna gives a unique perspective into Calcuttas changing identity, as reflected in its architecture and arts.																								Dutta said she would illustrate her lecture with slides. I dont want to waffle. What I want to bring out is that Calcutta has a vibrant, inner life, which for an outsider is not always easy to detect. Its a vast subject but my talk will be based on my book, she explained.																								The Royal Geographical Society (with The Institute of British Geographers), was founded in 1830 for the advancement of geographical science. It is the largest geographical society in Europe, and one of the largest in the world. The Society has a membership of approximately 13,300 and an annual turnover of approximately  3.3 million .																								Dutta, who has co-authored a book on Tagore with Satyajit Rays biographer Andrew Robinson, was educated in Calcutta but has lived in London for many years. 																								The classic book on Calcutta, a sympathetic account, was written by a former Guardian journalist, Geoffrey Moorhouse, but much has changed since it came out in 1971.																								The problem with Calcutta is that compared with the number of actors, writers, journalists, tycoons, politicians and other A/B/C list people who come from Delhi and Bombay to London, now effectively the capital of Greater India, relatively few come from West Bengal. 																								And the Bengali scene in London is dominated by the Bangladeshis. This means that Calcutta has not really benefited from the growth of Indo-British trade.																								Duttas address to the Society does not need to be just an exercise in nostalgia but the start of a real effort to project a more dynamic Calcutta to an informed and influential British audience.																								Dutta intends to look her best. I shall wear a sari, a kanjeevaram sari, quot; she said firmly.

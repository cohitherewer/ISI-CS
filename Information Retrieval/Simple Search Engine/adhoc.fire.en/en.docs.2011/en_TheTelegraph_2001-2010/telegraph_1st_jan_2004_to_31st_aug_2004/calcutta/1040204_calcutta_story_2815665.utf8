Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Hotels, and even large housing complexes in the city, have the facility for their guests and residents. State associations and clubs across the country have laid more than 100 of them over the past five years to groom tennis players.																								But Calcutta South Club is yet to go synthetic, with the rubberised paint imported to lay the asphalt-base courts confined to the cans for nearly three years. And its just a matter of a few months before the material, idling in one corner of the club, is rendered no longer fit to use.																								Everyone seems to agree that the erstwhile nursery of the Indian game at 2/1, Woodburn Park would be much better off with synthetic courts. It would be a significant value-add, more so for the young players, says former Davis Cup captain Naresh Kumar.																								So, whats stopping South Club from becoming an all-surface venue? Internal differences, is the passing shot. We are the only club in the city with nine grass courts, whereas six are sufficient for use by members on playing days. With the conversion of two grass courts into synthetic, we will still have seven. The vested interests of a few individuals have held up work on the project, laments an official.																								In November 2000, Syncotts International, a Delhi-based consultant, was picked to lay two Sport Master Ultra Cushion courts at the club that has cradled tennis talents from Premjit Lal to Leander Paes.																								The All India Tennis Association bought the surface paint from Seal Master Industries, Ohio, and sent the cans to the club in June 2001. During the tenure of immediate past secretary I.N. Chaturvedi, work on the Rs 30-lakh project started in February 2002, targeting completion by end-May. But work was interrupted by the Davis Cup tie versus New Zealand in April 2002. Heightened activity after the tie saw completion of the guard wall, excavation and soiling, fixing of steel poles and underground cabling on the grass courts.																								Then, a meeting on August 29, 2003, stalled the project again, with dissenting members arguing against sacrificing two grass courts, the pride of South Club, and sinking so much money into the synthetic courts. But backers of the synthetic courts project are confident the two courts would generate a net yearly income of Rs 4 lakh from pay-and-play schemes.																								Almost three-fourths of the work is ready and only the bitumen and asphalting remain to be done before the rubberised paint is laid in layers, observes Chaturvedi. Failure to go synthetic would cost the club dear payment of compensation to contractors, a loss of Rs 14,59,401 for work completed and payments made, and the obvious loss of face.																								What happened to hockey 20 years ago, with a dearth of astroturfs, is now happening to tennis here, with youngsters denied valuable practice on the all-weather synthetic courts at the only dedicated tennis club in town, says Vikram Swarup, committee member in charge of projects. For South Club, it could be a matter of going synthetic now or not in the near future.

 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 University row over attendance
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta University refusing to allow students without the requisite attendance percentage to sit for its examinations has set off yet another campus turmoil.																								Students of the English department on Monday threatened to start a movement this week after 33 students were refused permission to write their MA Part II, due next month.																								Similar agitations have rocked the universitys campuses over the past six months, with students of other departments, like journalism, Hindi, commerce and applied physics, were disallowed by the authorities to sit for their MA and M.Sc examinations for not having the minimum 55 per cent attendance.																								Students of the English department have lodged a complaint with the university authorities, alleging that never in the past had so many students been refused permission in a single year for writing their tests for want of attendance percentage.																								Demanding an inquiry into the procedure in which their attendance was calculated, the students said: Usually, the first-year students are more inclined to drop classes and their attendance falls short in the Part I exams. Our attendance registers should be rechecked. We suspect that the calculations must have gone wrong at some point. 																								From the attendance records, it is evident that the 33 students refused permission had attended more than 65 per cent of their classes last year, when they appeared for their Part I exams. 																								However, Duryahoti De, arts faculty secretary, ruled out considering the students demand.

 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Blazing lie to shift tale
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A fire that broke out in a paint-manufacturing unit in congested Majumdarpara, at Kaikhali, in the airport police station area, on Monday, gave the lie to the administrations claim that it was trying to shift factories from residential areas. Local people said the factory had been operating for the past three years. 																								Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality, said he would look into the legal status of the unit. 																								I will check whether the proprietors had proper documents and licences to run such a unit here or not. I will also inquire whether they had taken the necessary clearances from the fire department and other authorities, he said.Local residents noticed flames leaping out of the premises of Jai Maa Kali Enterprise at about 1.30 pm, and tried to put out the fire. Their efforts, however, proved futile, as a series of blasts inside the unit turned it into an inferno, when the fire brigade was called in. Ten fire-tenders struggled for over four hours to douse the flames. 																								We suspect that the two tankers parked inside the factory contained highly inflammable chemicals used for manufacturing paints. These chemicals caused the fire to spread fast and also made it more difficult to put it out, said divisional fire engineer Bibhas Guha.																								Two people, who were inside the unit, were injured. Fortunately, most of the labourers were absent as it was a holiday. Otherwise there would have been many casualties, Guha added.																								Dense black smoke engulfed the area and we had to clear out all the houses in the neighbourhood, since people were suffocating, said Ashesh Das, a local resident. We were afraid that the fire would spread to other buildings and raze the entire locality if the fire brigade officials were delayed, he added.																								Local people complained that they faced many difficulties because of the factory, though no one had complained to the authorities. An unpleasant odour hangs in the air because of the unit. The administration should not allow such units to function in residential areas, said Nemai Roy, a local resident. 																								A few years ago, a similar fire had broken out in another factory in Kaikhali. That, too, was located in a residential area. Municipal officers said the unit was running without either proper infrastructure or fire-fighting devices.

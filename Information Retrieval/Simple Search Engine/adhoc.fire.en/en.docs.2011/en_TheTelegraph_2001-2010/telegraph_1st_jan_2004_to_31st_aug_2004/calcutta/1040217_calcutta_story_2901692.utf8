 															- CU English syllabus, modernised a year ago, back to square one SUNANDO SARKAR																								For a confused Calcutta University (CU), the more things change, the more they remain the same.																								A year after ringing in several changes in the English syllabus for its under-graduate students, the university has now given a notice to consider as withdrawn many of them.																								When the university signalled the first set of changes in end-2002, it explained that they were to modernise the syllabus, besides helping students slip out of the tuition trap and the note-book method of studying, in which they often memorised irrelevant topics without comprehending many.																								Most of the second set of changes will ultimately help students go back to square one, feel teachers. This set is likely to have another beneficial effect, they say. The establishment  the note-book lobby  will now be saved the trouble of updating their products.																								A case in point is a change in Paper II, meant for questions on poetry. The university introduced a new poem in the syllabus  Oliver Goldsmiths The Deserted Village  a year ago. Now, it has asked its under-graduate colleges to consider (it) as withdrawn from the syllabus. 																								We are completely in the dark about the reasons for the more recent change, said a teacher of an under-graduate college. Many of us have already spent a few periods teaching it, he added, wondering why it was found good a year ago and unfit now.																								Conversely, the section on scansion was withdrawn a year ago, but has now staged a comeback. Another change that has been reversed concerns two longish poems introduced a year ago. They have not been withdrawn, but students have been given the choice of answering questions on two other shorter pieces (by William Blake) and one that already existed (written by Alexander Pope). Which student will now risk learning two new longish poems? a teacher asked.																								This year, CU has also given students a list of 19 terms in the poetry section, again leading teachers to view this as an attempt to constrict learning.																								The recent round of revisions has its merits, argue CU officials. Earlier, students could get by with studying only three of the four texts in the drama paper. Now, they must study all four, said one.

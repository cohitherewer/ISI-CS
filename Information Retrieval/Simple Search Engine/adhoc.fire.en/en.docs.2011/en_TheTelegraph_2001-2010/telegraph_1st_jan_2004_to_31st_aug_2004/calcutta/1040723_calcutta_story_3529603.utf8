 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Sleuths round up pharmacy owner
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The arrest of one person from Serampore early on Thursday marked the first breakthrough in the mystery murder of Sushil Pal.																								The gynaecologist went missing after leaving his Bright Street residence, only for his body to surface in a canal at Sankrail on July 3.																								A special Criminal Investigation Department (CID) team picked up Santosh Agarwal, owner of a pharmacy in Serampore, on charges of conspiring in Pals disappearance and subsequent murder.																								All we can say now is that Agarwal was aware that Pal had gone missing and had kept quiet about it. We havent had time to interrogate him thoroughly, but its just a matter of time before we get more details, said a senior CID officer at Bhabani Bhavan on Thursday.																								The arrest comes two days after the slain doctors widow Kanika met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The chief ministers prod prompted Bhabani Bhavan to set up five high-profile CID teams, comprising 25 officers, who were assigned to get to the bottom of the case.																								One of the teams has been deployed in Bandel, where Pal was to allegedly carry out an unscheduled abortion.																								Dilip Agarwal, brother of the arrested businessman, said his brother had been framed by the sleuths because they were not getting any leads in the case.																								Investigations have so far revealed that Pal was to have spent a few hours seeing patients at a makeshift chamber in a pharmacy in a Serampore bazaar on July 2. Unlike other days, Pal did not turn up by 9.30 am, and Agarwal, who also owns the pharmacy, spoke to Pal on his mobile phone and asked him why he was late.																								Sorry, I cannot come, since I am tied up with something else. Please ask the patients to come back at a later date, Pal was quoted by Agarwal as having told him. Pal used to see patients from 9.30 am, four days a week, before proceeding to Serampores Walsh Hospital, where he had joined three months earlier.																								Investigations further revealed that Agarwal tried to make a second call to Pals cell phone, this time to urge him to turn up as a lot of patients had queued up. Agarwal, however, said he couldnt get through, as Pals mobile phone was switched off. This is one version that the sleuths refuse to believe, because the call statement says Pal had received several calls from Agarwals chamber on July 2.																								After Pals body was found at Sankrail on July 3, a post-mortem examination had clearly revealed that he had been murdered.																								According to the CID, Pals panic-stricken wife Kanika had also called up Agarwal on the evening of July 2, but the pharmacy-owner feigned ignorance. 																								Why is Agarwal denying that he made more than one call to Pal on the day the doctor was killed? asked an officer. It is obvious that he is not telling the truth.																								Agarwal was produced before sub-divisional judicial magistrate Raja Chatterjee, who remanded him in police custody for 10 days.

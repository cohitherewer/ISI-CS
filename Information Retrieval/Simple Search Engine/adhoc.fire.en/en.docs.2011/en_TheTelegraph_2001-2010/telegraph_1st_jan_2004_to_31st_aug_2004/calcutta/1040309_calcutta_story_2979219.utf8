 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Clinic casualty fallout stalls rush-hour cars
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Trouble broke out in the heart of Howrah town, on the southern stretch of GT Road, after the death of Jamila Khatun, 45, at a nursing home on Monday morning. 																								Neighbours and Jamilas family, alleging negligence as the cause of her death, ransacked the clinic, injuring two group-D staff members, and blocked GT Road for two hours, crippling rush-hour traffic.																								Later, senior officers of Shibpur police station talked them into lifting the roadblock. 																								Jamila, a resident of Belilious Lane, was admitted to the private nursing home on Sunday evening after she was advised 24-hour medical supervision by a local doctor. 																								They didnt even let us know what they were doing for our mother, alleged son Pervez. He said nobody even informed him about his mothers death. It was only after he went into her cabin early on Monday that he was handed over a death certificate and that, too, by a nurse. 																								Pervez said that all of Sunday night, when he kept asking the nurse on duty about his mothers condition, he was told she was doing fine, though she was not treated at all, which I came to know from a ward boy.																								Claiming that the doctors never attended to Jamila, Pervez alleged that when she was escorted into the nursing home, the doctors and the nurse misbehaved with the family and refused to admit her. We had to plead with them to get my mother admitted, he cried.																								Jamila was admitted under the supervision of a senior doctor, but whatever medical attention she got was from a junior doctor. That angered her relatives even more. They believe the senior doctor could have helped save Jamila.																								When the southern stretch of GT Road, where the nursing home is situated, was crippled by the mob, the authorities and doctors on duty of the nursing home managed to flee from the back door. 																								Police locked the nurses in the nursing home to protect them from the mob. That saved us, exclaimed one of them. Otherwise, the mob would have lynched us. The entire area observed an undeclared bandh for two hours. 																								According to police, bruises were seen on Jamilas hands, which might turn the course of the case. We have received a complaint against the nursing home from the victims kin and are trying to find out what actually had happened. Until the inquiry report on Jamilas death arrives, we cannot be sure of the cause, said Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police (Howrah). 																								A spokesperson for the nursing home said that the death and its fallout would be inquired into.

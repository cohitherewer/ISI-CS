 																											- Teenager returns from Mumbai to bust racket, get recruiter arrested A STAFF REPORTER																								Two years ago, she left Calcutta with a typical teenage dream  making it big in Bollywood.																								Today, she is helping Calcutta Police bust the flesh-trade racket that turned her dream into a nightmare.																								Sixteen-year-old Reshma (name changed on request) helped police on Wednesday round up a key scout of the powerful gang that preys on young girls by selling them celluloid dreams. Lured by a supposed passport to stardom, these girls end up in the sprawling sex bazaar of Mumbai, not in the studios of filmistan.																								Officers from Entally made the move a week after Reshma  visiting her family on special leave granted by the gang that she is currently linked to  walked into the police station with her parents and a sordid tale of exploitation.																								The attractive female scout, identified as Baby, was arrested early on Wednesday from the Motijheel area of north Calcutta and lodged in the central lock-up of Lalbazar police headquarters, after being produced in court.																								According to sleuths, Baby is a former insurance saleswoman who was earlier employed with a private finance company.																								We believe the woman, in her mid-thirties, is involved in trafficking of minor girls. She may hold the key to the recent disappearances of a number of minor girls from the city and its neighbourhood, said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division.																								Reshma told police that Baby had befriended her two years ago near Sealdah station and offered her a role in a Bollywood film and a life of luxury.																								I was only 14 and I and did not realise that she was laying a trap for me. She insisted on my leaving Calcutta without telling my parents. I left the day after she made me those promises, Reshma recounted.																								After reaching Mumbai, Reshma was taken to a highrise apartment. I was kept confined to a small room for the first few days. Soon, I realised that I had been sold, Reshma told Entally police, describing how she was beaten up brutally for refusing to service clients. Till the day when she couldnt fight any more.																								Once Reshma fell in line, her minders dropped their guard. They recently granted her a few days leave to visit Calcutta and even handed over Rs 9,000 from her earnings. They were convinced that I would return to Mumbai, said Reshmi, who had other plans.																								Having led police to Baby, Reshma decided to hand over the Rs 9,000 she was carrying from Mumbai to police to give to some charitable organisation.

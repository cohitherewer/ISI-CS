The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Laundry service
																								It could well be the beginning of the end for your local dhobi and also your days of wasting half of the precious Sunday operating the washing machine. The IFB Launderette is here and for good. 																								The second launderette in the country (another one in Bangalore), this service, a take-off from the west, not just cleans your dirty linen by the kilo in 24 hours flat, but also picks up and drops the clothes back at your doorstep. We are getting clients from Salt Lake in the east and Bansdroni in the extreme south, says Pulak Chokroborty, franchisee IFB Launderette, located opposite the science college on Ballygunge Circular Road. 																								It began as an exercise to cover residential complexes within one kilometre radius, but word of mouth has now ensured that working couples from across the city drop their laundry at IFB before heading for work in the morning and pick it up the next day. 																								I have a client who is a doctor living in Salt Lake. He comes all the way to get his white shirts washed here, points out Pulak explaining that the residents of Salt Lake are flocking to the launderette especially because of the high iron content in the water that makes cleaning difficult. 																								The prices have been kept at a moderate Rs 35 per kg for up to two kgs of clothes given at a time. The prices go down to Rs 27 a kg for three kgs or above. On an average, one kg means up to five garments an adult would wear, explains Pulak. The USP of this place is convenience, but we also guarantee total hygiene, claims Sanjeev Mehra, business head, IFB Launderette. 																								A pre-cleaning session ensures that the clothes are free from all kinds of bacteria. The second step is to check the type of fabric and colour fastness. We also make a note of stains on the clothing and decide on the kind of stain removal treatments we ought to give, adds Pulak. The pre-cleaning also includes treating heavier grease in the collar and handcuff area. 																								Both the cleaning and the drying is done automatically in the IFB machines and is followed by steam ironing. 																								While the convenience provided to the customer remains the main concern, the added advantage of having a launderette in a locality is that it saves a large amount of water too. On an average, any other washing machine uses an excess of eight buckets of water to clean the same number of clothes as compared to an IFB washing machine, says Sanjeev. 																								With the success of the first outlet, the company is planning to open 10 more launderettes within the next six months. We have tied up with builders across the city who will be letting out space to us to start launderettes in large housing complexes, adds Sanjeev. Looks like its not just the dhobis but also the washing machine companies that are headed for a tough time. 						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

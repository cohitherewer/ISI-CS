 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 College fobs off sleuths in death probe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has failed to make much headway in its probe into the mysterious death in 2001 of Soumitra Biswas, a fourth-year student at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The agency on Wednesday accused the authorities of a lack of cooperation.																								CID officials are now on a hunt for clues from students belonging to unions other than the SFI. The officials had earlier interrogated members of the SFI, the CPMs students wing.																								Last week, a CID team visited the hostel next to the medical college and questioned some students in a bid to reconstruct Soumitras death in 2001.																								Soumitra was found hanging from the ceiling in his hostel room at Lalit Memorial Hostel, next to the medical college, two years ago. Though the city police, after a round of preliminary investigation, had said it was a case of suicide, Soumitras parents claimed it was murder and moved the high court. The court had asked the CID to investigate.																								We now feel we should talk to other students bodies as well. We are not getting much help from the college authorities. But, we need to reconstruct what actually happened on the night of August 25, 2001. In order to make any progress in the case, we need some vital clues, said a CID official. 																								Deputy inspector-general (CID) C.V. Murlidhar said an all-out attempt was being made to crack the case. At this stage, it is very important for us to get to the bottom of it all, he added.																								Soumitras mother, Sabita, said she has asked the high court for a CBI inquiry.

 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Crack career tests with online classes
 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 Students across the country will be able to discuss questions with teachers at the click of a mouse																								Its a virtual classroom, with the teacher far away and the students spanning thousands of kilometres in several places, all at the same time, interacting with one another and learning. Not science fiction or a glimpse into the future, but a concept set to hit schools from next month.																								While the reason remains age-old  cracking the toughest of competitive exams  the methods are modern. And bringing in the technology is Hughes Escorts Communications Ltd (HECL), a satellite service provider. The Delhi-based company has been in the education sector for a while, but is now ready to enter schools with its IIT-JEE tutorials, through the DIRECWAY programme.																								About 30 to 35 schools in India have tied up with HECL to provide the service. The classes, which will kick off from mid-April, will be held in the schools themselves. The teachers will broadcast the lectures from one of the studios in Jamshedpur, Delhi, Mumbai, Calicut and Bangalore.																								The software is in the process of being installed in the schools, which, in Calcutta, are Don Bosco Park Circus and Liluah.																								We did a pilot project last year in 10 schools across the country. Because it was successful, we are now launching the course nationwide. And we have had a very good response from schools, says Nagesh P. Singh, director, marketing and sales, HECL. In the near future, we will also start tutorials for the pre-medical tests, AIEEE, GMAT, GRE and SAT, for those who want to enrol. From what we have learnt, the eastern region will be most receptive to this course.																								There are two programmes  300 hours over a period of a year for Class XII students, and 500 hours beginning from Class XI. The cost is about Rs 50 to Rs 60 per hour per student, and the sessions will be held in two batches daily, from 4 pm to 6 pm and 6 pm to 8 pm.																								After every class is a test, with online performance predictors available for the students, parents and teachers to view. Those weak in particular areas will be given added attention, individually or in groups, depending on the requirements.																								The study material will include books, lecture notes and question papers. During a class, apart from the lecturer  the faculty includes IIT professors of mathematics, physics and chemistry  there will be a moderator per 40 students, for one-to-one interaction. Queries can be passed through e-mail or a scribbled note, which will be scanned by the camera at the students end and transmitted to the moderator. Help is also extended 24x7, through e-mail or telephone.																								A number of students and parents have been asking us to start something like this for a while, explains Father T.V. Jacob, rector and principal, Don Bosco School, Park Circus.																								Most of them go for coaching classes for the entrance exams after school, and they even have to take leave to attend them sometimes. So, I think there will be a very good response for this programme. We will begin the registration once the school exams are over, he says.

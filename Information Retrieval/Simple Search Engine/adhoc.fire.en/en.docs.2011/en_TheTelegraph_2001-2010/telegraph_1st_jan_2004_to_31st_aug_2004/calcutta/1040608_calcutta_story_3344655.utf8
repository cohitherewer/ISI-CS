The killer or killers slit his throatA week after the mystery Maidan murder, police on Monday were left to deal with another brutalised body of a woman, this time in north Calcutta.																								The two  the murder of the woman in her mid-20s on the Maidan and the killing of the 30-year-old woman in her Jorabagan flat  were linked by the brutality of the assault.																								The assassins first strangled Rekha Chandok, wife of a Burrabazar-based trader, with the wire of an electric iron and then slit her throat with the sharp edge of a broken bottle.																								Rekhas body, bathed in blood, was found in her bedroom with the wire round her neck. Police said she was pregnant.																								Following spot investigation and interrogation of the victims husband, Shibprasad Chandok, the sleuths were convinced that the murder had been committed by more than one person. Also, the assailants must have been known to the victim.																								According to police, the murder took place between 3 pm and 4.30 pm. Shibprasad left home around 9 am, as usual. Around noon, a middle-aged man came to the house. Both Rekha and her husband knew him. For the sake of investigation, we are not disclosing his identity, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.																								The man asked Rekha for a glass of water before leaving the flat. But he was back around 3 pm. This time, he came with two unidentified youths, said an official of the detective departments homicide wing.																								The person known to the couple, along with his two accomplices, asked for a blank paper and pen to write something important, added the official. Smelling a rat, Rekha asked the trio to wait while she slipped out to make a call to her husband from a telephone booth.																								She told me that there was something wrong with the way the three were behaving. She asked me to rush back home, but I was in no position to leave my garment shop. I advised her to tell them to contact me or my brother, who lives close to our place, Shibprasad told police during interrogation.																								Neighbours recalled seeing Rekha returning to her flat. They next noticed Rekhas two-and-half-year-old daughter coming out from the flat. She was crying, said a sleuth on the case. The neighbours, initially, called out to Rekha from outside. When there was no response, they entered the flat, to find the woman lying murdered on the floor.																								On examining the bedroom, police were convinced that the murder was not for gain. The killers did not touch the almirah and other places where the valuables were kept, said an officer of Jorabagan police station.

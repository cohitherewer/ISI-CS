																								An age-old adage about greatness says that it may be an inherent accessory or that it may be acquired in the journey called life. A classic example of the latter finds its finest expression in Calcuttas very own saint, Mother Teresa. She lived a life dictated by those who sought her undying help. In her was an insurmountable faith in the goodness of being and the urgency to keep the candle of hope and dignity burning. From Saint to Sainthood is a documentary film by Payal Mohanka which pays tribute to Mother Teresas journey towards sainthood. The film chronicles a journey through Mothers homes for orphans, destitutes and lepers. It is a medium through which those associated with Mother share their memories of her resolve to dedicate her life to the service of humanity. The documentary is a fitting tribute to a saint who is a step away from attaining sainthood. 																								Event: Screening of From Saint to Sainthood, a documentary film by Payal Mohanka																								When: Today; 3.30 pm																								Where: Rotary Sadan

 Prateeti MandalPrateeti Mandal																									Are what make this budding astronomer most happy. She might be just 14, but shes already on her way to cracking the astronomy-related numericals in the Higher Secondary syllabus  as a hobby. Although her school has been helping Prateeti, as part of the Indian Astronomy Olympiad Camp, its all just a piece of cake for her.																									Or rather girl, is what the Class IX student of Vivekananda Mission hopes to become, piloting things from NASA ground control. And NASA is where shes soon headed for, if everything goes as planned. After winning the regional contests of the camp, Prateeti is one of the 44 students selected nationwide from 15,000 entries. The Behala girl will be off to Mumbai for the nationals in May. The winners will then travel to NASA.																									On physics comes naturally to Prateeti who spends free time reading up books on her favourite subject. And studying eight hours a day is not a drudgery for the teachers pet, whos preparing for the astronomy Olympiad, now that her school exams are over.																									Is her motto, particularly with astronomer Kalpana Chawla as role model, whose famous footsteps Prateeti would like to track some day. Though time is rare, the youngster finds enough to take part in, and win, competitions on drawing, a hobby she has pursued through inter and intra-school contests.																									Might well be her name, as she gives the entire credit for her achievements to her teachers. But she does admit that working hard has its just rewards. Winning an open essay-writing competition on conservation of energy on her own was the fruit of hard labour. Not to mention the science quiz she enjoyed participating in at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum.																									Is what she doesnt want to be, nor another Dr No. But pioneering space technology and exploring the unknown is her dream, something Prateeti is determined to accomplish through sheer hard work and determination.

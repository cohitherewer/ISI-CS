The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Court rap for snail mail
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Danesh Sheikh Lane, in Howrah, is barely 10 km away from Lansdowne Road, in south Calcutta. It took the postal department all of four months to cover the distance. 																								Shocked at the pace, the state consumer disputes redressal commission has ticked off the department for taking so long to transfer nine postal accounts of a schoolteacher from Danesh Sheikh Lane to Lansdowne Road.																								Unless there is some amount of negligence and indolence on the part of the employees, such delay cannot take place, the three-member-commission observed last week. 																								The commission also upheld its Howrah forums earlier directive, asking the postal department to pay a compensation of Rs 5,500 for harassing the consumer.																								Schoolteacher Alok Bandhu Trivedi had shifted from Andul, in Howrah, to Salt Lake in March 2002. Trivedi had six monthly income savings accounts, two recurring deposits and one savings account at the Danesh Sheikh Lane post office, which he wanted to shift at Lansdowne Road post office, near his school. 																								He deposited the passbooks on April 2, 2002, at the Howrah post office. However, when the passbooks did not reach their destination till July 2002 and his complaints yielded no result, he filed a case with the Howrah consumer forum. 																								On October 22, 2002, the Howrah forum directed the Howrah chief postmaster-general to hold an inquiry and take action against the errant employees. The postmaster moved the state panel in December 2002 against the verdict. However, the state commission, in a recent order, dismissed the appeal. 																								The postal department told the court that a shortage of staff led to the delay in transferring the accounts, as also the procedure that was to be followed as per the post office rules.

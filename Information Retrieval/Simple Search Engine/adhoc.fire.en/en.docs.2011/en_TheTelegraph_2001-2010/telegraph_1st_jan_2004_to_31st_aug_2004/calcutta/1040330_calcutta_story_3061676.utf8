The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 CalTel dials rings of change
 																											- Image makeover with uniform for staff, six-day work schedule SUNANDO SARKAR																								The next time you step into a Calcutta Telephones office, dont be surprised to find every member of the workforce dressed identically. Also, at the neighbourhood telecom office, youll find a full force at work even on a Saturday.																								Calcutta Telephones, a wing of government-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), is taking a leaf out of the book of its private-sector competitors. In an attempt to build for itself an image of no-nonsense efficiency, some major intra-office changes are being considered.																								A meeting to decide on a dress code for employees is to be held on Tuesday. The first target: employees in direct interaction with customers. The idea is to reflect an impression of homogeneity and continuity, an official explained to Metro. 																								The customer must be made to feel that he is interacting with a single corporate entity, even if he/she speaks to one official on Monday and another on Tuesday, he added.																								For the employees, too, the dress code will have a beneficial impact, the BSNL brass hopes. We have come to realise that a uniform instils a sense of unity, a senior official said. There is no scope for anyone to feel superior or inferior, he added. 																								Not everyone, however, is sold on the idea. The proposed changes are more cosmetic in nature and very little will be achieved by forcing a uniform on the employees, feel the dissenters.																								This is why we are going for a brain-storming session, an official said. A few general managers, deputy general managers and some divisional engineers have been invited to Tuesdays meet. After we discuss the issue, the proposal will be tabled at the chief general managers office, the official added, explaining that the exercise was part of an overall image-building plan.																								Another major change is likely at the telephone offices, this one probably sooner. The BSNL headquarters in Delhi has sent instructions to every telecom circle to keep the office open six days a week.																								The move follows the upward revision in employee pay-scales, said BSNL officials. Only a section of the employees now work on Saturdays, they added.																								The sixth day in office (Saturday) will not be scaled-down affairs, like those followed in some government offices, a senior official said. They will, instead, be normal working days, when all employees will clock in eight full hours, he added.

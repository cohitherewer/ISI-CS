Model Nicolette Bird shares her formula for being a successful face in ad campaigns on print The primary requirement for a print model is an expressive and photogenic face. Unlike ramp models, height doesnt matter at all. On the ramp, one should ideally be a minimum of 58, but for media modelling, there is no such limit. I myself am only 56 and I get lots of print offers. Also, you dont need to have a great figure. Of course you need to be fit, but an hourglass figure is hardly necessary. For a print model, the most winning factor is body language. You must be absolutely comfortable with your body and know how to project it. Thorough research and flipping through lots of magazines to study pictures of other models to get a grasp of body language is essential. 																								Check out various poses and always try to experiment with new stances. This will also make you more comfortable and confident in front of the camera. Facial expressions are also crucial. What all successful print models do  while most may not admit it  is mirror therapy. You should look at yourself in the mirror for at least 15 minutes everyday and practice various kinds of expressions. It might sound very funny, but it really works. 																								Make a face or smile in different ways to see how your face looks at various angles and which suits you the best. The two sides of the face may basically be symmetrical, but everyone has a better and worse side. 																								My face, for example, always looks better when photographed from the right. My smile also looks much better when seen from the right side. I only figured this out after watching myself in the mirror very minutely. 																								Once you know your own strengths and weaknesses, it makes the photographers work much easier as well. If you know the pros and cons of your body and face even before you start, you can work with your cameraman to build a good portfolio. You can project your best image through the pictures and this will certainly help further your career. Three essential tips for anyone in this profession, but more so for print models, is to always get the right doses of good food, water and sleep. 																								While you should always maintain a regular, balanced diet, a day before a shoot you should make it a point to have all meals at the right time. Usually, during a shoot one doesnt get to eat properly, and you may have to grab a sandwich for lunch. This always shows on the face, and you dont look fresh. 																								Also, it is necessary to have lots of water a couple of days before the shoot and even while it is on, as this brings a glow to the face and skin. The same goes for sleep. If you havent slept very well the night before, you will end up looking tired and this will spoil everything. 																								But if you make sure you stick to these practices, the photographer will never complain about the way you look.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Hope and hype in portrait of city as gateway to the country
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Campaign for a better Calcutta has always inspired people with ideas. The usual areas of concern of most people have been roads, traffic, work culture and safety at night. But a few off-beat ideas are also worth pondering by those who are planning the citys future for the next hundred years.																								A poet, for example, would like to have an international poetry centre in the city, like the ones he has attended in New York, London and Cape Town. The city, he points out, has the highest density of poets per kilometre. There are also more people here who claim to understand poetry than anywhere else. Why then shouldnt the city have a poetry centre for poets to meet, chat and exchange ideas, to host poets from abroad and conduct seminars and workshops?																								He is not the only one. Talk to a theatre personality and he would happily dwell for hours on why the city needs more theatres and better theatres. The filmwallah is, of course, happy that the first multiplex is here, with more to come. More theatres with Dolby sound is what the city needs, he would convince you. Retired bureaucrats want something on the lines of India International Centre or the Habitat Centre in Delhi, where the glitteratti and the chatteratti could meet and decide the destiny of the nation.																								Two opinions stand out, though. Calcutta, holds one, is the only city in the world which has developed on one side of the river. All other cities situated on riverbanks have occupied both and developed. The suggested lesson is that without developing Howrah, development of Calcutta cannot make much headway. If the city can grow beyond Howrah, the virtually one-way traffic to Calcutta can be reduced, if not reversed. The observation is borne out by the experience of builders and promoters who find that even cheaper apartments in Howrah find few takers.																								Although just a few kilometres separate the two, the gulf is enormous. Much more than the bridge over the Hooghly is required to bring them closer and to ensure better management of the river and its banks.																								The other opinion, aired by the first woman in the country to drive a cab, is also worth noting. The lady, a Sikh, is happy, she says, to find the city improving. But nevertheless, precious little was being done for the poor and the pedestrian, she complains. The poor in the city of joy, she says, is getting poorer and finds the going more tough than ever. But the government, she laments, appears busy making the lives of the rich more comfortable.																								It is an important observation that city planners need to keep in mind, lest they get carried away by hope and hype. The number of millionaires in the city may well be in lakhs, but the number of the citys poor is in millions. Improvements in the city will work only if they also generate employment opportunities for the poor.																								Calcutta has an advantage it had frittered away in the past. Being the only metropolis in eastern India, the city has traditionally been a gateway to the East. On the other hand, by virtue of being closer to far-eastern countries, it is also a gateway to India for much of the Orient. Geography clearly has been more kind to the city than history. The city will have to take the initiative to take advantage of its blessings. It must do so by becoming less parochial and by embracing different cultural and linguistic traditions.																								A performing -cum-training centre for Manipuri martial arts, for example, will almost certainly be more successful in Calcutta than at Imphal. Similarly, a centre for eastern Indian dance forms, starting from Odissi or Manipuri, will attract many more people if it were to come up here, rather than at Bhubaneswar or Guwahati.																								The logic can be extended to include a museum on the tribes of eastern India, centres for Buddhist studies or studies on Bangladesh, an international centre on Rabindranath and so on. They will give the city more character and help firm up its claim to be a city of academic excellence, cultural diversity and a gateway to not just the East but also to India.

 Get children vaccinated against hepatitis AIts that time of the year when the mercury goes ballistic and the humidity saps the body of vital juices. Its also that time of the year when irritating man-days are lost due to diseases of the stomach and liver.																								With the unrelenting weather taking its toll, neighbourhood clinics and hospital OPDs in the city are flooded with patients suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders or the A and E types of hepatitis. Nearly 70 per cent of my patients over the past couple of months have presented with classic symptoms of GI tract ailments like diarrhoea, giardiasis and amoebiasis or common jaundice, says Abhijit Dasgupta, a general physician.																								Cases of infective gastro-enteritis and hepatitis are being reported from all corners and doctors blame the outbreak on drinking water contamination, bad hygiene and roadside food. 																								Conditions now are conducive to the breeding and growth of viruses, bacteria and protozoa that trigger the trouble. Transmission of the microbes is mostly through the faeco-oral route and hence, good basic hygiene is essential to combat the menace, observes Mahesh K. Goenka, chief gastroenterologist, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.																								While severe GI diseases usually manifest with uncontrolled loose motion, vomiting and a resultant dehydration, there are often no early warnings for hepatitis A (common in children) and E, since the incubation period for the virus is two to four weeks. Doctors warn to watch out for tell-tale signs like anorexia (loss of appetite), nausea, upper abdominal discomfort, yellow discoloration of urine and eyes, and mild body ache with fever.																								In most cases of hepatitis A and E, the patient needs to take little medication, but plenty of fluids and normal diet, just eschewing the deep-fried stuff, reassures Sarika Kedia, consultant hepatologist and gastroenterologist. Kedia, who anchors a dedicated liver clinic at AMRI Hospitals, advises her patients to drink a zero-bacteria tender coconut instead of roadside sugarcane juice extracted in contaminated iron grinds.

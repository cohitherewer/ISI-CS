 Feng Shui / Pinky Kapoor Q: I have just  got married and the master bedroom in my new house is in  the south-west sector. Please suggest some Feng Shui remedies  to bring harmony and stability so that we remain happily  married. 																								Name and address withheld																								A: I am glad to know that you will be occupying the bedroom in the south-west sector as the energy here is extremely conducive to successful marriages. To further enhance marital bliss, I suggest you keep two similar bedside lamps on your side tables. The lamps should have a single switch to simultaneously switch both of them on and off and the shades should be red in colour. This helps to encourage passion and harmony and even stabilises relationships.  Q: For the past few  years, we are facing a financial crisis. Someone suggested  that we could overcome this problem by placing some Chinese  coins in our cupboard. Please explain the significance of  these coins and suggest where and how they should be placed.  Do they really work?																								Grusha Kapoor, Calcutta																								A: We all go through certain favourable and unfavourable phases in our lives. To overcome and reduce the impact of the bad times, we can take the help of Feng Shui. It would be a myth to say that such good luck charms as Chinese coins would alone be sufficient to solve your financial problems. For this we have to look into a number of other factors as well. The Chinese coins are believed  to be very auspicious because a square hole in the centre  represents earth, while the round shape suggests heaven.  A red ribbon running through it symbolises blood, which  gives life energy to the coins. Hence trinity luck is created  with these and is believed to bring in immense wealth luck.  For good luck, you can keep a set of three coins in your  purse or wallet in the safe or a money bowl. You can also  place them on a round mirror or hidden under a flower vase  in the south-east of your worktable. They can also be kept  in the south-east of the cash drawer. Pasting three Chinese  coins that are tied together with a red ribbon in a triangular  shape or nine coins that are vertically tied can also energise  your assets. When hung on the inside of the main door opening  inwards, they are believed to bring in a lot of prosperity  and happiness.		 For people whose profession is connected  with construction work, directly related to the earth  element, fire energy will give a boost to business.  The best way to introduce this element is by painting  the extreme southern wall of the house or office in  red. Red is also associated with name, fame and recognition  and will help in realising goalsQ: I am a regular reader  of your column and have made changes according to Feng Shui  principles. Of late, I feel that there has been a shift  in energy after my mother-in-law was critically ill. She  is in the recovery stage now and I would like you to suggest  something that I can do which will help in bringing back  the positive vibrations that prevailed in my house earlier.  Presently the house smells of medicines and injections.																								Akshay Kajaria, Ranchi																								A: Feng Shui homes always have positive vibrations and to maintain such good vibes, one has to constantly undertake space-clearing at regular intervals. This becomes more important during or after an illness. You can also use this technique to clear the negativity left by an unpleasant visitor or after heated arguments have taken place in the house. On a full moon day, like February 6, 2004, place some flowers, incense sticks, candles or diyas in a plate along with some water in a small pot. Go around the house in a clockwise manner and sprinkle water all around. Then place the above arrangement in the centre of the house. After this, keep a candle with incense sticks along with some flowers in the centre of each room. Go around these and pray for health, harmony and peace. Incense sticks and candles when left to burn off completely, move and purify negative and stagnant energies. Placing flowers beside them help absorb the negative vibrations. For this reason, after cleansing is over, they should be thrown away and not used to cleanse the harmful energy of other rooms.  Q: I am an upcoming  architect with high ambitions and would like to reach great  heights in life. Please suggest what I can do in my house  and office that will help me achieve my goal.																								Navin Dhanuka, Jharkand																								A: As your profession is connected with construction work, it is directly related to the earth element. To give maximum power to this element, your requirement is fire energy, which in return will give a boost to your business. The best way to introduce this element is by painting the extreme southern wall of the house or office in red. Red is also associated with name, fame and recognition and thus will help you realise your goals.

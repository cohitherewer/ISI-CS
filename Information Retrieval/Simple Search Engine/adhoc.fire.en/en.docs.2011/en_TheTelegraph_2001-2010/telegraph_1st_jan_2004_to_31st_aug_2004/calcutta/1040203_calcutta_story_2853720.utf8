 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Injured constable dies 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 33-year-old traffic constable, Dhananjay Garai, succumbed to his injuries at Calcutta Medicare Research Institute (CMRI) on Monday. 																								Garai, of the Jorabagan Traffic Guard, was knocked down by a speeding taxi on January 31 at the MG Road-Rabindra Sarani crossing, in the Burrabazar police station area, while he was regulating traffic. 																								Immediately after the accident, the driver of the taxi fled the spot. Police, however, impounded the vehicle later, though the driver is still absconding. Initially, bystanders and residents of the area gathered to rush Garai to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was taken in. 																								However, as his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to CMRI, where Garai underwent surgery. But all efforts to revive him failed. Garai died at 3 pm on Monday.																								nFoundrymen on strike: Members of the Howrah Foundry Association launched an indefinite strike on Monday to protest the hike in pig iron prices. The strike will affect 500,000 employees in about 1,000 foundries. Association member Asit Chatterjee blamed pressure created by the pollution control board and poor supply by the state electricity board for the foundries woes. On Saturday, the association submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate, but no action was taken, he alleged.

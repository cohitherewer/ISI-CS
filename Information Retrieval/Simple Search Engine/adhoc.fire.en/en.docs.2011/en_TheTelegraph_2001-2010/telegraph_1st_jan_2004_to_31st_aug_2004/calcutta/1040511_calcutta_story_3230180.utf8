The mood in the citys smallest  but maybe the hottest  constituency swung dramatically on Monday with the holiday mood, the waves and the smiles giving way to snarls and sneers before the day was done.																								The Monday morning rush hour found more people than vehicles on the wide streets of Calcutta North West. Shops were shut and cricket ruled Lindsay Street, CR Avenue and even Rabindra Sarani, while residents sauntered to the nearest booth.																								It was the narrow, winding roads branching out of the thoroughfares  where most polling centres were located  that bustled with voters and poll workers.																								Most voters opted to wait in serpentine queues for hours in the blazing sun, and the mood was upbeat in all three camps.																								Red was the dominant colour at the roadside kiosks, where polling agents and party workers huddled with sheaves of voters lists. The Trinamul presence on the ground was less striking  though giant cut-outs of the mayor towered above pockets of supposed influence  while just a handful of the twin-candle support staff could be spotted.																								Of the three heavyweight contenders, Congress-backed-Independent candidate Sudip Bandopadhyay was the most visible, roaming the streets with actor-wife Nayana in a black Tata Sumo.																								Though Sudip loyalists were few and far between, those keeping an eye on the proceedings did not lack enthusiasm. We cant say for sure, but we wont fare too badly, surmised Sudip, even as Nayana railed on against the peaceful rigging by both the CPM and Trinamul.																								In front of the booth at Daulatram Nopany Vidyalaya, in Nanda Mullick Lane, his team settled down for a quick lunch of fried rice, paneer butter masala and gulab jamun.																								Not far away, packed lunches of roti, sabzi and sweets reached the mayors men near Mahajati Sadan. Polling has been positive everywhere, said a Trinamul party worker who, like most other partymen camping in the constituency, was waiting in vain for a glimpse of the candidate.																								CPM cadres were on the poll prowl  punctuated by cups of tea  from early morning. 																								But unlike the other two camps, talk of a win was more restrained here.																								It was all quiet on the North West front till afternoon. But the veneer of calm was ripped off in Taltala and on Zakaria Street in the late afternoon. With the poll process drawing to a close, explosions and expletives rent the summer air, as charges of foul play flew fast and furious.																								A white kurta-pyjama-clad Sudhangshu Sil was surrounded and heckled near a Taltala booth, while just a few yards away, Bowbazar MLA Nayana Bandopadhyay fumed and fretted on four wheels.																								A large crowd had, meanwhile, gathered around Sudip, in an alley off Zakaria Street. A police officer was in the booth brandishing his revolver and preventing people from casting their vote, alleged the third dimension in a three-cornered fight.

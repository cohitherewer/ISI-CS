The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Apollo union ends, AMRI moves on
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Calcuttas Advanced Medicare Research Institute (AMRI) and one of the countrys leading hospital chains, the Apollo group from Chennai, have divorced.																								On Monday, health officials said the AMRI, which runs a 400-plus-bed, multi-speciality hospital at Dhakuria, in south Calcutta, will begin a hunt for a new collaborator  preferably foreign  for its planned Rs 60-crore expansion project. The government holds a 24 per cent stake in AMRIs Dhakuria hospital.																								The relationship with Apollo is over. But life moves on. Let us hope there will be a new partner and a more vigorous and fruitful alliance in the near future, said health secretary Asim Barman. Though he would not look at the latest development in any other way, the end of the alliance was seen by many as a jolt to the governments attempts to showcase AMRI Apollo Hospital and the clinics as an example of a successful private-public initiative in healthcare in Bengal.																								Barman said the governments current participation in AMRI and its affiliates would not be diluted , even though the end of the alliance would take some shine off the institution. Three years ago, the AMRI board handed over the reins of management to the Apollo group, against an undisclosed annual fee.																								 The decision to induct the Apollo group was taken on the basis of its credibility and ability to raise healthcare standards, with its huge expertise in this sector. The group did initiate a lot of positive changes, but few months ago, labour and union problems in the hospital hogged the limelight, which Apollo officials believe could have been avoided.																								At present, the key stakeholders in the company are the Emami and Shrachi groups. Aditya Agarwal, a director representing the Emami group on the board, insisted that it was the AMRI management that had insisted on a parting of ways with Apollo. We decided to cancel the arrangement since the healthcare giant from Chennai was not contributing enough, as promised. We would, however, like to work with it if ever we get a suitable opportunity in future, Agarwal told Metro on Monday.																								V. Satyanarayana Reddy, chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Calcutta, pointed out that the healthcare group from Chennai took a collective decision to pull out from AMRI since it had established a full-fledged hospital in the city by itself. When we first started work here, we did not have a presence. For now, we will concentrate on delivering quality healthcare in our own hospital, was all Reddy would say.																								So, the AMRI group is now on its own. We were alone even before the Apollo association. For them, it was purely business. Unfortunately, they could not match our expectations and we decided to part ways, said AMRI vice-president S. Upadhyay. Ravi Todi of the Shrachi group said AMRI had drawn up sizeable expansion projects and the split would not affect the hospitals functioning.

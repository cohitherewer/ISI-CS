Husain  the imagination of young designers at Bhawanipore Education Society undergoing the one-year fashion technology course, went on an overdrive. The ongoing exhibition of the works of students at the college campus is also in keeping with the season, with a lot of vibrant hues on display.ed Fashion Visual Display, the exhibition featuring the creations of fashion students in the past six months was inaugurated by designer Sharbari Dutta. Each student takes an artist or a monument for inspiration and creates a story board from which they bring out the final product, explained Heena Gorsia, general secretary of the college. Based on their inspiration, the students have created wide-ranging motifs in a variety of textiles embellished with paints, dyes and embroidery. Thereafter, the students took to their sewing machines to come up with skirts, blouses, cholis, scarves and sarongs in interesting shapes and patterns. The exhibition also throws up a lot of stuff in crepe and bandhni to go with the mood of the season. The exhibition will be on till today.Terracotta artefacts on display at a festival at Bharatiyam Cultural Centre and (above) a dance performance at the same event												Tribal fare																					Tribal culture maybe far removed from our civilised norms, but their art and craft finds pride of place in urban homes. Dokra from Bastar in Chhattisgarh is one such craft, prized for its intricate motifs and interesting shapes. One can now witness its stylised, local tribal idioms at Gallery Kanishkas at 2/1 Hindusthan Road, that is hosting an exhibition-cum-sale of dokra figurines. 																					Inaugurated by theatre personality Usha Ganguly, the showing features a host of dokra figurines by National Award winner for dokra-casting, Rajendra Baghel. The exhibits on display range from three-inch tortoises to over three-feet high figurines. Besides various tribal gods and goddesses  Jhitku-Mitku (God and Goddess of peace), Dokri Deo (Goddess of wealth), Rau Deo (the protector) and Mauli Mata (whose image is worshipped before Mauli Mela begins in the month of Fagun), the exhibits include masks or veer mukhouti (usually worn as a sign of victory), tori or bugles, figures of tribal sportswomen, Ganesha and Shiva idols, numerous animal and human figures, as well as a tribal village fashioned on a square plot. 																					These figurines are painstakingly culled by a vanishing wax technique, explained craftsman Rajendra. First the desired model is made of black clay and rice husk. Thereafter, the model is shaped by filing or chipping. The entire model is then encased by bees wax thread. The unique texture and intricacy of dokra is achieved by these wax threads. The model is again covered by a layer of clay and coal dust. Another coating of termite dust and rice husk follows. The model is now ready to be baked in a kiln. The wax melts, leaving behind a hollow model into which molten bronze is poured. Casting over, the dokra item is now ready to be polished and finished, he details. 																					Each dokra item is unique. Once the casting is over, the clay model needs to be broken to take out the finished product. Not surprisingly, the prices starting from Rs 50 can go as high as Rs 1 lakh for really big and intricate items. Says Baghel, People mostly go for small pieces, but we can show our skill in the big ones.																					The exhibition will continue till March 31 and will remain open between 11 am and 8 pm from Monday to Saturday. Phone nos: 24634296, 9830015854. Theatre personality Usha Ganguly and craftsman Rajendra Baghel at a dokra exhibition												North-east calling																					North-east India is a rich storehouse of culture, most of which remains unexplored and unappreciated till date. To promote facets of North-east culture, Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre organised a North-east festival at its Bharatiyam Cultural Centre in Salt Lake. As eager enthusiasts poured into the open-air theatre in the evening, the curtains went up on the Singhi Chham folk dances of Sikkim, the Dhaowa, Farkanti and Sathar folk dances of the Rabhas of Assam and Nungthelleima  a Shumang Lila. 																					The traditional Shumang Lila is a performing art form of Manipur which is based on folk dance, theatre and martial art. Nungthelleima, performed at the open air theatre, is a Shumang Lila based on mythology. Dressed in traditional Manipuri attire, the performers enacted a war scene involving the mythological chief of Gods, warriors, wild animals and youth.																					Next to take the stage was the Rabha community of Assam with their rich folk dances. While the Dhaowa dance delineated the struggles, hostilities and conflicts that culminate in battles and wars, the Farkanti dance emphasised the Rabhas belief that the souls of the dead are reborn as animals and birds. The Sathar dance lent an air of merriment to the festival with its joyful tribute to youthfulness and love. The Singhi Chham or lion dance of Sikkim, as it is popularly known, also kept the audience glued to their seats.																					Apart from the bold dance and theatrical performances, the highlights of the North-east festival included an exhibition of handloom and handicraft items from Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura. From masalas to coir items, muga silks, wooden artefacts and agarbattis, there was every reason to rejoice in the wide variety that the North-east has to offer. The festival is on till today.

 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Shades of grey to go ga-ga over
 Kareena and Fardeen																								In Bollywood, they say, youre as good as your last film. So you have David Dhawan, all but written off after a string of flops, being hailed as the king again after the stupendous opening of Mujhse Shaadi Karogi. And now the spotlight shifts to music video director turned ad film-maker Ken Ghosh, whose big-budget romantic thriller Fida opens worldwide next Friday.																								The pressure is more telling with Ghoshs directorial debut Ishq Vishk scoring big at the box-office and giving the industry a new star in the form of Shahid Kapur. While Shahid returns in Fida for his second filmi outing, Kareena Kapoor and Fardeen Khan give him company as they continue their quest for that elusive hit. With the stakes soaring sky high, Ghosh doesnt need to be told that the countdown is on. Everyone in the industry says that the second film is the most important one for a director. I would be lying if I say I am under no pressure to deliver. Before the release of Ishq Vishk, I had gone through a terrible time thinking and brooding about how the film would fare. This time I have planned it out well. I have opted to stay busy with the post-production work till the very last moment so that I dont feel the pressure. Shahid and Kareena																								A hit music score (Anu Malik) and eye-catching promos have ensured that the curiosity level surrounding the film is high enough. And there is this big question mark about the storyline. The telly teasers showing a mysterious hand controlling the lives of the three protagonists on his (or is it her?) computer have led many to believe that Fida is a desi remake of Sliver, starring Sharon Stone (in a bathtub) and William Baldwin (behind the spycam). Some Netizens (read self-proclaimed film critics on the Net) have even dubbed it a copy of Jim Careys The Truman Show.																								It is not, protests Ghosh. As far as I know, Fida is a completely original script. Since no one really knows the storyline they are jumping to conclusions watching the trailers on television. The most difficult thing for me has been to keep the plot under wraps. If it is a professional crew, you can keep the secret but there are so many technicians involved that the storyline does tend to slip out.																								There is also this major Fida hoax doing the rounds that Salman Khan is the surprise element in the film. While Ghosh has stuck to the wait and watch routine throughout, he said it as he saw it on Sunday, while speaking to Metro from Mumbai. Let me put this straight to avoid any more confusion, Salman Khan is not a part of my film. But he did promise other more shocking surprises. There are concepts in the film which are very radical within the parameters of a commercial Hindi film. Fida has turned out well with some mind-blowing performances from Fardeen, Shahid and Kareena. If it doesnt work, it will only suggest that the Indian audience is not ready to accept such extreme ideas yet. Fardeen and Kareena																								For one, none of the Fida characters Jai (Shahid), Neha (Kareena) and Vikram (Fardeen) are out-and-out black or white. While I wouldnt say that my characters are grey, there are definitely some negative elements in them, says Ghosh. If the Dev and Khushi pairing of Fardeen and Kareena is under the scanner again, Fida will also see whether the behind-the-scenes romance between Shahid and Kareena works on screen.With advance bookings opening next week, Fida is the only major Bollywood release on August 20, at 89 Cinemas, INOX (Forum and City Centre). So, will Ken Ghoshs Fida have the perfect ending  despite the tagline?						PRATIM D. GUPTA

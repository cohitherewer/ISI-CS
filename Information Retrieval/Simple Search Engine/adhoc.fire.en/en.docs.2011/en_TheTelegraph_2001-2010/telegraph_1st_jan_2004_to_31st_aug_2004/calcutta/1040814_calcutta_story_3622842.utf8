 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Last PIL fails to move the bench
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The last effort to prevent the state from executing Dhananjoy Chatterjee failed on Friday when a division bench of acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy and Justice A.K. Mitra of Calcutta High Court refused to accept a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking an end to hanging as capital punishment.																								Petitioner S.C. Bagari, a high court advocate, argued that hanging of criminals could not check crime. The whole world is changing its view. Many countries have decided not to hang criminals as death cannot be a punishment for a killing, Bagari argued.																								The petitioner demanded that Dhananjoys death penalty be stayed until the central government decided what the method of capital punishment should be. The government has set up a committee to seek public opinion on the method. The Supreme Court has already sought opinion from judges of all high courts in this regard, he added.																								The courtroom was overcrowded but the onlookers heard the appeal in absolute silence for more than an hour. After the hearing was over, Bagari broke down. I tried my best (to save Dhananjoy) but I failed, he wept. 																								Some lawyers also took part and put forward suggestions about changing the method of capital punishment. The court gave them a patient hearing but did not find it fit to intervene in the matter.																								Even before the PIL was heard, the state government had examined it and made it clear that it would not stand scrutiny. In the end, the judge said: The application is summarily dismissed.

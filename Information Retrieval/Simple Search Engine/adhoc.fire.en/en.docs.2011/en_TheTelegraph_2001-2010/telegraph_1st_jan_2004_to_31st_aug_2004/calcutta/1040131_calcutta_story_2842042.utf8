 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Andarmahal
Traditional Bengali homes of the upper classes had two distinct divisions: the external or Baarmahal and the inner portion or Andarmahal. The Baarmahal or Kachharibari was the exclusive domain of the males. They used to meet guests and transact official business from here. The Andarmahal or the Janana-mahal belonged to women. No males could enter this well-guarded and fortified bastion of the fair sex. The half-lit corridors led to endless rooms, each a treasure-trove of hidden lores  of vices, of secret carnal pleasures, unfulfilled desires of tears and deprivation, of death and decay. Men, who were barred from entering this territory, were naturally curious. The more adventurous ones who dared to defy rules would perhaps peep from key-holes or even ventured into this forbidden territory under some pretext or the other. Pintu Paul captures vignettes of Andarmahal in his current exhibition. The paintings depict carefree voluptuous women in different postures and in various stages of undress. Their vacant or melancholic looks are more eloquent than words can ever be.																								When: Till February 2; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

 Feng Shui / Pinky Kapoor Q: Recently some good  business opportunities have come my way and as a result,  I have decided to shift into a larger, centrally-located  office. But I am still reluctant to leave my old office  as it was very lucky for me. Is it advisable to do so? As  the new office is actually under construction, I will be  grateful if you can give me some Feng Shui guidelines for  doing up the interiors and the lobby. 																								Animesh Mukherjee, Calcutta																								A: As you have prospered in your old office, I would suggest that you do not give up the place altogether, but continue to do some work from there. However, there is absolutely no harm in looking for a larger office to expand business. The following points should be taken into consideration before doing up the interiors of the new office. The dimensions of the door should neither be too large nor too small. Large doors would mean leakage of money because they allow too much chi to flow out and small undersized doors prevent the gentle flow of chi, which in turn symbolises blockage in your progress and luck.																								The lobby or reception must be pleasing, well-lit, airy and welcoming. A badly done-up lobby will give a poor outlook to your business and may drive away business opportunities. If the space allocated for the lobby is small, then give it a spacious look by placing full-length mirrors on the side-walls. These mirrors can be further highlighted with lights on top. This will change the entire ambience of the lobby.																								Your chamber should be larger than those of your subordinates. If the rooms of your employees are bigger than yours, then dont be surprised if they dominate you in the long run.			The western sector is not suitable for a water fountain, so to counteract the negative effects of having one here, dry up the water and introduce metal objects in it Picture by Rashbehari Das Q: I have energised  the southern portion of my house with fiery and vibrant  colours. There are lots of reds and maroons in the curtains,  tapestry, carpets, artefacts, and paintings. As a result,  this area seems so warm that sometimes, I feel very uneasy.  I have observed that all of a sudden everybody has become  quite ill-tempered. I have learnt from your articles that  the southern portion of my house is already projected. Is  this the reason for so much of uneasiness in the family?																								Nisha Mehta, Calcutta																								A: You have got it right. Feng Shui is all about balance and harmony in the house. The south is associated with the fire element and this area is ruled by fire. It becomes very dangerous when this area is projected and you introduce more of fire in the form of colours and objects. The excessive energy already prevailing here gets more powerful and creates an imbalance in the house. We all know that a little fire is inspiring and stimulating. However, too much could be destructive and makes the residents impatient and hot-tempered. A simple solution to this problem is to change the colour scheme into an earthy one because in the exhaustive cycle, earth exhausts fire. Q: Years ago, I had  got a water fountain built in the western sector of the  house. I now understand after going though your articles  that this area is not suitable for a water feature. I have  not seen anything positive happening in the house. Please  suggest what I should do with the water fountain?																								Seema Agarwal, Calcutta																								A: This is definitely not the right place for a water fountain. The western sector of the house is associated with children and is ruled by metal energy. In the exhaustive cycle, water drains away metal energy, thus affecting childrens future prospects. The easiest solution is to dry up the water and introduce metal objects in it. The existing earth element will nourish the metal energy, which rules this area. Q: I have heard so much  about the tortoise having a prominent place in Feng Shui.  Can you please explain its significance and suggest where  we should place it so that it is good for us?																								Surbhi Kanoria, Ranchi																								A: The advanced branch of Feng Shui, known as the flying stars, is derived from the engravings found on the shell of the tortoise. A tortoise is considered very auspicious and is a symbol of longevity. When kept in the north, it enhances career opportunities, but if good health is your priority, it should be kept in the east. We must remember that water nourishes wood. While the north is related to water energy, it is wood that rules the eastern sector. The tortoise also symbolises the universe  as it swims through water; its belly is compared to the earth and the back with heaven.

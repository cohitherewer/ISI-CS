 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 3-lakh supari for trader elimination
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Supari killing has come to the heart of Calcutta.																								Twenty-five-year-old Sambhu Kumar Choudhury, a trader in spices and milk powder, was eliminated by contract killers at the behest of business rival Bhagwan Tiwari, police said on Tuesday.																								Five persons have been arrested, including Tiwari, who allegedly paid a sum of Rs 3 lakh to the hitmen.																								On the night of February 5, Choudhury was intercepted by three men in front of his Rabindra Sarani office while he was on his way home.																								The killers herded him into his Santro. While one got into the front seat of the car and held a razor to the throat of the driver, the two others sat on either side of Choudhury in the back and kept on abusing him.																								The goons forced the driver to go down Chittaranjan Avenue, through Bagbazar, Shyambazar and RG Kar Road to Canal West Road, where they stopped the car, shot Choudhury in the head and left him to die.																								Bhagawan Tiwari was in the same trade and often visited the Choudhury brothers at their office for help.																								It was becoming increasingly difficult for me to run my business, as Sambhu and his brother Sashi were doing very well. Their teamwork was very good. It was necessary to eliminate one of them for me to succeed, Tiwari reportedly told interrogators.																								Tiwari paid Rs 3 lakh to Akbar, a resident of Howrahs Vaishali, and a confidant.																								Akbar immediately got to work and used his underworld connections to team up with Hamid, Naushad and Samsher Ali to carry out the strike. To make sure that the job was carried out properly, he also accompanied the trio that night in a taxi, that later tailed the Santro, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh.																								From the very beginning, we had suspected contract killers to be behind the murder of Choudhury, as they had left his driver Ujjwal Haldar unhurt. These men carry out orders they are paid for and do not bother about the rest, said an officer of the dacoity wing of the detective department.																								Sleuths, groping for a motive for the first few days, picked up their first clue when they traced Choudhurys cellphone, which the goons had taken with them to Raigachhi, in Howrah.																								A unique code is assigned to every mobile handset, something the killers were not aware of. That is the one mistake they made in an otherwise smooth operation, said officer-in-charge of the dacoity wing, A. Haque.																								According to police sources, many more arrests may follow in the coming days.																								Investigations, as of now, suggest that there could be others involved in the case. We are interrogating the arrested five and hope to piece together some more details of the killing, said an officer on the case.																								It marks a new crime trend in this part of the country. We have not seen anything like this for a long time, he confessed.

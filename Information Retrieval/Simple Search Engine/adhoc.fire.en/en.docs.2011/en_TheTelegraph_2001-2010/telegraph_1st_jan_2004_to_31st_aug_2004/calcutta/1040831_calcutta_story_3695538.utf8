 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 Life Old flames in new bottlesSANGITA S. GUHA ROY												In the age of remixes, reinventing age-old utility products into high-end home dcor items seems like a good idea. The latest to make its way on to table tops is the paraffin lamp, a snazzier version of the humble, home-made ensemble of medicine bottle, cloth and kerosene called dhibri.Imported from China and Singapore, these are available in glass bottles in sizes and shapes as varied as one can imagine. The lamps pack in interesting decorations like artificial flowers, leaves and even fruits in attractive colours.																					A touch of shimmer is added at times to take away the last visages of its Plain Jane cousins image, though the more boring variety has the far more useful task of lighting up many a poor mans home.																					In case of the odd powercut a paraffin lamp can prove useful to you as well. The smokeless lamp comes fitted with a sealed metal lid that houses a cork wrapped in silver coloured plastic paper. A dash of jute is tied to the neck as well for a touch of traditional chic. A wick tied to the neck is ready for anytime use.RACK RAIDER

 Kriti at Forum, fourth floor;

 How much
Rs 100 to Rs 300
To make use of this contraption, all you have to do is take off the cork with a corkscrew, wedge the wick in its place and off you go. The wick, which apparently makes use of German technology, burns rather slowly so even the smallest ones last for up to three days, if burnt continuously. Both the wick and the paraffin oil are replaceable.																					The lamps are best kept out of the reach of children and are not to be touched near the neck while they are burning as they tend to become very hot. 																					If the idea clicks, you can try your hand at making one yourself with customised decorations. Or you can pick one up for between Rs 100 to Rs 300.																					While you are out browsing, keep a lookout for aromatic paraffin lamps, about to hit the racks as soon as the manufacturers can figure out an aromatic oils-paraffin combo that clicks.

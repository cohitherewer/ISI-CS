The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 																				Banibrata Basu								Joint commissioner, traffic, Calcutta Police																																							We hold the driver at fault if a bus causes an accident. But the owner cannot evade responsibility if there was a mechanical fault in the vehicle. In case the driver was previously booked or prosecuted, we check whether his vision is a problem. The owner, in such cases, should not allow them to drive. But they claim their hands are tied by the union which comes in the way of a lay-off. Moreover, there is no law in the book yet by which we can penalise a bus-owner for an accident.

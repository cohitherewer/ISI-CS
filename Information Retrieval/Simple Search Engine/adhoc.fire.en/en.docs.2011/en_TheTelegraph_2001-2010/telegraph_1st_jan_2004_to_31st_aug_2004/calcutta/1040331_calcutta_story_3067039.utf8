 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Deaf ear to tax refund cries
 A STAFF REPORTERIf vehicles have been given a blanket breather on the auto-emission count by the court, car trouble of a different kind has erupted at the public vehicles department (PVD) office.																								For the past two days, PVD officials have been refusing to accept the one-year tax or refund vehicle-owners as per the high court order.																								Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya on Friday had set aside the transport departments move to collect five-year tax from four-wheelers and 15-year tax from two-wheelers and directed the government to collect the conventional annual tax, instead.																								The court also asked the government to refund the amount collected as lifetime tax from vehicle-owners over the past two months. We have not received a copy of the court order yet. What we have come to know about the judgment is from the newspapers, PVD director H. Mohan said on Tuesday.																								Until and unless we get the court order, how can we take a decision and act accordingly? We cannot do anything on the basis of news reports. Our law officials are trying to get a copy of the order and the decision will be taken only after obtaining it and going through it, added Mohan.																								Following Fridays judgment, a large number of car-owners who had already coughed up the five-year tax gathered at the Beltala office on Monday demanding a refund. 																								But PVD officials rejected all cries for a refund and several car-owners queuing up to pay their annual tax were also turned away.																								On Tuesday, too, the same chaotic scenes were enacted at the PVD office, where hundreds of car and two-wheeler owners gathered to pay their annual tax and get their refund. Even Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) representatives were turned away.																								An altercation broke out at Beltala as the PVD officials stuck to their no-tax, no-refund stand. Senior Beltala officials stepped in to pacify agitated car-owners with an assurance that their demands would be considered within a few days.																								Tension ran high at the regional transport offices in Barasat and Alipore, as well.																								The court order comes into effect immediately and it is the responsibility of the transport department to collect a copy of the order, asserted AAEI secretary Tapan Debnath. If the PVD does not follow the order, we will be compelled to move court again, he warned.

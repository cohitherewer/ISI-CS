The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Its all in the stars, and disbelief wont dim the effect
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								The website of Maa Laxmi Astrological Consultancy makes for interesting reading, if you have the patience to go through it. Operating from a somewhat unlikely corner of Ganguly Bagan, it offers a wild (sic) array of services. 																								The firm specialises in astrology, astro-palmistry, jem therapy, vaastu and, hold your breath, even anthropology! The copywriter evidently got carried away into believing that anthropology was a part of the occult. 																								The site offers its services for not just match-making but also for (presumably settling) marital disputes  and here the site emphasises  both pre-marital and post-marital disputes. For $ 200 (US) the site offers to answer 10 questions, while for Rs 1,501 in Indian currency, you are allowed to ask just five. 																								There are several other sites promising astrological cures to everything from diabetes to cancer. One of them, Sai Astrological Centre, hails its resident astrologer, Professor Chakraborty, as a PCB award-winner, whatever that is, and assures 100% guaranted ( sic) to all your ills. 																								Every metro has astrologers. But Calcutta appears to have more than its share of them and, by all accounts, the city appears to be fighting a losing battle against the stars. The fatalistic mindset of the people might explain the lack of initiative, for which the city is known. Every hotel here may not have a resident astrologer but every television channel, and there are half a dozen of them, appears to have one. By all accounts, they are hugely successful, with considerable viewer-participation and phone-ins. Newspapers are full with advertisements released by crystal-gazers of all kinds and of late, an increasing number of women appear to be joining what is possibly the second oldest profession. 																								The smarter among them keep a low profile, refuse to be photographed, avoid television like the plague and depend on references to draw clients to them. They operate from air-conditioned chambers and have the gizmos to impress the visitors. It is not unusual for some of them to flash a diamond ring or two and flaunt an expensive mobile handset.																								But while Calcuttans have a weakness for astrologers and the business is booming, universities here have taken the predictable decision of not including astrology as a subject of study. Indeed, they have reacted with mock horror or with righteous indignation to the suggestion. Pro vice-chancellor of Calcutta University Suranjan Das has been quoted as saying emphatically that the subject would never be taught in any university of the state. 																								One cannot be so sure, though, specially after the Supreme Court ruled that there is nothing in the statutes to prevent the University Grants Commission from introducing the course. Several universities in the country have already succumbed to generous grants on offer and agreed to introduce Vedic astrology as a subject of study. It could just be a matter of time before universities here, too, fall in line.																								Reactions to astrology veer from blind belief to equally blind and rigid disbelief. An alternative way of looking at the subject would be to explore its role as entertainment, commerce and in psychiatry, for example. It is, undoubtedly, important to promote scientific temper and fight superstition. 																								But assuming that academics and scientists here have been engaged actively in such a pursuit all these past years, the result can hardly be seen as encouraging. A more open mind, a fresh approach and the study of astrology, tempered by healthy scepticism, could actually be a more effective way of fighting superstition. 																								For example, university departments of psychology and sociology can initiate research into astrological predictions and their impact on people. The random and stray cases cited by rationalists have often failed to cut much ice because they were not perceived as the outcome of serious and sustained research. Universities and academics can lend legitimacy to findings of such research and help develop a more sceptical approach to star-gazing.																								Several families have been ruined by their obsessive and blind faith in astrology. That has not deterred others from flocking to street-smart astrologers. It is comforting to believe in a destiny pre-determined by astral forces beyond their control. 																								When astrologers are asked why they prescribe gems and precious stones, if everything is pre-determined by the stars, they come up with glib answers to sway the nave. You cannot prevent rains, they declare, but surely you can use umbrellas to protect yourself? 																								The growing number of people opting for such umbrellas need to restore faith in themselves. But the best way of doing that may not lie in refusing to acknowledge astrology even as a popular pastime.

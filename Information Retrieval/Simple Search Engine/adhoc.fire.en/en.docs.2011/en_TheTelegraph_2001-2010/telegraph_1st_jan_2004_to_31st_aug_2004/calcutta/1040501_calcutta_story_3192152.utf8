The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 80,000 hang up on CalTel landlines
 															- Distress tone sparks damage-control survey on product marketability SANJAY MANDAL																								The alarm bells are ringing in the Calcutta Telephones (CalTel), and with some reason  the loss of more than 80,000 subscribers of basic telephones in less than a year. 																								The findings, that can best be described as distressing, have prodded Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) into initiating a fact-finding exercise.																								The loss of subscribers is one of the largest in recent times, admitted CalTel officials on Friday. We lost the chunk of subscribers in the past 11 months owing to a surge in the use of mobile telephony services. This has forced the framing of a full-fledged survey on the marketability of our products, he added.																								Detailed strategies for marketing inspection have been drawn up to improve the organisations image and increase saleability of its products.																								Although the Sulabh scheme paid dividends and things improved significantly last month, the surveys will help arrest the slide further, said officials. The organisation is taking a more aggressive approach to the market in the face of competition and, for the first time, it has taken up data analysis in a structured form to set up a comprehensive policy, they added.																								The two-pronged surveys  internal and external  are aimed at gathering market feedback about CalTel products, vis-a-vis those of private competitors, various activities undertaken in the past six months, special efforts by various circles and even publicity measures.																								The survey form has been divided into 13 sections. It will provide information on a number of services marketed or sold by a circle, the number of franchises in CellOne (the mobile telephony service), Excel (pre-paid connection), Bfone and STD public call offices.																								Marketing information forms an important part of the survey, as it will throw up comparative data of the current and the previous year. These include a percentage change in the sale of Bfone, CellOne and Sancharnet (the Internet service of BSNL). Change in revenue earned from the sale of services will also be mentioned.																								The survey will also be aimed at identifying our nearest competitor in these services, so that adequate measures can be taken to strengthen our position, said a senior official of CalTel.																								Authorities have sought information about recent and running marketing campaigns. How many officers of various grades have been trained will also find mention. We are also attaching importance to training franchisees. So, information on how many of them have been trained will be included, an official said.																								Information on the number of schemes issued by circle officers, those implemented and those not implemented will find space in the form.																								In another bid to connect to reluctant consumers, an image-building segment will help the organisation take stock of its present standing and plan its public relations programmes.

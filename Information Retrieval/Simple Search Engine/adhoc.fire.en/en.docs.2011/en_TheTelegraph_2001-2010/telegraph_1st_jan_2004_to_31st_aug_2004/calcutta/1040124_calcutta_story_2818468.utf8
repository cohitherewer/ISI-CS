				 Mapping messiah on celluloid

 Mohammed, Christ and Netaji. All 
 have one thing in common: They represent, to the masses, 
 the chance of a messiah returned.
				 																																																											This dream is common to all cultures, feels director Shyam Benegal, whose film, Netaji: The Last Hero, is nearing completion. In town to deliver the Netaji Oration 2004 to mark Subhas Boses 107th birth anniversary, Benegals talk, entitled In Search of Netaji, explored the leaders iconic stature in Indias collective psyche.
				 																																																											Netaji is an icon like no other in India, he said on Friday morning at the Elgin Road Netaji Research Bureau. None, even Mahatma Gandhi, enjoys the iconic status of Netaji, added the director, whose film project was inaugurated at last years assembly.
				 																																																											There are some real and some imagined reasons for the devotion to the freedom fighter. Amongst these is the not entirely rational belief that the man is not really dead. Netaji sightings over the past 60 years have added to the mythic figures aura. This, he feels is an expression of a collective wish-fulfilment dream. Bose is still the only one who can put right the ills that plague us. Detractors who, at the time, accused Netaji of fascism and militarism are now acknowledged as blatantly partisan and propagandist.
				 																																																											In the film, Benegal stresses, he has consciously avoided controversy. It was like negotiating a minefield. But rather than make hindsight judgements, the filmmaker who has already delved into the lives of Nehru and Gandhi, chose to recreate a time and a period, to capture the interest of a lay audience. Presentation of his ideological beliefs and political actions are never enough unless his human side and humanity are on view. Benegal, keen not to get on the wrong side of public sentiment even steered clear of unnecessarily contentious details, like showing Netaji on film with a glass of wine, which he would occasionally have, or the coffee and cigarettes he was addicted to during the INA days. He chose instead to bear witness to an epic struggle, to capture the story of a great adventurer that is eminently suitable for a popular medium. He cautioned his audience that The Last Hero was not a history in the fullest sense Films can only be fictions based on facts.
				 																																																											The ceremony was also attended by Governor Viren J. Shah, who spoke of his personal devotion to the great hero, with tremendous charisma. It was on January 23, 1945 that Shah was at the receiving end of his first good cane charge and spent one reasonably uncomfortable night in police lock-up. The governor concluded, among great martyrs, Netaji stands at the front.
				 																																																											During the making of the film, Benegal encountered a tendency to be protective and proprietorial in some parts of Bengal. He received many letters, the director said after the talk, which crossed the boundaries of curiosity. But Benegal feels that there are no hidden secrets to the mans life that need to be uncovered. The film, ending with Indias Independence, is not at all concerned with the ambiguous circumstances of his death.

 on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta
				 																																									 Getting people to understand and believe in you enough to take your side in a heated argument, but without using a language they understand. Thats a rather unusual challenge, but one that the Stone brothers have won time and again, around the world. 
				 																																																											Mannerisms and machinations, body language, gestures, facial expressions and voice modulation  and a whole lot of gibberish. A winning formula for a show that Barnaby and Jonathan have performed nearly 300 times, in 28 countries and for the past 16-odd years.
				 																																																											The two siblings began working together in 1985, after graduating from a small arts and theatre college in England, started by a friend of Tagores and based on Santiniketan. After a successful cabaret show, the duo formed the Ralf Ralf company and came up with The Summit, an unconventional play depicting the negotiations between two politicians  a parody of men making stupid decisions because of power.
				 																																																											Inspired by the end of the Cold War and the historic Reykjavik meeting between Reagan and Gorbachov, as well as events in South Africa, Northern Ireland and Israel, the dynamics of relationships portrayed by brothers, they felt, would be a unique concept. And one that has worked well, transcending time, politics and cultures, since it is basically about human behaviour.
				 																																																											While the show is scripted  or as much as possible in the absence of language  the ample room for spontaneity and innovation means the more responsive the audience, the better. We address them as members in a political summit, each of us choosing our share. Its like a game with rules. So, audience reaction always makes it more fun. During a show in Spain, the viewers were divided, half supporting me and the other half Jonathan. They ended up shouting at each other, Barnaby recalls. 
				 																																																											But, the nicest compliment is even if people are silent spectators, they come and tell us they had forgotten that we were speaking a language they didnt know, the 40-year-old adds.
				 																																																											The skill is in the movements and voice. In fact, theres a lot of music, too, but all live acoustics that we do with our hands, feet, voices and even breathing, the 45-year-old older brother explains. We use non-verbal language, logic, reasoning and sequences of gestures.
				 																																																											During their three-week tour in India, theyve received warm receptions, with polite approval in the south and vocal appreciation in the west. After the performance in Calcutta on January 27, organised by the British Council, theyre off to Jamshedpur. Friday, our second day off so far, they spent wandering around the full and busy city.
				 																																																											In the works is a play on corporate executives coping without cell phones  another universal concept.
				 																																									 2A quaint exhibition of gramophone record covers will be hosted by Mitra Institution, Bhowanipore, on January 26 amp; 27. Gol Chaktir Molat is what it is called and a musical trip down memory lane, paved with nuggets of history, is what it promises. A counter for cassettes and another for Bengali magazines will also be set up. 
				 																																																											2Popular as well as rare titles on cassettes and CDs will be on sale at Music Mela 2004, organised by MusicWorld at Academy of Fine Arts from January 27 to February 2. Amala Shankar will light the ceremonial lamp at the inauguration. The carnival, which was hosted on the Academy lawns last year, moves indoors and will also offer an exhaustive spread of favourite movies on view CDs.
				 																																																											2Pencil and charcoal are his tools and the human form and spirit his inspirations. Rhythms of Life in Black amp; White is an exhibition by Charbak Sen (January 28-30) to mark the 30th anniversary celebrations of Gorky Sadan presented by the cultural department of the Russian consulate general in Calcutta.

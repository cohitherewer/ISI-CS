 The latest to join the numbers race in the name game is celebrated jazz musician Louiz Banks (picture by Rashbehari Das). Yes, you got it right  the s in his first name has now given way to a z and the effect seems to be showing, already. In recent years, my focus has mainly been on fusion music and I am getting to do some real good work, says the bearded man, from under a trademark baseball cap.Banks is in town to be part of the 10th anniversary celebrations of Someplace Else and is all charged up to play on Friday night. I think Someplace Else deserves a lot of kudos for promoting live music. Thats the real thing, with the power to inspire an entire generation of aspiring musicians.Apart from his live shows, Banks is taking time out to work on his new venture. I am bringing out a new hip-hop jazz album titled Heatwave. I think the only way you can make the younger generation listen to old music forms, like jazz, is by packaging it in a format they would like to listen to. So, elements of hip-hop and R amp;B should be incorporated into jazz music to make it easy on their ears.Another fusion project that Banks is working on is kathak jazz. I am working with danseuse Aditi Bhagwat and you have to see her to believe how one can match kathak steps with jazz movements.While Banks isnt too keen to work in films because of the typical formula music, he is ready to rock with more discerning film-makers. I did the score for Bharat Dabholkars God Only Knows and another international project titled Bokshu. I am working on a mega musical project with Parvati Balagopalan (director of Rules  Pyar Ka Superhit Formula) and Shiamak Davar that would bring together music forms from every part of the country.Perizaad Zorabian is the new Miss India. Not on the ramp that is, but on the big screen for British film director Lawrence Postmas new project Exits And Entrances. Its an all-British cast and I am the only Indian in the movie. I play the female lead of a Miss India winner in the five-character film. And let me tell you, the script is quite amazing, said Joggers Parks Jenny, who was last in town to unveil The Telegraph Food Guide on June 20, with Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly as spotlight partner. Perizaad:Big biteNext week, Perizaad will leave for London for the one-month start-to-finish shooting schedule for the film. On the home front, too, she has two films lined up  Mahesh Dattanis second directorial venture Morning Raaga and Bappaditya Bandopadhyays bilingual film Devaki.Morning Raaga should release in mid-October and as for Devaki, the dubbing and mixing is almost done, says the pretty woman who had Victor Banerjee jogging after her in the Subhash Ghai production.But you may not have to wait that long to catch Perizaad on celluloid. She has a surprise appearance in next Fridays big release Dhoom.Oh! Its a two-second fleeting appearance. Dhoom director Sanjay Gadhvi is a very good friend of mine, from the time he assisted my director friend, the late Anant Balani. He asked me to do this tiny little cameo where Uday comes to this hot looking woman and asks something. I did it only because of Sanjay. I am not even sure whether it is left out of the film, she says in one breath. Whew! But then, Perizaad is like that only  as bindaas as it gets. Eminem: Play on This one is for the parents. The big bad boy of music is all set to invade your living rooms and so, perhaps, you can take the PG tag a bit more seriously. With Eminem around, can you afford to take a chance? 8 Mile, Eminems big screen debut, will be shown on HBO on Saturday at 9 pm.The film sees the controversial Grammy Award-winning rap star playing Jimmy Rabbit Smith, who stays with his washed-out mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) in a gritty stretch of road in inner-city Detroit. The film trails Jimmys life who wants to make a career out of rap music and break free from his factory work. All odds are stacked against the white kid trying to make music in a predominantly African-American community.The Eminem effect  some are starting to call it the legend  continues to grow in the US with the rapper taking matters into his own hands to evade censorship on radio. Come autumn and he will have his very own channel on Sirus satellite-radio network. Subscribers will need to acquire a special receiver for Eminem to reach out to his audiences directly. He will be one of the executive producers of the commercial-free radio station that will also be a platform to exhibit the talents of other Shady Records stars, including D12 and 50 Cent.For all quizzing freaks, heres some more of it on TV. Janar Moja-Mojar Jana Syllabus Barry Sirer Sathe (take a breath and read on!) will have students of Classes IX and X facing a barrage of brainteasers on Alpha Bangla every Sunday, 12.30 pm sharp.Compered by Barry OBrien, the first of the 26-episode show will kick off with a warm-up for the war of words and wits. Forty-eight teams, no less, from Madhyamik, ICSE and CBSE schools across town will square off. The prelims for the four-tier contest will feature three teams of two contestants each. The three rounds  the rapid fire Syllabus Theke, the four-minute buzzer Googly and the final Out of the Syllabus  will trim the list to a handful for the finals.This quiz is the first of its kind as schools from all three boards are participating and the students can choose either Bengali or English. The teasers are also based on their syllabi, says quizmaster OBrien.We all get to see the action only by the month-end, but the quiz team (cast and crew included) is fighting it out at Roopkala Kendro, where the shooting is on.

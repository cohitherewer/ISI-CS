 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Bishops fusillade at critics
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rev P.S.P. Raju, Bishop of Calcutta, diocese of the Church of North India (CNI), on Thursday warned his detractors that he had informed higher authorities of the Church in Delhi that he will soon take stern action against them.																								He said he had warned them earlier, too, after they demonstrated in front of Bishop House in February. I did not take action then, as I wanted to give them a chance to understand their fault. But I notice that a small group is continuously fomenting trouble over baseless issues, tarnishing the image of the Church and the community, he said.																								The Bishop has been embroiled in controversy since February 19, when a group of members belonging to CNI-controlled churches in Calcutta demonstrated in front of Bishop House, demanding that he step down. 																								The lobby charged him with corruption, saying he had handed over a sizeable portion of Bishop House, designated a heritage structure, to a city-based realtor to develop it into a commercial complex. 																								It accused him of changing the admission policies of CNI-controlled schools, alleging he did this to be in full control of their admission procedure. 																								Dipak Nath, a spokesman for the anti-Bishop camp, challenged the Bishop, saying: We will fight till he steps down. 																								Countering the charges, the Bishop said: We have changed the admission policies to ensure more transparency in the entire procedure.

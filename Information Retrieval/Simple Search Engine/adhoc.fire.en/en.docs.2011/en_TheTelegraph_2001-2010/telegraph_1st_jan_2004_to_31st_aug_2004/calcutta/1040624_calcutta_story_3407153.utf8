The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 Two to talk tango
TT Surprize Jishu Sengupta and Nelanjana Bhowmick being mobbed at The Telegraph Surprize meetIt was a dream date with Tollywoods jodi No. 1, Nelanjana Bhowmick and Jishu Sengupta, for 100 readers of The Telegraph who had gathered at Moksh on Tuesday evening. Fifty lucky winners of The Telegraph Surprize contest, along with their partners, were given the chance to interact with the star couple at the 22 Camac Street auditorium.What was supposed to be a question-answer session turned out to be much more than just that, with the stars having as much of a blast as the audience.The crowd comprised an interesting mix of people from various age-groups and professions and the questions ranged from the serious to the saucy, the thought provoking to the funky.Nelanjana was the first to take the dais with her hubby-to-be turning up slightly late, but full of apologies to his ladylove as well as the crowd.The Q amp;A session got underway with a gentle one from Kushal asking Nelanjana about her hobbies, which set the lady off about her passion for animals, her dog Chipper and her two cats. She also revealed how she was currently penning a pet column in the Sunday Metro , writing short stories and doing some stain-glass painting.The next one from Debashish set Nelanjana thinking about her dream roles: Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady, Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich and her mom (Anjana Bhowmick) in Nayika Sambad. And before her beau made an entry, Nelanjana named her dream hero  Uttam Kumar (unfortunately I didnt get to act with him).The heros entry at this point interrupted the flow of questions and fans of Tollywoods chocolate boy grabbed the chance to congratulate him on his streaked-hair look. The next round of questions forced Jishu to pad up, with the first one from Sarda trying to probe why he gave up cricket for films. To this, Jishu said that while he had started playing cricket in school and had even turned out for the Bengal Under-16 team, his ties with the industry were strong right from his childhood because his father was an actor. Once during the Pujas, Madhabi Mukherjee came to our para pandal. She saw me and offered me a role in her serial Nishkriti and I decided to give it a try. After that I worked in a feature film which is still half-done. But I seriously took to acting since Mahaprabhu happened, he recounted.The dream role question from Debashish next rolled Jishus way and he went on to reveal how he too was a die-hard fan of Uttam Kumar and to play any of the Mahanayaks roles would be a dream come true. His favourite screen women  Julia Roberts and Kajol.The spotlight then shifted to Jishus first Hindi film  he dwelt at length on Shyam Benegals Netaji: The Last Hero, where he plays Sisir Bose  and his forthcoming blockbuster  Premi, co-starring Nelanjanas sister Chandana and Jeet.With a taste of both Bollywood and Tollywood, what does he think are the primary differences between the two industries, asked Seema. To this Jishu said that it would be unfair to compare a regional industry with a national one, but the basic difference lies in the fact that we dont have enough money here. But he stressed that Tolly technicians are actually better than those in Mumbai. If we had their kind of money, we would be much better than Bollywood, declared Jishu. The duo fielding questions at the same event. Pictures by Aranya SenThe Q amp;A game then switched from single to double-wicket, with the next few questions directed jointly at the lovebirds, who smiled, swayed and sweet-talked their way through the attack. Answering Seemas question on how their love story began, Jishu revealed that the duo first met on the sets of a telefilm called Bosundhara in September 2002. But we really bonded when we were touring the US and London with our theatre, added Nelanjana.When is the big day, was the loudest whisper of the evening, and it was finally voiced by Archana. According to Nelanjana, the first week of November would see them tie the knot, provided Jishu can give me a date.So, when do we see the two coming together in reel life, was the obvious one from Pamita. Thats also our question to all the directors  why isnt anyone asking us to do a film together? laughed the twosome.In true filmi fairytale style, the curtains on the dream date came down with a song. Kal Ho Na Ho, sang she for him and Pretty Woman, sang he for her from the same film and the audience joined in with gusto.

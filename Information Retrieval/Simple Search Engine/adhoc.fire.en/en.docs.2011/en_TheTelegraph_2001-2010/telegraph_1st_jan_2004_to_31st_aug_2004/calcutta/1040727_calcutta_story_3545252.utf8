The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Hot words over car chaos
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government came in for a lot of flak in the Assembly on Monday for its failure to restore traffic discipline in the city.																								Look at the condition of the major roads and intersections. Theres a jam on every street, shouted Congress MLA Asit Mitra. It takes two hours to travel a distance of five km during peak hours. The traffic police are silent spectators, he added. 																								Echoing Mitra, Tarak Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress pointed out that the major roads are over-run by autorickshaws. 																								It seems the three-wheelers are not under the administrative control of the transport department. Thousands of illegal autos ply on the roads, creating congestion and polluting the air. More surprisingly, the transport department does not even have any statistics on the number of autos, he said.																								The Trinamul leader also trained his ire on trams for damaging the roads. What is the benefit of plying trams on busy roads? Either withdraw them from the city or repair the tracks, Banerjee thundered.																								The transport minister, in his reply, said the roads were overburdened with a growing vehicle population. The roads are limited and there is little scope to create any more space to accommodate the rising car count. We are making all efforts to improve transport infrastructure, the minister told the House.

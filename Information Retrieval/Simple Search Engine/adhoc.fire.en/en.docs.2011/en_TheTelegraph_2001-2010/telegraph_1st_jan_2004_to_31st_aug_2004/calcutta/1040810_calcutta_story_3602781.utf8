Shaun Kenworthy - Executive chef, The ParkIf you talk to any chefs in London about cocktails, you could write a book about their drunken stories. I have to admit to being one of them. Ive got myself into all sorts of ridiculous situations over the years from the tamest of concoctions (also some nonsense hideous enough to deflate a camels hump).My earliest memories of cocktails were in one of the local pubs called Old Vaults in Ashton, the town where I grew up under Lyne, just outside Manchester. At the time, about 16 years ago, Manchester was a rocking city for live music, with great bars around. Most of the cocktails were still quite basic.The Harvey Wall Bangers, Screwdrivers, Manhattans, Between the Sheets, Black Russians were all quite dull in comparison with the shooter and test tube culture in todays cocktail market. Most modern cocktails are just mixtures of hard alcohol with a bit of this and that to make them a little more pleasant to down, but still give one untamed kick in the head at the end of the day.Ive tried all sorts of stuff, from tequila shots topped up with Tabasco to Mojitos (white rum, crushed brown sugar, lots of olive, fresh mint and crushed ice).Two of my all-time favourites are Long Island Iced Tea and Bloody Mary. Long Island Iced Tea can be quite potent, depending on how much cola you top it up with. The Bloody Mary is a good cocktail to drink with friends and a great hangover awakener.Long Island Iced TeaIngredients: Half shots each of tequila, gin, rum and vodka; cola.Method: Throw all the liquor into the biggest, tallest glass you can find with a lemon wedge and ice and top it off with cola.Bloody MaryIngredients: 500 ml tomato juice, 2 tsp Tabasco, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp horseradish sauce (if you can get it),  tsp celery, 1 tsp salt,  tsp pepper; vodkaMethod: Make a tomato mix with all the ingredients apart from the vodka. Shake or blend well. You can keep this mixture in the fridge for a week. Throw a large measure of vodka into a rock or whisky glass with a couple of ice cubes and top up with the tomato mix and stir.

								Dayal Banerjee: When will the flyover at Kaikhali be ready? We hear that another is to be constructed at Baguiati to ease traffic congestion at the crossing of Keshtopur and Kaikhali. The area is extremely accident-prone.																																																													Work on the flyover has started, as you may be aware, after a lot of persuasion from my side. It should be ready by April. I have tried my best to push the project through. Elaborate planning has gone into it, with provision for a three-point subway for pedestrians. The project was sanctioned in 2001 and a private firm asked to carry out the job. The estimated cost was Rs 371 crore. But according to public works department minister Amar Choudhury, the coffers are empty. Several pleas from me have been ignored.

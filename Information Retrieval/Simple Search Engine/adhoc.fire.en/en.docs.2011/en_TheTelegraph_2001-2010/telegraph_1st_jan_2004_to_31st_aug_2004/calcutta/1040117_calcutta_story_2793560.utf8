The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 On track for smoother ride
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Come March 31, and tram rides will be smoother, at least in some parts of the city.																								Nearly three km of tracks on two stretches in Calcutta are being renovated by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC): between Gariahat tram depot and Syed Amir Ali Avenue (Park Circus) and between Rajabazar and Sahitya Parishad Street, in north Calcutta. Work started in September last year and HRBC hopes to complete both stretches by March 31, 2004. 																								The tracks will be laid in concrete road surfaces, replacing the worn-out bituminous stretches. In some portions, the tracks will be dereserved, so all vehicles can ply over the tracks, explained HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee on Friday. 																								Once the tracks are dereserved, the road surface will be wider, and free of congestion, the HRBC authorities hope. 																								The idea is to improve the quality of the ride and to allow a continuous smooth flow of traffic from Gariahat to Sahitya Parishad Street. Already, the Gariahat and AJC Bose Road flyovers have offered some respite to the people of Calcutta. But if stretches in between are bumpy, the flyovers become pointless, Banerjee added. 																								Tram tracks, he said, damage bituminous roads, but concrete roads are maintenance-free and last without much damage for at least 40 years. The project is part of Phase IV of the work on flyovers and road improvement for better traffic management in the city. Altogether, Rs 30 crore is being spent on the package, work on which started in July last year. 																								The outlay for the entire project is Rs 400 crore, of which the Japan Bank of International Cooperation is providing Rs 340 crore and the state government the rest. 																								Phase IV aims to ease traffic, mostly between the new flyovers, so roads that will be widened or bettered include Gol Park, Southern Avenue, Gariahat, Park Circus, Mullickbazar, Loudon Street and Rajabazar in the south and Sahitya Parishad Street in the north, Banerjee added.

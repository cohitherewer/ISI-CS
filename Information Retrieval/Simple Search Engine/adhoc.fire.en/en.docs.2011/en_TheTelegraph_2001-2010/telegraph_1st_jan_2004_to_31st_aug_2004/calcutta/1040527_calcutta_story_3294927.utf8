Those with a discerning eye prefer to dissect the stone to get to know it a little better.																								Mainly aimed at city jewellers and jewellery design students, Indian Diamond Institute (IDI), Surat (an autonomous body aided by the government of India) is conducting a diamond grading and identification workshop at Bhawanipur Education Society, in association with The Gem amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council, eastern region.																								The weeklong programme seeks to acquaint students with the four Cs of identifying diamonds  cut, colour, clarity and character using a 10x-loupe or magnifying glass. The course also encompasses diamond identification from substitutes like American diamonds, synthetic maisonette, etc.																								Conducted over two sessions, the workshop has enlisted 25 students this time around. Weve got local as well as outstation students from places like Siliguri and Cuttack. Most of them are from jewellers families, but there are others who are not into the diamond business as of now but would like to diversify, said faculty member Hitesh Verma of IDI.																								Priyanka Verma from the family of Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons is one such student at the workshop. Ive come here to get a basic knowledge of diamond identification as I would like to start a related business, she said.																								The likes of Priyanka help fulfil the long-term vision of The Gem amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council under the ministry of commerce, instrumental in bringing the course to town. We aim to improve trade and trade-related activities in the eastern region in the gems and jewellery segment, said Shantanu Rajguru, director, eastern region.																								The council has a target of achieving exports worth Rs 16 billion dollars in the diamond and studded jewellery segment by the year 2007. Of this, exports worth 12 billion dollars have already been achieved in the current financial year.																								Business to the tune of nine billion dollars was conducted in the cut-and-polished diamonds segment and the rest in plain and studded gold jewellery, Rajguru went on to reveal.India has a stake of two per cent in the 50 billion global market at present. But there is good scope for increasing our share, he elaborated. A student observes a diamond at the workshop in Bhowanipore. 
Picture by Rashbehari DasWoman power																								Till five years after my marriage, I was happy doing household chores and working for my family, but one day, I thought that I needed to be more than just a wife and a mother. Thats when I came out of the cocoon and tried to live as June. And here I am today.																								Actor June Maliah did not have to use her histrionic skills to convince the women behind some successful businessmen of the city that having ones own identity was synonymous with being alive.																								The first meeting under the new committee of the Ficci Ladies Organisation (FLO), Calcutta chapter, at Mahendra Jalans plush Alipore residence, amidst the dazzle of diamonds and the heady scent of perfumes, turned out to be an interesting experience-sharing session.																								Our motto is power to empower, said Sashi Prabha Jalan, who has just been sworn in as chairperson of the Calcutta chapter for 2004-05. To truly empower a woman, we need to ensure that shes economically independent, she added.																								Thats probably the reason why Sashi Prabha Jalan has some really finance-intensive strategies up her sleeve which she hopes to bring to the table and put to action during her tenure.																								Our focus will be the woman entrepreneur and ways to facilitate her activities, said Sashi Jalan on Wednesday. She went on to explain that this would entail alliances with the bank to help women-owned businesses get micro-credit faster, bring in international business consultants, and take middle-level women entrepreneurs for trips abroad for greater exposure.																								Setting up of a tele-helpline for those who might need sudden assistance is also on the cards. 																								High on the guest list were first lady Anjanaben Shah, jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty and artist Wasim Kapoor.

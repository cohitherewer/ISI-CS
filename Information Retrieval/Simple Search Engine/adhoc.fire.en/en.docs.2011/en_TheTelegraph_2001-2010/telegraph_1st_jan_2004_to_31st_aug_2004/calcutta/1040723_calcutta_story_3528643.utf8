 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Procedure shift plea rejected
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Rajnis Patel death case was further delayed on Thursday, with the defence council representing the accused doctors trying to reason with Alipore court sub-judicial magistrate Manjit Singh to convert the summons procedure case into a warrant procedure case. 																								The proceedings started after noon. The defence council, represented by senior lawyer Nikhil Nandi and Amitava Ganguly, urged the judge to consider its plea for the last time. The duo tried to explain why he should convert the case into a warrant procedure. They argued for nearly an hour, but to no avail.																								Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh, contesting their arguments, cited Section 259 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which states that a procedure can be converted only at the behest of the judge, if he so wishes, and only if he feels that the section on which the charges have been framed against the accused should be altered.																								Under no other circumstances can the procedure be converted. Also, to date, there has been no case where a procedure has been converted on the reasoning of the defence council, Ghosh added. 																								The judge observed that the arguments had continued for long enough and rejected the petition. The argument put forth by the defence council on the issue is not legally sound, judge Singh said. The next date of hearing is on August 16.

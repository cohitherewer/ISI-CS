 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Neighbours thrash man for bigamy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Torn between heart and home, he married a girl without the consent of his family. He hoped his parents would gradually come to terms with it. 																								But when things did not work out the way he had anticipated, he headed home, forsaking his wife and six-month-old son to marry a second time. 																								Two-timing cost him dear. On Tuesday, residents of Bidhan Palli, in the Regent Park police station area, on the southern fringes of the city, beat him up severely, before ransacking his house and handing him over to the local police.																								According to police, Siddhartha Basu, alias Pappu, had married Lily Khatun of Badamtala, in Sonarpur, about two years ago. His family did not accept Lily. So they tied the knot at the Kalighat temple, said an officer of the local police station.																								He lived elsewhere with his wife. But he was even more strongly attached to his family, and a couple of months ago, he returned home, the officer said. 																								Meanwhile, his wife Lily had given birth to a male child. But since his first visit to the family house in Bidhan Palli, he had been in constant touch with his people. His family members told him that they would accept him if he agreed to marry a girl of their choice. He gave in under pressure, the officer said. 																								When Lily came to know of Basus marriage, she went and pleaded with him and his family, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. When Basu and his family refused to accept her and pushed her out of the house on Tuesday morning, local people came to her rescue. First the mob tried to reason with him, but when Basu did not pay heed to their words, they dragged him out and beat him up severely, the officer added.																								Police rescued Basu but picked him up along with his parents and siblings. We arrested him on charges of bigamy and his family members were rounded up for cheating and conspiracy. The accused will be produced in court tomorrow. We have put up a police picket to maintain peace in the area, said superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, Debkumar Ganguly.																								Police said Basu did not marry Lily in court, but a few witnesses were present at the Kalighat temple during the marriage ceremony. It will not be difficult to prove that Basu had married Lily. Local people are ready to present themselves as witnesses in court. A DNA test of the child could also prove to be a vital point in the case, they said. 																								Swapan Roy Chowdhury, a neighbour, said everyone in the locality would ensure that justice was done. We will not allow the Basus to rest in peace. We have asked Lily to go to court, as in a recent high court order, marriages held in temples are valid in the eye of the law, Chowdhury said.

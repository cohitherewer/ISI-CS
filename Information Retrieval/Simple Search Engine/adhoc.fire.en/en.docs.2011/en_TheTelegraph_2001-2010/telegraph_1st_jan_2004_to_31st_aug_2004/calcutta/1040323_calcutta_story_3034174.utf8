 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 Life - Passing Through				 The crown connection
Neha Dhupia. Picture by Pabitra Das																								This time, Neha Dhupia was busy flaunting a crown not her own. But the beauty queen-turned-actress still seemed to love every moment in the spotlight, till the attention turned on her forthcoming filmi venture.Neha was in town on Monday to unveil this years coveted Miss India crowns. She has been enlisted by the designer, Tanishq, to show off the new creations to best advantage. The three crowns, positively dripping with diamonds and crystals, are in sync with the temperament of the modern Indian woman, gushed Neha, who sported the Miss India Universe crown in 2002.																								When the spotlight turned away from Neha the beauty-queen brand ambassador to Neha the actress her poise slipped a few inches. All eyes are now trained on her upcoming release Julie, in which she follows Kareenas Chameli footsteps. Its the story of a girl and how she goes on to become a prostitute, says Neha, on her fourth or fifth visit to the city which immediately makes her feel at home.																								While the publicity stills of Julie capture Neha posing draped in naught but a sheet, she reiterates that there are no steamy scenes in the film whatsoever. The protagonist here is very bold and the entire emotional gamut of the film is very beautiful, stresses Neha, who has previously starred in the no-starter Qayamat. Julie is set to release later this summer, possibly by June.																								Though she has more modelling credits to her name than films  with brands like Reebok, Pepsi, Gillette, Maruti and Mitsubishi Lancer under her belt  she feels that being before the camera brings out her creative side. But then, Bollywood just happened to her  just like it seems to have happened to just about every beauty queen around.																								Having discovered that acting can be stimulating, the pretty Neha wants to complete the experience by taking the most difficult plunge into theatre at some point. But its so time consuming! she sighs.																								With a lot of time on her hands Neha has been glued to the television for all of the India- Pakistan matches. I havent missed a single match so far, she says, flashing a wide smile. She is waiting with bated breath for Wednesdays face-off, and nothing could keep her away from the cricket on her TV set.

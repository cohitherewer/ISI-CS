 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Shop blaze kills duo
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A father and his son were burnt to death in their paint shop in Radhanath Choudhury Lane, Entally, on Friday morning. Local residents alleged the duo couldnt be saved as fire-fighters reached the spot an hour after being informed. The shop was reduced to ashes.																								The fire broke out around 8 am, when 62-year-old Sitaram Prasad Rai and 40-year-old Kameswar were cooking food in the shop, with the front door bolted from within.																								On seeing smoke billowing out of the shop, neighbours ran towards it, only to find that the door was locked from inside. They broke open the door and discovered that the shop was up in flames. 																								Because of the smoke and the blaze, we didnt realise that Sitaram and his son were inside, said Dharmendra Shaw, a neighbour. 																								Sitaram, he added, had been an employee of a private firm. He had set up the shop in his house after retiring from service. He brought his son Kameswar from Chhapra, in Bihar, to help him run the business. 																								The neighbours tried their best to douse the blaze. First, they splashed water. But it didnt help, as the fire was caused by a chemical substance. We then decided to use sand, neighbour Shaw said.																								Madhu Rai, another neighbour, said by the time the fire-fighters came, it was all over. The firemen could only retrieve the charred bodies.																								Fire services officials, however, denied the allegation, saying two of their engines had reached the spot in time. The blaze was small and the neighbours could have controlled it, they added.																								Deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Ranvir Kumar said Rais family in Bihar had been informed. We are investigating whether Rai had a licence to sell items such as paint, thinner and carbide. All these items are inflammable and hazardous. We will also inquire whether he had any clearance from the fire department.

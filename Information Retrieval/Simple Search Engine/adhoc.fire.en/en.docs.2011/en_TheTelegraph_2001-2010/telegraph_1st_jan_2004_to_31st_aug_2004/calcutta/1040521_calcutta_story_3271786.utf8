	Polling this year was quite disciplined in most areas what with the election commission not allowing party booths to be set up near polling stations and getting presiding officers to check the ID card of every voter. But a gross injustice caught the eye in many booths. Ailing and infirm citizens who had come to exercise their franchise were made to wait in the queue along with the others in the scorching sun or in the humid corridors. I suggest that a separate booth be provided at each polling centre for aged, ailing and physically challenged voters.

	Of late, many girls colleges have withdrawn the Higher Secondary courses and offer only graduate and post-graduate degrees. In the absence of an adequate number of girls schools in the city, many students are forced to enroll in a co-education institution against their wishes. They might find this inconvenient for various reasons. I appeal to the HS council to address the issue.

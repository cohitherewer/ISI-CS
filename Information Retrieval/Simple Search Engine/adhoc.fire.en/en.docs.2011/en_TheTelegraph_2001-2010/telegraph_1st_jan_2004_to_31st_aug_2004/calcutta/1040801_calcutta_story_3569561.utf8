The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 01, 2004 Life - Party Hopping Busy Bips breezes throughParty Hopping Bipasha at the Refuel counter at INOX, City Centre on Saturday afternoon.															 Strip and smooch all you want, Mallika, Neha Bips is boss, okay?																					That was the clamour from the crowd as Bipasha Basu breezed through two hotpsots at two ends of town on Saturday afternoon.																					So what if she was hardly recognisable, all covered up in full-sleeved pink top and grey jeans and as plain as the Jism Jane can possibly look? So what if she was sporting an unfamiliar fringe on her forehead and had mother in tow?																					The mere mention of Bipasha was enough. As word got around stealthily that the hottest export of Calcutta to Mumbai was to drop by for a soft-drink promotional, Forum got all fizzy and City Centre stopped in its tracks.																					Wherever Bipasha goes, a party begins. This was first proved at INOX, where a mob of about a hundred tripped over its feet to get close to lady long legs as she stormed the sixth floor. But even before onlookers could catch a good glimpse, she was whisked into a room amidst tight security.Five minutes later, Bipasha strode into the Refuel food counter, flashing a 1,000-watt smile, charming dimple in place and chucking cassettes into the crowd. Kamana sizzles at Cloud 9. Pictures by Rashbehari Das Bipasha, Bipasha, rose the shouts from cine-goers treated to a Saturday afternoon bonanza, however brief.																					Some thrust pieces of paper for autographs towards the Bengali babe, while others whipped out their cell phones to capture the magic moment.																					The early clicks were the only clicks as in the blink of her long-lashed eye, Bipasha was safely ensconced in beside her mother and rolling off to the next stop, City Centre.																					The mood at the Salt Lake hangout was more than electric long before Bipasha walked in. Rock band Fossils had gathered quite a crowd drumming out its chartbusters in the courtyard.																					The moment the lady stepped in, the crowd let out a roar and moved in for a clearer glimpse of the girl they called Bips.																					With quite a few fans hot on her heels, she scurried to secluded safety, only to resurface at the Refuel counter minutes later.Chilled out and in the mood to field queries, Bipasha said: I am always willing to work in Bengali films, but I must add that nothing substantial has come my way.																					The only letdown  Bipasha was supposed to pose in front of the ticket counters, too, but she left by the back door, leaving the crowd crying for more and the organisers stumped.																																														Lady Viking																					 Friday night saw Cloud 9, the resto-bar at The Astor, going in for a Bollywood binge. What with leggy lass Kamana Jethmalani, the item girl in Bombay Vikings Chhod do aanchal video, making herself at home at this night haunt. 																					In fact, regulars to this hip hangout on Shakespeare Sarani could well be getting used to seeing starlets sharing the dance-floor with them. It was Alesia Raut, the Meri beri ke ber girl who was at Cloud 9 last weekend, and on Friday night the guests got their fair share of stardom in flesh.  quot;Bollywood has been having fun this year with so many releases, and so are we, said general manager of the hotel Ravinder Kumar Palta. And the menu for the evening that had innovative dishes and cocktails named after Bollywood movies proved that the resto-bar was celebrating silver-screen spin offs in style. The lady of the night was all set to have some fun too, even as she hit the floor looking gorgeous in a short top and crimson minis. With moves that can bring any dance floor to a halt, this second year textile engineering student had the crowd swooning over her. 																					Dancing to hip-shaking numbers like Ishq kameena and Babuji zara dheere chalo, she ensured a mass adrenaline rush at the club. 																					I am a total dance freak and love to watch movies, specially Bollywood. So, I am also looking forward to some fun tonight along with these lovely Calcuttans, she said, even as she tuned into her own hit number and set the floor on fire. 																					Star-struck Calcutta was only too happy to have yet another pretty thing in its midst even as mobile phones aided with cameras worked overtime to click the dancing dame from various angles. 																					Kamana took all the adrenaline and the admiration, the ooooohs and the ogles in her stride in style. Some trademark jhatkas later, it was time to take a break for a chat. 																					Daughter of a transport owner, showbiz is something which just happened to Kamana by chance. We were shifting to a new house and I got some of my snaps clicked in my new house. The snaps came out well. I showed it to a friend of mine who happens to own a modelling agency. He insisted that I take part in the Miss Mumbai contest. I gave in reluctantly... I won the crown and the rest..., smiled Kamana. 																					The directors of Chhod do aanchal, Raj and Shruti, spotted her snaps in some magazine and in no time she was shooting for the video. 																					She swears by her vada pavs and paani puris, is a shopaholic and loves to pick up anything from skirts to sandals. On Friday night, she picked up fans by the dozens. But the question from the party people: Where was the aanchal, yaar? Reshmi Sengupta, Zeeshan Jawed Model Ria Mitra at the Mercedes show. Picture by Rashbehari Das Mercs rule ramp of maidensThe ballroom at the Hyatt Regency witnessed a fashion extravaganza with a difference on Friday night. What was unique about the show is that the best was saved for last. Just when the audience thought that the action on stage had come to an end, with the models having walked the ramp for four sequences, the screen behind the stage moved to make way for a swanky white Mercedes that glided on the ramp with elan. While the crowd was still gaping at the most gorgeous thing of the evening, two more Mercs, one black and the other maroon, appeared from either side of the stage. The occasion was the launch of the new Mercedes Benz C-Class Hypnotic and the crowd predictably comprised the Mercedes owners and potential buyers. City models including Pinky, Joy, Amrita, Ria (who also choreographed the show) and Priyanka Pal sashayed down the ramp in Western as well as ethnic creations by designer Abhishek Dutta.Table turner TushqaIt was time for some Mumbaiya ishytle music at Dublin on Friday night as DJ Tushqa took to the console at the Bacardi Night celebrations. He gave the citys party animals a taste of his remixes, which according to him are what the people would love. I am very particular about my crowd. I always keep their taste in mind. I dont believe in dishing out my own favourites. I play whatever is acceptable to the people who pay and come to dance to some good music, said the DJ from Mumbai. So he churned out some familiar tunes as he tried to catch the pulse of the party-hopper after a three-year break from the city. But the break hasnt done him much harm  he sure sent the happy crowd back home happier.Party poopersWhere have all the women gone? The citys party circuit seems to be missing out on one vital component  the F factor. On Friday night, at a packed house in a nightclub, we saw six men on the wrong side of 30 hitting the dance floor all by themselves and matching steps with each other. A quick look around and we spotted the glaring gap: four males to one female. Sad, naa?

 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Fire frown on schools
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After market complexes, its the turn of Montessories to find themselves in the line of fire. Failure to adhere to fire-safety norms has forced the government to turn the heat on all educational institutions, especially Montessori schools and crches.																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee on Friday issued a stern note asking educational institutions to submit detailed information to his office by August 31.																								We have identified two Montessori schools in north Calcutta where kids are at risk. We will close them down if the authorities do not change the present set-up immediately, said the minister.																								For it to be equipped to fight a fire, every educational institution must ensure that:There are at least two exits to every classroomExits are unobstructedExits and corridors are adequately illuminated; lobby approach and staircases are ventilated and illuminatedAll teaching and non-teaching staff members know how to use extinguishers;Width of the staircases is not less than 1.5 metres and distance from any point to the nearest exit or staircase not in excess of 22.5 metresStaircases are not used for storageIf there is a kitchen, it is at a fair distance from the main school building. No temporary structure is used as a kitchenElectrical wiring is tested regularlyThere is one attendant for every 100 childrenChemistry laboratories have professionally qualified people to handle spillage; chemicals are preserved in sealed containers and kept isolated.																								If the schools do not adopt the norms, we will take stern action, which means eventually closing them down with the help of the school education department, warned minister Chatterjee.

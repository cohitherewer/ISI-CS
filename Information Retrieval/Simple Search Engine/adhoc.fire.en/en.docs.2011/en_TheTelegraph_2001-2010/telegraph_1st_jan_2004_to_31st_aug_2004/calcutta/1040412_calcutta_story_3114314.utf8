The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Womens panel block for abuse case probe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police investigation into the sex, abuse and videotape case suffered a jolt on Sunday. 																								The state womens commission, controlled by the ruling CPM, stepped into the picture and all but asked the sleuths to stop interrogating the 26-year-old woman, whose husband wanted her to help him make pornographic films.																								S.K. Nayar was arrested from his Dum Dum Park residence on April 3 for torturing his wife, employed with a non-government organisation (NGO) that works with sex workers and counsels students engaged in flesh trade.																								Police said they had stumbled on some information, for which the interrogation of Nayars wife was essential. But, the womens commission has asked us not to grill her for information. So, we will have to be soft and restrained with her. But we believe that only by intensely interrogating her will we get to the bottom of the case, said Sitaram Sinha, officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station.																								Nayars wife, escorted by her Chennai-based father and a colleague, had met womens commission chairperson Jasodhara Bagchi at her office last Friday.																								We received a call from the commission and were asked not to harass Nayars wife, admitted an official of Lake Town police station. 																								However, the police feel theres more to the case than meets the eye. When the woman came to us with complaints about being tortured by her husband, we thought it was a typical case. But, during investigation, we found that Nayar had set up an NGO himself and demanded Rs 20 lakh from his wife to launch a business. How could he have demanded such a hefty amount when shes been working for a year-and-a-half only? asked a sleuth on the case. 																								The investigators said the NGO where Nayars wife worked had been contacted, too, but officials there were behaving in a peculiar manner and not cooperating with the probe.																								 When Metro met the director of the NGO, he said: Why are you spending so much time on this particular case?. There is nothing in it. Also, we will not speak on this score. 																								The director refused to divulge where Nayars wife is now. The police have questioned her at least four times since April 2 and can contact her only when she visits her residence at Dum Dum Park, he asserted.																								Police, meanwhile, have handed over to her some articles, including a television, a tape-recorder and a motorcycle, that she claimed in her complaint had been bought with her money. She claimed that the articles were bought by her and she wanted them back. So, we handed them back to her, said Lake Town officer-in-charge Sinha.																								An associate of Nayar, who accompanied him to the police station, said his friend had been falsely accused. I feel his wife was gradually getting involved in some illegal activities. When Nayar objected, she slapped charges of torture on him. It appears she has plenty of things to hide, he said, without disclosing his identity.

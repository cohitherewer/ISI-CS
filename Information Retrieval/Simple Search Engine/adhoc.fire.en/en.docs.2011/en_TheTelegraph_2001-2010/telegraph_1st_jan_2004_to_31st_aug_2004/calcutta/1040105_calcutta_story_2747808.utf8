																								Sure there is music even in the beauty and the silent note which Cupid strikes, far sweeter than the sound of an instrument. For there is music where ever there is a harmony, order, or proportion: and thus far we may maintain the music of the spheres... Sir Thomas Browne																								Music is inherent in nature and forms an intrinsic part of our existence, be it in the form of humming and twittering of bees and birds, in the blowing of the wind, rustling of leaves, sound of rain, thunderous sky, sea waves thrashing against hard rocks.... However, we destroy this natural rhythm with our cacophony and, in the process, lose our peace of mind and rush to nature again to seek solace. Chhanda Bharatis musical programme Avijan aims to provide a soothing balm to highly-charged, jet-set people with frayed nerves. The production incorporates not only elements of Indian classical and Western music, but other art forms including dance, poetry, painting etc. Avijans concept, script, recitation and choreography is by Manjusri Roy Chowdhury. Music by Chandan Roy Chowdhury. Pandit Manilal Nag will be felicitated for his invaluable contribution to Indian classical music. 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Quarrel mars Bar conclave
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Two groups of lawyers nearly came to blows at Calcutta High Court at a meeting of the Bar Association over Wednesdays ceasework, called by the West Bengal Bar Association to protest the proposed Block-level Pre-Litigation Conciliation Board Bill.																								Sardar Amjad Ali, association president, said it was at the discretion of individual advocates to attend or stay away from the high court and all the other 201 courts elsewhere in Bengal, in view of the call by the state Bar Council to cease work on Wednesday to protest the proposed Bill. 																								It is believed that work at the high court and its subordinate courts will be severely affected, as most of 26,000-odd advocates have already ranged themselves against the proposed Bill.																								They (the Bar Council) have requested us to abstain  we may do so or choose to attend the courts, said Ali, angering some members who wanted the association to adopt a resolution asking all its members to abstain from the courts on Wednesday.																								Members of the Democratic Lawyers Association, an organisation of left lawyers, took advantage of the situation and came out in support of the presidents move. 																								Immediately thereafter, lawyers belonging to the Congress began to shout slogans. 																								The association president was forced to conclude the meeting without taking any resolution, amidst shouts and scuffles.

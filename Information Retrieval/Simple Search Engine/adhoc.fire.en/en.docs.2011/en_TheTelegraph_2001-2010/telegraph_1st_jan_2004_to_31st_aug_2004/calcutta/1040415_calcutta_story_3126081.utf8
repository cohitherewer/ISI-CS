The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 15, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Emma Thompson The sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars guide you. You have a commanding personality, a logical mind and an interest in the arts. You are intelligent and have a good memory. You appear arrogant and imposing, but you can sacrifice anything to help people. Criticism affects you as you tend to take it to heart. Be careful with your spending.  Kusum Bhandari

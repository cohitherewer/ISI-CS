The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Adnan, the pied piper, is here
 Adnan Sami is a name to reckon with in the world of music, a name that needs no introduction. In a very short time he has carved a formidable niche for himself. His music is complete in every sense; it has a melody that ensnares, an instrumentation that enthralls and a voice that enchants. He has given classical music a new touch, a new face that appeals to the masses and classes alike. Classical music has seldom found an audience so diverse. This romantic crooner, synonymous with songs like Tera chehra and Kabhi to nazar milao, is in town to mesmerise music lovers with renditions of his soulful numbers. Calcuttans have something to look forward to this Valentines Day with the man playing cupid and belting out music that will surely touch a chord in every heart.																								Event: A musical evening with Adnan Sami																								When: Today at 5.30 pm																								Where: Salt Lake Stadium

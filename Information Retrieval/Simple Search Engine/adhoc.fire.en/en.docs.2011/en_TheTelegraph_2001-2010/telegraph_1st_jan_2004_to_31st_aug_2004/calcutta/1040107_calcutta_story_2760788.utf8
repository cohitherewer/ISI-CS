The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Just a degree to dip for cold wave 
 OUR BUREAU																								Twenty-four hours after crowning Monday the seasons first cold day, the weather office stopped just short of officially announcing a cold wave in the city and its adjoining areas.																								The minimum temperature plummeted to 9.4 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal, at Alipore. At Dum Dum, the minimum temperature was pegged at 8.6 degrees Celsius.																								If the minimum temperature is five degrees or more below normal, we declare a cold wave, said a weather official, recounting how the minimum temperature had dipped to 9.3 degrees on January 22, 2003, during a cold wave.																								The mid-day sun broke free of the fog after fighting shy for 48 hours and shone brightly through afternoon, pushing up the maximum temperature from 15.7 degrees on Monday to 19.1 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, still a good eight degrees below normal.																								There will be some let-up in the chill factor if the sun shines brightly during the day. But I cannot promise too much respite, because the cold wind continues to blow from the northern part of the country, said K.K. Chakraborty, director of the weather section at Alipore.																								The morning did not exactly show the day, as a foggy overcast sky and cold winds blowing at about five kph greeted early risers. The fog over the city airport foiled air-traffic movement till 9 am. Only the flight to Port Blair managed to leave Calcutta before the fog descended. Fourteen morning flights were held up for two hours due to poor visibility. 																								The fog over Delhi added to the delay, with the morning flights from the Capital arriving five hours behind schedule. In the evening, three flights to Delhi were cancelled.																								Weather officials said the cold and foggy condition would continue for the next couple of days, with the minimum temperature pegged at around 10 degrees Celsius. Also, there is very little moisture in the upper air circulation  hovering 3,000 ft and above from ground level  leaving little chance of rain in the next couple of days.

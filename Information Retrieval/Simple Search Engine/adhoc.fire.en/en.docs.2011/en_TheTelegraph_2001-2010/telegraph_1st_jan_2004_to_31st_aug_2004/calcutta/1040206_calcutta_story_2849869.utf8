The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 06, 2004  Photographs amp; memories
 The character of Dalhousie Square  has changed dramatically and mercantile houses have new rulers.  But Raj nostalgia lives on, says Soumitra Das  Writers Buildings: Witness to colonial past  While memories can vividly reconstruct  the past by stringing together wispy remembrances recalled  from oblivion, they have a way of glossing over unpleasant  and unsavoury details. Imagination often embroiders plain  truths of the past, giving rise to phenomena like Raj nostalgia. Raj nostalgia could mean working  under white bosses. Nestled in a sofa in her Beniapukur  flat, Charlotte Winifred Hinton waxes eloquent about those  were the days  the Fifties  when she would catch the  ladys tram  a boneshaker with a sniffer compartment  for men  and Mrs Lewis of Calcutta Telephones would stand  on the footboard shouting utar jao at any man who  had the temerity to hop into it. Her one-time office in  India Exchange Place behind Writers is now a mass of gutted  masonry and twisted steel. The punters, who used to quote  share prices at the tops of their voices, have all fled  the coops they occupied, and the ground floor of the building  next to the former StandardChartered headquarters on Netaji  Subhas Road has turned into an eatery extending to the street. Music could feed nostalgia. 1  Garstin Place, where All India Radio was born, is now a  glass box, quite pseudo-classical. But No 5 is dilapidated,  yet crammed with offices. Overlooking as it does Job Charnocks  tomb, one can imagine why the demolished AIR station had  a reputation for being haunted. Bulbul Sarkar, now in her  70s, whose conversations with Satyajit Ray on Beethoven  and the auteurs favourite music are still broadcast, had  joined AIR, Calcutta, in 1958.  With tremendous clarity she recalls  the celebrated musicians from Benjamin Britten and Yehudi  Menuhin to soprano Leontyne Price and pianist Rosalind Tureck,  whose performances were often broadcast live when they performed  in the city, and not infrequently at the AIR studio. Sarkar  would occasionally seek help from Birendra Krishna Bhadra  and Banikumar, without whose crack-of-dawn radio programme  Mahishasuramardini no Durga Puja is complete. In  1958, Akashvani shifted to its new station and I went with  coolies carrying cupboards filled with 78 rpms in the middle  of the afternoon. Distance does add charm.  Taste buds could bring back the  past in a flash. Bhaskar Mitter, first Indian to head Andrew  Yule and later CESC, rewinds to the Forties and quick office  lunches at Pelitis where companies had reserved tables.  The menu was fried bekti, saddle of lamb and ice cream.  The table linen snow white. It being the hub of the business  world, only Londons Oxford Street could rival the sophistication  of the shops here. At Hamiltons all the workmen were Bengali  and they could produce perfect imitations of jewellery in  vogue in London. Apart from the Birlas, the great Marwari  businessmen still operated from their Burrabazar gaddis. Perfumes, too, have the power  of recall. Barin Roy, whose living quarters and chamber  have been in Waterloo Street since the Fifties, says back  in those days, Great Eastern, not the Grand, was the hotel  to be seen in. Scents as heady as those that greeted ones  nose on the Metro cinema pavement, hung like a mist in the  Great Eastern lounge. The scents that emanated from the  hotels bakery were equally compelling. Roy, orthodontist  to the citys culturati, dubs Dacres Lane Khaibar Pass,  a pun on the eateries that cram the lane, and where Chittadas  stews and fish rolls have become an institution. Nostalgia could mean a scintillating  nightlife. Calcuttas first European-style hotel to be centrally  air-conditioned, was Spences (1830-1974). It had been taken  over by the family of Vien Singh, better known as a dress  designer, in 1951-52. Its AC plant came from a ship. It  had a ballroom. The hotels agent in London would organise  the floorshows and cabarets. There was a lot of competition.  At no given time was there no entertainment. On any day,  particularly Saturdays, people would do the rounds and end  up at the Golden Slipper, the only nightclub open till 6  am. If you missed the floorshow at Princes you could catch  up at Scheherezade. The clientele was wealthy Jews, Armenians,  bhadra Bengalis, more Western than Indian, conservative  Bengalis without wives, with mistresses or girlfriends.  Karnani Mansion used to be a love nest. Up to the late Fifties,  the bands and crooners were all imported. Calcutta was the  last fleshpot of the East. But having money didnt give  you entre into society. The hotel is a bank now.  Little wonder the common man would  gawp. Madan Mohan Seal, who had joined what is now HSBC  Bank in 1952 at age 20 and went to work in the shirt-dhoti  uniform, walked from his Kidderpore home to Dalhousie to  look at the lights after World War II ended and again in  1947 to usher in Independence. The bank still has the marble  tables and balusters he talks about, though the look is  corporate. I was wonderstruck by the city.  Dalhousie Square was a beautiful garden. The water of the  tank was crystal clear, says P.T. Nair of the time when  he arrived by tram from Howrah Station, on September 22,  1955, a penniless young man from his Kerala village. Hopping  from one job to the other in offices around Dalhousie, he  would explore the city by tram during lunch breaks and thereby  became acquainted with each city building. One understands why Nair was bowled  over when one passes by the gracious Raj Bhavan staff quarters  opposite the main entrance. The beautiful faade is deceptive  for the cubbyholes around their courtyards are occupied  by the drivers and menial staff. But the colonnaded suites  with balconies overlooking the street are quite princely,  never mind the drapes of synthetic fibres.  At Carritt Morans on RN Mookerjee  Road (the name is the only reminder of Bengali entrepreneurship)  they are still very pucca. P.K. Sen, chairman and managing  director, said the front of the building is 150 years old.  Sit-down lunches are meant for the managerial staff and  during auctions they have to wear a tie and a jacket, whatever  the weather. Tea is very traditional. The Marwari community has made  Calcutta its home and it rules the mercantile houses of  Dalhousie. I met former tea king B.M. Khaitan in his office  on the top floor of 4 Mangoe Lane, a name redolent of vanished  orchards. The Eveready chief has a name for being sensitive  to heritage issues and he came down like a ton of bricks  on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for defacing the beautiful  Square by indiscriminately planting billboards. Said Khaitan:  Hoardings are destroying the character of the city. The  loss of revenue could be made up by other means. Remove  hoardings from Chowringhee and Dalhousie.

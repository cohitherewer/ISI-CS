				 	SAURAB BASU																									Saurab Basu																									Is how this young man describes himself. Saurabs interests are two-fold, but in completely diverse fields  robotics and archaeology. And hes determined to marry the two, by applying computing techniques to advanced archaeology. The 20-year-old is already building his dream project  a robot that can drill underground to discover the unexplored.																									Is what the boy from Dum Dum says, for he believes that artificial intelligence is the way forward. And thats the technology hes using to find a way to dig up ancient sites that remain hidden under layers of soil. While robotics was always a fascination, visiting Clive House near his home several times as a child kindled his interest in all things old and lost. 																									Is an understatement for the member of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, who was selected for a conference on robotics in New Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA, in November 2002. To make the cut, he had to submit a paper and then do a convincing presentation on the interaction between humans and robots.																									Is what this coin collector hopes to penetrate, after inventing the hardware and software for a robot that digs deep. And the first stop for the final year computer applications student of BP Poddar Institute of Management and Technology will be the ancient fortress at Chandraketugarh, near Barasat, which still lies buried.																									Is what Saurab does, be it with academics in California through the Internet, or officials of the Archaeological Survey of India. But thats all part of the hobby he says, as is writing research papers on various sites in West Bengal about the height of a mound at Dum Duma dhipi or soil formation in Athghora, South 24-Parganas. 																									And much more is his love for archaeology, although a career in computers is what he prefers. And although Saurab hasnt yet managed the funds for his beloved project, hes going it alone, slowly but surely, till he makes the dream a reality.

 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Cancer scare turns resident wrath on hospice 
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Weeks after opening a hospice in Narendrapur for terminally-ill patients and destitutes, Somasree Roy learnt the hard way on Sunday that Calcutta has no room for Samaritans. 																								Roy is secretary of non-government organisation Friends Foundation of India (FFA).																								Driven out of Modern Park in Santoshpur, the FFA had recently opened a hospice for cancer patients at Karbala, in Narendrapur, South 24-Parganas. 																								In a rerun of the Santoshpur ouster, around 100 activists of the Trinamul Congress and the CPM stormed the Karbala hospice on Sunday. 																								Their demand: It has to be shut down, since the disease would spread in the neighbourhood.																								After being ousted from Santoshpur, Roy had scouted in vain for land in the adjoining localities. She then moved to Narendrapur to set up the 10-bed hospice. At present, two destitute women in their 60s  disabled by age, not cancer  are lodged there. 																								To muster public support, we first spoke to political leaders and then organised blood donation camps. We have also started an outdoor clinic. But all our hard work came to a nought, said a depressed Roy, herself a cancer survivor.																								Police said the mob, led by constable Nazrul Islam, told Roy that she could not keep patients at the hospice. We are all educated people, living here for years. We cannot let you bring in old patients. They will die soon and you have to carry the bodies out, which will not look nice, one of the protesters reportedly told Roy.																								For several hours, Roy sat with them, trying to explain that cancer is not contagious. 																								We even told them we dont have a single cancer patient now, but they wouldnt listen. The two women, whom we rescued in a precarious condition from Imambara Hospital, in Hooghly, have nowhere to go, Roy added.																								A hapless Roy then contacted Rajesh Subarno, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. Subarno acted immediately. He identified the constable and warned him of dire consequences. 																								I have asked her not to quit the place. We will convene a meeting there and try to dispel false notions about cancer, Subarno said. All of us should back Roys project. 																								Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee could not be contacted, since she is out of town. 																								The incident has taken place at a time when cancer is wreaking havoc in Bengal and very few people are coming forward to provide the patients with what they need most  care.																								According to modest estimates, 65,000 new cancer cases are reported every year from across the state. Around 25,000 patients reach the terminal stage of the disease within a year of detection, and several thousands die without any treatment.																								In December 2003, Roy was forced to move out of Modern Park after local residents gheraoed the hospice, alleging that it was spreading cancer in the locality. Almost all senior CPM leaders were asked for help. Still, we had to move out. This time, I am at my wits end, Roy said. 																								The incidents at Modern Park and Karbala have been criticised by all quarters, especially the Indian Medical Association (IMA), which has launched a fresh campaign to educate people about myths surrounding diseases. This is definitely an unfortunate incident and must be stopped, said Moloy Patra, secretary of IMAs Bengal branch.

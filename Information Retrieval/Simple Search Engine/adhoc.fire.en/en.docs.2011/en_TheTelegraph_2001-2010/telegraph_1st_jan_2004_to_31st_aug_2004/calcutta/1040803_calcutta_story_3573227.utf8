 															- JOINT INITIATIVE PLAN TO CHECK MALARIA MARCH A STAFF REPORTER																								The winged menace is back. And nothing but a joint fight by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the state can ward off the threat, feels mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 																								So, he talked to municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya about an integrated mosquito control programme in Calcutta and all municipal areas within a 10-km radius of the CMC jurisdiction.																								I stressed the importance of a joint mosquito control drive at the state-level meetings on malaria control, said the mayor. Minister Bhattacharya agreed. We are working on a proposal to ask the civic authorities to develop their own mosquito-control infrastructure. This will help both Calcutta and its suburbs, he added.																								Surface drains and sanitary chambers in the town areas are teeming with mosquito larvae and, hence, a mass awareness campaign should top the priority list,said senior CMC entomologist Debasis Biswas. 																								It is impossible to control mosquitoes from breeding merely by using larvicides, as adult mosquitoes are invading Calcutta daily from Salt Lake, Sonarpur, Howrah, Baranagar, Behala, Jadavpur, Madurdaha and Kalikapur, mayor Mukherjee said on Monday. 																								Officer on special duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee said: Since mosquito-control activities are almost nil in the municipal areas, more adult mosquitoes of various species enter the city daily in the evening than the larvae killed in the day. He continued: Together with the mosquito menace, indoor air pollution in the city has increased alarmingly due to rampant use of coils, mats and liquid repellents. 																								According to preliminary estimates, city households release more than 80.5 tonnes of gaseous pollutants in the ambient air daily. Substances emitted by burning mosquito coils and mats are carcinogenic and affect the health of poor households more, as they live in ill-ventilated houses. 																								About half the citys population lives in slums, pointed out mayor Mukherjee. 																								Officer on special duty Mukherjee said the carbon monoxide released by a burning coil or mosquito mat reacts with the haemoglobin in the blood and forms carboxyhaemoglobin, that leads to oxygen deficiency. Besides, mosquito coils emit a number of nitro compounds, that have serious effects on health. These compounds, sour in taste, cause dizziness, nausea and irritation in the eyes. 																								CMC entomologist Biswas said a compound found in the emission of a mosquito coil is carcinogenic. The neuro-toxin used in a mat has serious, long-lasting ill-effects on health.

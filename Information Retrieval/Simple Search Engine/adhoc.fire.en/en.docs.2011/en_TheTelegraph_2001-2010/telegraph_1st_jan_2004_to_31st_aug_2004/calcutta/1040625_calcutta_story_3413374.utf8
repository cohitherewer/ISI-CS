 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 (From left): Joydeb Bain, 51, and Krishnapada Sarkar, 44, both Group-D employees at Writers Buildings, savour their Madhyamik success. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Over three decades after dropping out of school, Joydeb Bain, 51, on Thursday managed to clear his Madhyamik exam. 																								It was third time lucky for this Group-D peon in the finance department at Writers Buildings, whose feat was appreciated by finance minister Asim Dasgupta himself.																								When you have turned to studies at your age, you must clear Higher Secondary, too. I want to see you earn your bachelors degree, Dasgupta told the beaming peon of his department, who scored 343 marks, with a score of 55 in English, from Madhyamgram BPC High School.																								My wife doesnt give me much money. Here, buy yourself sweets with this.., Dasgupta told Bain, handing him Rs 50. Dasgupta also offered to help Bain with his lessons. 																								Another Group-D employee, Krishnapada Sarkar, 44, was so impressed by Bains diligence that he, too, took the Madhyamik exam. Though he studied hard, he did not dare to sit for the exam for two years, fearing failure. 																								This year, I was confident and decided to write it, says Sarkar, a picture of composure. 																								Arriving at Writers Buildings on Thursday, he checked his result on the Internet with the help of a colleague. 																								After finding that he had secured 404 marks, the Class VIII dropout went to his school to get his marksheet. 																								Bain had left school while in Class IX, following his fathers death. I couldnt study for want of money. Now that I can spend a little more, I thought it was a good time to give it another try, he said. 																								To prepare for his exam, this portly grandfather sought the help of his wife and daughter, both of whom are educated. He was also helped by colleagues.

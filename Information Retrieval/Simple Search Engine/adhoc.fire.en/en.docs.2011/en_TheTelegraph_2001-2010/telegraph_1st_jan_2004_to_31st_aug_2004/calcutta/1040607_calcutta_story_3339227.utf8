 PAPER CHASE: Tax-payers queue up for forms to file returns. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySailen Bhattacharya: The format of the forms for filing tax returns is a bit complex. Is it possible to change the format or get help from your department to fill it up?																																																													I admit that the earlier return deposit form was a bit complex. But now, we have introduced a one-page tax return form, known as Saral. I am sure one can easily fill it up and the help of a professional will not be required. Still, if you find it difficult, contact our public relations department officials for assistance. They will guide you to fill up the form.

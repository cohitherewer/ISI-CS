 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Minor hiccups in ballot beat
																								I went to vote at my local Jadavpur polling station with my husband Kaushik at around 11 am. We had to wait for about half-an-hour in the long queue, which would have moved faster had the officials been a bit more alert. But the atmosphere was very nice, as its a friendly neighbourhood and there was a community feeling. I met several people I had not seen in a long time, which was nice. It was all very peaceful and smooth. The issue most important to me is national stability. Churni Ganguly,
actor																								I voted at about 9.30 am, along with my mother and wife, after a 45-minute wait, at my local polling station in Tollygunge. There were a few hiccups with peoples ID cards. It would, perhaps, have been faster and easier if there had been electronic ID cards. The atmosphere was jovial. The officials wouldnt check my card, and several people wanted to have a chat. I voted to exercise my right and to prevent my vote from being illegally used. I dont think about issues any more, because politicians have lost credibility.  Sabyasachi Chakraborty,
actor																								I went around 1.30 pm with my family to Lake Girls School. It was rather crowded and I had to wait for at least 20 minutes. What surprised me was the long queue in front of one room, while there was none in front of another. So, I think, the distribution could have been better. Security seemed adequate. I wouldnt like to say what I considered before casting my vote, since its a personal matter. But I voted because it concerns my land and country. Nabaneeta Dev Sen, 
author																								I went with my family to the polling centre at Wahed Memorial School, near Broad Street, around 12.30 pm. I didnt have to wait for too long, since the booth was quite empty. It has always been a trouble-free affair at our booth and today was no exception. The venue could have been better, though, since the school isnt very clean or well-maintained. Im neither much aware politically nor interested in details about the candidates and parties. There is so much corruption. I voted simply because I feel its my duty as a citizen. Sharbari Dutta,

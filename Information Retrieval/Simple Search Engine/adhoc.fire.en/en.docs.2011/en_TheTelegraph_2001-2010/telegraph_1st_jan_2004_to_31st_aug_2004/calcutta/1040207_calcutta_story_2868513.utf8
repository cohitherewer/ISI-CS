 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Mayor favours speed, minister in no hurry
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants to rid the city of trams. Ditto, mayor Subrata Mukherjee. Only transport minister Subhas Chakraborty sees several impediments, including monetary, to put in place Bhattacharjees ambitious plans of a faster mass transit system. 																								On Friday, minister Chakraborty, though all for speed, averred that Calcutta has the countrys best public transport system. The chief minister wants an overall improvement in the transport system, and the government has already taken steps towards that. What Bhattacharjee said yesterday was an expression of an ambitious vision. But first, we have to get rid of the hurdles in implementing that vision, he said.																								Asked if he supported scrapping the present fleet of vehicles, Chakraborty said: In a city where faster forms of transport must co-exist and compete with slow-moving vehicles, it is natural for the faster to take over. It is going to be a case where only the fittest will survive.																								He said a company from Denmark had submitted a proposal on Friday for setting up a monorail system. Several proposals have been forwarded to the chief minister. We must plan for the future, but not in a hurry.																								Minister Chakraborty was of the opinion that Calcuttans are averse to speed, which is reflected in the speedbreaking humps erected every time on every spot that a road mishap takes place. But speedbreakers alone cannot avert mishaps. I, myself, am all for speed, he added.																								Mayor Mukherjee, on a visit to Writers Buildings for a meeting with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, was delighted that the chief minister saw eye-to-eye with him on the need to rid the city of trams. 																								Mukherjee felt trams could be retained in some pockets, but only for their heritage value. Even bullock-carts have heritage value, but can they be used as public transport? he asked. On Rabindra Sarani and Mahatma Gandhi Road, at Park Circus and Gariahat, trams have become a menace, causing sound pollution and slowing down other vehicles, the mayor said. 																								He differed with the chief ministers views on scrapping buses, though. Instead, he expressed his keenness to harness the hawkers, taxis and autorickshaws. There must be at least 26 per cent of road space in a city. In Calcutta, we have barely six per cent. If hawkers take up the roads, where will people walk? Mukherjee asked. He rued the spurt in illegal rickshaws and autos, and the proliferation of licences being offered for taxis.

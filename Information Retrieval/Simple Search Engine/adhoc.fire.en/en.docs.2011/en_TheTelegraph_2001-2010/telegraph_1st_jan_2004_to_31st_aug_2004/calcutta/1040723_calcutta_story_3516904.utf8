The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 A battle against eyesores for a pretty city
 A STAFF REPORTER Teams being quizzed at Crossword. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								It was a quiz, with Calcutta as the topic, from history to geography. The venue was Crossword, the participants were some of the citys best quizzers and the audience comprised a gathering of illustrious names and customers at the bookstore. Street names to newspaper headlines, they were all on the question list.																								The contest was organised by SKAPE (Shaping Kolkatas Aesthetic and Physical Environment), a fledgling NGO, to improve the look of the city.																								The quiz, entitled qSKAPE, was their first event to bring about awareness about the topic. Hence, the evening began with the screening of the film Oh Calcutta by Creative Arts, and the event was punctuated by eco and heritage tips, like Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC (People United for Better Living in Calcutta) offering advice on what to do when a tree is being illegally cut.																								The organisation comprises 12 artists, architects, interior designers, graphic designers and others  some of them not even Calcuttans but based in the city for the time being. Their goal is to make people aware of their surroundings, and do something to improve the environment.																								We are essentially hiring out our services for free for community projects, and to get corporate houses to fund the projects, explains Gita Balakrishnan, an architect. On the anvil to begin with are street furniture, including bus shelters, toilets, gardens and other public spaces. 																								A bus shelter project has already been approved for funding by TATA Steel, but even applying for the land and getting it free of cost from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation involves a long process, adds Usha Ramaswamy.																								In the works at the moment, is a book on participatory planning, which will include citizens rights and responsibilities in the urban context, so that people can go about righting wrongs.																								The objective of the entire exercise is to make Calcuttans observe, question, reason and eventually participate in the planning processes of the physical city, because people are often unaware of what happens. We get to know about things long after they start, like the New Market underground car park project, by when it is too late to do anything, observes Balakrishnan.																								The group, a planning and implementation forum to make a difference to the built environment of the city, is working in tandem with PUBLIC, Concern for Calcutta and others.																								All we want is to improve the citys look, to make it more compatible with its intellectual and cultural traditions, before it is too late, sums up architect Anindya Basu.

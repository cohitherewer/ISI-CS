 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Ramsar map row rests
 JAYANTA BASU																								Even as the East Calcutta Wetlands are readying for a major facelift, a controversy over the map of this Ramsar site has blown over. 																								Peter Bridgewater, Ramsar Bureau secretary-general, has written to Subir Ghosh of the International Union for the Conservation of Natural Resources of Flora and Fauna: Ramsar has the authenticated map of the East Calcutta Wetlands. The authenticated map is with us, as well as with the Government of India. Its also available in public domain. 																								Denying the allegation that the wetlands had been accorded Ramsar site status without a map, Bridgewater has asserted that the Ramsar bureau didnt recognise any site without a proper map.																								A section of environment department officials have been trying to change the wetlands map on the grounds that the site doesnt have one recognised by Ramsar. 																								The green lobby has been vocal against the attempt, as it fears that any change in the map will only allow land sharks to sink their teeth into this vast stretch of watery green  off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, between Chingrihata and Ambedkar Bridge. 																								The stretch is now out of bounds for developers, thanks to a court order passed 12 years ago, declaring it a no-development zone and a waste-recycling region. 																								Urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, too, has confirmed there is no confusion over the map. The map, upheld by Justice Umesh Chandra Banerjee of Calcutta High Court in 1992, still stands, he said. The issue had been referred to Bhattacharya, who heads the executive committee of the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee, the highest authority to oversee planning in the metropolitan area. 																								The map, covering the entire 12,500-hectare waterbody, was drawn in 1985 under a state planning board project. Following the court approval, an effort was undertaken in 1995 to demarcate the mouzas. A more detailed map of the site was prepared and cleared by the director of the Institute of Wetlands Management and Ecological Design. 																								The map was examined by the Survey of India and the Union environment ministry, before it was sent to the Ramsar bureau, said a ministry official from Delhi. 																								State environment officials are now claiming that whatever changes were made to the map, were in the way of adding a few areas to the wetlands.

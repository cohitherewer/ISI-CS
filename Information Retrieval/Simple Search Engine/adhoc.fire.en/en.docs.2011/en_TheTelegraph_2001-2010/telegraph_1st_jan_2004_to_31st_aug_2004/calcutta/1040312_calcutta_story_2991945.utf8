The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 12, 2004 Was it really that green?
Three decades after the construction of Metro Railway, Chowringhee faces a new upheaval as a flyover comes up off Park Street, says Soumitra Das What if the Park Street flyover under construction goes awry like the half-finished one in Kidderpore and it is left to fester in the middle of Chowringhee? Would it turn into a makeshift bazaar as it has on the road leading to Garden Reach? This stretch of the thoroughfare, that begins deep north in Chitpur and was once the straight and narrow to Kalighat, is being mauled for the second time in the past three decades.As in many other neighbourhoods of Calcutta, the pavement on the Maidan side has been erased and a huge swathe of the road has been dug up, leaving no space for pedestrians, who should consider themselves lucky if the wheels of vehicles rushing past havent turned them into pulp by the time they have managed to negotiate the stretch. The trail of mist over the Maidan has turned into a pall of dust. The forgotten tank at the Park Street crossing is now meant exclusively for the ablutions of people who live on the street and labourers. The garden and walk on its peripheries is a forest of weeds and plastic bags. All this for a flyover from Sudder Street up to Kanak Building that will levitate a handful of cars for a couple of seconds across the chaos underneath and then dump them back into the maelstrom of vehicles.In living memories, however, Chowringhee or Jawaharlal Nehru Road survives as a road lined with stately buildings, mainly residential, and the Maidan as parkland for promenades. Keya Kullar born in 1942 lived at No 42 next to the Darbhanga Maharajas palace, both houses being part of the zamindars estate next to Tata Centre. Her father was D.N. Mukerji, one-time Congress leader and founder of the United Bank of India. During the communal riots, they were compelled to seek refuge in the neutral territory of Chowringee.In the Forties, when my father rented the house, it was taller than the maharajas palace. He had to promise he would never look down at the ranis, says Kullar, who moved to Delhi after the house was destroyed in 1994-45. The Ezras, the famous Jewish moneybags, were the original owners of these two houses. She, like hundreds of other Calcuttans, remembers the two charming turrets on the roof that gave it the look of a giant salt shaker.Then the Metro happened and trees were felled. Before that, her house commanded an unbroken view of Fort William, and she could see her yet-to-be husband walk down the swarded Maidan from that citadel to woo her. All that remains of the building is the zamindars piscine insignia on the gate.Jayasree De is a professor of geography at MS University in Vadodara now, but she spent a good part of her childhood in Chowringhee from 1953 to 66. Des father was a doctor and like many others in his profession he had a liking for this neighbourhood. Many of these chambers have survived, some with such high ceilings one can grow neem trees in them. She remembers dignitaries passing by within handshaking distance. She saw Zhou-en-Lai and also Krushchev and Bulganin but they were not crowd-pullers, not in this part of the city. When the two Russian leaders came there was a huge meeting at Brigade Parade Ground. We could hear their speeches from home, she says. The high point of their stay was a darshan of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip. Relatives had come over for the great day. Did the crowds yearn for such a sovereign in a pink dress graciously waving at them from her car?At King Edward Court close to the Acharya Jagadish Bose Road crossing a little girl opens the door of the Chopra flat. Her grandmother Adarsh sits inside the spacious drawing room on a plush velvet sofa. Cross-stitch classics adorn the wall. This place has grown on us. We came to live here in the early Seventies when the space opposite was bare. Bands used to play and carols were sung during Christmas. We could see St Pauls Cathedral sitting here. The church clock was a reliable timer for feeding the children and the ayah followed it, she says.In the beginning her children used to play in the lawn in front till late in the evening. Then it became overgrown. Subsequently, a restaurant opened there. That was closed. Then the humongous and horrible Chowringhee Court eclipsed Edward Court forever. How did that happen to Edward Court, designated a heritage building? The Chowringhee Court plan was sanctioned long before heritage laws were even thought of.The Maidan may have seemed idyllic then, but the stories of Uttam Kumar witnessing the death of an alleged Naxalite leader in a police encounter early one morning, and the stars consequent nervous breakdown are still fresh in public memory. The first corporate house to come up in this residential enclave was Virginia House belonging to the ITC. It was ready by 1928. Constructing an office building there was quite an extraordinary move at a time when Dalhousie Square meant business. ICI (now Reliance House) and Lloyds Bank (later Grindlays and now Standard Chartered) soon followed suit. ITCs black glass annexe opened in 1996.Once Army and Navy Store, now Kanak Building, always looks splendidly done up. But inside it is chipped marble and paint. The terrace is cluttered with superfluous structures. From the top floors of ITC glass box the wealth of greenery of Russell Street is visible. Crouching within are two crumbling houses. It is an unlikely place for a studio but Nidhi Bagrodia and her mother, both ceramic artists, have used one of them as such for 15 long years. In the shadow of a tall building, this bungalow shows no sign of life. But beyond the groves one comes upon hundreds of potted plants, a workshop where block-printed saris are produced and lunettes with gem-like glass panes.Deep inside its recess is the studio lined with equipment. Daughter works here the whole day sometimes, her clothes still spotless, her hands soiled. Indal moved into the multi-storeyed Jeevan Deep belonging to the Life Insurance Corporation of India in 1965 soon after it was ready. Its house magazine carried a report on how 50 truck-loads of office equipment were carted to 1 Middleton Street, where once stood a palace belonging to the Maharaja of Darbhanga. A photograph shows the bare grounds before the palace. A senior member of staff recalls the fair Manimela, the famous organisation for children, had held on that spot in the Fifties. Of the new office blocks, Tata Centre designed by the Chicago-based Holabird and Root is the smartest, particularly at night when it lights up. Till now the 24-storey Chatterjee International used to be the tallest blight of Chowringhee. It is being repaired after 20 long years.

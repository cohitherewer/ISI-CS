The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 Tolly dresses up its greens
clubsandwitchThe greens and fairways which have been the cradle of the Brand Bengal initiative by the Consular Corps of Calcutta over the past couple of years are all set to drive home an even prettier picture to diplomats and golf enthusiasts alike.The structured upgrading programme for the 6,305-yard, 18-hole golf course at Tollygunge Club, teed off a few years ago, has gathered fresh momentum. Redesigning the greens and converting the previously used wild crabgrass into the better cynodon dactylon variety of grass have been at the core of the augmentation scheme. Our undivided emphasis is on proper maintenance of the course and ensuring quality, stresses A.K. Chowdhuri, managing member (golf), Tollygunge Club Ltd.The club management has also embarked on an aggressive tree-planting programme to add character to the refurbished course. We have planted hundreds of trees of special species, which conform to golf-course norms and dont shed too many leaves, says Chowdhuri.The drainage system has also undergone a total overhaul. Now, its pretty much an all-weather course. One can play almost the year round, barring maybe two-three days, chips in golfer Indrajit Bhalotia, who anchors the junior programme at Tolly. The 60-odd juniors, five to 17 years of age, are revelling in the improved playing conditions, confirms the coach.Brandon DSouza, president, Tiger Sports Marketing, agrees that the Tolly course should be in far superior condition with all the investment and hard work. The better drainage and the sand-based greens make it a 12-month course, which all golfers look forward to.The club has also started growing its own grass, which should withstand the onslaught of the monsoons. The earlier Malaysian strain of Tifdwarf grass was not suited to our climatic conditions. But our home-grown grass has fared much better. Extensive de-thatching on the greens has been supplemented by the aerating of the soil and the top-dressing of the fairways, explains Chowdhuri.To carry the coaching scheme for juniors forward, the club is also contemplating a dedicated golf academy. We are exploring all avenues to try and tee it off. The trainees would be supervised by resident and visiting professionals and those who show genuine potential will be clubbed together for advanced training, Chowdhuri promises. Earlier, the club had brought in visiting coaches like Kevin Brand from the UK and the management is thinking on those lines again.The ladies golf union at the club is very active. The putting green and the floodlit driving range are becoming popular by the day. The traffic on the course is showing a healthy upswing, points out the clubs golf chief. Subhro Saha

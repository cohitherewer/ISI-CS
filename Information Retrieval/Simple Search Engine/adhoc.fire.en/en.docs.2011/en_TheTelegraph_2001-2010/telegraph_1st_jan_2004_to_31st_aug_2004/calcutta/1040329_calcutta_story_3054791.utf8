 Monday, March 29, 2004 				 Remembering the Mother
																								She is an epitome of beauty, affection and perfection. In her being one can perceive the calm and quiet that allows for a repose from the humdrum of life. It is to commemorate the Mother on the occasion of her First Arrival in Pondicherry that Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture is organising a special cultural programme. Mother having been an artiste herself, it is only befitting that the evening should feature the talented Koushiki Bandyopadhyay who will offer a solo recital entitled To Mother, through petal of songs, I leave my Prayer to Thee.... Her recital will comprise slokas, Tagore songs and Brahmosangeet, compiled as a homage to the Mother. Deserving special mention are the Tagore songs on flowers which have been included specifically keeping in mind Mothers preoccupation with flowers as they were to her a connection with the Divine.																								Event: Songs by Koushiki Bandyopadhyay																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture, 3 Regent Park, Calcutta 700 040

 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Ruckus at bank job exam centre
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An examination to select 350 out of 960 competing candidates as probationary officers in different branches of Allahabad Bank was cancelled after a mob went on the rampage at Maharaja Manindra Chandra College, in the Shyampukur police station area on Sunday morning.																								The college was one of the four examination centres in the city, and all the candidates were from Bihar, officials said.																								Police arrived at 11.30 am and told the authorities that they would not be responsible for any damage to college property if the examination continued, forcing it to be cancelled at 12.30 pm. 																								About 30 disgruntled youths stormed the examination control room, on the first floor, around 10 am, after some candidates alleged anomalies in seating arrangements, distribution of question papers and a leak. The mob destroyed sealed packets of question papers and shattered windowpanes.																								After college and bank officials were roughed up, they declared the examination cancelled at 12.30 pm. The exam was being conducted by the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection , senior bank officials said.																								Some of the candidates barged into the control room, alleging irregularities. They shattered glass panes, looted packets of question papers and left, said professor of physics Bimalendu Sarkar, in charge of the examinations at the centre. 																								Bank officials brought the question papers half-an-hour before the examination was scheduled to start. The process of distribution followed the guidelines laid down by the bank.																								In some of the rooms, candidates alleged that exam officials distributed the descriptive-type question paper, slated for the second session, from 11 am, instead of the objective-type question paper of the first session. They also alleged that three to five candidates were being seated on a single bench, enabling them to cheat.																								Some candidates protested the anomalies about 10 minutes into the examination. Thereafter, some boycotted the test and left the campus, only to find that people were moving around with photocopies of the second paper. 																								They then went to other rooms in the exam centre, announcing that the second paper had leaked and the exam would be cancelled, and disrupting the process by tearing up answer- scripts.

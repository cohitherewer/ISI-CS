 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Arrests bust spray and snatch racket
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Chandan Saha had withdrawn Rs 50,000 from a bank on Bangur Avenue. He was on his way home when his back started itching and he put the bag on the ground. Two youths then picked it up and started running. Alerted by his cries, passers-by caught one of them, identified by the police as Kishori Singh.																								Sripati Nag was not so lucky. With Rs 6,500 in his bag, he also felt an itch while walking near BH block in Salt Lake. Two youths struck up a conversation with him and catching him unawares, snatched his bag.																								Both incidents occurred on April 5, within a couple of hours of each other. 																								The Lake Town police started interrogating Kishori Singh. Singh admitted that his gang had committed both the crimes, said Ajit Sarkar, sub-divisional police officer, Salt Lake. 																								On the basis of his tip-off, a team raided a village in Halisahar, North 24-Parganas, and arrested one Kundan Singh. Rs 30,000 was recovered from him, along with Rs 6,000 which the gang had snatched from Nag. 																								The police came to know that a gang of six members had been engaged in snatching money from people after spraying chilli powder or some sort of chemicals on them. The gang is based in Halisahar and used to operate in the Salt Lake, Lake Town and Bangur areas, said Sarkar.

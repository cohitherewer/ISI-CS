The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Where minute=km=money
DHIMAN MUKHERJEE				 	 DHIMAN MUKHERJEE, managing director of the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC), met readers of The Telegraph on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included G.G. Bhattacharya, Manas Ghosh, G. Laha, Diptimoy Ghosh, Arun Hazra and Nikhilesh Chatterjee				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Manas Ghosh: When was the corporation formed? How does it affect everyday life?																																																			In 1996, the transport department registered the corporation by an Act, but full-fledged functioning started only in 1998. We do not provide any public service, except for generating funds to make sure a particular scheme is commercially viable. The transport infrastructure developed from such schemes will facilitate goods transport and public transport. In that way, we serve the people, in spite of being an organisation with a purely commercial outlook.																																																									

Arun Hazra: How will your activities ensure traffic safety, in light of the numerous violations of norms in the city?																																																			As far as rash driving is concerned, we are helpless. The city police are responsible for enforcing traffic laws to avert accidents. We have found that most drivers of public buses are not properly trained to tackle the traffic problems they face while plying the city roads every day. We plan to open an institution for training drivers in traffic management, though it will take time for the results to show. With only six per cent of roadspace free in the city for vehicular movement, only a brigade of well-trained drivers can ensure traffic safety. Specific skills will be tested in future before issuing driving licences.																																																									

G. Laha: How do you plan to check pollution in the city due to the emission of noxious gases by motor vehicles?																																																			The major challenge we face is to curb the growing vehicular pollution and to ensure a better environment by reducing the alarming pollution level. We took the first step with trucks. Currently, nearly 1.5 lakh trucks move along the states roads, ferrying goods to different destinations. Nearly 10,000 trucks enter the city and its immediate outskirts every day to unload foodgrains and other consumables. These trucks are a major nuisance, since they increase the level of pollution by their process of loading and unloading of goods. We will soon have three state-of-the-art truck terminals outside the city  at Dhulagarh, Budge Budge and Baranagar where the trucks will be delivering goods. This will go a long way in reducing the level of pollution. The Dhulagarh terminal will be inaugurated this month, and construction of the other two will be completed soon. Once these terminals become operational, you can forget the pains of unloading operations at spots like Posta and Sealdah.																																																									

G. Laha: The pockets you mentioned are prone to criminal activity. Dont you think the new truck terminals will become extensions of the criminal hubs, once they are ready?																																																			On the contrary, I can assure you that the criminal activities will be reduced. This is because in the transport business, a minute equals a kilometre equals money. The space at Posta and other places in the city are not adequate to accommodate the trucks. But each has to unload its cargo. It is because of this inadequacy that the mafia raj began, with each truck driver paying some local dadas for space to park their trucks and ensure quick unloading. In each of the new truck terminals, about 300 trucks can load and unload at a time, reducing the chances of muscle power.																																																									

Nikhilesh Chatterjee: Parking of vehicles is still a major problem in the city, though the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has constructed some parking lots.																																																			The Parkomats that have been constructed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation are targeted to offer parking to specified business hubs. We have already taken up the issue, and a few 24-hour parking spaces will soon be made where you can park your vehicle. Some of these will be underground, while others will be multi-storeyed structures.

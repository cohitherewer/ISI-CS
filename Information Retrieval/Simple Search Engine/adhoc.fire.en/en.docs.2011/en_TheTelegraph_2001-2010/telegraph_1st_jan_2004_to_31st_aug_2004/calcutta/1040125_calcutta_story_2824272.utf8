 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Lynched for extortion bid
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A middle-aged man was lynched by residents of Khanpara in Jadavpur late on Friday when he opened fire after trying to extort money from a contractor at a construction site on NSC Bose Road.																								Additional superintendent of police, town, South 24-Parganas, Humayun Kabir said two armed men came looking for the promoter of the construction at around 8.15 pm on Friday. When he could not be found, the men demanded money from labour contractor Arikul Islam, alias Kalu.																								As Kalu refused to give in to their demand, the miscreants hit him on the head with the butt of a revolver. Kalu raised an alarm and workers at the site gave the miscreants a chase. Local residents joined the group and almost caught up with one of the goons when he opened fire. The man had by then run out of ammunition and people overpowered and lynched him. His accomplice fled in the dark.																								Workers Marcos Soren, 25, and Cornel Soren, 35, suffered bullet injuries and were admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, along with Kalu. Kalu was discharged on Saturday but the Sorens, residents of Murshidabad, are still under treatment.																								The miscreant has not been identified. The duo was probably from Kidderpore, Kabir said. RG Kar trouble: Trouble  erupted at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Saturday  after Trinamul MLA Paresh Pal stormed in, demanding an inquiry  into an alleged case of medical negligence of a patient.

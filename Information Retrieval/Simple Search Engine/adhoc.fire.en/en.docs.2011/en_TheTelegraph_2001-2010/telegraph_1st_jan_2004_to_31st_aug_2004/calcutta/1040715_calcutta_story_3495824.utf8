 Lit up all day: Alternative power sources are needed to tackle waste  The report Panels four, chaos to the fore, June 11, gave voice to the point of view of those who travel in the comfort of taxis or private vehicles.  I am sure commuters who travel every day fighting for a foothold in buses or get caught in a traffic jam standing in a suffocating overcrowded minibus would not criticise the increasing number of such vehicles on the road. In fact, a rise in public transport will surely help thousands of office-goers who would welcome more breathing space.  The report mentions stoppage of issuing permits for buses and minibuses as one of the solutions to the traffic snarl problem. But how can buses which are directly beneficial for lower and middle class income group citizens be reduced in number? No traffic, so no traffic jam  this is surely not a solution.  I wonder why a restriction is being prescribed on auto-rickshaws. Can it be said that all owners of three-wheelers in the city are tax-evaders and thereby flouting government rules? There is no reason why they should be singled out for penalty by way of restrictions.  Building wider roads, flyovers, proper traffic control system, etc are steps in the right direction. The report should also have dwelt on the actual reasons for traffic jams such as rallies, political meetings and poor conditions of roads. Vineet Agarwal,
Sarat Bose Road.The decision of the city police to instal solar lights on the streets of Calcutta (Suns rays to power road lights, June 17) is definitely a welcome move. Very frequently street lights are left on during the day in the city and the power cut menace persists. It would be appreciated if the government could further decide to utilise solar energy for various commercial as well as domestic purposes. Prahlad Agarwala, 
Nadia.Apropos the report Health woes in weight shed, June 16, no matter how ineffective all weight-loss health foods in the market are, people still fall prey to the false schemes. This points to a gnawing unhealthy emotional quotient in our society. Diptimoy Ghosh,
Salt Lake City.Apropos your report Six-month bar on doctor, June 16, it is unfortunate that Jitesh Samaddar, a retired gynaecologist of Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, was guilty of negligence that caused the death of a pregnant woman. The medical profession has no scope for such mistakes when doctors are worshiped as gods in India. Govinda Bakshi,
Budge Budge.The report Mentally unsound girl reunited with mother, June 10, showed a mothers feelings for her mentally-handicapped daughter who was thought to have been dead. The effort made by Pavlov Mental Hospital proves the skills of the organisation in handling mentally challenged youngsters while the polices ineffectiveness was brought forth once again in their being unconcerned towards the missing. Raffhat Mir, 
McLeod Street.After the fire in New Market in the mid-80s, Calcuttas prime shopping destination had suddenly changed for the worse. The mayors plan to expand the market (New Market add-on address, June 14) seems nothing more than a trick to woo the public to vote him to power once again in next years civic poll. T.R. Anand,
Budge Budge.The report Blood poisons 30 children  Ugly head of HIV in transfusion, June 15, brought to light the shocking state of the health care system in West Bengal which seems to be deteriorating day by day. Children from economically-backward families are the worst sufferers. Umpteen number of conferences have not managed to provide any helpful solution. Chirantani Dey,
Delhi. The report Night guards for women in long-distance trains, June 19, about night patrols jointly by the RPF and the GRP for the safe journey of women and other passengers was heartening news. Let us hope ticket-holders are able to travel in comfort and safety after implementation of this plan. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum Park.

Baby's Day Out Little ones hooked on to the printed word at Oxford Bookstore. Picture by Sanjoy Chattapadhyaya The simple joy of reading is lost to kids these days, claim critics. For once, lets play it by the book. The small screen may be scoring (were talking TV plus computer, here) over the printed word, but did not Harry Potter triumph well before the movies were made?Closer home, Landmark has added an entire floor for kids while Crossword has opened with a flourish, boasting an entire section for the young ones. And if the numbers are anything to go by, no one is complaining about the tiny footfall.The bonus with most bookstores in town is the reading corner, where one can just sit and browse. While parents leaf through what interests them, the kids have their own corners, sometimes with other activities, cosy enough to keep them occupied. Even the toddlers enjoy being with books. Drop in at a bookstore and let the children explore  you dont even have to buy anything.And the collection is sure to keep them coming back. Other than the traditional nursery rhymes, alphabet, numbers, colours and shapes, there are the touch-and-feel baby books, bath books made of rubbery material, sticker books, Origamy, magic fun books, pop-ups, ones that make sounds and much more. Whoever said books were boring?The best bargain for the baby brigade: plenty of books and its not in a library, so silence please is the last thing youll hear unless, of course, you bring the place crashing down.CrosswordAs part of the childrens section, theres an area just for the tiny tots, where they can play, browse and freak out. Completely carpeted, theres no fear of bruised knees or grazed elbows. At the Elgin Road address, toys share space and spotlight with books. So they can cuddle up with a teddy bear and learn all about A, B, C at the reading tables or on the floor. At the activity tables, they can play with clay and building blocks. Inform, entertain and enlighten is the motto.Every Sunday, there are reading and activity sessions where animated storytelling is followed by painting, colouring and crafts like soft-toy making. There are also regular events, like the recent summer holiday fair, with a series of activities from learning to play musical instruments to craft sessions. There is also a computer, with demo CDs free for use  funda is fun here.LandmarkBrowse away, even if you cant buy is the advice from Landmark bookstore. The recently-built floor for kids is brimming with books and toys and theres plenty of space and scope for the babies to hang out and have fun. Although the outdoor play area is closed for the monsoons, theres enough to keep them inside.Let the toddlers rummage the shelves and then sit them down at the five-seater Lego table (with blocks too big to put in their mouths). The play zone is also theirs, with Lego always ready for use. Here, too, activities form a big part of the plans.Pokemon parties and Christmas carnivals are a regular affair at the Lord Sinha Road address. Coming up is an event worth mentioning  next month, in association with Storytellers, every other Sunday will see a reading and enactment of The Mahabharat for kids.Oxford BookstoreIn the kiddie area, plonk them down on the pint-sized tables and chairs. The books are comfortably placed on low shelves, within easy reach. A conducive and stimulating atmosphere is what Oxford Bookstore promises. Books are peppered with creative activity. Sift through the cupboard stuffed with paper, crayons and other materials, so they can draw. The efforts hang on the bulletin board.Every Sunday, from 5 pm to 6 pm is an activity hour, with colouring, fun games, quiz, storytelling, drawing and sketching. Every six weeks is an event. Next in line is a forest party on Teachers Day, where children of The Creative Arts will enact a play based on Jungle Book. Also, during the planned environment week, there will be a workshop on learning and fun with nature for kids coming to the Park Street store.NISHA LAHIRI

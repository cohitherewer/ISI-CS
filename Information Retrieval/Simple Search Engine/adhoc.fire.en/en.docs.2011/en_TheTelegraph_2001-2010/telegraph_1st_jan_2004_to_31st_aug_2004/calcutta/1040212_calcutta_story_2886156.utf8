 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Court allows price-control raids on bars
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday refused to pass an interim injunction on the raids conducted by the consumer affairs department on bars and restaurants, on the charge of selling packed drinks like beer, soft drinks and mineral water at prices higher than the printed maximum retail price (MRP).																								Justice S.K. Mukherjee, who passed the order, will hear the case again on Thursday.																								The Hotel and Restaurants Association of India moved the court after the consumer affairs department slapped penalties on 20 bars and restaurants in the city for violating MRP norms. 																								Officials said the courts refusal to pass the interim injunction against the raids virtually allowed the consumer affairs department to continue their action.																								When there is a fixed price printed on the label of any packed item, nobody can charge any additional amount for it. Everyone is bound to charge the MRP and it is the duty of the government to ensure that no trader charges any amount over and above the MRP, Justice Mukherjee observed. He felt that many sweet-sellers, too, do not maintain the specified quantity even though the price is fixed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Call for sense, not strictures
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should members of the audience be penalised if their cell phones ring during a performance in an auditorium? More letters will be published next week Drumbeats over ringtones: A scene from Sateroi July. Picture by Ashok MajumdarManasi Chakrabarti,
																		Behala																																																														Members of the audience should be penalised if their cellphones ring during a performance in an auditorium. The entire ambience is disturbed by ringing mobile phones.									

Nirmalya Biswas,
																		Hridaypur Station Road																																																														Auditoriums will get rid of the polyphonic garbage only if irresponsible cell phone users are penalised. But it will be difficult to mark out and penalise the culprits in a packed theatre, especially when the performance is in progress. It depends entirely on the discretion of cell phone users in the audience.Dhananjoy Ghosh,
Baruipur It would be a welcome move if a member of the audience is penalised if his cell phone rings in an auditorium. Any performance these days is interrupted by the ringing of cellphones and penalisation of the guilty user will be the right step to ensure a smooth show. 									

Sandhya Banerjee, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														A cell phone, definitely a useful gadget, should not be misused. Ringing cellphones are a cause of irritation for both artists performing at a show and other people. So cellphones should be switched off during any performance.									

Samiran Das, 
																		Duttapukur																																																														Only a cell phone can help people in an auditorium to stay connected with the world outside, especially during a medical emergency. The cell phone user should be responsible enough to see that his gadget does not disturb others. Bhupen Bose,
Dum Dum ParkIt is highly irritating when during an engaging performance in an auditorium, cell phones start to ring. It breaks the concentration of the performer and annoys the other members of the audience no end. It would be a good move if people carrying mobile phones are restricted from entering auditoriums. 									

Rohinimohan p. mazumdar,
																		Shyamnagar																																																														Members of the audience should definitely be penalised if their cell phones ring during a performance in an auditorium. The noise of cell phones disturbs the audience who have come to see the particular performance. Discipline matters, more so when lack of it affects others.									

Ahasan Jahir Molla,
																		Maheshtala																																																														Ideally cell phones should be forbidden inside any auditorium during a performance. It causes much disturbance for both the performers and the audience. Everybody is aware of this. So, inspite of this, if a cell phone is used during a performance, the user should be punished.									

Rakhi Chakraborty, 
																		Durgapur Lane																																																														It is indeed very annoying when the audience is distracted by the ringing of a cell phone in the midst of a good performance. The user should certainly be penalised in such a case. But exceptions can be made during emergencies. 									

Sunil Banerjee,
																		VIP Road																																																														Penalisation of the errant cell phone user in the audience would be the right step to take in such a case. A ringing cell phone is a menace during a performance, and the situation needs to improved.Anandadip Chowdhury,
																		Baguiati																																																														People lacking in sense of responsibility flaunt their funky ring tones in an auditorium during programmes. This not only irritates others around them, it also distracts the performers. Using the vibrator mode is the best option. Punishment in such a situation would be unjust.									

Sourish Misra, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														Irresponsible members of the audience must be penalised. If a cell phone rings in an auditorium during a performance, it not only disturbs other members of the audience, but also breaks the concentration of the performer. Most mobile phones today have the option of being set in the vibrator mode so that the user can attend to his call without disturbing anybody else. But if the phone disturbs others in the auditorium, penalty must be imposed on the offender. 									

Tanushree Mukherjee, 
																		Chandernagore																																																														Members of the audience should be penalised if their cell phones ring during a performance in an auditorium because it disturbs the ambience in the hall and distracts others around. Often, despite repeated warnings, people do not switch off their phones. In such cases, the offenders should be severely penalised. Arindam Ray, 
Salt LakeThe auditorium authorities should instruct as well as follow a rule asking the audience to switch off the cell phones before entering the hall. If a cell phone rings even after this, the member of the audience seated near the offender should make him switch it off immediately. Vinay Dokania, 
																		GT Road 																																																														The idea of penalising anyone for a ringing cell phone during a performance is a ridiculous idea. Instead, I feel there should be extensive checking before the beginning of a show. A mere penalty cannot change a persons attitude, hence this useless idea should not be put into practice at any cost. Sananda Sen, 
																		New Alipore																																																														Yes. It is understandable if some one has to keep the cell phone switched on in anticipation of some urgent information during the show. But even then, the phone should be set in the silent mode so that nobody else is disturbed.Subhobrata Basu,
																		Ballygunge Station Road																																																														It is almost criminal when the cell phone of an irresponsible member of the audience disturbs a performance. Requests from organisers have no effect. Some people just dont learn. The best way to teach them a lesson is to charge a hefty sum or throw the person out every time an offender is caught with his cell phone on during a performance. 									

Debalina Bose, 
																		Konnagar																																																														It is no crime if members of the audience enter a hall with their cell phones because it has become an indispensable mode of communication these days. But there must be some kind of reminder so that people are not disturbed. If a phone rings in spite of warnings, then the offender should be severely penalised. Sudeshna Ghosh, 
																		Baranagore																																																														Ringing cell phones distract the audience and disturb the performers as well. It leads to further annoyance if the cell phone owner starts talking on the phone, right inside the hall. So, a strict rule of keeping phones switched off or setting them in vibrator mode inside an auditorium should be implemented.									

Arijit ghosh, 
																		Shyamnagar. 																																																														Penalising someone for his ringing cell phone is not a reasonable move. Cell phones are of great use during emergencies. There could, however, be a rule so that the audience keeps his phone at the lowest volume. 									

P. Pramanik,
																		Santoshpur																																																														If a cell phone owner thinks himself too busy a man, he should not come to attend a show. It should also be made mandatory for the auditorium authorities to display a notice prohibiting the use of mobile phones inside the auditorium during a performance.									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,
																		Barrackpore																																																														A notice board, carrying an appeal in bold letters to switch off mobile sets or leave them at home during a performance, placed in front of ticket counters of an auditorium is the ideal way to stop this. The errant member of the audience should be asked to leave the hall and debarred from further entry. Such punishment is the best way to curb the increasing insensible use of cell phones.									

Hemanta Datta,
																		Shibpur																																																														Though cell phones are useful in many ways, the problems of technical progress cannot be overlooked. Therefore, for everybodys convenience, during any performance, cell phones should be set in vibrator mode or banned totally. Punishment for such offence is ridiculous. People should have a sense of responsibility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Police wield the baton on poll-eve
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a bid to curb violence at election time, Calcutta Police is taking a number of measures.																								According to police, hired goons backed by political parties have started entering the city from Bihar and Jharkhand. Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh said police personnel had been deployed at major entry points to the city to stop infiltration of criminals. Sleuths in plain clothes are also doing the rounds.																								We have contacted our counterparts in the districts to keep watch over goons so that they cannot intimidate voters, said an officer of the anti-rowdy section of the city detective department.																								Preventive arrests are being carried out in the city and its outskirts to ensure a trouble-free election. We have identified several areas as sensitive  Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Ekbalpore, Rajabazar, Park Circus, Dum Dum and Karaya, the officer added.																								Allegations and counter-allegations are also pouring in from political parties. The blame game is on and we have received complaints of criminal activities in certain pockets. The contestants have submitted lists of miscreants who, they allege, had been fielded by the opposition parties. We are looking into these allegations as well, the officer said.

								Diptimoy Ghosh: How is Great Eastern different from the other high-profile city hotels? What is its star rating?																																																													This hotel being the citys oldest (165 years) has already been declared a heritage site. We are trying our best to maintain the quality of services it was renowned for. The hotels central location is another plus point. Before 1975, Great Eastern had a four-star rating, but as the facilities and infrastructure were not upgraded or maintained, its rating slipped. We had not applied for a renewal of the star status as we do not fulfil several criteria.

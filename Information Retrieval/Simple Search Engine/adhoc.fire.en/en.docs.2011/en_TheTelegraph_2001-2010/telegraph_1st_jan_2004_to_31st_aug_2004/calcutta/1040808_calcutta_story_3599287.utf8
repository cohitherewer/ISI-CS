A dream cast never to be (From top) Suchitra Sen, Madhabi Chakraborty with Soumitra Chatterjee, Uttam Kumar with Kishore Kumar, Dev Anand with Waheeda Rehman, and Madhubala				 																																																											Swapner Din, yet to be released in Calcutta, is trundling the foreign festival circuit, and director Buddhadeb Dasgupta is in no hurry. Taking a break from fine-tuning the script for his next film, Dasgupta settles down for a free wheeling chat with Reshmi Sengupta on a cool August evening in his Gol Park office. Over cups of tulsi-flavoured tea, faces etched in memory and buried in time peep out. Faces that the film-maker would have loved to cast, only if he had a chance.Five heroines: Madhabi Chakraborty. The mention of her name reminds me of the pensive face in Charulata. Such a sensitive face was never seen in Bengali cinema before. I can never forget her performance in Ritwik Ghataks Subarnarekha. Suchitra Sen. I have wondered what she would be like if she stepped out of her trademark style  the way she stared, her body language and mannerisms. Not the Suchitra Sen of, say, Chaoa Paoa.  If you ask me to single out any one actress, its Waheeda Rahman. She was a sheer genius and possessed an extremely sensitive face. Unfortunately, Waheeda left films long before I started.  My very close friend Smita Patil. She was way ahead of all her peers. Both of us had always wanted to work together, but it never materialised. And yes, Madhubala! How could I forget her The one I fell in love with at age 12 and even decided to write a love letter to. I would never miss her films and remember watching Chalti Ka Naam Gadi about seven times. Bollywood has never seen a more glamorous and beautiful heroine. I would have loved to see her in a serious role.Five heroes: Balraj Sahni, who was a very dignified and accomplished actor. You seldom come across a Hindi film hero with such melancholic eyes. Kishore Kumar, any day. If only I could have worked with him... He was such a colourful and vibrant personality. Soumitra Chatterjee. Hes capable of a miracle even at this age. Soumitrada was one of the most talented actors of his times. Somehow, casting him in my films didnt quite work out.  Dev Anand. Heres another actor I would have loved to see on screen minus his mannerisms. But a great showman. And of course, Uttam Kumar. He was the ultimate romantic hero. The innocence that radiated from his face is rare. I would have liked to see him in a non-hero kind of a role. Barring Nayak, he didnt act in too many off-beat films.Twinkle toes, phuchka feast				 																																																											Shes been visiting the city for years, but each time Calcutta has something new in store for her. This time, it was the phuchkas and some fresh talent waiting to be tapped.				 																																																											A rain-swept evening found Odissi exponent Sonal Mansingh  in the city to conduct a weeklong dance workshop at Calcutta School of Music  taking time off from her busy schedule to tuck into some phuchkas.				 																																																											I tried my first phuchka near the Lakes. I was told its a speciality of Vivekananda Park. I just loved the hot flavour, which is very different from the sweet Mumbai or Delhi varieties which I dont take too keenly to. I gobbled down over a dozen of those, and didnt feel a tad guilty, gushes the dancer, taken in by the phuchka but loath to try mishti doi. I have a presentation at Tollygunge Club on Sunday evening and have to watch my waistline for that, she reasons.				 																																																											Calcutta has always fascinated Mansingh, only if you could just do without the traffic jams. Its a pity that a city so perfect otherwise has such a flaw. The bandh provided some respite, though				 																																																											The monsoons have made her stay even more pleasant this time. The rain-washed streets and the green canopy at the heart of the city have touched a chord in the artiste. You would have found me at my best dancing with abandon in the middle of the Maidan, says she, looking resplendent in a flaming yellow sari.				 																																																											For Mansingh, the citys pulsating cultural activity is what has always set it apart. Theatre, music, dance  always forming an integral part of Calcuttas appeal  have inspired me. There has never been dearth of talent here, she feels, and that holds true even now when shes grooming a bunch of dancers on the art of abhinay.Her only worry: the dwindling popularity of Odissi as a classical dance form. My colleagues say there is not much scope for performance here. A couple of decades ago, we were chart-toppers in Calcutta as artists with a new form of dance. We have to get the city back on Odissi track through meaningful target marketing, says she. Youngsters being fed on the Bollywood variety of dance can still be lured to Odissi. The Mansingh potion: You just have to serve it right Thats the magic.Rajrupa GhoshStep by step: Riya Sen creeps up glam ladderIf Suchitra Sen makes it effortlessly to director Buddhadeb Dasguptas dream list from the past, her grand daughters are fast climbing the popularity pole of the future. Have you seen the younger one sizzle in the sneak peek of Dil Ne Jise Apna Kaha? Riya Sens special appearance in the multi-starrer comes in the wake of her raunchy remix of Jhumka gira re. And the Bengali belles fortunes may soon soar with Deepak Tijoris Fareb, co-starring Manoj Bajpai and Shilpa Shetty.

																								Playmakers latest production, Mohon Banshi, has as its central theme the eternal tussle between virtue and vice. Treated in a humorous vein with shades of gentle satire, the play subtly awakens in us a sense of the loss of innocence and simplicity in our lives. The plot of the play revolves around the adventures of Srinibas, who wants to deliver the Mohon Banshi, a flute with magical properties, to the person whos most fit to possess it. Written by Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay and directed by Sujit Mukhopadhyay, the play presents a perfect blend of fantasy and reality, transporting the audience to a fairytale-like realm, yet remaining true to its intended message. This comedy promises to amuse and enthrall the young and old alike.																								Event: A play in Bengali, Mohon Banshi, by Playmakers																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Saturday, July 10, 2004 Calcutta 				 Of the foul and the fair
Eye on Calcutta
Barry O'BrienThe city has its share of both breeds  those who stray into a football match without a care for the game and those who spend their lives caring for four-legged strays																								phirst they were telling, we Calcuttans were phassionate about only three Ps  phootball, phootball and more phootball. Nonsense! They were not knowing. We were phassionate about all letters  a to jed. We enjoyed every damn thing. From adda to joo!																								Now they are telling, we Calcuttans are phassionate only about three Ps  phashion, phashion and more phashion. They are not knowing. Till now we are phassionate about all letters  a to jed. Actually, we are having so much time on our hands, we are enjoying every damn thing.																								I am also very pleased to tell you that it is still phasionable to be seen at a phootball match. In phact, at INOX that night I was japped to see so many daring damsels taking leave of abhsence from Tantra, Lawndon Pub and some more places else, to be chearing Portugal and Phigo with full gusto; in phact, some were wearing such tight clothes I thought they were going to bursto! (Dont mind! Like all phellow Calcuttans, I am also budding poet. Shall be all my liphe!)More visitors at INOX, where the final was screened. (Above) A scene from Jungle Book. Pictures by Rashbehari Das No matter. Let us get to the point. Euro Cup phinal was being shown on giant screen at INOX, City Centre. What a mag-nee-phee-cient multiplex. Marbhalous! Really! God promise! It is simply gor-jus! But I was having big problem concentrating on the gor-jus hall and the bhery abha-rage match. I was getting distracted by the gor-jus phemale supporters who phorgot to wear belts and their jeans were phalling down, lower and lower. What a dangerous phashion they are phollowing these days!																								I am not sure they were there to watch the phootball. I think some of them heard Greece and came, thinking John Travolta and Olivia Newton John were going to shake a leg. When they saw it was only some phootballers from Greece whose names they could not pronounce and who were looking abha-rage, they were out of there, with their boy-phrends, like greased lightning. Other paagols like me stayed till the bitter end, right from the bitter beginning, when beer was on the house (bhery bad joke).																								Mrs Pal Choudhari, 76, also stayed, as did 11-year-old Anirudh Bagaria. In phact I was japped when didima Pals son told me that he brought maa to see a live final on a giant screen because the World Cup was still two years away and life is so uncertain. All in all, it was a bhery abha-rage match but a superb ebhe-ning. Could have been a bit better if I had become more phamiliar with my phellow supporters  the ones who phorgot to wear belt. Problem was my phather-in-law had come along with me. Next time I shall not be so damn phoolish and let my phather-in-law be kebab-mein-haddi, even though he is a big phootball phanatic! Mind it, I am not a ghar-jamai!																								Now that my father-in-law has read this, now that I have taken my foot out of my mouth, now that I am in the dog-house, with him and my wife, lets talk about dogs and their houses.																								Exact figures arent available, but it is estimated that the number of stray dogs and cats in the city could be well into the thousands. While their pedigreed jaatbhais invariably find a comfortable home, many of these, sadly referred to as local pariahs, have to fight for survival in our concrete jungle. As a race, they are probably the oldest, having reportedly walked the earth for some 14,000 years, but as a breed they never get to walk the walk or talk the talk. Invariably, its a dogs life for them, till they get run over.																								Fortunately, there are the likes of music-man Nondon Bagchi and telly-lady Madhumanti Maitra, public people who in their private lives care for animals big time. While Madhumanti has mothered scores of stray cats and dogs, Nondon has built lasting friendships with dozens in his para. There are others too  less famous, but as committed  who care and show that they care.																								There is Lucy-di who has made it a daily ritual to feed some 20 cats and dogs in Hazra and a teacher-mashima who commutes from Salt Lake to Manoharpukur Road to feed 15 cats who line up in anticipation on the same boundary wall every day, without fail. I knew Ann Madathian, an elderly lady who told me that the joy that her little darlings (her cats) brought her helped her to keep her spirits up and fight cancer. Gradually, the cats died; so also did her will to live. Soon, Ann died too. Fortunately, her breed didnt.																								Radhika Bose, Sam Mitra and the other founder-members of Animal Relief and Care Society belong to the same pedigree. The thread that binds them together is their undying love for animals dying on the street. Between Radhika and Sam they have cared for hundreds of stray and cats and dogs and even today have more than a dozen in their homes.																								Realising that they would have to work under a banner and build a shelter for these animals in order for their efforts to be more fruitful, they set up the society late last year. The current action plan is to create awareness and raise funds for the shelter in Alipore. Following up on a rock concert and a star-studded panel discussion, they recently got children from schools in Calcutta to stage Jungle Book at GD Birla Sabhagar.																								Directed by Aniket Deb Roy, a math teacher who knows the formula of a good production but cannot calculate how many hours he has spent caring for animals, the show was a huge success, as big as Baloo, the bear. Rehearsing through their summer vacation, the monkeys and elephants, wolves and vultures sang and danced to Neel Adhikaris music, full of melody and sprinkled with his very own masala. Leading them were a couple of hunks from college, Projjol and Projesh Banerjee, two of the citys truly gifted all-rounders who can act, write, play music, play sport and shine in the classroom  all at the same time. As Sher Khan and Bagheera, they held the production together while the adorable Arvind Mowgli Suresh grooved to the beats of ape King Louis (Anubrata Basu) and bubbly Baloo (Rohan Sen), two exceptionally talented young guys who could go on to make it big on stage. 																								Personally, it was a huge day for the wife and me, theatre-crazy and not in the dog-house any more. Two of our three daughters made their stage debuts  Raisa as a monkey and Zasha as the village girl whom Mowgli follows in a love-trance. The monkey bit was fine  theyre doing it all the time; it was the falling-in-love bit that the girls father couldnt handle. Give him a break! Shes only 10; and hes still recovering!

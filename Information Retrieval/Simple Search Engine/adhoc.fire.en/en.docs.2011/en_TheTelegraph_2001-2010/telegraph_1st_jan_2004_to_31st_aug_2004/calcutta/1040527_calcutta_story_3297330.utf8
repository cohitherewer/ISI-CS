 The road behind... and ahead: Contrasting faces of the city The report Film passport to flesh trade, April 29, is not an isolated incident. Nowadays there is so much of films and television serials, not just on the screen but also in the media, that young girls are getting enamoured of the glamour of tinsel town and nurture hopes of making it big in Bollywood. Taking advantage of their immature dreams, racketeers lure them into their traps.  The dream becomes more unreal and the urge more acute in case of girls from needy families with little income and less education. An active gang operates in the districts of Murshidabad and 24-Parganas that draws girls into flesh trade after making false promises of glory in filmdom. Although social welfare organisations have been pointing out this alarming trend to the government, such nefarious practices are going on in full swing due to the indifference of the intelligence department.  The situation will not improve until the government undertakes an awareness drive and the media too highlights the pitfalls on the way to a career in films. Govinda Bakshi, 
Budge Budge Apropos the report IT firm beats bandh blues, April 21, it was nice to note that an IT firm, which was planning to shift out of West Bengal irked by the states bandh culture, has decided to expand its base here instead. The change in the firms decision is a recognition of a shift in the governments philosophy. The state has become investor-friendly. This proactive attitude would help in expansion of trade and commerce and gradually benefit the common people. Rabindra Nath Kar, 
Sankar Ghosh LaneKudos for highlighting the pathetic condition of scientist Subhas Mukherjees wife Namita towards the fag end of her life (For a medal in his memory, April 26). The authorities should come forward to fulfil her wish and support her financially. That is the only way to honour a lifetime of unrecognised research. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum Park It was sad to learn that Namita Mukherjee, wife of late physician and scientist Subhas Mukherjee, is in a critical condition. The health department should at least set up a research centre on reproductive bio-medicine in memory of the unsung hero. Prahlad Agarwala, 
Majdia, Nadia The thought of bedridden Namita Mukherjee lying uncared for and staring at the ceiling from where her scientist husband had hanged himself to death causes pain. It is high time our government set up a support infrastructure for the lonely and the ailing . T.R. Anand,
Budge BudgeOf what use is the report On wheels, peddlers of films new amp; blue (April 26) detailing places where, at what prices and from whom pirated audio and video CDs, specially blue films, are available? This caters to people who want to be titillated but do not know where to go, as well as those who want to get into the business. P. B. Choudhury,
Shakespeare SaraniCollege authorities should not be allowed to dismiss dereliction of duty in such a casual manner (On marks of blunder, April 29). I feel sorry for the student concerned. Anil Kumar Sen, 
Ramchandra Chatterjee LaneIt is alarming how the stretch between Ultadanga and Lake Town has turned into a death zone (Swift entry to zone of death, April 27). Vehicles, after suffering a jam-packed CIT Road, accelerate on the VIP Road to make up for lost time. The need of the hour is traffic monitoring at the crossing. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake TownWhy does the president of Time and Talent Roma Bhagat not help those who really need it and would appreciate it? (Ragpicker roots for freedom of footpath, April 24). She could, for instance, help the police officer who also found a bag with money and returned it to the owner. He has a family to support. If the ragpicker does not want help, just leave her alone. Ramesh Daswani,

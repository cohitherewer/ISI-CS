 Tuesday, July 06, 2004 				 Hone your talent for tongues
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With demand for experts in foreign languages growing in the city, Inlingua International, one of the leading language education brands across the globe, is setting up operations in Calcutta and kicking off a host of courses for those who want to hone their skills in foreign languages.																								The demand is primarily from the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, who need experts in foreign languages to serve their global clients, says Indrajyoti Sen Gupta, director, Inlingua, and a licensee of the company in Calcutta.																								The Switzerland-headquartered company has around 300 centres in 30 countries. In India, it has four centres in Delhi and one in Chandigarh.																								In the first phase, the language centre on SP Mukherjee Road will offer courses in English, Spanish and French from July 6, while Japanese and German will be introduced after two months. 																								Anyone above 13 is eligible for the courses, that are staggered in four modules. The fees for each module ranges from Rs 10,000 to Rs 11,500.																								According to Sen Gupta, the method of training  with personalised care, a proper mix of classroom sessions and home assignments and constant monitoring of progress  helps students master foreign languages in the shortest possible time.																								To extend placement assistance, the company is in the process of tying up with BPO outfits and placement agencies. Sen Gupta claims that some of the leading call-centres are picking up Inlingua students from its Delhi centres.																								Our teaching method is standardised across the globe and we dont teach through the standard grammar mode or translation techniques, he explains.																								To ensure perfect delivery for effective learning, the teachers have to undergo a stringent training programme to conform to the Inlingua standards. 																								Along with the programme for students, the institute will also run customised sessions for corporates. Language courses for kids are also on the cards.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Flop: a death wish over fish 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Policemen manning the central gate of Writers Buildings didnt take a second look at the lean man, of average height, passing by on Wednesday.																								Not until he walked right up to them, zeroed in on one and thrust a printed leaflet in Bengali into his hand. The policeman read it casually, till he reached the end of the handout, and yelled: Arrest him.																								The words that prompted the policeman to shout out loud: I beseech you and the government to help me kill myself, as all my efforts to remain honest and tread the path of truth have got me nowhere I hope you will cooperate with my plan of committing suicide in front of the VIP gate.																								The author: Tapan Das, a 50-year-old fisherman from Hooghly.																								The addressees: President A.P.J Abdul Kalam, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and several of his ministers.																								And Das ploy to announce his end, within minutes of handing over the leaflet to the cop, achieved partial success from his point of view  it forced the indifferent and inert state machinery into action. 																								Before the fisherman could take another step towards his suicide bid, cops on the call collared him and led him away to prevent an embarrassing situation at the door of the states seat of governance.																								At Hare Street police station, Das was arrested, only to be released on bail a few hours later, said Rajeev Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).																								This was the second time in two months that Das had threatened to take his life in full public glare. On March 29, he had showed up in front of the district magistrates office in Chinsurah. I had informed the chief minister and other administrative officers well in advance of my decision to end my life, said Das, adding: I had to defer my planned suicide as the district magistrate was not in his office and the sub-divisional officer intervened.																								Das, a resident of Belmuri, in the Dhaniakhali police station area, listed all his grievances against the government in his leaflet-cum-suicide note. In the past two years, he has written to the President and the Prime Minister, lamenting the rejection of several applications for loans to facilitate organised fishing activity.																								I will look into the matter. Das grievances will be verified with the Hooghly district administration, said chief secretary Ashok Gupta.

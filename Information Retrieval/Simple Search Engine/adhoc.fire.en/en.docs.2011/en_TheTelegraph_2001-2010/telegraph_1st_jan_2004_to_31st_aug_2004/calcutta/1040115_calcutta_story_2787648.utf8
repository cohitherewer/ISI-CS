 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Road tax in higher bench
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government on Wednesday filed an appeal in a higher bench demanding quashing of the revised road-tax cases pending before the trial bench.																								The appeal is likely to be heard by the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee early next week. High court sources said the government is planning to file a stay application on the interim order passed by Justice P.K. Roy of the same court, restraining the government from collecting the lifetime road tax from two-wheeler owners.																								The state is also set to challenge the observation of Justice Roy, that the notification issued by the government in this regard is unconstitutional.																								Earlier, the Automobile Association of Eastern India had filed a petition before Justice K.J. Sengupta of Calcutta High Court, challenging the validity of the government asking four-wheelers owners to pay five years road tax at one go.																								Sengupta heard the petition over two days but declined to pass an order, as a similar petition filed by some four-wheeler owners was pending before Justice B. Bhattacharjee of the same court. Justice Bhattacharjee passed an interim order allowing the state to collect the new tax but said vehicle-owners would have to be refunded if the petition was allowed after final hearing.																								Then, vacation judge Justice P.K. Roy took up a similar petition and passed an interim order, prohibiting the government from collecting the new tax.

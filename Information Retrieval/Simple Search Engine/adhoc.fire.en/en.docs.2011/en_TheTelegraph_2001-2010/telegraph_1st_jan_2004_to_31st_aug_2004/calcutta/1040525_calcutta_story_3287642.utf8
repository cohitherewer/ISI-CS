The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Divergent tracks united on Calcutta
 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Nageen and father Habib Tanvir: Dramatists daughter, when not in riyaaz, is documenting the music in her fathers plays. Picture by Amit Datta																								The father tours the country with his stage productions, sifts through old diaries and scoops out old jottings to reconstruct his life into a book. 																								The daughter sings in his chorus, does bit roles if needed, but is keener on spending long hours training her mellifluous voice and documenting the theatre music of her famous playwright-director parent.																								In the past four decades and more, Habib Tanvir has built up an enormous repertoire of stage shows with his Bhopal-based Naya Theatre, but daughter Nageen has decided to cut herself off from the troupe and carve a niche in the world of Hindustani classical music.																								Though on divergent tracks, the father-daughter duo loves  and keeps coming back to  Calcutta, to the worlds best and most discerning audiences. Sunday saw them staging Charandas Chor  a play Calcutta never tires of watching  at a Behala hall.																								A big city, that has always nurtured the best of western and indigenous cultures, is how the father describes Calcutta.																								The most humane and sane city in the country, that can accept any innovative work, is how the daughter views Calcutta.																								And so, the city is sure to see much more of the 39-year-old, armed with a six-year diploma in classical music and training under vocalists Sulochana Brihaspati and Dipali Nag.																								At Nags Behala residence on Monday evening, Nageen voiced her desire to hold her first solo concert in Calcutta some time later this year. The city had got a taste of her powerful voice last month when she performed for Vikram Iyengars Crossings.																								Music seeped early into Nageen ever since she started watching Tanvir work with folk artists from Chhattisgarh. While travelling along with her parents, she has picked up various genres of music  be it classical, devotional, folk, Rabindrasangeet, Nazrulgeeti, Atulprasadi or the tribal tunes of Bastar.																								Father has integrated a lot of folk tunes of this region, and even ghazals, in his work which need to be preserved in the form of proper recordings. Unfortunately, we have lost some powerful folk singers of Chhattisgarh. So, the recordings have to be done by the remaining voices and myself, said Nageen.																								Later, she wants to expand the project and include documentation work on Chhattisgarhs folk music that is dying out slowly.																								And whats keeping the father busy? Apart from overseeing the construction of a full-fledged campus for Naya Theatre in Bhopal, the 81-year-old finds himself mostly engaged with his autobiography  the IPTA days, his associations with Shambhu Mitra and Utpal Dutt, his pioneering work with folk forms and artistes, his movement against fundamentalism																								My long and chequered career, my friendships, my love affairs  theres everything in it, said Tanvir, reclining in an armchair, darling daughter perched by his side.

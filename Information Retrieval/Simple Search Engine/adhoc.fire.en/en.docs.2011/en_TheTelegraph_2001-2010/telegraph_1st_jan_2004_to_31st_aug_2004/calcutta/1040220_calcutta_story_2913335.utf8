 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Campus chaos sparks tech varsity tone-up
 OUR BUREAU																								Confronted by a never-before situation  the resignation, en masse, of the faculty of the Bengal Institute of Technology (BIT)  the West Bengal University of Technology is adopting measures never before implemented in the state.																								The events at BIT  supposedly one of the better private engineering colleges  have blown the lid off serious malpractices, forcing the university to adopt stern measures that, officials feel, should have been taken long ago.																								One of the solutions on the anvil is the creation of a pool of teachers, who will be employed by the university itself but will be shuttled from one college to another, as per necessity, to complete the syllabi. 																								Also being considered are more serious inspections of the colleges and the infrastructure they provide to students and cancellation of affiliation to colleges that refuse to tone up their act.																								Though the events on the BIT campus at Bantala  the mass fast by students and the mass resignation by their teachers  have jeopardised the future of the college and the students themselves, officials admit that they could turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the university.																								We knew all along that the problems  of a very serious nature for an educational institution  existed, a senior higher education department official admitted on Thursday. 																								But we have always shied away from taking firm steps because we feared that we could end up harming the students, he added. The past weeks events, however, have shown how wrong we were in taking a soft stand.																								The evils in the system followed by most of the private colleges can be divided into three heads, say officials: Most colleges do not have adequate full-time teachers and, therefore, employ a large number of part-timers. Most of these part-timers are full-timers in other government-run colleges. Their commitment to this job and the hours they can devote to it are often inadequate The infrastructure that many of the 48 private engineering colleges provide is not commensurate with the high fees they charge The examination system followed leaves much to be desired. This results in frequent allegations of wrongdoing.																								The pool of teachers, to be called adjunct teachers, will help counter the first malaise, say officials. 																								We will employ a constant group of 70 to 80 teachers, who will be asked to help out colleges in completing their syllabi, registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay said. 																								But the colleges will have to pay the university for the services rendered by its teachers, he warned.																								With the infrastructure in many of the colleges still not up to the mark, despite repeated reminders and assurances, inspection of campuses will now be conducted more rigorously. It has been decided that the university will carry out its own inspection before the one by All-India Council of Technical Education, a senior university official said. These will be serious affairs, he said.																								We will always think twice before cancelling the affiliation of a college, because that will adversely affect the students. But we will not hesitate to do so if the situation demands such strict action, Bandyopadhyay added.

 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Newer horizons for the footloose
 															- GOING GLOBAL IS THE SUMMER HOLIDAY MANTRA				 	 An angler on Pattaya beach. The Southeast remains a perennial favourite of Calcutta vacationers (Reuters)																								Nepal is not quite in this summer, but South Africa definitely is. China isnt a favourite yet, but Sri Lanka and Egypt are emerging as hotspots. Calcutta holiday-makers are out in droves this year, travelling near and far in search of rest and relaxation, adrenaline-pumping adventure or just family fun. And the horizon is getting wider as the old favourites battle it out with newer pastures. Going international is the vacation mantra for summer travellers in Calcutta, and the borders are fading fast, as travel agents rustle up tours to exotic locales.																								There has been a phenomenal number of bookings this year, so much so that we had to give a several of our clients unconfirmed seats, because there just wasnt enough available to accommodate everyone, says Stanley Rosario, executive, leisure, Thomas Cook. The numbers are definitely up from last year. 																								Topping the charts in the west is Europe  for those who can afford it  from London to Paris and beyond. It offers the right mix of business and pleasure for corporate executives and businessmen, who combine a working trip with a holiday for the family, explains Sanjoy Sett, chairman, eastern region, Travel Agents Association of India, and chief of Globe Forex and Travels. Besides, the weather is nice. Further west, the US remains a preferred choice.																								The vacation winds blowing in the easterly direction are taking travellers to Southeast Asia, on Star Cruise liners and flights. Thailand (Bangkok and Pattaya), Singapore, Malaysia and even Indonesia (Bali) are the top draws, despite no direct flights to Malaysia from Calcutta. This is the budget holiday-makers paradise, with sun, sea and sandy beaches, as well as cool hills, all easy on the pocket. Its actually cheaper to go to Thailand than Goa, adds Sett.																								What has attracted most Calcuttans looking for seashores are the Southeast cruises, which have completely sold out for May and June. Quite a reverse trend from last year, when some had to be cancelled due to the SARS scare. Further east, Australia, too, is up for grabs. However, one of the most favoured choices for Calcutta travellers has slipped in the ratings this year. Nepal is losing out due to the political problems in the region. It was one of the hottest destinations. Now, passengers are a little scared, since there is a problem every other day, observes Suman Bhattacharya, manager, leisure, Cox amp; Kings. That though, hasnt deterred some, since the flights are going full up and cancellations find replacements.																								Among domestic destinations, Darjeeling and Gangtok rule the roost, says Manoj Saraf of Gainwell Travels and Tours, a member of the conglomerate Budget Tours. But Orissa, with Puri and Bhubaneswar on the itinerary, continue to hold sway. Internationally, Southeast is popular anytime. I even sent a large group to Bali this year. South Africa is picking up as a new destination, adds Saraf. Sri Lanka is the place with potential for Cox amp; Kings, and Egypt shows promise for Thomas Cook. Globe Forex is promoting South Africa. We have a package for China at Cox amp; Kings, but that attracted very few people, points out Bhattacharya.																								The footloose-and-fancy-free Calcutta traveller no longer faces limited options, and is spoilt for choice at home and abroad. So, if you missed out this summer, pack your bags and plan ahead for the Pujas, because there will be plenty of new offerings for October. 																								If you have the money, we can send you anywhere you want to go. There are no limits, sums up Sett.						 NISHA LAHIRI

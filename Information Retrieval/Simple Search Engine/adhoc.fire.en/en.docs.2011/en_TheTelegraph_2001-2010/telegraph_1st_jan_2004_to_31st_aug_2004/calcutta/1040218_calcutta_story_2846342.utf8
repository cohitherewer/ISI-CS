The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Wheel, deal amp; grease palm
 JULIUS GOMES AND BHAJAN GANGULY 																								After 10 pm, the taxi lanes at Howrah station are converted into avenues of extortion. The victims: passengers arriving by late-night trains and desperate to reach home or hotel.																								With no alternative mode of transport available once the pre-paid counters shut down and buses settle in for the night, passengers turn hapless victims of a vicious cycle, involving politicians, policemen, touts and taxi drivers.																								A candid confession of why cabbies at the station turn villains after dark came from a taxi driver: This city doesnt have a half-down meter system like other metros, which allows for extra night charges. Here, police run a different system, so we cant go by the meter or the pre-paid rate.																								After 10.30 pm, a Shyambazar resident agreed to pay Rs 200 as the pre-decided taxi fare from Howrah station. Another man, headed towards Tollygunge, had to pay Rs 400. As the touts gathered around them, both had no choice but to comply.																								Challenging a rogue cabbie about the absurd late-night fare invariably brings another vital cog in the extortion play into the picture  the men in uniform.																								Striking the bonnets with their batons, they order the cabbie to hurry up (Ei, taratari kor). Under pressure from the taxi driver to agree to the preposterous demand and the cops to get a move on, all that most passengers want to do is get out of the station premises.																								For this small favour  the subtle pressure tactic  the cop gets Rs 20. The man wielding the baton says nothing if the taxi driver doesnt pay up, but any cabbie unwilling to cough up the token amount faces the prospect of bigger cases  mostly false, insist the men behind the wheel  involving heavy fines and seizure of documents.																								A north Calcutta-bound taxi driver was spotted greasing the palms of a GRP constable standing guard by the pre-paid taxi counter. We have to pay Rs 20 per taxi after 10 pm every night to avoid false cases being slapped on us, he explained.																								Sunil Mullick, superintendent of railway police (Howrah), hinted that he was aware of police personnel accepting bribes from taxi drivers, but pointed out the problem posed by no official complaints on the matter.																								If any written complaint comes to me about any of my staff indulging in corrupt practices, I will initiate action against the culprits, promised Mullick.

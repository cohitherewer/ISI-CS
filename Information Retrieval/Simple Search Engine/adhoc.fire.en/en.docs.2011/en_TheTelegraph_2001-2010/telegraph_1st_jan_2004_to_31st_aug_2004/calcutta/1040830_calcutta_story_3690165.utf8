The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 30, 2004 Life You cant get through this week without...Tying the knotSmart girls would do well to indulge in a little brother bonding for theres much to rake in with the rakhi rage. Pamper em with funky threads and youll have every right to expect a bag of goodies in return. If you believe this give--take relationship is likely to last (ignore all those times you heard of rakhi brothers being anything but brotherly), go right ahead and grab that wrist.Cribbing about chaosDo shout out loud about the condition of roads and fume about the unfinished flyovers. With the city resembling one never-ending trench and with flyovers left hanging half-way, going from here to there is taking at least 20 minutes more than planned. As the monsoon adds to the mess, its best to brace for the worst and hope that todays pain is, indeed, tomorrows gain. Silver lining: things cant get worse  or can they?Baying for bloodGet into the filmi flow of things by planning when (starting Friday) and where to catch Rakht. Tarot cards invade tinsel town  and that too in the hands of Bips  as Mahesh Manjrekar ventures into the avaastav with his first horror film. With a cast that boasts every hot bod in town  start counting Bipasha, Amrita, Neha, Payal Rohatgi, Dino, Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Himanshu  and item numbers by Yana Gupta and Abhishek Bachchan, Rakht wont fail for eye candy. And the content? Maa Prem Ushaa jaane

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 A lakh extra for train trippers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcuttans wanderlust is proverbial. And in another six weeks or so begins the great exodus from the city. 																								Eastern Railway (ER) and South Eastern Railway (SER), to cope with the surge, have arranged for 100,000 additional berths, bookings for which began on Monday. 																								We know how people in Calcutta and the adjoining areas love to go out during the Pujas. For their convenience, well add extra coaches to some long-distance trains from the city and accommodate a lakh extra passengers, said S.R. Thakur, ERs chief operations manager.																								The New Koilaghat reservation office has recently been renovated; an electronic display board has been installed to provide current information about reservations and the number of inquiry counters has been increased. 																								Till last year, information on additional coaches was not disclosed in advance. 																								According to railway officials, this years preferred destinations are the hills and tourist spots in Orissa and South India. Mumbai and Goa are not on the list, because of the floods there. City-based travel agents, too, said that apart from the hills, most tourists are heading for Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Araku Valley and Bangalore. 																								Rail officials said additional coaches will be fitted to 11 pairs of ER trains and six pairs of SER trains. 																								The ER trains to be fitted with extra coaches are the Rajdhani Express, Doon Express, Akal Takht Express, Saraighat Express, Sealdah-Balia Express, Gour Express, Kanchenjangha Express, Kamrup Express, Purbachal Express, Sipra Express and the Darjeeling Mail. The SER trains are the Gitanjali Express, Howrah-Yashvantpura Express, Puri Express, Dhauli Express, Ranchi-Hatia-Delhi Express and the Howrah-Tata- Ahmedabad Express. 																								ER will run the additional coaches between October 13 and November 29, and SER for a month from October 15.																								Railway officials said reservation counters will remain open on Sundays and holidays. Railway commercial and vigilance officials will man the booking counters from 7 am to 10 am to prevent touts from fleecing passengers. They will countersign reservation forms and affix a serial number to each form to ensure that touts do not collect tickets in advance. 																								After the tickets are sold, the reservation forms will be scrutinised. 																								In case of any discrepancy, a railway official will visit the address mentioned to verify whether its genuine or not. 																								If the address is found to be fake, well advertise in leading newspapers and ask the passenger to call on us in person. If he fails to respond, the ticket will be cancelled and allotted to one of those on the waiting list, said a railway official.

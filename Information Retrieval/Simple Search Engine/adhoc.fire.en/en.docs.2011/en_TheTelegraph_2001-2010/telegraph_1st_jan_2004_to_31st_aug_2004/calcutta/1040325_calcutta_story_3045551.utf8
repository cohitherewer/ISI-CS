 A STAFF REPORTER Firemen fight the mysterious blaze that broke out at Remington House on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta 																								A mysterious fire broke out at Remington House, on Council House Street, gutting the first and second floors of the four-storey building on Wednesday afternoon. The building has remained sealed, on a Calcutta High Court order, for four years.																								A security guard spied smoke billowing out of the rear section and raised the alarm. Five fire tenders doused the blaze around 4 pm.No one was hurt, but a lot of documents and furniture were destroyed. We cant say exactly how the fire started or how it spread, but the possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out, said fire brigade divisional officer Dilip Basu.Shyamal Kanungo, former secretary of Remington Rand Workers and Employees Union, said the company was run as a sick industry since 1993 and was finally shut down in 2000, with outstanding labour dues. The 300-odd employees of the company then filed a case against the proprietors. The case is continuing in Calcutta High Court, with the premises remaining sealed.

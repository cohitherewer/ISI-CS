The cigar lounge at the Bodhi Bar Few things in life can be as fulfilling as dipping a Cohiba Esplendido in Laphroaig and puffing away, connoisseurs of cigars and single malt whiskies would say. While the culture of smoking cigarettes may have spread like wildfire, the less common passion for cigars has always been hailed as a passport to good taste and high living.ThenImported from Cuba and Jamaica, collecting and smoking cigars, or segars as they were initially called, is still a pleasure cherished by the rich and famous. Cigars were introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus men. While they were exploring Cuba, the crew got into the habit of smoking a rustic form of the modern cigar and brought them back to Spain, after which they spread through the continent. Spain then began manufacturing cigars with raw materials imported from Cuba, till Spain allowed Cuba to start manufacture themselves, in 1821. Thus the Cuban cigar was born. As a mark of respect, Cuba presented a box of its best cigars to the king of Spain every year. These became known as Trinidads.NowThese rich, aromatic brown sticks occupy pride of place in the plush lifestyle lounges across the city. The Bodhi Bar, the private lounge at Tantra, the nightclub at The Park, is one such place that makes for the perfect stop for an evening with the most exotic cigars and fine single malts.The most expensive variety to light up at the lounge is the Cohiba Esplendido. Priced at Rs 1,600 a piece, the seven-inch-long cigar is strong in aroma and is regarded as an option only the seasoned cigar smoker is likely to try. Vintage V, a brand that boasts of the finest tobacco, comes a close second and is priced at Rs 1,350 per piece. Hoyo De Monterrey Prince Philip and H.Upmann are also among the favourites that rule the cigar sensibility at Bodhi.Soft touchFor the woman who needs to relax in style, Romeo Y Julieta and Baron de Rothschild are the milder options. In fact, the silver-cased Romeo Y Julieta, priced at Rs 825 a piece, is what most women prefer at this lifestyle zone. Though most prefer to stick to their glass of sparkling white or red wine, when the cigar comes into play (mainly on special occasions) its Romeo Y Julieta that is ranked highest by the femmes. Partagas and Hoy Do Mont, in the price range of Rs 250 and Rs 300, are also available. Right careFor the crew at the Bodhi Bar, maintaining a collection of cigars for its high-profile guest list is not easy. The cigar can neither be soggy nor too dry when handed over to the guests.Its the storage of the cigars that needs all attention, with the temperature and relative humidity inside the humidor (the cigar case) having to be monitored with a hawk-eye.A relative humidity of 65 to 75 per cent and a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit has to be maintained for the flavour of the cigar to be just right.

 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Lakhs found in suicide flat
 																											- Discrepancies in case, says Saha duo defence; remand extended A STAFF REPORTER																								It was a long wait for members of the Saha family on Tuesday, as they assembled at the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate to hear the outcome of the bail petition filed by accused Amalendu Bikash Saha and wife Anita.																								Both are in police custody for six murders and a suicide that rocked 91/3C, Tollygunge Road on the morning of July 18. Proceedings started around 4.15 pm. Judge Shankar Nath Das, after hearing both sides, remanded Amalendu and Anita in police custody for another five days. 																								At the outset, the judge asked the investigating officer of the case to produce the accused in the courtroom before defence lawyer Tamal Mukherjee could place his side of the argument. 																								Amalendu and Anita arrived with tearful and swollen eyes, and stood in two opposite corners of the courtroom, trying to draw each others attention throughout the proceedings. 																								Lawyer Mukherjee, pleading for bail, argued: There has been no progress in the case over the past nine days. The police did not even refer the suicide note to a handwriting expert to determine whether or not it was written by Shibendu (who committed suicide after killing six members of his family). The note was not signed by him. 																								Mukherjee further argued that no documentation or corroborative evidence was found in support of the suicide note. 																								The deceased did not file a case of criminal misappropriation, criminal breach of trust or any other civil suit prior to his death. According to the suicide note, the only point is that Shibendu and his family had suffered a heavy financial loss. But is there any evidence to substantiate his claim? he added.																								Mrityunjoy Mishra, appearing for Anita Saha, told the court that according to the seizure list submitted by the police, the articles collected from the second-floor apartment of the Saha residence, where Shibendu lived with his parents, brother and family, were worth several lakhs. 																								Police have recovered Rs 50,000 in cash and gold ornaments worth several lakhs, apart from cash certificates of hefty amounts purchased in favour of Shibendus father Nabendu Bikash, and his two sons, Krishnendu being the second. If police investigations have revealed this, how can we say that they were bankrupt? Mishra said. 																								The defence lawyers argued that the accused were neither a part of a conspiracy, nor did they instigate Shibendu to commit the crime. All we can say is that Shibendu was not in his senses when he killed his family and, thus, on the basis of his statement in the suicide note, the accused cannot be held guilty, they said.

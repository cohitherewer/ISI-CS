 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Cops trace and arrest mystery caller
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								For the past year, a mystery caller made life miserable for officials of Domjur police station, in Howrah. He would introduce himself as a social worker, a Calcutta High Court judge or a chief judicial magistrate, and direct the thana officials to arrest someone or the other.																								On Thursday night, the cops tracked down the caller and arrested him. They identified him as Joydeep Mukherjee, 35. Not only was he dropping names and directing us to make arrests, he was also swindling a lot of people, said additional superintendent of police (rural) H.K. Kusumakar on Friday. 																								The unemployed Mukherjee, a resident of Chinsurah, had reportedly borrowed money from a number of people. But when the creditors asked for repayment, Mukherjee would fob them off, claiming to be related to several well-known people.																								He would call up Domjur police station and ask officials to arrest those who had forced him to return their money, another senior officer added.																								The repeated calls raised our suspicions. Well-known people generally call the superintendent or other senior officers, and not the thana-level personnel. So, we traced the phone number to Chinsurah and Mukherjees residence, an officer of Domjur police station said on Friday.																								In that call, Mukherjee had claimed to be a high court registrar and asked police to arrest Prakash Jafra, a resident of Domjur, for disturbing him. Police found that Mukherjee had borrowed money from Jafra and refused to return it to him. 																								During his arrest on Thursday night, Mukherjee repeatedly claimed that he had been framed. Mukherjee had earlier been arrested by Hooghly police for illegal possession of arms.

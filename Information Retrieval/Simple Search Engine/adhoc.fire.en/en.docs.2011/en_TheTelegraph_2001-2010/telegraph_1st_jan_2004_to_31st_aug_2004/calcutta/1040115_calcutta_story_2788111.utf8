																																																		Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Wednesday that he would try to talk the bus, minibus and taxi operators lobbies out of the strikes they had called on January 20 and 21 to protest rising taxes and alleged police harassment. Chakraborty, who had earlier stated that he was not interested in telling them the same thing over and over again, said he would meet the operators on January 16. The Bengal Taxi Association (BTA) and the Progressive Taximens Union have called an indefinite strike from January 20, while the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate has called a strike on January 21. According to officials, the discussion is the result of a BTA letter to Chakrabory and the chief minister seeking a discussion. Apparently, Chakraborty was asked to initiate a dialogue by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. I am willing to sit with the transport operators to solve their problems. But they are not open to reasoning. I will make another attempt. But if they want to go ahead with the strikes, so be it, said Chakraborty. He made it clear that there was no scope for any rollback of the new tax. But I am willing to look into other problems. The transport operators are non-committal on the withdrawal of the strike. If we are satisfied, we will rethink the strike call, said BTA president Bimal Guha.																																																		The state government on Wednesday announced that it would phase out the old system of pre-paid milk cards and gradually transform the existing 570 booths in and around the city into retail outlets from where milk and milk products, chicken, eggs and meat will be sold. Animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman said the government had identified 27 booths in the city and Salt Lake where pre-paid cards would not be required to get milk. The workers who operate the milk booths can now run the outlets. This way, they can earn up to 500 times their present salary as commission from their sales proceeds, he said, adding that the workers now get a salary ranging from Rs 250 to Rs 500 a month. 																																																		Are the banks unwittingly issuing fake currency notes of Rs-500 denomination? The question was asked by Trinamul Congress MLA Kalyan Banerjee. On Wednesday Banerjee, a lawyer, alleged that he had sent his clerk to withdraw Rs 49,527 from the Church Lane branch of Standard Chartered Bank and to deposit the same at the Old Post Office Street branch of United Bank of India (UBI). Accordingly, the clerk withdrew the money from Standard Chartered Bank and went to deposit the amount in UBI. But UBIs cash receiving clerk returned the Rs-500 note, claiming it was a fake. Banerjee lodged a complaint with the police.																																																		After Tuesdays ruckus at 3, Imam Box Lane in Sonagachhi, police on Wednesday arrested Namita Bhattacharjee, 34, project co-ordinator of Durbar Mahila Samanyay Committee (DMSC), and five male members, for obstructing justice and assaulting policemen. While Bhattacharjee was released on bail, Md Mehraz Gazi, Ananda Das, Montu Bhagat, Samir Das and Debendranath Mita will remain in police custody till January 27. Payal Das, 14, admitted in her statement to the police on Tuesday that she had been sold by Dipali Das from New Barrackpore and was brought to Sonagachhi by Nilima Das during the Pujas. Project director of the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society S. Suresh Kumar visited Payal at Lalbazar on Wednesday morning. Trafficking of minor girls will not be allowed, he said. The society supports DMSC with logistics and finance. Payal was sent to a home in Liluah in the afternoon.																																																		Police arrested Nazeez, one of the three suspects in the Imran Khan murder case, after a raid in Beniapukur on Wednesday. The motive for the killing has not been ascertained. Khan, 26, was shot dead on Tuesday at Chatu Babu Lane in Entally. People saw three youths fleeing the spot immediately after Khan was shot. Police suspected Khans long-time accomplices Nazeez, Akeel and Bablu to be involved, and conducted raids to net them.

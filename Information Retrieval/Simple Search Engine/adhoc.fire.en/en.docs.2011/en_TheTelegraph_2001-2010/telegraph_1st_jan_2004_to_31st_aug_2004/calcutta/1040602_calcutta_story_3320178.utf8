The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Poll shadow on 10-lane airport road
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The 10-lane road connecting Sector III of Salt Lake to the airport is ready for use, but the government may not be able to open it on June 5, as scheduled.																								The inauguration is subject to a nod from state election commissioner Ajay Sinha, since the VIP Road-end of Calcuttas first 10-lane road falls under the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, which goes to the elections on June 27. 																								Being an alternative to VIP Road, this road will be the main corridor for entering the city, minister for housing Gautam Deb announced on Tuesday.																								There are no 10-lane roads in Calcutta. The widest is the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, which is a five-lane road. This road has taken Rs 75 crore to build and will last 100 years, Deb promised. 																								The road is also the main connector with the new Rajarhat township, which, with a projected area of 3,075 hectares, will accommodate a residential population of 7.5 lakh and a floating population of 2.5 lakh. 																								The township has been divided into three sectors : Sector I between Kestopur and Bagjola canals, which is almost ready. Sector II comprises the space from Bagjola canal to the airport fringes, where construction work is under progress, while Sector III comprises the eastern side of the township, where land acquisition is underway.																								It will have two shopping malls, several banks, schools, an engineering college and a central business district, housing offices of IT majors in addition to offices of the BSF and CRPF and a host of other organisations. 																								Coal India has also taken a 15-acre plot there for shifting its office from central Calcutta, Deb said. 																								A plot has been allotted to Delhi Public School, while the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency has booked a 1.7-acre plot, where it will build bungalows using non-conventional sources of energy. The bungalows will not have power or water supply, but will use solar power and recycled water, he added.																								Three artificial waterbodies, covering a total of 105 hectares, have been created in the new township, which, according to Deb, will be three times the size of Rabindra Sarobar.																								 A total of 5,693 plots have been allotted so far to individuals, cooperative societies and bulk cooperatives, while 3,290 flats are in the final stages. 																								The township will get 20 million gallons of water daily from the Mullickghat pumping station under a new project by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Salt Lake will also get an additional 20 million gallons under the new project.																								Housing amp; Infrastructure Development Corporation needs a total of Rs 4,000 crore to develop the township, of which it has already spent Rs 1,000 crore, Deb added. The state government is expecting an investment of Rs 25,000 crore to be made in the new township.

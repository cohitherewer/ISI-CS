The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Lies can travel half the earth while truth ties its shoelaces
Metro Matters / Uttam SenguptaLife is pleasant. Death is peaceful. Its the transition that is troublesome  Mathew Arnold.																								Well, the city last week had little or no patience with either philosophy or, for that matter, humour, as it passionately clamoured for death to the infamous Dhananjoy Chatterjee, rapist and killer of a schoolgirl.																								Students of Welland Gouldsmith School, where the victim had studied before she was killed 14 years ago, signed a petition to the President, urging him to turn down the mercy petition pending before him. And school principal Gillian DCosta Hart went on national television and cried for justice to the victim and death to the killer.																								The hysteria generated by the controversy, one would like to believe, has left many feeling uneasy. The thought of schoolchildren being prompted to demand death for a fellow-human is disturbing, though not many appeared to even bat an eyelid. One can imagine Ms Hart spitting out the word naive as she did on a televised debate with Soli Sorabjee and Chatterjees counsel Colin Gonsalves. Death penalty alone, she advocated, could set an example and act as a deterrent. Those who believe otherwise are all naive, she said with conviction.																								Statistics or facts do not quite support her stand. The record from the United States, which boasts of the most sophisticated forensic and investigative tools and among the most effective police forces, is revealing. The death penalty, with close to 100 executions every year, has failed to act as a deterrent against violent crime.																								Whats more, many of those who are convicted to death, seemingly after extensive investigation and an exhaustive trial, are actually freed from the death row with fresh evidence surfacing to prove their innocence. In Illinois, for example, more people have been freed from the death row than executed since 1977. One of them, Anthony Porter, spent 15 years on death row, and was only two days away from being executed, when a group of committed college students convinced the court that they had proof of his innocence. Such examples are not really rare and law journals record cases of many Americans sentenced to death who were grudgingly granted their freedom after their innocence was established.																								If corrupt police and prosecutors can frame people, plant evidence and intimidate witnesses in the US, Ms Hart would surely concede that chances in our own land of people getting framed are greater. Lies have a habit of growing into perceived truth, as Mark Twain had observed: A lie can travel half-way around the world while truth is just putting on its shoes.																								The curious case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, quite apart from the moral issues involved, raises many uncomfortable queries. He escaped, but rather than leave immediately for the Mumbai underworld, he hid in his own village home. He confessed to his crime but could he have done it because he was told that a confession would prompt a pardon or a reprieve? Was he a mentally deranged man, a sex maniac, a hardened killer or a fool?																								We must not also lose sight of the fact that every year, this country records around 40,000 murders and the figure does not include unintentional killings, killing by law-enforcing agencies or riots or murders which pass off as accidents. Rapes are hardly less frequent and in most cases, the rapist is known to the victim or even related. Rapes followed by murder are also not uncommon. Why is it that only on rare occasions our collective conscience responds hysterically?																								The overwhelming sentiment of the city appears to favour death to the convict. Given the citys volatile temperament, it does not come as a surprise. It could also be a fallout of a herd mentality or an emotional exercise. But the city also boasts of rationality and one waits to see a more reasoned response to the issue.

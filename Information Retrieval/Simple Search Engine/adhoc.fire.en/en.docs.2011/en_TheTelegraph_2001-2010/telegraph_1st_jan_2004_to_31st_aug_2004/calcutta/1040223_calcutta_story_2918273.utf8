 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Designed in harmony with healthcare
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A quiet, clinically clean, soothing and pleasant ambience created through the quality of colours, textures, light, spatial and volumetric compositions of form and function fused with balanced, maintainable landscaping. 																								Design solutions to provision for adequate movement of services, unidirectional airflow, disposal of bio-medical waste, proper doctor-patient interaction.																								In other words, an ideal healthcare environment, something that can only be created with critical inputs from architects at the conceptualisation stage. 																								This was the essence of debate and discourse at the annual convention of the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA), West Bengal chapter, which had Architecture for healthcare environment as its focal theme. State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, too, felt involving architects in hospital projects could have its pluses.																								Surgeon Dipak Mukherjee set the tenor for the doctor-architect-manager-developer interface at Swabhumi. Minute details, like designing of corridors and the waiting area, size and speed of elevators, engineering of air-circulation pattern to prevent airborne infection, must be taken into account while building a hospital, and only qualified architects can provide such inputs, he said.																								A.K. Sanyal, managing director of Peerless Hospital, said hospitals must budget for the higher life expectancy now (up 64.6 from 36.7 in 1951) and lay more emphasis on the management of non-communicable, stress-related and lifestyle diseases, like diabetes, hypertension and cardiac disorders. 																								Praising the Paris-based Hospitex Ltd for the original concept design of Peerless Hospital, Sanyal said: Good architecture is the fulcrum of a successful healthcare project.																								According to IIA chapter chairman and senior architect Dulal Mukherjee, the success of a good hospital design strategy lies in how an architect can enmesh form, function and an aesthetic and psychologically compassionate atmosphere within and without the building.																								Another veteran city-based architect, Prabir Mitra, felt a hospital plan has to be very pragmatic, with details for clockwork-precision and the architect cant just go fancy-free. Subhash Chakraborty, architect and consultant to the World Bank, lamented there was no systematic documentation of the work of past British masters in this city.																								It is extremely crucial to strike a happy balance in a healthcare facility between being administration-friendly and user-friendly, felt Rana Mukherjee, consultant surgeon, Westbank Hospital. He stressed on the need to get the design team on board as soon as a hospital project is finalised.

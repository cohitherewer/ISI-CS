The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Book fair at usual venue
 																											- Settlers on Bypass permanent fair ground refuse to vacate DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is facing tough opposition from a group of settlers on the 10-acre plot at Hatiagachha, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, earmarked for a permanent fair ground.																								The government plans to shift all major fairs earlier held on the Maidan to the plot, but the residents refuse to budge.																								This, however, could prove a reprieve for book-lovers: Calcutta Book Fair may not be relocated this year, after all. The impasse has forced the state government to give its nod to the book fair being held at its usual venue. 																								We had a meeting with the state government and convinced it that the book fair is a major event, listed in the international fair calendar, and a shift of venue would entail a lot of hassles, said Kalyan Shah, general secretary, Publishers and Booksellers Guild.																								The relocation project suffered a major setback on August 3, when the settlers refused to vacate. A team from Tiljala police station and the Rapid Action Force had to bring the situation under control. 																								The state government has asked us to evict the settlers from the plot by August 15 and we have conveyed to them the decision, said an officer of the local police station. 																								The squatters, however, claimed they had legal documents to prove their right to the plot. They, led by Arpan Sarkar and Satyaranjan Roy, met the local CPM councillor Lakshmimoni Banerjee. The residents had come to me and I am aware that most of them have valid land deeds. I sympathise with them and have assured them that they will not be evicted, Banerjee said.																								Local Trinamul Congress MLA Nirmal Mondol, too, expressed his disgust over the development. First of all, the residents were not served an official notice. How can they be evicted without any rehabilitation? They have valid documents supporting their claims of owning the land, they have ration cards, voters identity cards and, above all, the area has a planned drainage system and water supply lines, Mondol pointed out.																								We are not against a permanent fair ground or any other development work in the city and its fringes. But how can the government render us homeless without a proper arrangement? demanded local resident Arpan Sarkar.																								We are not refugees. We own the plot. If we are evicted by force, we will lie in front of the bulldozers and give up our lives, he asserted.																								South 24-Parganas district magistrate Vivek Kumar said the residents claims would be verified before any step was taken. The land was officially handed over to the state government by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation but if the occupants claim to own it, and if the papers are genuine, we will have to make arrangements to rehabilitate and compensate them, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Reserved train seats given away
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								A passenger travelling with his asthmatic wife and other family members was in for a shock when he boarded the train  four of the six air-conditioned (AC) chair car seats he had reserved had been allotted to other passengers. The peeved passenger has now won some compensation from court.																								Girdharilal Saraf had reserved six AC chair car seats on a train from Rampurhat to Howrah. But after he boarded the compartment at Bolpur  as notified while purchasing the tickets  the travelling ticket examiner informed him that four of the six seats had been given to other passengers. A furious Saraf and family got off at Guskara and had a harrowing time getting to Howrah.																								Saraf moved Calcutta District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Unit 1, which asked Eastern Railway (ER) to pay Rs 60,000 to Saraf as compensation.																								Lawyers representing ER argued that the boarding point of the complainant party was inadvertently not recorded in the reservation register. 																								The railway authorities then appealed to the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which scaled the compensation amount to Rs 5,000, plus the price of the tickets.

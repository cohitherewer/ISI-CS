The go-ahead, he hopes, might come by the afternoon.12.20 pm: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee leaves Writers. Ive heard about it, so have you. I wont comment till theres an official intimation, he says. Bhattacharjee had spoken out in public that the government favoured Dhananjoys execution. 12.40 pm: Inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty says: I have been watching the news on TV channels since morning, but we have received no such official intimation It takes at least 21 days from the time of receiving the order to carry out the execution. 2.35 pm: Chief secretary Ashok Gupta says: I have only heard about it, just like you have.

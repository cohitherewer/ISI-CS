The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Netway paves way for Diwali debut
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With private telecom major Reliance Infocomm gearing up to roll out NetWay, the bugle has been sounded for the broadband battle in town.																								The market is being tested and the headhunt has kicked off, but market sources indicate that while the launch in some other metros can be expected by end-April, Calcutta will have to wait till Diwali for NetWay.																								Reliance officials, when contacted, declined to comment on their plans for Calcutta.																								NetWay is the broadband solution from Reliance Infocomm, providing cable television, high-speed Internet access and telephony through a single cable and on a single platform, using the high-speed fibre optic network. 																								The final stretch to the consumers home would still be through the local cablewallah.																								And in true Reliance style, price war will be a prime focus. Currently, the likes of MTNL and Bharti are offering broadband services at around Rs 3,500 a month, with a deposit of Rs 15,000. Though Reliance officials wouldnt say, sources spoke of a monthly rate of Rs 1,200.																								The key to the NetWay technology lies in a set-top box being developed indigenously by Reliance. Billed to provide TV channels, high-speed Internet access and value-added services like pay TV, audio and video on demand and video-conferencing, it will also have significant storage capacity for recording television programmes.																								According to plans, the box will initially be given free to cable operators and subscribers, to push the product and address the under-declaration issue.																								The local competition, however, didnt sound too flustered by Reliances imminent entry. A spokesperson for BSNL, coming up with its own broadband solutions, felt more players can only open up the market.																								Talks are on at the highest level and we are coming into broadband in a big way, the spokesperson revealed on Monday. BSNL will first concentrate on high-speed Internet services.																								The mood in the cable fraternity is also one of wait-and-watch. Their project is at the testing stage currently. They have to formulate a viable business plan, streamline the marketing aspects and make it affordable for the common man, said the spokesperson for a multi-system operator.

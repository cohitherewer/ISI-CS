The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 A date with Amit Chaudhuri
																								Amit Chaudhuri is very much a Calcuttan despite the fact that he grew up in Mumbai and later went on to study at Balliol College, Oxford. He continued his academic career abroad, taking up teaching assignments in various universities. By the time his first novel was published, another facet of his talent came to the fore. Already considered one of the major contemporary Indo-Anglican authors, Chaudhuri has penned four novels, a collection of short stories, a scholarly study, and an anthology of Indian literature. His works have been translated into various languages. He is the recipient of several major national and international awards. But that is not all. Chaudhuri is also a talented classical singer. He took to Hindustani classical music when he was in his teens and since has devoted whole-heartedly to mastering this art. A disciple of late Pandit Govind Jaipurwale of Kunwar Shyam gharana and the Tulsidas Gosain gharana of Jaipur, known for its intricate tankaari and layakari and its reposeful, meend-based alaap, Chaudhuri is one of the very few living exponents of this genre. CIMA adda hosts a vocal recital by Chaudhuri interspersed with readings from his books, specially Afternoon Raag, with his own comments and reflections. The evening will be an exploration of how music forms a thread that weaves different facets together.																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: CIMA Gallery, Sunny Towers, 43 Asutosh Chowdhury Avenue

 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 The human predicament
																								Natyam presents two one-act plays that have been woven around similar themes but have received diametrically opposite treatments and have, therefore, developed into two strikingly contrasting genres, those of tragedy and comedy. Juddhakshetre Picnic (picture left) revolves around the situation that young boys find themselves embroiled in when they are made into soldiers who have to fight their enemies  also young men like themselves  in the name of nationalism. The play conveys a serious message, but is well within the parameters of a comedy so that the seriousness is well concealed within a cloak of humour. In a sharp contrast to Juddhakshetre Picnic is Manoj Mitras Ashwatthama, which is a poignant tale that recounts the last phase in the life of this great warrior from The Mahabharata. It is the heros search for his enemy that forms the crux of this play and is the reason behind his death. Ashwatthama epitomizes the crisis of the modern man who is suspended in an abstract limbo of an eternal search that ultimately consumes him in its intensity.																								Event: Two short plays, Juddhakshetre Picnic and Ashwatthama, produced by Natyam																								When: Today at 6.45 pm 																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Sterner test after laxity rap
 																											- Certificates refused to 2,000 cars as govt tightens emission belt SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								A laxity rap from Calcutta High Court has forced the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to clean up at least part of its anti-pollution act.																								After the court had pointed out how faulty the system of tail-pipe tests was and how flawed was the vigilance, the state machinery has now tightened the emission belt. As a result, at least 2,000 vehicles have failed to meet the basic standards in the past month.																								Transport department officials confirmed on Thursday that the mandatory pollution under control (PUC) certificates have recently been refused to around 2,000 vehicles, mainly private cars and taxis.																								Surprisingly, some of those vehicles were bought five years ago, while the rest were between seven and 10 years old. We have given the owners 15 days to make the necessary rectifications and return for a second test, said a senior public vehicles department (PVD) official.																								PVD director H. Mohan said vehicles that had failed to meet emission norms would not be allowed to pay taxes or renew permits and certificates of fitness. A PUC certificate is mandatory for the transfer or sale of cars, stressed Mohan.																								With a sterner eye being cast, a majority of the 350,000 private cars and 40,000 taxis plying in the city could find it difficult to pass the emission test, since 80 per cent of the vehicles are between 10 and 15 years old.																								Though it is not mandatory for vehicles to conform to Bharat Stage II norms, as per the Centres notification and the modified judgment of Calcutta High Court, they must meet the emission standards set by Delhi.																								We have found that a large section of car-owners has obtained PUC certificates from testing centres either through manipulation or bribe. A large number of testing machines was also found to be faulty, said a senior PVD inspector.																								After introducing stricter norms and scanning the test results, we found a large number of vehicles falling below the desirable standard. Those who failed to pass the test will either have to change the engines or opt for LPG, he added.																								Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary of the state pollution control board, said most of the PUC certificates carried by the vehicle-owners were useless, since the machines used for the tests were faulty and the process of testing was unscientific. 																								If the tests are carried out properly, many would fail miserably. Moreover, many old cars would not be able to pass the emission tests if a four-gas analyser machine is used. These new machines will be installed in a couple of months, Sarkar said.

	Underground water reservoirs will dry up very soon if the construction boom continues in the city without proper planning. As more water is being consumed in a locality with more people than one where the density is less, ecological imbalances are bound to occur.

	The Calcutta Municpal Corporation had dug up Motilal Gupta Road in Behala, from James Long Sarani to Muchipara, in about 14 places to reconnect domestic and industrial users to a new pipeline with improved water pressure. But the roads havent yet been repaired.
	 D.J. Basu, Barisha.

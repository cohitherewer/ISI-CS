 																											- High court throws out suits filed by advocates for business gains OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Prodded by a Supreme Court ruling, Calcutta High Court on Friday pulled up two public interest litigation (PIL) petitioners  both of them advocates  for allegedly seeking to fulfil either personal or business interests through their actions.																								The high court on Friday rejected a petition after directing one petitioner to pay Rs 10,000 to the respondent as cost of the case. The other petitioner, after being severely censured by the court, withdrew his petition.																								A three-bench judge of the apex court, while rejecting a PIL, had observed that some people were moving such litigation under the instigation of a third party that was often motivated by gains in business.																								The bench held that courts should not entertain such petitions and asked the high courts to take stern action against such petitioners.																								Calcutta High Court advocate Tirthankar Das had moved a PIL before the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee alleging that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had handed over eight acres of land off the EM Bypass to a company that had quoted lower than a competitor.																								The advocate urged the court to ask the CMC to hand over the plot to the company that had placed a higher tender bid.																								CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh informed the court that the land had first been sold to the Taj Group for a hotel. But the Taj Group changed plans and demanded a refund of Rs 10.76 crore from the CMC for handing the plot over.																								My client then issued a tender and after the first bidder failed to pay the amount in time, the borough committee and the mayor-in-council decided to hand over the land to second-highest bidder, Ghosh added.																								When the petitioner failed to explain his interest in the matter, the bench rejected his petition and asked him to pay Rs 10,000 to the CMC as cost for the case.																								High court lawyer Mohanji Ojha had moved a PIL before the same bench, alleging that the CMC had wrongfully engaged a party for the construction of a water treatment plant at Palta. Ojha had submitted technical data about the water treatment plants with the tender documents appended to an affidavit.																								When Chief Justice Mathur asked the lawyer how he knew about the technology of the treatment plant and who had supplied the tender document, Ojha could not come up with a satisfactory explanation.																								The court then said it would reject the petition and impose the cost. Ojha promptly requested the court to allow him to withdraw the petition.

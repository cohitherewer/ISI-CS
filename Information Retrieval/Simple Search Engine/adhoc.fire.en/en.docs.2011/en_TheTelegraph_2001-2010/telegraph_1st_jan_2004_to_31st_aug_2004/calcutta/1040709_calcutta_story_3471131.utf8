 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Court removes rent controller
 																											- Appointment not in accordance with the law, rules judge OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the state government to remove B.N. Haldar from the post of rent controller, Calcutta, as his appointment was not in accordance with the law.																								Justice P.C. Ghosh said if the order was not carried out, the court would have no option but to quash the notification by which the government had appointed Haldar to the post.																								The order follows a petition filed by P.K. Papat, owner of several houses in Calcutta, challenging the appointment of an executive officer as rent controller, though a high court ruling had asked the government to appoint a judicial officer to the post.																								Petitioners counsel pointed out that the government had not made any gazette notification before appointing Haldar. State counsel, however, showed a notification, but that did not satisfy the judge. The appointment had been made on the basis of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997, but Haldar was performing his duties as per the rules of the amended Act of 2000.																								The rent controller is presiding over landlord-tenant disputes according to the amended Act. But the Act has no provision for a rent controller to hear landlord-tenant disputes. A rent controller appointed on the basis of the previous Act has no authority to hear the cases, Papats counsel argued.																								He also contended that the government had violated an earlier order of the court by appointing an executive officer to the post. Justice D.P. Kundu of the same court had passed a directive in 2000, asking the state government to appoint a judicial officer to the post, the petitioners lawyer pointed out.																								The petitioner demanded that since the directive was not met, the civil courts should be allowed to hear legal disputes between landlords and tenants.																								He said: Haldar has no authority to keep public money with him. He should be asked to hand over the amount to the government agencies.																								The legal tussle over Haldars appointment has thrown the government in a fix. A spokesman of the state judicial department, however, said: We think the problem will be sorted out shortly. Let the court order arrive. We will surely find a way out.

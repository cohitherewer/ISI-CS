 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Change of guard boon for B-school
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 SPECIAL BONDING: Happy faces at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta Alumni Association annual meet. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								As a new government took oath in the Capital, a band of old B-school boys and girls was raising a toast of relief back in Calcutta.																								On Saturday evening, the city chapter of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta Alumni Association organised its annual meet, which saw present students, alumni and faculty members trooping in and collectively breathing easy with the change of guard in Delhi.																								Dr Manmohan Singh is symbolic of future policies that will give more autonomy and greater fiscal responsibilities to the IIMs. We think the phase of authoritarianism is over, said Amitava Bose, former director, IIM Calcutta.																								According to Bose (who joined the Delhi School of Economics as teacher the same year as Prime Minister Singh) and most of his colleagues, the relationship between the IIMs and Shastri Bhavan (headquarters of the ministry of human resource development) will definitely improve and the process of consultative approach for decision-making will be back. 																								The processes of governance were flouted by the ministry and we expect not to have to deal with that any more, pointed out Ashis Bhattacharyya, dean, planning and administration, IIM Calcutta.																								Outgoing human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi had unilaterally decided on a fee cut at the IIMs and slashed the annual sum from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000. The BJP strongman, who even lost the elections from Allahabad, had also put the institutes under pressure to sign an annual MoU with the government, scrap the common admission test and increase the number of students. Following resistance from the premier institutes, the fee cut issue took a legal turn and is now pending with the Supreme Court.																								But the fee-cut fracas could now be a thing of the past, with the Joka faculty announcing its future plans  setting up a new campus, launching new courses  and inviting the alumni to be part of the dream.																								Putting in place a structured alumni-institute network has been on our agenda for some time and we thought we must get involved with the alumni meet and kick off the process with a bang, said Anup Sinha, dean, programme initiative, IIM Calcutta. Given the attention the institute has been drawing for some time, the timing could not have been better, he added.																								And while the Calcutta crowd was taking a melody-filled trip down memory lane, the alumni in Delhi were also meeting under one roof. 																								Our director Shekhar Chaudhury is in Delhi for the meet. In the next month or so, we will organise similar events in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai to reach out to our ex-students, said Sinha, while seeking all possible support from former students.																								The alumni association, meanwhile, has decided to make its presence felt in the city and is in talks with the state government to pitch in on some projects. 																								Whatever I am today is because of the institute. This place is different and the bonding with the people from here will be special, summed up Purnendra Kishore, in-charge of SAPs business in the region.

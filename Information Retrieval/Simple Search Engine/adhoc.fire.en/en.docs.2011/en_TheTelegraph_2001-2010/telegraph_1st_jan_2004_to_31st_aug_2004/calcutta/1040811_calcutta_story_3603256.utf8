The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Ring in a penalty for every call
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should members of the audience be penalised if their cellphones ring during a performance in an auditorium? More letters will be published next week In times of peace: A performance during Nandikars theatre festival four years agoAmartya Bera,
																		Belur Math																																																														Members of the audience should be penalised if their cellphones ring during a performance in an auditorium as this distracts the performer on stage. Sometimes fancy or peculiar ring tones irritate others among the audience as well.									

Subham Chakraborty, 
																		Serampore																																																														Penalty should be a must for anyone whose cellphone disturbs a performance in an auditorium. But the questions remains as to who should impose that punishment on the phone user  the authorities of the auditorium or the organisers of the programme? Perhaps, the answer is both. PratyayY Banerjee, 
																		Tollygunge																																																														There are now enough options for people to be alerted while keeping their mobiles switched on. The entire set can be put on silent mode and the user can receive messages noiselessly. Even if the cell is switched off, the user can get informed about missed calls later. If the guilty member of the audience is penalised, it will make him think twice before entering a hall with his cellphone on.									

Surangana Basu, 
																		Parnarsree 																																																														Every performing art requires an peaceful ambience and intense concentration. It is obscene to break the mood. Often the ringing of cellphones in an auditorium takes the fizz out of a performance. Both the performer and the audience get vexed. We should protest against such insensible attitudes, and rally for penalty for the guilty.									

Tapan Pal, 
																		Batanagar 																																																														Not only should the guilty be penalised, the amount of the fine should be hefty. If a person cannot remain unconnected for a couple of hours, he had better not spoil the mood of others enjoying the show. Service providers should develop cell-etiquette norms and sensitise subscribers about them. 									

Tanmoy Das Lala,
																		Salt Lake																																																														Phones are useful devices for receiving information in an emergency. There should be no problem if a call is received without disturbing the performers and the audience. In case of speaking on the phone, the user should go outside the auditorium. But if the ring distracts others, the person should be immediately forced to pay a heavy fine. Rimli Datta,
																		Salt Lake 																																																														Members of the audience should not be penalised if their cellphones ring during a performance in an auditorium. One cannot penalise anyone for or bar anyone from carrying it as this device has become an integral part of our lives. People can be instructed to minimise the volume of their ringtones or be ordered to leave the set outside the auditorium.T.R. Anand,
																		Budge Budge																																																														Members of the audience in an auditorium should be penalised severely if their cellphones ring during a show. Certain halls in the city employ search teams to locate mobile phones among the audience. It would be great if all halls employed the same measure and imposed heavy fines on those disturbing others by keeping their mobile phones on during a performance or a show. 									

Sushma Jalan,
																		Alipore																																																														People in the audience have to realise how the use of their cellphones can disturb a show. The phone can easily be put on vibrator mode so that it rings inaudibly. Moreover, emergency messages can be received via SMS. Why not ban cellphones totally during performances? This might send the right message across to an insensitive audience.Purnima Vasudeva, 
																		Rowland Road																																																														If a cellphone rings during a performance or a show, it could be for an emergency. If not, the phone should be switched off. But if someone in the audience talks on the phone during a performance, he should be definitely penalised. It is irritating for others in the auditorium trying to concentrate on the show. 									

Indranil Sengupta, 
																		Salt Lake 																																																														No, viewers should not be hauled up for using cellphones, which have become indispensible in our day-to-day lives as the most important mode of communication. The audience could be requested to put their phones on silent mode so that the ringing does not disturb others. A penalty might keep people away from live shows, which is certainly not desirable. 									

Sumant Poddar, 
																		Kyd Street																																																														For those who do not have the vibrator facility in their phones, the next best option is to keep their mobile phones switched off. A system of monetary penalisation with a one-time warning, or announcements to have mobile phones switched off or set in vibrator mode at every break might do the trick. Sometimes, it so happens that older people hardly know all the features available on their cellphones. But that is not really an excuse.									

Indranil Sanyal,
																		Dhakuria																																																														The different ringtones followed by whispers in an auditorium during a performance irritate the audience and, most importantly, the performer, no end. This practice should be curbed. Auditorium authorities must penalise offenders so they think twice before using cellphones during a show.Neha Almal, 
																		Howrah 																																																														The audience should be requested either to switch off or put their mobile phones on silent mode. If, despite such warnings, someone uses his phone during a performance or show, he ought to be fined. After all, one has to pay a price for disrespecting others needs. 									

Rajarshi Ghosh, 
																		Surya Nagar 																																																														Members of the audience should be penalised if their cellphones ring during a performance in an auditorium. It irritates everyone. When someone enters an auditorium, he must switch his cellphone off. Keeping it on silent or vibrator mode does not help because the user almost always receives the call and starts talking. 									

Anandadip Chowdhury,
																		Address not given																																																														If a member of the audience is expecting an urgent call, he can activate the vibrator and take the call stepping out of the auditorium. Punishment, however, cannot keep this problem in check until people realise the impact of a phone ringing in an auditorium. Vaijayanta Chattoraj,
																		Bowbazar 																																																														It is the civic duty of the members of the audience to keep their cellphones switched off during a performance. If using a cellphone disturbs others, the offender should be penalised.									

Purvi Thacker,
																		Address not given																																																														Cellphones should not be allowed in theatres and cinemas as they disturb and distract the audience. The offender should be punished.									

Kaushik Guha, 
																		SN Roy Road																																																														Yes, a person whose cellphone rings inside an auditorium should be penalised. Auditorium authorities should display a notice board requesting patrons to switch their cell phones off inside the auditorium. They could also make arrangements for keeping a deposit of cellphones at the entrance of the hall as is done with bicycles and motorbikes in railway stations and ferry ghats.									

Stuti Agarwal, 
																		Beleghata 																																																														Yes, members of the audience should definitely be penalised if this happens because the ringing of cellphone hampers the concentration of the performers.Ali asgar Poonawala, 
Rafi Ahmed Kidwai RoadYes, a member of the audience should definitely be penalised if his cellphone rings during a performance. A lot of hard work and concentration goes into any performance. No one has the right to distract the performer and hamper the show. 									

Md Yajij Ali,
																		Salt Lake																																																														Cellphones ringing during a performance disturb the audience. The cellphone-owner can easily spare the performer and the others this irritation by setting the phone on vibrator mode. It is common social etiquette.

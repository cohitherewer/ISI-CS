 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Bangla youth gang cleans up 12 lakh 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Bangladeshi gang of thieves broke into an office located in Mangoe Lane near BBD Bag early on Wednesday and escaped with Rs 12 lakh in cash, police said. Less than 24 hours later, one of the gang members was arrested, and Rs 50,000 was found on him. The names and whereabouts of other other gang members, all in their teens or early twenties, were extracted from him.																								We arrested Mohammad Sohail, 18, in the Maheshtala area today and recovered Rs 50,000 from him, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department (I). After a round of interrogation, we got the names of his accomplices, including the kingpin. It is also evident now that none of the thieves had any prior knowledge about the money in the vault. They had previously conducted several similar raids, sometimes getting lucky. Last nights haul seems to be the biggest. 																								According to police, around 2 am, the Bangladeshi gang entered the premises of O.P. Gupta and Company, a private firm with six or seven subsidiaries involved in a variety of business activities, through the exhaust vent after removing the fan. The crooks then proceeded to break open a vault and cleaned out all the cash, before making a smooth getaway.																								The sleuths of the Calcutta Police Detective Department took over the case on Wednesday and swung into action, employing their network of informers, and arrested Sohail from a Maheshtala residence. The crook had not expected the police to catch up with him so soon, and the element of surprise worked to the sleuths benefit. 																								During interrogation, Sohail revealed that the gang had been operating in the business district for a while and was monitoring the movements of both police patrols as well as private security guards. They had planned their moves accordingly, making sure they went undetected when they broke into the office room. However, they had no idea that the hit would yield so much money, and had selected the target at random. 																								The proprietor arrived later in the morning as usual and unlocked the gate of the office. Moments afterwards, staff members rushed into the office room after hearing a cry. Gupta was standing in a state of shock before the empty vault that stared back at him, the door wide open. Accompanied by some staff members, Gupta then went to Hare Street police station and lodged an FIR. A police team was sent to examine the crime scene but returned clueless.																								It was a clean operation, an officer of Hare Street police station said. The thieves had removed the exhaust fan, climbed into the exhaust vent and entered the office room. They located the vault, broke it open, took the money, and left the way they came. The only thing we were sure of was that all the thieves were young and agile, judging by the way they had made their entrance.

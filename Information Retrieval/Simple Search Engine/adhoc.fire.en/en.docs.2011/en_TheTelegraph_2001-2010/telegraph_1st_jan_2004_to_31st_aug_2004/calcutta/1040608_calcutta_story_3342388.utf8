 A STAFF REPORTER			Hell hath no fury as a policemans wife robbed. With law-keepers rendered victims of law-breakers, 50 agitated wives of policemen belonging to the Government Railway Police (GRP) ganged up and rushed into the office of the superintendent of railway police, Sealdah, on Monday. Their point of protest: the rising number of thefts at the housing complex for policemen near the Chitpur railway yard.																								The law-enforcers louder halves spent more than half-an-hour at the office, seeking an explanation from the GRP boss. They threatened to return and intensify their agitation if steps were not taken to curb crime.																								The demonstrators alleged that the housing estate, in which the families of railway, Calcutta and state policemen live, has become a soft target for thieves in the past 10 days. During this period, three quarters were burgled and six break-in attempts were made. All these incidents were recorded in the crime book of Chitpur police station, but no one has been arrested so far.																								GRP sources said a tight security ring had been thrown around the housing estate during the tenure of former railway police superintendent Gangeshwar Singh. With four guards patrolling the premises, the theft and burglary count had dropped.																								The security ring was withdrawn by W. Karketta after he replaced Singh last March. The thieves took full advantage of the situation, said a GRP officer. All three quarters were burgled when the policemen were on leave and out of town. The thieves broke open the locks so expertly that even neighbours heard nothing, he added.																								The thieves were smart enough to bolt from outside the room next to the quarters they targeted, so that no one could interrupt their operation, revealed another official.																								The cops wives on Monday asked railway police superintendent Nabarun Bhattacharya why the security ring had been withdrawn. It helped us a lot. At least, we could sleep without fear, said an agitator.																								Bhattacharya pacified the all-woman brigade by assuring them that he would look into the matter and take appropriate measures as soon as possible.																								This is, undoubtedly, shameful. If policemen cannot save their own homes from thieves, how can people trust them to protect their houses? These thefts have tarnished the image of policemen, said one of the angry wives.																								Law-keeping, after all, must begin at home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Soccer skipper to style guru
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 Bhaichung Bhutia struts the catwalk during a fashion show at the conclusion of World Bamboo Conference in New Delhi in March 2004. (AFP)																								The hair gelled and spiky, the suit sitting snug on wiry frame, the comments a shade less impressive than the look the portrait of a soccer expert as style guru.																								Bhaichung Bhutia is our local flavour in the football frenzy in far-off Portugal. The Indian soccer skipper has not quite made it to Lisbon, but hes pleasantly parked in the Singapore studios of ESPN. Impeccably turned out  night in, night out  in colour-coordinated jacket and tie, gelled spiky hair to boot, Bhaichung is a constant as the analyst from Asia for Euro 2004.																								Apart from bringing the greatest European tournament live, we wanted to provide the viewers in India a relatable element, says an ESPN Star Sports (ESS) spokesperson. Analysis and comments by our own soccer hero, we felt, would add that extra excitement for the viewer, he adds.																								Calcutta, of course, is in strong ESS focus, with the city accounting for over 30 per cent of its promotions to push product Euro 04. And the boy from Sikkim, who now lives in Salt Lake, has emerged as an off-field star, for reasons more sartorial than soccer.																								The look, Bhaichung insists and ESS agrees, is completely his own. Its probably because people dont see me in formals much, that it looks different to them, says one of the citys popular party people, from Singapore.																								The formal dress code was in keeping with the official tone and style of the programme, but the spiky hair was a completely personal touch, clarifies the ESS spokesperson. Ive always had spiky hair and have regularly used gel too, adds Bhaichung.																								The look has suited the footballer, who had modelled outfits made of bamboo shoots at the World Bamboo Congress in Delhi earlier this year (see picture), agrees designer Sharbari Dutta. 																								Hes looking very polished and gentlemanly. According to his age and temperament, the look is just right, points out Dutta, adding that she probably wouldnt change a thing on him, given the chance.																								Getting the Indian captain on the expert team wasnt hard. He is a keen footballer, who wants to contribute to the development of the game in India, says the ESS spokesperson.																								And Bhaichung is loving every moment of it. There is so much to learn from seeing the players in action, as well as through interaction with co-commentators, he feels. I also surf the Net on the teams and players, particularly in case of relatively-unknown teams like Latvia.																								As the tournament enters the make-or-break stage, Bhaichungs favourite remains France. I would love to see Thierry Henry score lots of goals, rounds off the striker.

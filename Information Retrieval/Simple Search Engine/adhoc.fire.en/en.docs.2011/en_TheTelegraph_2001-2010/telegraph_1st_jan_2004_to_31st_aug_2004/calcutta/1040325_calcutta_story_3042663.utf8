The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Exempt plea by car-owners
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) moved Calcutta High Court on Wednesday, seeking an exemption for its members from Bharat Stage II norms. The court assured it a hearing next Friday.																								Citing recent orders of Mumbai and Delhi high courts exempting private cars from implementing Bharat II, AAEI claimed the ruling should be followed by Calcutta High Court, too. Mumbai and Delhi high courts had passed the directive on the basis of an observation that in a poor country like India, it was impossible to change a car frequently.																								Later in the evening, an AAEI spokesperson told Metro that it would file a formal petition on Thursday, annexing the orders of the Mumbai and the Delhi high courts. 																								An association of truck-owners also moved the high court on Wednesday, seeking an order allowing them to run their vehicles in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area without Bharat II norms. 																								Next Friday, the green bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, will hear the state government report on what measures it had taken during the past year to modify old public vehicles to Bharat II.																								Fridays hearing is significant also because it will be the last hearing before the April 2 deadline fixed for Bharat II.

Associated with the NGO Enviro, Bibidho Ratan, a gallery on Jatin Das Road, is committed to giving rural artisans a platform to showcase their talent.																								Soma Duttas designs and conceptions have been executed by rural craftsmen, resulting in a collection of plant holders, figurines, lampshades, tea sets, tables, windchimes, bells, table bases and other decorative pieces. 																								We are always scouting for new talents and we find it in hordes in rural Bengal, especially in villages like Bira in North 24-Parganas, explains Soma. Its amazing what these people can come up with, despite lack of infrastructure, she adds.																								Braving all constraints, Soma and her team try to introduce a new feature every year at their annual exhibition, on since 2002. The theme this year is industrial powder-coating, lending more durability to the otherwise fragile terracotta articles.																								Earlier we would decorate our items with enamel paints and Fevicryl, but then we started receiving complaints that the colours dont last. So we hit upon the idea of using these coats, explains the designer. 																								This kind of powder coating is usually found in electronic and other household products such as fans, televisions and washing machines. Apart from making the terracotta more durable, the coats are wash-proof. The medium has also encouraged the artisans to experiment with colour.																								Soma, who works with Eco-Coat, a company dealing with powder-coating, came up with the idea of using the finish on handicrafts along with Arunabha Sinha, head, Eco-Coat.																								The majority of the proceeds from the exhibition, on till May 2, will go to the artisans.																								lAnother handicrafts exhibition, which offers even more in terms of variety and talent-on-display, is on at the Central Gallery of Academy of Fine Arts. 																								On till April 22, the exhibition called Nimble Fingers showcases traditional crafts of rural Bengal. 																								Inaugurated by danseuse Mamata Shankar and ex-footballer P.K. Banerjee on Sunday, pottery, terracotta, foil, tile and glass painting, batik and block prints, soft toys, woodcraft and buffalo horn-craft from National Award-winning craftsmen and housewives are on show. 																								Worth a special mention is a range of intricate costume jewellery by Nasim Islam, who is suffering from cancer. With an eye on the budget-conscious customer, Nasims work is mainly on silver, some of which is chromium plated for those who prefer a platinum-like finish, while the rest come with a gold wash.																								Combs and cutlery fashioned from buffalo horns are other standouts as are utility dokra items like door handles, candle stands and pegs. 																								We hope to take Nimble Fingers to other parts of the country from here, to acquaint people with the traditional crafts of Bengal, says Shyamashree Sen, a childrens book publisher who has been instrumental in organising the exhibition. 																								Nimble Fingers also hopes to serve as a platform for rural craftsmen, mainly from Midnapore and Naihati, to display their skill. A show is in the pipeline every two months.																								The organisers have also invited Dona Ganguly to present the vocational excellence awards for the most creative craftsman/ woman of Bengal, instituted by the Rotary Club of Calcutta (Metro City) on the concluding day of the exhibition.

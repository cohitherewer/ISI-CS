 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Phuchka passion
We call it the phuchka, and face it, anybody who calls it anything else doesnt know how to make em. Pani puris, gol gappas and other variants around the country dont have a hope of competing against the Calcutta version (at least with someone brought up savouring the bite-sized treat our way). Keep your fancy sprouts and meetha chutney away. Tamarind, aloo, a little chana, coriander and kala namak are flavours we love.																								You could, of course, sit down at a fancy restaurant and order a plateful of the sour devils. It will arrive sanitised and disinfected  and ultimately unsatisfactory. You could also cook them at home. Make the shells or buy them, whip up the pani, put together the potatoes and you probably wont do too badly for yourself.																								There are local variations, too. At some restaurants in town, you might chance upon vodka phuchkas. More common is the sookha phuchka  the shell and aloo, superbly laced with lime, coriander and a dash of the mans special masala. 																								But like designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee puts it: The dirtier they get, the better they taste, so if you are going to worry about how hygienic they are, best not to bother with them.If the phuchka has a destiny, it is to be gobbled up by the roadside. The shaal pata plate and phuchkawalas jhuri are inextricably linked to the taste-touch-feel-sight-smell of this gastronomic explosion. It is the ambience that has inspired innumerable phuchka eating competitions. And at a rupee a piece (by and large), this is unparalleled magic in the mouth.TOP 5Vivekananda Park																								If you want the street experience while sticking to some hygiene, here you can have some of the best phuchkas in town, made with mineral water on request.Lake Kali Bari																								This is heaven for anyone with a sour tooth. Snacks galore can be found at this south Calcutta hotspot.Russell Street																								Take your pick from the junk-food squad at the Park Street end.Kwality (Salt Lake)																								A few choice phuchkawalas man the AE Block zone. New Alipore																								The man with the biggest jhuri around can never be left out of the phuchka hit list. He holds fort  and really, if you see the size of his cart, basket and line, you wont argue with the term  at Block .

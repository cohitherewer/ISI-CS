 SUNANDO SARKAR 																								The state government is poor. And it is not hiding the fact.																								The health department has thrown up its hands, making an abject confession about its inability to supply some essential drugs even to hospitals at the very apex of the healthcare system. And NRS Medical College and Hospital, the most-frequented tertiary health centre, has become the first victim of the governments financial state.																								Facing the axe are some 30 drugs, many considered essential, especially for a hospital that receives several hundred patients requiring emergency treatment. Even plaster of Paris, an absolute must in the emergency and orthopaedic wards, will not be available at the hospital. We know patients will face problems, a senior NRS official said on Tuesday. But, given our state of finances, we are helpless, he added.																								The doctors are apprehensive. As the most visible face of the states healthcare system, we stand the risk of being misunderstood, one general surgeon attached to the hospital said. It is very difficult for us to make patients and their relatives see reason and explain that it is not us, but the state government, that is at fault for the non-availability of medicines, he explained.																								Physicians say there are some drugs on the list that the state-run hospitals cannot do without. Like two essential tablets for treating tuberculosis (TB), Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide, that have found their way on this not-available list.																								Every region of the state, most particularly the city, is seeing a rise in the number of TB patients, said a doctor attached to the hospitals medicine wing. We have often found that there tends to be a direct correlation between poverty and the incidence of TB, he added, explaining why the absence of the anti-TB drugs would hit where it hurts most. After freely getting these frequently-prescribed tablets from the hospital, it will be extremely difficult for patients to overlook their absence, he admitted.																								Two other tablets  Famotidine and Ranitidine  are commonly prescribed for indigestion-related ailments. They, too, will not be available at NRS, thanks to the states dire straits. How can you run a hospital without these drugs? asked a doctor.																								Injections  17 of them  have made their way on the not-available list, too. For doctors, the most worrisome absence is that of Dopamin Hydrochloride, often the first shot prescribed to revive emergency cases. From renal failure to cardiac failure, this is the first injection pushed into a patient in an emergency situation to bring him around, a senior health department official admitted. Its necessity can be gauged if you come to NRS any night and see the number of emergency cases being wheeled in, he added.																								The problem, a Swasthya Bhavan official said, arose from the inadequate budgetary allocation for procurement of medicines at NRS. This may have to be repeated at other hospitals, too, though we will try our best to ensure that it does not happen, he said.

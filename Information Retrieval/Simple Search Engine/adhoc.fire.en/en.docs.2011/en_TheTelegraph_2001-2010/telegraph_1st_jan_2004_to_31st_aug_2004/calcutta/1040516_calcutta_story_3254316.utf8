The other side of darkness 				 																																																											Had it not been for the amazing collages of Shakila and the richly-layered canvas of Jayashree Chakravarty, CIMA Gallerys Summer Show could have been just another mixed bag of exhibits culled from all over India. Shakilas work has become more mature now and she reveals the darker side of her vision in these collages as she explores the predicament of women in our country.				 																																																											In a suite entitled Nirjatan, or torture, she depicts how oppression of women is built into the Indian social system. It is quite remarkable that an unlettered woman like Shakila, who lives in a remote village and was fortuitously introduced to art by her father Panesarji, is so clear-sighted.				 																																																											She unflinchingly and graphically depicts violence on women  rape, suicide and molestation. However, she avoids sensationalism by the economy and honesty with which she builds up her images. These are scenes out of nightmares being enacted within the four walls of homes that are actually prisons. It is difficult to breathe here.				 																																																											Shakila has a lot of control over her medium and the precision with which she tears scraps of paper to create particular gestures and expressions never ceases to surprise. Glimmers of light are set off against continents of darkness. She shows tremendous skill in balancing the two areas.				 																																																											Shakila feels equally at home with joy and festivity. She has executed some very fresh images of flowers with heavy petals and a bird nest, where a parent extends its neck to inspect its partner and their brood. In Cauldron, date palm jaggery is being made over a fire, the wisps of smoke actually cottonwool.				 																																																											Another artist who has evolved with consistency over the years is Jayashree Chakravarty. She has only one canvas on display but it is a very eloquent work. On layers of white pigment she conjures up a complex image. The nervous lines of an electrocardiogram dance across a host of images picked up from the natural world and demonstrate how human intervention has altered it. Water hyacinth and other plants are dredged up along with the plans of buildings to show how past and future often merge.				 																																																											Layers of acrylic from the lighter to the deeper shades colour the works of Manoj S. Kachangal. He uses bright reds and blacks and greys but is most effective when the shades are subdued.As in his earlier canvas of black whorls of silicon glinting against grey, A. Balsubramaniam has created a clever image of innumerable tiny figures performing yoga feats against a stark white background  like a groundswell of human forms.Its the time to rove amp; rock				 																																																											Bangla rock is set to get an all-new fizz. In a novel corporate initiative, cola giant Coca-Cola India has come forward to promote local talent and music. City-based Bangla rock bands will be leveraged in an attempt to build local connect through its Paanch Peeyecho Ki mega summer promotion designed specially for Bengal.				 																																																											This initiative was kick-started on May 1 and will conclude on June 30. The promotion is part of Cokes efforts to continue excitement around its affordability strategy for the 200 ml Thums Up.				 																																																											As part of the under-the-crown promotion, the company will give away 4,00,000 Thums Up Rock cassettes as prizes. The four-volume series, a compilation of 40 mega-hits of popular Bangla rock bands like Chandrabindoo, Fossils, Miles, Ujan, Paras Pathar and Lakkhichhara, will be backed by interactive consumer-connect roadshows.				 																																																											We feel Bangla rock cuts across all age groups and connects just like movies do in Andhra Pradesh. So we would like to take it live to the streets, says Manu Talwar, regional operations director, Coca-Cola India.				 																																																											The interactive roadshows will kick-start on May 20 and continue till June 5. The jazzed-up rock-show float-vehicle being fabricated at the moment will move around town for five days and then roll into the suburbs. We will take the roving rock stage to different nooks and crannies of the city and also to district towns like Burdwan and Durgapur, with a bus in tow to ferry members of the leading bands selected to perform at the roadside gigs. We will also give out a phone number where para bands can call for a chance to perform alongside the established acts on the floatilla, Talwar adds.				 																																																											Road show engagements through FM broadcasts as well as live updates by reputed radio jockeys have been scheduled to add a beat to this summer promotion. A countdown show on Red FM  Bangla Music Show  will air songs from the four-album compilation of the selected bands as well as a contest to select the five best songs of the week.Says Upal Sengupta of Chandrabindoo: Road show is a good way of reaching out to the masses, especially the youth. But priority should be given to upcoming bands, which usually do not get the chance to perform in front of a big audience.				 																																																											 Winning pair of the week: Rituparna in a Jeet clinch				 																																																											Prosenjit-Rituparna refused to share screen space, Rituparna went married and missing, Prosenjit-Arpita made their reel romance real, Prosenjit-Rachana wriggled and failed, Jeet-Priyanka rose and fell				 																																																											The hunt for the winsome pair goes on in Tollywood. First in line for the Friday box-office test are reigning queen Rituparna and rising star Jeet, paired for the first time in Ashok Dhanukas Aakrosh. The film, made on a reported budget of Rs 2.5-crore, has been shot almost entirely at the Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.				 																																																											If the billboards are anything to go by, Jeet plays action, rather than romantic, hero and Rituparna is, well, Rituparna.

Where art is a product and does not have enough consumers, the advertising arithmetic weighs heavily against itEye on Calcutta
 Renu RoyBeyond barriers of caste or creed, or even status, Calcuttans have always been proud of their city as home for culture and the arts. Even those who are not native to our city often grudgingly accept our position as a centre for cultural activity. Yet, many of us who are actively concerned with protecting a cultural ambience patiently built and sustained, often at great personal cost, are not without our concerns for the future continuance of the arts in this city, especially the performing arts.There are considerable threats to many of our cultural bastions. The Bangla commercial stage, for instance, has already lost its formidable presence with regular shows, and theatre hangs on precariously on occasional and itinerant productions of motley theatre groups. While the graphic arts have seen unusual prosperity with the acceptance of Indian contemporary painting in the international art market and the presence of the big European art auctioneers on our soil, it is the performing arts that seem to be the most threatened. The most vulnerable among them is classical dance and music, both Hindusthani and Carnatic.On the surface there seems to be nothing wrong. Come winter, our city hosts one classical music conference after another as it did in the past, yet only the inner circle of organisers knows the hurdles that keep growing every year. Putting a show together today causes far more anxiety than it did yesterday. And when we Calcuttans are accused of living in the past, all we can say in self-defence is that we have a great past that we can forget only at our own peril, nor can we wish it away.

The Telegraph file pictures Calcutta has a tradition, and a very great one, of accepting and applauding major classical musicians, singers and dancers from every school, from every corner of the country. Careers have been made here not only by local talent, but by a large number of people drawn by an enthusiastic audience. The audience is still there; it still crowds nightlong music conferences, waiting for the maestro to appear in the wee hours. The performers still want to come here because they cannot easily find such knowledgeable and overwhelming audience response elsewhere.What then is the problem? Predictably, it is also about money. As you may know, the newspaper you are now holding in your hand cannot be written or printed with the money you have paid for it. It is the advertising that these pages contain that truly pays for your hunger for the news. Without feudal patronage, it has become the same for classical music. But the cost of the ticket cannot even cover a fraction of the budget in which the venue, advertising, and above all the performers themselves feature so prominently. Of course, there is the question of return on investment for a classical music show of any consequence, and it is not insignificant. The question is how did we do it yesterday? And why are we finding it difficult to do it today?The answers to these pertinent questions may seem impertinent to many idealist votaries of classical art. But the bottomline is that even art today is a product. And in this world even products of the mind must sell, and post profits. The fact is that everyone is trying to earn more, and the classical music performer cannot be an exception. The earlier generation had probably lived on far less, but the fact is that our lives and our perceptions of our existence have changed. That is a fact of life that we must accept, and we must also face up to the reality that this quantum change, this paradigm shift, is bound to have some casualties.When an entire society shifts its focus, redefines its priorities, reassesses its values, it has to shed some burden of its past; it has to lighten its load to create space for new loads. The question is simple: can we allow our classical musical heritage to be one of these casualties? Many art forms have died down in history; can we allow our instrumental and vocal music, and our myriad dance forms to follow the same route to oblivion? And if we do so, what is the cost that we will have to pay as a civilisation?There are no easy answers. A ticket to Pavarotti is about US $500. Converted, it would be an impossible Rs 25,000 to listen to Bhimsen Joshi! The international examples are simply not relevant. The advertiser who helps brings this paper to your hand every morning may also contribute to bring Bhimsen Joshi to your ears. But his advertising rupee is run inexorably by a rather simple arithmetic called Cost Per Contact, the ultimate calculation in advertising effectiveness. It disallows arguments, it debars any dialogue on values, or heritage, or what have you. It leaves no space for negotiation.Mathematics, unfortunately, is amoral. The only thing that could change this mathematics is numbers. That is, if classical music had a constituency large enough to regularly fill up say the Netaji Indoor or the Salt Lake stadium, the advertising arithmetic would change. It is not that this never happens, like the Ravi Shankar-Anoushka and the Zakir Hussain-Amjad Ali Khan recitals, but these are more in the nature of exceptions, rather than the rule. The younger generation is just not turning out in the required numbers.And at the other end of the spectrum, are hundreds of talented young musicians and singers who keep knocking on the doors of every impresario in town. Some of them are exceptionally gifted, but it is impossible to fill an auditorium with their performance, let alone a stadium. The audience goes for the big names, and the advertiser follows suit. Cold-blooded event managers, fast replacing the old-style impresario who began as an aficionado, are looking icily at the bottomline. So, the bump-and-grind Hindi film songs rule the show world. Because kitsch sells. Kaanta lagaaYet, there have always been success stories from Calcutta. The earlier generation saw the rise of Rashid Khan or Ajay Chakraborty, today we are witness to the growth of singers like Ulhas Kashalkar or Sandipan Samajpati, musicians like Partha Sarathi and Purbayan Chatterjee.Talent is not lost; it is an audience that we are in danger of losing. But there is reason still to believe that our classical music will survive and will create for the new millennium its new bandish.

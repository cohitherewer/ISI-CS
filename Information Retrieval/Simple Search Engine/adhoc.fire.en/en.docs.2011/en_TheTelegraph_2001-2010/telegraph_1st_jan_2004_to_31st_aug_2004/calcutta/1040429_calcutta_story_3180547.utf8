 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Leading talent by the finger
 Shyamashree SenIts children and their relation with nature, and the plight of financially deprived rural artisans that move this mother of two. And Shyamashree Sen is trying to make life better for both. Nimble Fingers  the exhibition thats a lead-up to the NGO Sen intends to form of the same name  seeks out artisans from the remotest corners of the state and arranges exhibitions for them. The idea is to nurture talent and help these artists in the process, she explains.																								The success of the exhibition held this month featuring 12 artisans, has further boosted Sens confidence, as she intends to expand the artisan hunt to other states and hold the exhibitions across India. 																								Some of the rural artisans are immensely talented. There is one in Midnapore who designs objects out of bull horns and was invited by NIFT to teach students there. But there is hardly any guidance or help provided to these artistes, is Sens complaint. Nimble Fingers intends to set that right.																								The idea struck Sen on seeing national award-winning artisans selling their works for a pittance at the West Bengal Handicrafts Mela in the city. She started looking for more such artisans soon after.																								Colour Me Green is a publishing agency through which she tries to take care of her other concern  children and nature. Started in 1998, it has so far published eight childrens books on ecology and environment. The body also organises workshops in schools, primarily targeting kids between the ages of three and 11.																								Sens love for the arts is something she inherited from her father, a painter. His art college friends would have endless adda sessions at our house and that was the atmosphere I grew up in, she recollects.																								Her academic and other achievements have not been unexceptional either. A political science student from Presidency College, she topped both the bachelors and masters courses. Not continuing with studies further, Sen started freelancing for newspapers and magazines. A lot of travelling followed marriage, her husband being a sailor. After years of globe-trotting, she settled in Calcutta and started her social work.																								Sen is an active Rotarian. She has also penned a book of poems, entitled Stolen Moments, released by author Sunil Gangopadhyay, she proudly adds. Dabbling in paintings is another hobby.																								With Nimble Fingers expanding into a full-fledged NGO, Sen plans to seek out artisans from the Northeast and Jharkhand. Further, there are plans to conduct workshops where artisans would train interested people. Along with helping the artisans financially, it would help pass on the skills, feels Sen.

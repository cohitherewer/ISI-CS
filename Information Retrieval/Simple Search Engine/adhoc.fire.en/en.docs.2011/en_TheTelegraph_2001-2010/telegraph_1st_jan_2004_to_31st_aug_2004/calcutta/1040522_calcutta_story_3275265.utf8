 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Poster perfect
Arts amp; Ideas Designshop celebrates its inauguration with 20 X 30, an exhibition of decorative posters by eminent painters of Calcutta. Reinforcing the idea that simplicity is the soul of best designs, the posters on display reflect their makers in a creative yet contemplative mood. Based on intensely subjective themes, the simplicity of the images ring true through the almost innocent use of clear, bold tones, serving as an image to the beliefs and predilections of the artists. Sometimes lyrical, and even poetic in their expression of ideas, this collection of limited edition posters by Aditya Basak, Jayashree Chakrabarty, Jogen Chowdhury, Mrityunjoy Chatterjee, Pabitra Das, Satyaki Ghosh, Shuvaprasanna, Subrata Chowdhury and Sunil Sil is a must-see for every art connoisseur.																								Event: An exhibition of decorative posters																								When: Till July 16; 12.30 pm - 8.30 pm																								Where: Swabhumi, Shop No. 213

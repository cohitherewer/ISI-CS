 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Mute boy found dead in govt home
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Kalu, an eight-year-old mute inmate, was found dead on Tuesday night at Kishalay, a government home for juvenile delinquents in Barasat.																								After he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead, officials of the home said on the condition of anonymity that the boy could have survived, but for the pitiable state of healthcare in the home. 																								The blame lies squarely with the social welfare department, which was repeatedly petitioned about the need to improve things, but chose to ignore the pleas, one of them said.																								Kalu was spotted by officials of the government railway police in Jirat, in Nadia district, in October last year. Later, he was handed over to officials of Kalna police station. They brought the boy to Kishalay. From the outset, the boy suffered from ill health. He was admitted to Barasat District Hospital twice last month, said Hiranmay Saha, chairman of the Juvenile Welfare Board of North 24-Parganas.																								Kalu could have done with some treatment, both psychiatric and otherwise, Saha said. Unfortunately, the home was in no state to provide it, he added.																								Kalus absence from the dining table was noticed by three other inmates. It was they who brought the matter to the notice of hostel superintendent Ashok Poddar. During the final check before the inmates are sent to bed, Kalu was found in his bed, apparently lifeless. 																								A local doctor who was summoned advised immediate hospitalisation, Poddar said.																								The home superintendent himself was critical about the poor state of health-related infrastructure at Kishalay. We do not have any residential medical officer for the home and have to depend on visiting doctors for the health of about 150 boys. The social welfare department is indifferent to the problems existing here, another official said.																								Inmates of the home, despite being threatened by the officials against speaking to the media, also blamed the death on the absence of medical facilities at the home. They took very little care of Kalu after he was discharged from hospital last month. He was given no additional care or medicinal support. He was even teased and heckled by a few senior home officials, as he could not speak, they added. The cruelty, they recounted, would cross all bounds at meal-times.																								Senior inmates referred to other incidents in the past that indicated a shoddy state of affairs at the home. A 20-year-old inmate had fled by scaling a wall last month, they said. We dare not protest, because we will be victimised, one of them said. Subrata snub: The CPM Opposition,  at the monthly meeting of the civic House on Wednesday,  was not allowed by mayor Subrata Mukherjee to raise questions  on the Trinamul Congress election manifesto, regarding  funds from Delhi for urban development. He said a party  manifesto could not be discussed in the civic House.

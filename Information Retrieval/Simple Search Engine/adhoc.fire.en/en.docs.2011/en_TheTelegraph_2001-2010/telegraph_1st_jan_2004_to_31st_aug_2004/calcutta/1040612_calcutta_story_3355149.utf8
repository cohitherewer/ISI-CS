 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Remembering Tagore
																								As part of Rabindranath Tagores 143rd birth anniversary celebrations, Vikalp Art Shop hosts an exhibition of drawings, paintings and sculptures that pays tribute to the multi-faceted genius of the Poet. Titled Aamaar Rabindranath: Sraddhaarpan, the exhibition features works by leading artists and sculptors of our time that offer fresh interpretations to some of Tagores best-known works in poetry and prose. Noteworthy among them is Paritosh Sens rendition of two of Tagores immortal heroines, Binodini of Chokher Baali and Kumudini of Jogajog, both of whom assume a distinctively new personae through the brush strokes of this celebrated artist. Shanu Lahiris portrait of Victoria Ocampo with Tagore, Deviprosad Bandopadhyays bust of Tagore, and a rare photograph of Tagore at the Amrakunja in Santiniketan, taken just three months before his death, among others, make this show a must-see for Tagore scholars and art-lovers alike.

																								Colours can make or mar a painting. It is one of the most integral ingredients of a painting and lends it a finality of form. One with a keen eye for colour will notice that no amount of expression or invention can redeem an ill-coloured picture. At the same time, if the colour has the right tinge, there is nothing it will not raise or redeem. A masterful interplay of colours is what can infuse life into a blank canvas. Hence it is only the skilled that venture into this area to create magic successfully. Idiyas Gallerys exhibition of Indian art and sculpture is a tribute to those talented ones who have a special eye for colour and its vibrancy. The exhibition features the works of Partho Bhattacharjee, Bratin Khan, Sanatan Dinda, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Dewasis Das (a photograph of whose painting appears above), Samir Ray, Bimal Kundu, Shyamal Mukherjee, Tapas Gangopadhyay and Asit Sarkar among others.																								Event: Exhibition of paintings and sculptures																								When: Till July 31; 10.30 am - 7.30 pm																								Where: Idiyas Gallery, 15 Dover Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 East-West Metro in route plan shift 
 															- Twin detours at salt lake, howrah			The transport department has suggested two changes to the route for the East-West Metro Rail corridor, which was originally outlined by the Japan Economic Trade Organisation (Jetro).																								The feasibility study for the proposed project, which comes with a price tag pegged at Rs 4,000 crore-plus, was conducted by the Japanese body, but the local transport authorities have recommended two deviations along the course at both ends in Salt Lake and Howrah. 																								At a recently-held meeting chaired by chief secretary (transport department) Ashok Gupta, senior transport department officials pointed out that two deviations would allow the new Metro  tentatively slated for completion in 2013  to benefit a larger number of users. The proposed route covers 23.5 km. If the suggested deviations are incorporated, this will go up by 4.5 km.																								Transport department officials said that according to the route in Jetros feasibility study, the Metro would, after crossing the Hooghly, reach Vivekananda Road, via Central station, and move towards the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass through Kankurgachhi, on its way to Salt Lake. Then, it is to enter Salt Lake along Third Avenue from the Bypass on its way to Central Park, through to Rajarhat.																								To connect the Salt Lake stadium with the new route, the transport department has suggested a two-km detour, with a right-turn off the Bypass to reach the stadium, before turning left towards Central Park. We want the East-West Metro to connect with the (Salt Lake) stadium, as it will help more commuters, said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. Apart from helping sports lovers, who go to watch football matches at the stadium, the deviation will also help a large number of commuters, who currently have very few transport options to reach the area, he added.																								The transport minister said that the suggested deviations are to be incorporated when the detailed project report is drawn up. The government has received Jetros feasibility report and is planning to appoint the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to draw up the detailed project report.																								The stadium, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, the Hyatt Regency and Swabhumi will be easily accessed once the line is complete, and within striking distance are Saltlec, or the Sector V infotech hub, Nicco Park and a number of academic institutions. The transport minister was apparently approached with complaints about the inadequacy of connectivity during a visit to the Apollo Gleneagles Hospital last week.																								Similarly, on the Howrah side, the Metro is supposed to terminate at Dasnagar. But the transport department has suggested that this stop would be inappropriate, as Dasnagar has narrow roads and there are many factories in the belt, which will lead to a bottleneck in commuter flow.																								But if the Metro turns left a kilometre short of Dasnagar, along the Howrah drainage canal, making a two-and-a-half km detour to Santragachhi railway station, commuters can catch local trains and connecting vehicles from Kona Expressway.																								The suggested deviation will help thousands reach the stadium, the indoor arena and the large residential complexes  both government and private  that have come up in that area of Howrah, said a senior transport department official.

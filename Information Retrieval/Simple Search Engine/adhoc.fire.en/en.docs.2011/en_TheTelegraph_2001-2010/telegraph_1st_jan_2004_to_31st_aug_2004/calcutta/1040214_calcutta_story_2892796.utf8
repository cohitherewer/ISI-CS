 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Hospitals eye IT sops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), a conglomerate of 11 hospitals in the city, on Friday sought from the state government the facilities it has extended to the IT sector. The state health minister, on his part, sought more cooperation between private and state-run hospitals for the uplift of healthcare services in the state.																								We want the existing hospitals to grow and more hospitals to come up. Incentives like those given to the IT sector will attract more investors, said AHEI president Sajal Dutta, during the inaugural function of the three-day health fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium, organised by the association. Providing land, subsidies on capital investment and interest rates are the kind of incentives we are looking at, he elaborated. We also want a directorate of health, under the health department, to interact between the government and the private hospitals to streamline operations, Dutta said. 																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra laid stress on increased private-public participation in healthcare. We want our private-sector healthcare services to match that of other states. The government will provide all help, Mishra said.																								We have provided private hospitals with space to instal CT scan machines in state medical colleges, the minister said, adding that similar joint ventures were being planned in the fields of MRI and dialysis. He said primary healthcare was the governments priority and invited private hospitals to help with tertiary services.																								Mishra hailed the AHEI for announcing a uniform subsidised rate for diagnostic tests at all the 11 member-hospitals for patients referred by state-run hospitals. This was a landmark decision, the minister said.																								Rupak Barua, joint chairperson of the health fair organising committee, said the subsidised tests were the beginning of a collaboration with the state government. We have lots of other plans, he said.																								Somnath Chatterjee, MP and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation chairman, spoke on the occasion. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee visited the fair, where free check-up camps are being held.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 01, 2004  Through the looking glass: Calcutta  2004  One year is history and another is  upon us. How much will history repeat itself? Will new ground  be trodden or will the footsteps be blindly followed? As the  curtains go up on the year of the monkey (by the Chinese calendar),  Metro takes a sneak peek at whats waiting in  the wings to take centre stage		 Amitabh babumoshai Bachchan:  Back to Bengal for a Rituparno film
	Business is the buzzword  
	Just do IT will be the main mantra of a Bengal government  meaning business. Leading the infotech way will be Wipro,  billed to kick off its BPO operations in the city and create  more than 2,000 jobs by the end of March. The city  will have six out of 10 major IT players by the end of 2004,  promises state IT minister Manab Mukherjee. 
	Three new towers Millennium, Infinity second tower  and Bengal Intelligent Park phase II to come up in  Salt Lake Electronics Complex and around 400,000 sq ft of  space for IT companies to be created by the end of this  year. 
	A job boom to match, with companies like IBM, TCS, Skytech  and CTS lining up major expansion plans. From 15,000, the  headcount in Saltlec is expected to cross the 20,000 mark. 
	A state-of-the-art toy industry complex, built by WBIDC,  will be ready by March 2004. Spread over 2.28 acres in Salt  Lake, the facility will have 24 modules; all have already  been booked. 
	Bottomline: Portrait of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  as the B-team skipper, busy dividing his time between international  conferences on IT, infrastructure, steel, agro industries  and scouting for investment in Bangalore and Delhi.		 Charles Correa: Design  draw
	Centre of attraction 
	Charles Correas first major signature project in  Calcuttas public domain, the much-awaited mixed-use  centre, will be the biggest value-add in our entertainment  calendar. The completion of the first phase of City Centre,  built on a large, six-and-a-half-acre island property in  Salt Lakes DC Block will draw all those looking  for a superior lifestyle experience, claims Correa.
 With the shopping mall anchored by Shoppers Stop,  foodstops led by Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken and  INOX moving in with its second four-screen multiplex in  town, City Centre will be the one address with myriad attractions.		 The 800-metre flyover  on Chowringhee: An eyesore, but billed to boost traffic  speed where it matters
	Street smart 
	Mission: Traffic flow as opposed to car crawl  in vital pockets.  
	D-Day: The final day of the current financial year. 
	The must-dos by March 31 completion of the 800-metre  Park Street flyover on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, restructuring  of Esplanade, renovation of road space under the Gariahat  flyover, remodelling the Park Circus seven-point crossing,  finishing the Cossipore flyover. But the smooth-street deadline  for stretches under the AJC Bose Road flyover is January  15. 
	Also poised at the check-post is the five-year road tax  to be slapped on all cars less than 15 years old and the  annual flyover tax of Rs 500 to enable the government to  pay back donors for the high roads it is building. 		 Raveena Tandon: Chhoti  Bahus second trip to Tollywood for Sahib, Biwi,  Ghulam is slated for the month of her marriage.
	Star parade 
	Two of Tollywoods best go Hindi, while another big  name goes English and yet another documents living legends.  The Bollywood bandwagon rolls deep into Tollywood territory  with Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai steering Rituparno Ghoshs  Hindi debut vehicle Raincoat. Ajay and Saif Ali Khan then  take aim for Aparna Sens Gulel, set on the streets  of Mumbai. As for Buddhadeb Dasgupta, after finishing off  a Bengali project with Jhamu Sugandh playing producer and  Prosenjit the lead, he hops on to his Dream Cycle, an English  celluloid saga to be shot partly in Europe. 
 Goutam Ghose wraps up his documentaries on Jyoti Basu and  The Dalai Lama. Tollygunges most ambitious year is  rounded off by the Big B, no less, leading Rituparnos  start-studded father-son saga. And Raveena Chhoti  Bahu Tandon will be back in Tollywood in the  month of her marriage for Sahib, Biwi, Ghulams  final schedule.		 Portrait of the Maidan  as a playground: April will be the kindest month, with  the court saying no to fairs on our favourite greens
	Stress buster amp; salvage stops 
	Adding a new dimension to health tourism is the 100-acre  Vedic Village. With village farmhouses, luxury villas, the  Village Circle Club and a well-appointed medical spa combining  ayurveda and naturopathy, it is a retreat from the stress  of modern living.
 Even as the concept of wellness and preventive healthcare  gains currency, curative medicine remains the need of the  hour. So, many of the city hospitals are in expansion mode,  adding beds and specialities, while the first integrated  trauma-care centre is also set to open its doors.		 All for one: Make shop-sip-bite  under one roof a habit as the market grows 
	Cleaner amp; greener 
	April could turn out to be the kindest month for Calcuttans  at least for their lungs in a long, long time.  And all thanks to two deadlines set by the high court to  force Writers Buildings to clean up its act. First  up, April 4, when the city keeps its date with the Bharat  Stage II norms of vehicular pollution. Government grumble  and go-slow notwithstanding, watch out for the fight against  foul fumes.
 Bengali new years day is when our beloved Maidan gets  a much-needed breather again thanks to judicial intervention  with no more fairs to call in the crowds, clutter  the greens and cause a dust screen to hang heavy over Chowringhee.		 Zakir Hussain: Just in  January
	Market matters 
	Buying grows bigger and bigger. The Metropolis, the citys  first suburban mall at Hiland Park, to be anchored by Big  Bazaar, will be commissioned mid-year. A mix of retail,  food and entertainment and a four-screen cineplex sprawled  over 175,000 sq ft will add a buzz to the Bypass.
 A third Big Bazaar will come up on a 55,000-sq ft property  on Rashbehari Avenue, besides two more Food Bazaars  in Alipore and inside the Pantaloons store at 22, Camac  Street. C3 The Market Place, Calcuttas first  big-format organised supermarket chain, opens shop  near hot-favourite Forum, followed by a few more outlets,  plus a 20,000-sq ft hypermart on the EM Bypass. And bet  on todays stores having more in store. 
	Gala on the greens 
	Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the oldest golf course  outside the British Isles, will celebrate its 175th anniversary  in style. While the fulcrum of the yearlong celebrations  will be two Asian PGA Tour-level tournaments, the celebrations  will also involve club meets, honouring of past captains  and, of course, the descent of a galaxy of sporting and  celluloid stars for the entertainment galas.		 Kapil Dev: One of the  top drivers in the year-long celebrations at RCGC 
	All that jazz amp; classical strains 
	After Shawn Lane-Jonas Hellborg and then Larry Coryell-George  Brooks in 2003, Congo Square is reviving the annual JazzFest  in 2004. Besides select city combos, the January 22-25 festival  will feature acts like the Karin Krog Trio, Rena Rama Quartet/Oriental  Wind, Felix Fan, Emtrio and Hellborg-Srinivas-Sipe-Selvaganesh.
 January is a month for Indian classical music buffs, too.  The year opens with Ustad Vilayat Khan and Ustad Bismillah  Khan sharing the New Years day stage at the Science  City auditorium. Zakir Hussain makes an appearance at the  Sabrang Sangeet Sammelan on January 17 at Kala Mandir, collaborating  with the father-son santoor duo of Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma  and Rahul Sharma. Then, theres the Dover Lane Music  Conference. 
	Canvas call 
	The Academy of Fine Arts plans to hold a series of landmark  annual exhibitions highlighting Bengal art, and in November  it will organise a major show focussing on one of the past  masters Benode Behari Mukhopadhyay. The Academy,  in collaboration with Kala Bhaban, Santiniketan, plans to  exhibit about 40-50 works of this blind artist whose murals  need to be carefully restored.

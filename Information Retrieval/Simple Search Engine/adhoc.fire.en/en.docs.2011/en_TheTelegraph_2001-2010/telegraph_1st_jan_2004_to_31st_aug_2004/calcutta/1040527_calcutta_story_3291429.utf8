The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 IT comes clicking at Corporation door 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The CMC headquarters: Turning a new-age leaf																								Key in the holding number and the outstanding tax amount pops up on the screen. Click on the button for mutation and all the details  from the name of the concerned official to the documents needed  come flashing. Access the birth registration form on the Web and get a printout at the click of a mouse.																								That may be far from the reality of 2004, but that is the vision for 2008, drawn up by officials at Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), as the civic body gears up to change the way it connects with Calcuttans.																								The entire effort to put in place a proper information technology (IT) network across the city hinges on bringing in transparency in the system and taking our services to the doorstep of the citizen, says a senior CMC official.																								Armed with loans and grants from multilateral funding agencies like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and UKs Department for International Development (DFID), the civic body has initiated a mega IT project that promises to reduce human intervention and make interacting with the CMC simpler and swifter.																								Attaching topmost priority to the project, CMC has already earmarked over Rs 12 crore  out of the fund received from ADB (a loan of $220 million) and DFID (a grant of $42 million)  for the project. Infotech major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been roped in and the company is on the job for the past three months. 																								They are conducting the business process re-engineering study, which they will complete in nine months. After this they will develop the system and implement in various departments, said the official. 																								There are around 60 departments in the civic body with a workforce of over 37,000. Though computers are being used in various CMC departments  from inventory management to tax assessment and waste disposal to trade license renewal  for the past few years, the benefits of computerisation have not been realised in the absence of integration and compatibility of platforms, 																								We have assigned TCS with the responsibility of laying down a fully integrated computerised system covering all 141 wards. They will also advise us on the hardware to be used, explained the official.																								To ensure a smooth transition from the manual to a hi-tech system, the civic body has set up an eight-member team to assist the 10-member TCS team of techies working on the project. 																								CMC officials expect that once the system is in place it will help boost the civic bodys bottomlines.																								Computerisation aided us in getting exact details of outstanding receipts, broadening the tax base and initiating an intensive collection drive, which helped us repay the overdraft amount to banks. Besides, we can settle pension and other dues to the employees in less than one month, which earlier used to take more than a year, explained the official.

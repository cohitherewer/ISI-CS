 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Of power and politics
																								Bohurupees latest production, Pati-Paksha, a play in Bengali, has as its theme the eternal oppression of women in our society. The plot revolves around Kumud Guha, a politician, who is characterised as a modern Machiavelli. Priyamvada, his trustful wife, becomes the victim of his schemes and machinations to grab political power at all costs. But not quite. For, ironically, the woman he sets his wife up against is no other than Shefalika Khastagir with whom he was involved in a romantic liaison not too long ago. An unexpected turn of events follow when the erstwhile timid Priyamvada discovers herself and starts defying her husband. Written by Ujjwal Chatterjee and directed by Tarapada Mukherjee, this play is a brilliant satire which uses laughter and wry humour as instruments to expose how a male dominated society still hold sway over the lives of women.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Pati-Paksha, by Bohurupee																								When: Today and tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Girish Mancha (today) and Academy of Fine Arts (tomorrow)

 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Mason dies in cave-in at old building
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Civic workers demolish balconies of the building, part of which caved in, killing a mason. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The calm was shattered at Naktala, in south Calcutta, on Wednesday morning when part of a dilapidated building on NSC Bose Road collapsed, killing a mason and critically injuring another. The portion that caved in was being remodelled,																								Local realtor Debasish Das Choudhury, whose men were engaged in the reconstruction, was arrested and a hunt was launched for R.M. Kar, absconding owner of the building.																								The victim was identified as Najibul Sheikh, 26, from Murshidabad. He fell from the third floor with a slab of concrete. Shishul Mohammad, 22, was injured, said Jadavpur police station officer-in-charge Sudip Roy.																								Neighbours said building-owner Kar, who could usually be found at the site from 8 am, disappeared after the accident.																								Najibul and 15 other masons from Murshidabad were working there for about two months, supervised by Choudhury, a local resident with alleged CPM links.																								At around 7.30 am, a third-floor slab, comprising a sunshade (six ft long and 3.5 ft wide) and a beam, caved into the second-floor sunshade. Najibul was working on the third-floor slab, while Shishul was on the second-floor sunshade. Najibul fell with the slab and died on the spot. Shishul was trapped between the two slabs for almost three hours, said mason Mainul Sheikh.																								It was a risky rescue, said Dipak Kumar Ghosh, officer-in-charge, Tollygunge fire station. First, we used a lowering line, but the entire building could have collapsed under the weight. We managed to shift the body, but a leg stayed pinned under the debris. Finally, a crane, provided by Metro Railway, was used to lift the slab, he said.																								I dont think the contractor consulted an engineer or an architect. It is evident that the construction work was not properly planned, Ghosh added. 																								Neighbours said B.K. Chatterjee of Chatterjee International Centre built the house in the late 60s. UCO Bank took it over after he became bankrupt. For years, it remained unoccupied, and petty thieves walked off with its gates and windows. About six months ago, R.M. Kar bought the house for Rs 26 lakh and started reconstructing it.																								Later in the day, civic workers demolished the balconies of the building. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had issued a notice on April 15, declaring the additional work illegal. The notice went disregarded and todays accident was the outcome, said Ashokendu Chakraborty, assistant engineer, Borough X.

	It has often been noticed that people ill-treat stray dogs for sheer fun. They pelt dogs with stones, beat them and even ram their vehicles into them, injuring the animals seriously. Sometimes, children innocently indulge in these cruel activities. But when it comes to keeping burglars away, we depend on these same canines. Elders in the family should teach kids to be kind to stray animals. Also, the civic authorities should take a more active role in the welfare of these animals. An increasing number of stray dogs in the city are suffering from various diseases and injuries.

	Lack of timely whitewashing, repair and maintenance of the buildings of some of the most prestigious colleges in the city have left portions of the structures in deplorable condition. In the long term, this is sure to affect the students academics adversely. City industrialists should come forward and donate money for the upkeep of these colleges for the benefit of our future generations.

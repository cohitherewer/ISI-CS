 Friday, April 09, 2004 Battle of ballots shows its farcical face 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Earthen pots painted like scarecrow faces form one of the displays at the CIMA Gallery exhibition. Picture by Pabitra Das																								As a people, we lack a sense of humour. But satire has for long been a favourite weapon of those who want to take pot-shots at their opponents in the field of politics. 																								Bengal has a glorious tradition of wielding humour and wit to expose hypocrisy or to deflate windbags. Cartoons have been used effectively to lampoon those against whom one is pitted in the political arena. The war of words and images comes to a head during elections, and though graffiti deface walls, they are certainly a very powerful expression of popular opinion.																								Sarat Chandra Pandit, better known as Dadathakur, was a great one for taking digs through his verse and had composed the famous Voteranga. Ironically, satire has lost much of its edge at a time when things seem to have reached the nadir and Dunciad goes unchallenged.																								Using theatre, video, paintings, installations, music caricature and graffiti, CIMA Gallery has organised a multi-media exhibition entitled Vote tumi kaar? or Vote, to whom dost thou belong? Artists and students of Rabindra Bharati University had joined this project to demonstrate how the battle of ballots has turned into a farce and how an entire nation is being bamboozled by politicians of every hue. 																								Among the participants are Partha Pratim Deb, Jogen Choudhury, Bimal Kundu, Abhijit Gupta, Ashoke Mullick, Samir Aich, Ramendra Kastha and Sohini Dhar. The Bangla band Chandrabindoo sang a song composed for the opening of the exhibition on Thursday evening.																								Viewers walk into the gallery through an installation that looks like a chaos of old newspapers, along with caricatures of the participants competently executed by Suman Chowdhury, who has done an equally effective series on prototype politicians.																								Partha Pratim Deb has done an effigy representing the electoral process with paper cutouts. The students have created a museum of votes highlighting the absurdity of it all.																								Among the museum exhibits are the dried remains of human beings (like Bombay duck) and other strange artefacts.																								Colourful faces, like those of scarecrows, have been painted on earthenware handis and displayed against a white wall painted to resemble a surface without plaster. Graffiti in Bengali says Vote kinun, vote din or Buy votes, cast votes. A vessel of votes sails on a sea of humanity  black painted on a white sheet. 																								An altar of votes has been created, complete with offerings and twinkling fairy lights. A cartoon of a naked child and his father look at feel good.com. 																								Atul Dodiyas work shows a constipated man with a grindstone. The man, who is obviously having a hard time relieving himself, sits over the famous sunburst associated with a brand of washing powder. 																								Sumitro Basak has in his enthusiasm brought out a Vote Mangal Kabya in a Bat-tala format, so popular at the end of the 19th Century. Bimal Kundus sculpture of a rickety chair and the stump of a leg represents decadence. 																								Buddhijivi Mancha, a collaborative installation where one could detect a familiar drawing by Jogen Chowdhury, was used as a backdrop by the Bangla band. There were video presentations, too. An air of festivity was sought to be created.

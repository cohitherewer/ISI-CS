The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, February 16, 2004  Survival Kit You cant get through this week without...				 																																												 Packing away all your woollens				 																																												 Going shopping for a spanking-new summer wardrobe				 																																												 Booking yourself in for a pedicure now that its open-sandal time				 																																												 Substituting your early-morning cup of coffee for some iced tea				 																																												 Giving up on carbohydrates for dinner to lose some of your winter weight				 																																												 Filling the house with bright, cheerful flowers				 																																												 Taking a cold shower every evening to get rid of all that grime and dirt				 																																												 Reading for an hour before going to bed				 																																												 Getting up an hour earlier to go for that long-postponed morning walk				 																																												 And then changing your mind and going right back to sleep

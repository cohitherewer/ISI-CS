 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 New windows of opportunity
 OUR BUREAU																								From microbiology to biotechnology, from film studies to journalism and mass communication, students can now afford to get choosy and opt out of the mad rush for college admissions.																								Most colleges want high marks and under the circumstances, it is difficult to gain admission to the good institutions. Where will we go, what will we study? wondered a student on Monday.																								A friends father, standing by his side, offered a window of opportunity: Every year, there seems to be this mad rush for subjects like English, economics, physics, chemistry, mathematics and so on, as if there are no other subjects to study and shape their future.																								Taking the cue, the state government has introduced several new courses, both regular and unconventional, in colleges to ease the pressure on the prized picks and give the students a bigger basket. 																								Heres a trek through some of the new career tools:																								0Biochemistry at Asutosh College and Sarsuna College																								0Microbiology at Gurudas College, St Pauls Cathedral Mission College, Sarsuna College, Scottish Church College, Surendranath College and Asutosh College																								0Journalism and mass communication at New Alipore College, Thakurpukur Vivekananda College, Surendranath College for Women, Barrackpore Rashtra Guru Surendranath College and Mahestala College																								0Communicative English at Deshabandhu College for Girls and Behala College																								0Film studies at Loreto College																								0Bachelor of business administration at Bhawanipur Gujrati Education Society (College), Scottish Church College, Deshabandhu College for Girls, Asutosh College, Barrackpore Rashtra Guru Surendranath College, APC College and Kanailal Bhattacharya College.																								Other organisations have also come forward to claim a share of the higher education pie, with a plethora of unconventional courses.																								Leading the pack is the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which has collaborated with the National Institute of Sales and Marketing to introduce sales and marketing for those passing HS 2004.																								The council, said official Gerry Arathoon, has also collaborated with the International Institute of Advanced Studies and is coming up with a course on hospitality management.

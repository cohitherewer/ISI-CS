 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 When womanhood is at stake
Kheyali Dastidars adaptation of the legend of Behula and Lakhinder follows the folklore upto the point where Behula infuses new life into her dead husband. It is at this juncture that Charbaks production of Kande Keno Behula Sondori makes a significant detour from the original story. Behula is henceforth made to represent womanhood in its entirety. She becomes an embodiment of the woman who lives and suffers, the woman who will risk her life to secure the continual existence of her family and yet have to prove to the world her commitment and chastity. The play is a tribute to the modern Behulas who have to pay with their lives, be it before the evil called dowry or that of suspicion... or simply because they were born as women with an unearthly capacity to suffer, yet love and live.																								Event: A play in Bengali, Kande Keno Behula Sondori, by Charbak																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

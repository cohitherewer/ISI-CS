 A STAFF REPORTER																								I have been kidnapped. The distress call from a 13-year-old boy  that later turned out to be rather dubious  reached his parents on Tuesday night, more than three hours after he went missing from his Raja Subodh Mullick Square residence.																								It took some time for the police to figure out that this kidnap drama had a curious twist in the tale  it had been scripted by the boys fear of repeating failure in his Class V finals.																								The boy told his parents that he was going to a friends place and left home at around 5 pm on Tuesday. Three hours later, his parents received a call from him saying he had been kidnapped.																								The boy told his parents that two unidentified men had picked him up in front of Hind cinema, while he was on his way to his friends house. I was taken to Sealdah station from the hall and was forced to board a local train. We travelled for nearly an hour. They have kept me captive in an unknown place, he told his anxious parents.																								His parents immediately alerted us. Officers rushed to the house and installed a caller-line identification (CLI) machine to trace any further calls from the boy or his abductors, said Naseem Ali, officer-in-charge of the local police station.																								At around 9 pm, the family received another call, this time from the kidnappers who demanded a ransom of Rs 10 lakh. The call was traced to Naihati, in North 24-Parganas.																								We circulated the boys photographs among our officers so that they could identify him. We were also making arrangements to send a team to Naihati. But at around 10.30 pm, one of our officers spotted the boy on Creek Row, very close to Hind cinema, and brought him to the police station, Ali added.																								When the police started questioning him, the boy insisted that he had been abducted and then forced by the kidnappers to call up his parents from a local booth. When asked how he had managed to land up at Creek Row, he said he had managed to give his abductors the slip and board a Sealdah-bound train. But on further questioning, he started coming up with contradicting statements, Ali said.																								Finally, the boy confessed to his crime  leaving home and going to Naihati, from where he called up his parents, waited for an hour before making the second call posing to be a kidnapper, with a handkerchief stuffed into the mouthpiece, and then returning to Calcutta by the next train.																								He told us that he had failed in his examinations last year and was anticipating a similar result this time. With his results due on Friday, he had become desperate to gain the sympathy of his parents, Ali concluded.

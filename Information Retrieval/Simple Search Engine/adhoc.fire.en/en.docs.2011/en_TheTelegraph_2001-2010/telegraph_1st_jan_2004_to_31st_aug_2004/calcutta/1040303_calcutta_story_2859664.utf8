The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Joint venture run for buses
 																											- CSTC explores funds options to meet courts clean-air deadline A STAFF REPORTER																								What with the court deadline on complying with Bharat Stage II norms drawing closer and the funds crunch still hurting hard, the government has formulated a new scheme to ply buses under a joint venture. Besides, the transport department has decided to take a bank loan to upgrade the old buses and buy new ones.																								The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has nearly 1,200 buses in its fleet, of which only 60 are Bharat II-compliant. Another 400 can be upgraded. But the remaining 740 buses will have to be replaced by new ones, for they are between eight and 12 years old. 																								Everything will have to be completed by April, as per the court order. The expense has been estimated at Rs 250 crore.																								We submitted the plans, including funds requirements, to the finance department at least a month ago but to date, there has been no response, said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. We are ready to comply with the court order within the April 2004 deadline, but if the file from the finance department does not move, we cant do a thing, the minister added.																								He will take up the matter with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Chakraborty said, seeking his intervention in the release of funds. Everyone will blame my department if we fail to turn Bharat II-compliant. So, I want to make it clear that the department will not be able to move an inch in this matter until and unless funds are forthcoming, the minister said.																								We estimate that it will cost Rs 96 crore for upgradation and Rs 27 crore to buy 300 new buses. We sent the detailed plans and estimate to the finance department a month ago, said Debabrata Kundu, financial adviser of CSTC. 																								He added: Instead of providing additional funds for Bharat II compliance, the government slashed our usual subsidy by Rs 70 lakh in January (CSTC gets a monthly subsidy of Rs 6.87 crore). Besides, we have not yet received the Rs 9 crore required for the emergency repair of some buses. We are virtually penniless now and work can start only when funds come.																								However, realising that there is little hope of funds materialising, transport department officials have drawn up some alternative plans. 																								We are not sure whether we will get funds from the government or how much we will get. So, we are knocking on the doors of nationalised banks for loans and, ultimately, have been successful in getting their assurance, officials said.

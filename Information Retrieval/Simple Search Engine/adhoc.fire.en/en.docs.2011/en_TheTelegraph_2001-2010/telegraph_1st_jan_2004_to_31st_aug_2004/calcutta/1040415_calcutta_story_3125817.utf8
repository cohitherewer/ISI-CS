The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Taxi meter tamper check unit
 																											- Machines from Japan and Korea for joint venture on Bypass plot SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Concerned over rampant tampering of meters by a section of taxi operators and loopholes in the checking system, the transport department has decided to set up a modern meter-testing centre in Salt Lake.																								The centre, projected to cost about Rs 2 crore, will come up near the Salt Lake stadium on a one-acre plot owned by the sports department. It will be a joint venture, to be implemented by the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC).																								According to TIDC officials, taxi meters will be checked by sophisticated equipment to be imported from China and Korea. Each machine will cost around Rs 3 lakh. The testing will be conducted jointly by officials of the public vehicles and consumers affairs departments.																								At present, the public vehicles department (PVD) alone is authorised to check taxi meters. The tests are conducted at a centre with inadequate space on the EM Bypass, near the Kasba connector. As the testing is manual, it is time-consuming. Taxi operators have to wait for hours to get their meters tested.																								A taxi meter cannot be declared fit after a simple manual check. The meter has to be tested when the taxi is on the move, officials said, adding that there are only a handful of inspectors to undertake the stupendous job of checking the meters of about 40,000 taxis in the city.																								Cashing in on the loopholes in the system, a section of taxi operators is in the habit of tampering with meters and cheating passengers. PVD officials said it is very easy to break the meter seals and claimed that over 70 per cent of the citys taxis have faulty or tampered-with meters.																								Under the new system, meters will be tested while the vehicles are in motion.A taxi undergoing the test will be lifted by a hydraulic machine, which will activate the engine and make the wheels turn. The vehicles meter will be tested by the sophisticated machine in this condition. If the meter is found faulty or tampered with, necessary rectifications will be made, said TIDC director G.G. Bhattacharya.																								Then, the meters will be sealed to make them, more or less, tamper-proof. A token will be pasted on the windscreens of the taxis cleared by the meter-testing centre so that the passengers can identify them.																								 We will provide land to the private party, which will finance the project. The charges for testing and sealing the meters, to be collected from the operators, will be shared by the private partner, TIDC and the Salt Lake stadium authorities, said TIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee.																								Initially, six machines will be installed, which can check nearly 500 taxi meters a day.

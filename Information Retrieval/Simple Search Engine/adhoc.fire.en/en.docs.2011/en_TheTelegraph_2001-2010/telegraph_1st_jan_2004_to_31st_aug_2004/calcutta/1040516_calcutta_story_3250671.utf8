The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 16, 2004 Writing on the wall
Ad Lib / Shiloo ChattopadhyayPersonality over party is the message poll graffiti shouts out loud. But is that how we see it?The metro from Tollygunge left exactly at 6.45 pm. This was the Friday evening before Election Day. Two elderly gentlemen were engrossed in a chat. They were talking about electioneering  then and now. They were ruing the absence of good orators, charismatic leaders et al. And then they said parties and candidates had to advertise these days to win votes  what a sad state of affairs.It is more than likely that many of us share their perception. Electioneering and advertising are different things. It perhaps would take us a minute or two to realise that both are in fact communication, aiming to influence our choice. Indeed, during the last month or so what we experienced has been undiluted advertising. Advertising is a handy tool  equally for brands and ballots.It is curious however that many of the basic principles of advertising are not followed in electoral communication. Take wall signs for example. It is by far the most visible medium used by parties and candidates. It consumes the highest amount of space and uses the highest amount of manpower for producing the ads.Using the walls for electoral advertising thus makes sense  what does not is the communication the walls usually carry. The lions share of the available space on the wall is devoted to the name of the candidate. Striking colours, large fonts  all are deployed to make the candidates name readable from a mile away. Next in importance, but a very distant second, is the symbol of the party. And then almost as an apology, some space is devoted to the reason why our vote should go to that particular candidate. Smallest sized letters are used. Usually, too much is written in too little space. The advertiser almost does not expect us to read the small script. Strangely, this holds true irrespective of party, candidate or constituency.This, of course, would make eminent sense in a star constituency. There the candidate is the star  say Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Lucknow, Govinda in Mumbai and may be even our own Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta South (I hear the sniggers!). The trigger for voting there is expected to be the candidate. So the emphasis is understandable.What about normal constituencies with normal candidates? Such constituencies are in majority. Pundits talk about committed voters and fence sitters. For the committed, the allegiance is usually to a party. They need very little talking to. It is the fence sitters, the largely apolitical mass, which needs to be convinced through electoral advertising. Would an emphasis on the name of the candidate alone be enough motivation for them? Is the assumption then that the voter chooses a candidate first, then finds out which party he belongs to and then looks for a justification for his choice?Perhaps the real explanation lies elsewhere. In the Satyajit Ray movie Nayak, there is a sequence where a sidekick tries to explain to the hero (Uttam Kumar), why his latest release has flopped. The sidekick asks: What is there in the movie for the public? Uttam Kumar replies: Why? I am there.May be, just may be, this is what standing for elections does to candidates. They all feel: Main Hoon Na.

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Collapse, breach put paid to canal clean-up
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 																								The Kestopur canal desilt drive, taken up after a 25-year wait, has suffered a setback with the collapse of its guard walls at Chingrihata and Chitpur and a breach in its Salt Lake embankment.																								As water gushed down the canal, the desilt programme had to be called off. Engineers of the irrigation department, however, could not set any specific date on which work could resume.																								The irrigation department had taken up the Rs 10-crore project a couple of months ago to make the canal navigable and improve the drainage system in the east and north of the city. The Kestopur and Bagjola canals are the key outlets of drain as well as rainwater. The duo is also linked to a third small canal.																								Apart from improving the drainage system, the project also aimed at introducing water transport in the canals.																								The desiltation work on the stretch from Bagbazar to Kestopur, along Canal and VIP roads (10 km) was to be undertaken by the irrigation department and the stretch from Kestopur to Bhojerhat (20.5 km) fell under the jurisdiction of the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco).																								The irrigation department had flagged off work along the stretch from Ultadanga to Kestopur a couple of months ago. But now, resumption of work will be a problem. We will have to block the flow of water again and then pump out whatever has accumulated. It will be a tough job, irrigation engineers said. 																								Sources felt there was hardly any possibility of work resuming before the monsoon.																								Official sources said trouble cropped up in the first week of April, when a guard wall at Chingrihata collapsed and water started entering the canal. After two or three days, another guard wall at Chitpur collapsed, followed by a breach in the embankment at Nayapatti.																								Minister of state for irrigation Ganesh Mondal blamed the April 6 Norwester for the collapse of the guard walls. He added that an outlet at the Chitpur Circular Railway station, which had been blocked for the desiltation, had to be opened to drain out the accumulated water that then entered the Kestopur canal.																								The engineers should have taken a few more precautionary measures when work was in progress. We are now trying to make some alternative arrangements to pump out the water and resume work, the minister said.																								Hidco general manager Anjan Das said the collapse of the guard walls would delay the projects implementation. We had planned to complete a major portion of the desilting before the monsoon. But now, we have to change the entire work schedule and the target date of completion. However, we are trying our best to resume work at the earliest, he said. 																								The delay in the desilting project will also defer the repair and widening of the canalside roads. A section of local promoters, taking advantage of the situation, has started lifting the silt dumped on either side of the canal. My engineers will have to account for every handful of earth. I shall not spare anybody who tries to make capital of the adverse situation, minister Mondal warned.

 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Venice beside Victoria
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The stretch of land along Victoria Memorials perimeter wall, venue of several fairs in the past, will be turned into a park, complete with fountains and illumination, mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Wednesday.																								The mayor has even instructed civic engineers to beautify the surface drains in the stretch in pure Venetian style.																								Calcutta Police, in charge of this stretch, wants to beautify it, now that a permanent fairground is scheduled to come up on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.																								We at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are willing to invest Rs 8 crore to develop the stretch into a beautiful park and, if necessary, foreign consultants will be hired to landscape it, Mukherjee said. 																								He led a joint inspection of the stretch on Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by municipal commissioner Debashis Som, joint commissioner of police (organisation) Soumen Mitra and engineers from the project and development wing of the CMC.																								The Maidan belongs to the army but the stretch along the western side of Cathedral Road is managed by Calcutta Police. The stretch came to be known as the Maidan fairground as book fairs, handloom fairs, industrialfairs and melas of every description used to be held here.																								In November, Calcutta High Court had directed the government not to allow fairs to be held there.

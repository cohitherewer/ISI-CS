					PICTURE BY RASHBEHARI DAS Designers Priyanka Kumbhat, Anita Sureka and Farah Khan (left to right) pose in ensembles from the newly-opened Kavya 															This one turns the tables on the age-old too many cooks spoil the broth maxim. Kavya, the newly-opened boutique at 44A, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road is fronted by three enterprising women  Anita Sureka, Priyanka Kumbhat and Farah Khan  who have pooled together their creative talents to come up with a store that specialises in clothes that always, but always make a statement.																					Located on the ground floor of Wellesley Mansion, Kavya is the dream project of Anita, who has been designing professionally for the last seven years and supplying her creations to ateliers across the country and even in Dubai. Priyanka and Farah are the two designers that Anita has roped in recently to help her out with her work.																					The fabrics of choice for the trio include light-weight chiffons, georgettes and crepes as also heavier materials such as jamevaars. From these are fashioned short kurta ensembles, trendy kurtis, ghaghras and of course, saris  all one-of-a-kind and in striking designs. While the kurta sets and kurtis are quite chic, coming as they do in wispy styles and with eye-catching embellishments, its the collection of saris that steals the show. Especially appealing are the flaming orange saris with intricate Lucknowi chikan-work, the reds that sparkle and shine courtesy an interesting use of sequins and mukaish and the bright blue saris set off by attractive pattis and patch-work. The kantha creations in myriad hues also catch the eye while adding a generous amount of glitter to the range are the saris with rich kundan-adorned borders. The in-house speciality, though, is the range of hand-painted chiffons and georgettes, the floral and abstract motifs dusted with sequins for that extra sparkle.																					The price of togging up in a Kavya creation  anything between Rs 700 and Rs 2,500 for a kurti, Rs 1,000 and Rs 3,000 for a kurta set and a minimum of Rs 1,500 for a sari. 																					Kavya remains open throughout the week except Sundays from 10 am to 7 pm. For further details, contact 98301 95161.

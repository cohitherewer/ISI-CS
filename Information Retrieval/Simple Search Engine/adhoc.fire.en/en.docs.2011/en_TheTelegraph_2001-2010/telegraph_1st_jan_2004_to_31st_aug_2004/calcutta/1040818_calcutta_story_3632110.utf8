The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Bitten by Bips bug
																								She came. They saw. And boy, did she conquer! The Bengali boy bands were just bowled over by the Bips effect. The occasion was the Thums Up roadshow and the venue was the Hyatt banquets. It was supposed to be one thanda evening with Bipasha handing over special autographed guitars to the winning bands. But with the Jism lady around, it turned out to be one toofani affair																								Of the two city bands to be felicitated were the Lakkhichhara lads (picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). The evening was truly special for keyboardist Debaditta, who has always nursed a not-so-secret crush on the dusky Bengali beauty. 																								When she was just another model in the city, I used to know her through some common friends of ours, reveals Deba (as he is known). And I have no problem in admitting I had a crush on her and meeting her after all these years, well, it all came back to me in a flash.																								It was hardly surprising then that Deba landed up right next to Bipasha when the band was called up on stage, only to step back  kayoed by the height difference. I told Bipasha, You are too tall for comfort. Bips, of course, didnt bat an eyelid and said: Not that much.																								Not everyone was as hyper about it as Deba, but then Fossils didnt mind sharing 15 seconds of the Bipasha spotlight. Says lead singer Rupam: She said that she has heard a lot about Fossils and was really excited to hear that our new album was being mastered at New York. Obviously, being an out-and-out rock band, we would have been happier if we were felicitated by a rock legend. But Bipasha is big in her own way and although we are not really fans of hers, it did feel good.It was also a moment of glory for two other bands  Ishan had come from Ranaghat and Ek Poshla Brishti all the way from Behrampore. For people like us who do not even get to play that much in Calcutta, meeting Bipasha Basu and being felicitated by her was really a great feeling, says Santu Das, manager of Ishan. Her congratulatory remarks will motivate us to make better music in the future.																								By the end it was evident that all these roadshows had rolled out quite well for the young men of music.																								The only speed-breaker: She was wearing too much, complained a Lakkhichhara member, referring to the simple white shirt and jeans Bipasha was sporting for the evening. Alas!

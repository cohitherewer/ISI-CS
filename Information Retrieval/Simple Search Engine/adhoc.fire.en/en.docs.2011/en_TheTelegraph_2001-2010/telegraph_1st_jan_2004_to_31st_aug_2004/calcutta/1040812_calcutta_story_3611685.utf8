The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 New lakshya in Ladakh
Screen On amp; OffIt was Farhan Akhtar, along with the likes of Hrithik Roshan and Amitabh Bachchan, who made Ladakh come alive on the big screen in Lakshya. And now it is up to dandiya queen Falguni Pathak to do the same on the small screen. The video (stills left) for the title song of her new album Dil Jhoom Jhoom Naache, shot against the distinctive backdrop of the Ladakh landscape, is already making its presence felt, seen and heard on the Indipop countdown charts.When we were discussing where we could shoot the song, video director Yugander VV felt that only a place like Ladakh could do justice to the fresh flavour of the track, says Falguni. In the first couple of days, we did have breathing problems but then as we settled down, it turned out to be a beautiful experience.From Yaad Piya Ki Aane Lagi (remember little Riya in the video?) in 1998 to this new album of hers, Falguni has never really changed her style or content. I wouldnt like to disappoint my audiences. Even in Dil Jhoom..., the songs have simple Indian melodies with a couple of tracks having an extra groove or two. I just love folk numbers and that is what comes out in my songs  catchy tunes, not difficult to remember.The new album also sees Falguni and music director Lalit Sen coming together again. He has been my constant collaborator. He not only understands my range, mood and style, he knows how best to use my singing skills. When it comes to Hindi film music though, Falguni feels that she has never really got that big break. I did sing a couple of numbers but nothing major has worked out till date in Bollywood.One thing that is working out, though, is another trip to Calcutta. She is quite excited at the thought of coming here for an October show. The audience there is quite amazing. They not only have a vast knowledge of music, but are open to all genres. Unlike other places, they do not stick to one particular kind of sound, feels Falguni.And if you are one of those hoping to bring her down for a performance, here is a sweet tip. I can do anything to get my hands on the Calcutta rasgullas. The Mumbai ones are never as good. My show organisers invariably get me huge cans of rasgullas as soon as I land in Calcutta, smiles the girl with the syrupy voice.PRATIM D. GUPTA

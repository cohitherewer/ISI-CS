 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Fowl prices crash after flu fears
 OUR BUREAU																								Fowl is not fare in Bengal any longer. Thanks to the flutter over bird flu in some Asian countries, the poultry trade is going into convulsions in the city and elsewhere in the state, with major poultry outlets witnessing a sharp drop in consumption and a resultant crash in prices.																								Trade officials said on Monday that customers have all but shunned chicken and the demand for fowl has nosedived in the markets of the city and the districts, that usually sell 15 crore birds a year. 																								As a result, prices of live chicken have plummeted by about Rs 20 a kg. A bird that sold for Rs 55 a kg is now available at between Rs 35 and Rs 40 a kg in the city markets.																								Consumption of chicken has dropped by 30 per cent to 70 per cent in the state. At New Market, only two truckloads of birds are being supplied daily, against 10 truckloads four days ago. At a market in Behala, 700 kg of chicken is usually sold on Sundays. Last Sunday, however, only 40 kg was sold, said S.S. Aggarwal, secretary of the East India Association of Poultry Industries and Farmers, a major poultry traders body. 																								The bird flu virus is nowhere in India, let alone Bengal. But people have virtually stopped eating chicken. Even the supply of chicken to states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa has stopped. Two days ago, trucks carrying birds to Orissa were stopped at the border, said Aggarwal.																								There should be no panic, as bird flu has not been found yet in humans. We have discussed with the state government steps that are to be taken if a case is detected. We are vigilant, asserted T.N. Naik, deputy director and head of the virology department at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases at Beleghata.																								The fallout is that the prices of fish and meat have spiralled in city markets. Id-uz-Zoha on Monday and the statewide bandh on Tuesday have raised fish and meat prices.																								The price of quality meat, that ranged between Rs 140 and Rs 150 a kg, is around Rs 160 a kg now. Fish prices, too, have shot up because of dwindling supplies from Andhra Pradesh, in view of Tuesdays bandh and the ongoing marriage season.																								The city receives over 1.5 lakh kg of fish daily from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Rohu and katla were selling for Rs 70 and Rs 90 a kg on Monday, against Rs 50 and Rs 60 on Saturday.

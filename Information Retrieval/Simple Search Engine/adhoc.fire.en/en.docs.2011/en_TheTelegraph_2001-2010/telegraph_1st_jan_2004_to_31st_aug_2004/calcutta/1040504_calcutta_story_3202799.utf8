 A STAFF REPORTER																								Jeeba Yasmin, 15, died after she was burnt in the explosion of a gas cylinder when she went to make tea at her home on Gas Street, Narkeldanga, on Monday. 																								Gas had leaked overnight from the cylinder and turned the kitchen into a bomb waiting to explode. The moment Yasmin lit a matchstick, the gas exploded with a blinding flash and she found herself enveloped in flames. 																								A screaming Yasmin stumbled out of the room and slumped on the floor of the adjacent room. Initially, her relatives did not know what to do when they saw Yasmin turn into a human torch. They managed to smother the flames with the help of clothes, an officer of Narkeldanga police station said.																								However, the fire in the kitchen showed no signs of subsiding. A few neighbours tried to douse the blaze by sprinkling water on it. 																								Seeing their efforts were proving inadequate they called the fire brigade, said the officer.																								The firemen, who arrived there in two fire tenders, had to fight for over an hour to put out the flames completely. 																								We have carried out a spot investigation. The cylinder has been seized for examination, said a fire brigade official.																								Yasmins family and a few neighbours rushed the screaming teenager  her torso was badly burnt  to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where doctors attended on her for two hours, but she never regained consciousness. 																								The fire brigade report on the cause of the blaze is awaited.

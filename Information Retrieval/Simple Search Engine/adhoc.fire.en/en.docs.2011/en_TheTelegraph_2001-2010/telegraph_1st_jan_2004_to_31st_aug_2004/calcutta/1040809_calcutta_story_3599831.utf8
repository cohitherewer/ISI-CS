 THE HOLE TRUTH: Craters eat into a road in Baguiati that cannot be repaired right away because the PWD is short of cash. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryBacchu Roy: I represent the Baguiati-Satgachhi route autorickshaw union. The condition of the road between Baguiati and Khaldhaar is awful and a major mishap is imminent.We are aware of the condition of the road and have held a series of meetings with public works department (PWD) officials to discuss its repair. Unfortunately, due to a financial crunch, the PWD is not in a position to carry out the repairs immediately. Considering the condition of the road, we had included it on our list of projects for the Rajarhat neighbourhood development committee, though the road lies far beyond the committees action area. The committee was set up by the government to look after the rehabilitation of families evicted during the acquisition of land for the New Township project and to develop the surrounding areas for swifter growth of Rajarhat. By the plan, the Housing and Industrial Development Corporation (Hidco) will pay the PWD for repairing the road. If red tape delays this inter-departmental transfer of funds, I assure you that our municipality will take up the repairs on a priority basis by this month-end.

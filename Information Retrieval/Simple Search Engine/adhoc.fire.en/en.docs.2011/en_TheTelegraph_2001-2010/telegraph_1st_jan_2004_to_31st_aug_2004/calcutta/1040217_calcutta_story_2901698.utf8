 Ballari Mukherjees fascination with the intricacies of the human body and its dynamics finds expression through her artistic creations. Her creative finesse is such that it can turn familiar characters and objects into icons. She infuses new life into mundane things that normally escape the naked eye. The monumentalization of a limb, a raised hand or the feet at the accelerator, or the dynamics of a bus in motion, when transported on paper takes on a fresh meaning. She feels a whole gamut of emotions, ranging from passion to pain, before she allows them to filter through her aesthetic eye and lends them a tangibility that takes shape on paper. Mukherjees works are throbbing with a life that has been granted to them by their creator, an artist who recreates the world in retrospect and colours it with her minds eye.																								Event: Recent paintings of Ballari Mukherjee																								When: Till February 21; 10 am - 7 pm																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery, Queens Mansion, 12F Park Street

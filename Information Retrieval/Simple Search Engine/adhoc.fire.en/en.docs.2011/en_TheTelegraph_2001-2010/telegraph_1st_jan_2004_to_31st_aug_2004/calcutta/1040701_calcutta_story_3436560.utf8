 Actress Koel Mullick gets a royal treat at Saffron, The Park. Pictures by Rashbehari DasTheres a royal affair at Saffron with the Indian speciality restaurant at The Park hosting The Great Mughals  a food festival presenting the culinary journey of the emperors. 																								The festival, on between July 1 and 11, gives Mughlai cuisine a new dimension. The fare being offered is a world apart from the so-called Mughlai khana dished out by every other eatery in the city.																								The Mughal emperors were patrons of lavish food and their food habits rule the country even today. They were the ones to introduce kebabs and biryani in India. 																								The festival pays tribute to this epicurean era by showcasing cuisines from the court of the seven great Mughal emperors. 																								After extensive research on the food habits of each emperor, master chef Ashfaque Quereshi has come up with a menu which presents seven delicacies from the courts of each of the seven emperors. Our research revealed amazing facts about the culinary preferences of the Mughal emperors related to the social conditions of the time and the geographical boundaries of their empire. While Akbar had very extravagant food habits, Aurangzeb preferred vegetarian cuisine. Baburs kitchen had a lot of central Asian influences, while during Humayuns reign the cuisine reflected Iranian influences, said Quereshi.																								The treat at Saffron starts with the lavish spread from Baburs court with dishes like Afghani Kebab (chicken marinated in yoghurt, cheese and vinegar, chargrilled in tandoor), Birjani Iran (lamb cooked with rice flavoured with saffron and pinenut), Naan Changezi and others. 																								The delicacies that ruled the roost in Humayuns time are well represented in the menu with items like Murg Anari Biryani (chicken stuffed with fresh pomegranate, cheese and dum cooked Basmati rice) and Sirka Boti Kebab (cubes of lamb marinated in fruit vinegar and Peshawari masala and chargrilled) among others. 																								From Akbars bill of fare there are Lahori Machchi (steaks of local river fish marinated with fresh masala and green coriander and fried), Paneer Hazoor Pasand (paneer sauteed and simmered in white gravy) and Malaiwala Murgh (chicken cooked with brown onions, mixed spices and sour cream) to name a few. 																								From Jahangirs reign there are Noormahal Biryani (Basmati rice cooked with minced meat dumplings garnished with egg yolk), Lazeez-e Pasliya (lamb chops cooked with garlic and onions in yoghurt gravy) and Jamun--Gul and others. 																								From Shahjahans treasure trove there are Bater Musallam (Qualis cooked on dum with thick nut and saffron gravy), Kofta Chui Mui (lamb dumplings cooked in a rich gravy), Guchhi Mattar (Kashmiri morels simmered with green peas) and the famous Firni. 																								From the court of Aurangzeb there are items like Baghe Hazim (tandoor roasted aubergine and potato soup), Rakhoche Ka Salan (tender arbi leaves rolled in urad dal paste) and assorted diced mangoes served with malai. The last emperor, Bahadur Shahs exotic fare include Jhinga Jalperi (prawn simmered in a tangy gravy), Arbi Gosht (morsels of lamb and arbi cooked in hot spicy masala) and Chutney Pulao (baby potatoes marinated in green mint and coriander chutney cooked with Basmati rice).

Gem of a jewelShe started designing very basic jewellery around a year-and-a-half ago, selling mostly from her home and through exhibitions. In this short span of time, Vasundhara Mantris gems have added to the beauty of many of Calcuttas fashionistas. 																								On Wednesday, the young designer launched her studio called Vasundhara at The Enclave in Alipore. The launch was as high profile as the collection on offer, with B.K. Birla and Sarla Birla inaugurating the store. 																								Trained at the Gemological Institute of America, Vasundhara creates intricately handcrafted jewellery in silver, using semi-precious stones like aquamarine, amethyst, zircon and many more. The motifs are a blend of traditional Indian and Western designs. There are also antique Edwardian designs using pearls. 																								All of these are designed to go with partywear for women between 20 and 35 years of age, informed the designer. 																								Vasundhara updates her collection based on international colour trends. I keep changing my collection every season. Theres a new set of colours which are in vogue each season and I try to keep my line in sync with these trends. Currently, pastels are in and you will find lots of gems in similar shades in my collection, she said.																								Besides, the studio also offers a line of handbags and shoes designed to co-ordinate with the jewellery on offer. There are partywear shoes in brocade and gota work and ones for regularwear in colour co-ordinated leather. Batuas and clutch bags complete the look.

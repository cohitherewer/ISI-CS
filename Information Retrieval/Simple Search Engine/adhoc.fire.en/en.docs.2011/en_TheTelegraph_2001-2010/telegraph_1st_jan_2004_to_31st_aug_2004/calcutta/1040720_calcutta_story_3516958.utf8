 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Five pyres, in order of age 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Around 8.30 pm on Sunday, the victims of the serial deaths at 91/3C, Tollygunge Road, reached Keoratala burning ghat. Three Matador vans moved slowly through the main gate. One by one, five bodies wrapped in white cloth were drawn out.																								The floor in front of the electric crematorium was packed, so the five bodies were lined up, side by side, in order of age. 																								The cloth that covered the faces was removed. The bodies of two children, Simanta and Bedanta, remained in one of the vehicles.																								The first half-an-hour passed silently. Only a few relatives keened. Then, as news spread in the adjacent localities, the burning ghat overflowed.																								The relatives had urged the police for special measures to hasten the post-mortem and cremation, as it was a Sunday. Police agreed, on a condition. 																								We told them wed rush through the procedure as long as the bodies were not taken back to the Tollygunge residence, said an officer. 																								The Sahas agreed. There was no reason to refuse. There was a throng of people waiting outside the 93/1C gates. So, we went straight to the burning ghat from the Kantapukur morgue, said a relative.																								All five brothers of Nabendu Saha, father of Shibendu, who allegedly wiped out his six family members before committing suicide, were present at the ghat, except Amalendu Saha. He was under arrest at Charu Market police station, being named in Shibendus suicide note as the instigator of the tragedy. 																								We started interrogating him on the basis of Shibendus three-page suicide note, in which he has been clearly blamed. We couldnt allow him to go to the burning ghat in the middle of our investigation, said a Charu Market police station officer. Besides, he showed no interest.																								At the burning ghat, there was some indecision over who should light the pyres. The Sahas asked Biswanath, Shibendus brother-in-law, to stand in.																								Father Nabendus body was the first to be cremated. It was around 1 am when Shibendus brother Krishnendus body was consigned to the flames. The two boys were then taken for burial to Topsias Hindu Burial Ground.																								Around 1.15 am, the 91/3C gates were opened. Heads were seen peering out from balconies. A silver Santro and two motorcycles came to a halt. A woman asked from a balcony above: Shob bhalo bhabe hoyechhe to (Did everything go off well)? Two persons from the Santro answered: Yes. The rest went away. 																								And Nabendu and his three generations faded into the past.

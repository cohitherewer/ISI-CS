The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Retail tale: crawl to canter
 																											- The Calcutta consumer turns the city into a mega mart																								Zip, zap, zoom zero to 60 in nine seconds. Typically, a motorcycle burning rubber on asphalt																								Now, Calcutta is zipping  burning paper and plastic on the high streets of modern retail  and leaving industry-watchers zapped.																								A trifle late in reacting to the starters gun, the tale of its rapid acceleration on road retail can be told in figures. Till 1999, there was only 22 Camac Street. In the next 36 months, around 11 new malls are set to roll out, offering nearly three million sq ft of retail space, besides 30-plus multiplex screens and allied entertainment.																								A year ago, there was hardly any modern trade outlet spread across more than 1,000 sq ft with two or more cash tills here. Over the past 8-10 months, at least 75 such stores have come up across the city, points out Manish Tiwary, national key accounts manager, Hindustan Lever. Tiwary, in town to attend the CIIs Retail 2004, is confident modern trade, which accounts for only one per cent of the citys turnover now, should spiral to 20 per cent in the next three years.Defying tradition																								The mindset of the Calcuttan had always favoured denial over consumption. But there has been a quiet revolution in attitude over the past few years and the visible end of the consumption spectrum is retail, observes Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises Ltd.																								Kurush Grant, chairman, services sector sub-committee, CII, eastern region, ascribes the recent spending spree to the new-found confidence factor, with a clutch of enablers like availability of credit, better options in goods and services, higher salaries and increased media impact.																								So, from the value-seeker to the promo-grabber, the monthly grocery  and annual clothes  shopper to the impulse buyer, shopping behaviour pattern in the city is changing radically. And there are strong fundamentals to sustain the displacement from the conventional trader-run standalone shops to more organised and large retail formats, says CII.																								The disposable income in Calcutta has been on the rise according to a report by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER). About 62 per cent of city households had annual incomes of up to Rs 18,000 in 1985-86, while a decade later, the Rs 25,000-77,000 bracket accounted for some 61 per cent of the households.																								With a median age of 24-25, todays Calcutta shopper has high aspiration levels and carries a mixed bag of intrinsic values and western aspirations. 																								With the IT boom, call centres and BPOs, theres moolah in young hands, and unlike in the past, the motto of the young nest today is have money, will spend, says Vidya Sen of ACNielsen ORG-MARG.In sync with times																								Stressing that the future of retailing in the city lies in new-age shopping malls providing variety, value and convenience in a more comfortable environment, Sen feels the most significant trigger in Calcuttas case was Pantaloons, with its value for money line.																								Kishore Biyani, chief knowledge officer, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, feels it was the citys inherent pessimism which prevented it from celebrating its successes, but now there is so much more optimism in the air.																								The propensity to buy was always there in Calcutta, but it was more linked to the Pujas till 22 Camac Street happened, feels Anuj Puri, managing director of Chesterton Meghraj, international property consultants.																								Sumit Dabriwal, convenor, core group for retail, CII eastern region, agrees the city always had the aspiration, and is now reacting strongly to the organised-format product in steady supply.Footfall space for all																								A little bit of herding takes place in any successful area and there will be some mortality for sure, but overall, modern retail should keep growing in the city. What we have seen till now is simply the tip of the iceberg, says Goenka, keen to bring in his FoodWorld chain on the heels of four Giant hypermarts.																								Puri agrees: While there could be an oversupply situation on a narrow band along the Bypass, the city as a whole can still absorb a string of malls, because the basic hygiene of the Calcutta mall developer has been exemplary.																								The emerging formats in town are all a statement in innovation. Be it Forum, the plush, integrated, vertical lifestyle mall of Rahul Saraf or the brand-bazaar blend and horizontal sprawl of Harsh Neotias City Centre, the experiments with retail truth will intensify. Nothing, on the shop floor, succeeds like success.

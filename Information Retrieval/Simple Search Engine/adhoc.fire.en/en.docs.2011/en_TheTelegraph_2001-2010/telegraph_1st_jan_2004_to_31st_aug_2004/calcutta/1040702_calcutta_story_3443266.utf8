 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Less fortunate than the Sens
 																											- Bapi batchmate, crushed to death by taxi, remains uncompensated A STAFF REPORTER 																								The Sen family of Parnasree may have found the support to continue its crusade, but not all are equally fortunate. Not, at least, the Gangulys of Sarsuna. 																								Barely a kilometre or two from Bapis residence, the wife and mother of another traffic sergeant, Biswajit Ganguly, continue their daily struggle to survive. Two-and-a-half years after he was deliberately run over by a taxi while on duty, the family is yet to be compensated.																								Gangulys colleagues had collected Rs 2 lakh, but with no one to decide on how to disburse it, the money was returned to the contributors. Since then, files have piled up yet no relief has reached the family. 																								It was around 7.30 pm and I was on duty near the approach of Dhakuria bridge. It seemed nothing would move, recalls Amitava Sarkar, Biswajits batchmate. 																								Biswajit stood beside me as I tried to cope with the situation. Suddenly, a taxi drew up from one of the approach roads to the bridge and tried to wriggle past at breakneck speed. The passengers screamed. 																								Amitava, then a sergeant with the South-East Traffic Guard, booked errant driver Abhimanyu Thakur for rash and negligent driving, before moving on to clear the traffic jam. 																								Once the road had cleared, he shifted to the Gariahat crossing, leaving Biswajit on the spot. Almost half an hour later, the driver returned to the spot, his number-plate covered with a red cloth. He mistook Biswajit for me. The driver first knocked him down and then crushed him under the wheels, Amitava said. 																								We rushed him to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, but he had already succumbed to his injuries. The driver was later arrested and prosecuted for murder. But Biswajits family received no compensation, said batchmate Bhagirath Ghosh.																								Efforts were made to help them. Immediately after the incident, I made an appeal  typed both in Bengali and Hindi  to the rank and file of my force. It worked, and soon Rs 2 lakh was collected, recalled K. Harirajan, then deputy commissioner of police (traffic).																								I am not sure what happened thereafter, but for months, the money could not be handed over to the Gangulys. The money was returned to the contributors, he added. 																								For some time thereafter, Biswajits colleagues recall, his wife ran from pillar to post in search of compensation and then gave up. 																								A day after Bapi Sens death, she went to his Behala home to sympathise with the family.

 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Dues talks fail, ship stranded in stand-off
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The MV Nicobar is not going anywhere in a hurry. With most of the 756 passengers disembarking, the MV Nicobar wore a forlorn look on Sunday as it lay anchored at the Kidderpore docks.																								The dues-dispute talks between the agitating crew supported by Citu and the Directorate of Shipping Services of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration dragged on, with no solution in sight.																								Kali Ghosh, state secretary of the CPMs labour arm, reaffirmed that the ship would not be allowed to weigh anchor unless the dues of 24 seamen, belonging to the Citu-controlled Forward Seamens Union, were settled. There is no question of allowing it to embark on its journey to Port Blair, Ghosh said on Sunday.																								The ship, which arrived on April 19 from the Andamans, was to set sail on Friday with 756 passengers and 300 tonnes of perishable cargo, but a militant crew, backed by the local Citu leadership, stalled the journey.																								Left with no option, captain Manoj Kumar  heading a passenger liner like the MV Nicobar for the first time in his 12-year tenure  had to ask passengers to disembark. Only around 30 passengers, who are non-locals, have decided to stay back till Monday, when all others will be refunded their fares. I, along with my 27 officers, will stay put till the ordeal ends, Manoj Kumar told Metro on Sunday.																								We hope some authorised official from the Andamans administration will arrive and start some sort of a dialogue soon. We are incurring huge losses as a result of the stand-off, said Kumar.																								Union members, meanwhile, tried in vain to contact the Andamans authorities after talks failed with the Shipping Corporation of India (authorised agents for the MV Nicobar) and contractors Fareedh Traders, Port Blair.																								The seamen will go, but only after their dues are cleared. And if we allow the ship to sail now, the issue will not be resolved for another six months at least, Ghosh added.

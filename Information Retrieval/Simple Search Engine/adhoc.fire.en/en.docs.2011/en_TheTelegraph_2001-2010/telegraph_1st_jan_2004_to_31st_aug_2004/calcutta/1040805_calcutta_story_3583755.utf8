 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Hangman gets his last chance
 A STAFF REPORTER Nata Mullick: Hangman readyThe Presidents nod has afforded hangman Nata Mullick another  and probably the final  chance to bargain with the government. 																								He wants a permanent job for a family member or a monthly retainership as hangmen for two members of his family.																								We have been fighting for a cause for over three decades  to be officially recognised as hangmen. Unfortunately, in spite of assurances by senior government officials to provide a job for a family member, we got nothing but humiliation, Mullick said on Wednesday morning. 																								The Mullicks, who had migrated from Bihar in the 19th Century, are proud of being hangmen.  Post-Independence hangings 
in Bengal:Aug. 21,1991: Twin hangings of Sukumar Barman and Kartick Seal 
April 1,1965: Twin hangings of Bhramar Singh and Suman Singh
Feb. 12,1962: Twin hangings of Ramdeo Kurmi and Sovan Mati, alias Palan
Sept. 23, 1959: Bholanath Choudhury
May 29, 1958: Gura Sahu
May 10, 1958: Twin hangings of Shamsher Sheikh and Sher Mohammad
Jan. 28,1956: Dinendranath Dutta
June 25,1952: Shyama Charan ShuklaMy father had hanged more then 600 people and I assisted him in 61 of the cases. Dhananjoy will be my 25th subject. And I should add that a perverse criminal like him should go to the gallows, Mullick asserted.																						I am ready to do the job for the government, but my sons and grandsons, who will perform the task after me, should get their due recognition, Mullick added. 																								This time, I will not let the government cheat me. I will only carry out the hanging after I get the confirmation of either an allowance of Rs 2,500 or Rs 3,000 for at least two members of the family or a permanent government job for my grandson, Mullick said, with a determined look on his face.																								Mullicks son Mahadeb, who is expected to replace his father once he retires, too, expressed his unhappiness over the issue. Whenever someone is to be hanged, the jail department officers summon us but they forget us once the job is over. We were not even informed when Dhananjoys hanging was stayed on June 25, Mahadeb said. 																								The Mullicks feel they have been exploited by the state government. After the hanging was stayed, Natas grandson, Prabhat, was offered a job but on a years contract, instead of a permanent one.

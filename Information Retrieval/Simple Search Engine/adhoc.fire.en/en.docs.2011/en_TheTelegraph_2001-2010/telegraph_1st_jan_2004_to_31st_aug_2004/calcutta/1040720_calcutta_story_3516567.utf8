 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Defence fails to get veiled couple out on bail
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A long wait in the court lockup. A packed courtroom. An uncle and aunt arrested for abetting suicide. Jittery relatives hoping to get the couple out on bail. 																								A day after tragedy struck the Saha home on Tollygunge Road, where seven members of the family were found dead under mysterious circumstances, Amalendu Saha  uncle of Shibendu, who is believed to have hanged himself after poisoning his family  and aunt Anita were produced in Alipore court. 																								The judge remanded the couple in police custody till July 27.																								Shibendu, in his three-page suicide note, had said that his uncle and aunts behaviour had prompted him to take the lives of his family before killing himself. He claimed Amalendu had duped his father and influenced him to act against his wishes. 																								Shibendu had also expressed surprise over the huge property that his uncle had amassed on a salary of Rs 4,500 per month. He even mentioned the name of a close relative of the Saha family as part of the conspiracy.																								The court of additional chief judicial magistrate Shankar Nath Das was packed with lawyers, members of the Saha family and a huge crowd of curious onlookers. The audience, including mediapersons, spilled over on to the verandah outside. 																								Amalendu, clad in a pair of khaki bermudas and a yellowish T-shirt, walked into the courtroom with his face covered. He was closely followed by his wife, who hid her face in the pallu of her pink printed sari.																								The couple stood motionless, clinging to the wooden railing of the witness box, facing each other, while defence lawyers Tamal Mukherjee and Mrityunjay Mishra pleaded with the court to get them out on bail.																								It was undoubtedly the most gruesome and sadistic incident of the century and a detailed probe into the incident is, indeed, a must. However, on the basis of a suicide note  by a person who killed his parents and children, along with his wife and brother  one cannot hold the two guilty, reasoned lawyer Mukherjee. We must realise that Shibendu was not in his senses when he wrote the note, he added.																								We must also take note of the fact that Anita is not a business partner. Being a woman, she is not capable of instigating someone to commit such a ghastly crime before taking his own life, the lawyer added.																								But the arguments failed to convince the judge. More so, after public prosecutor Shashanko Shekhar Choudhury pointed out that it was next to impossible for a man to commit suicide after tying his own legs with a gamchha. 																								The two accused could help in the investigation of the case and could sort out the mystery that shrouds the killings. Taking into consideration the circumstantial evidence, they need to be interrogated, public prosecutor Choudhury added.

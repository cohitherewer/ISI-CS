The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Blame the man at the wheel
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Is the bus-owner liable to compensate the victim(s) if his vehicle causes an accident? Road-racer: Firemen try to douse the flames after yet another killer bus is set on fireVaijayanta Chattoraj, 
																		BowbazarInstead of accusing the bus-owner, the drivers licence should be cancelled for five years. The conductor should also be barred from the profession for the same period. A hefty fine charged from them can be used to compensate the victims. If the accident occurs due to a technical fault, only then can the bus-owner be held responsible. P. Pramanik, 
Santoshpur AvenueBus-owners are the primary employers and operators of vehicles. However, the compensation amount should be recovered from both bus-owners and drivers. Bus-owners may recover a part of the amount paid as compensation from the employees responsible for the accident as a precautionary measure. 

Piyal Mukherjee,
																		Lake Town																																																														If the accident is caused due to negligence on the part of the bus-owner, the onus of responsibility for the accident falls on him. As such, he should compensate the victim. However, he may realise the amount of compensation from the bus driver and the helper subsequently. 									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
																		Behala																																																														If a bus-owner is made to pay up, he will probably have to take adequate insurance cover on the lives of passengers by charging some extra money along with the existing fare. Then, the compensation might be paid through the insurance company. 									

Samita Pal, 
																		Kalindi																																																														Accidents are caused mostly due to irresponsible drivers trying to race and overtake each other. A life of a person cannot be compensated with money but if it depletes the purse of the bus-owner, he would be more careful when employing drivers.									

Kanai Saha,
																		Gauri Bari Lane																																																														A committee appointed by the Regional Transport Authority should try to fathom whether mechanical trouble or the drivers irresponsibility or public ignorance of road rules led to the mishap. If mechanical trouble of the bus led to the accident, only then should the bus-owner be liable to compensate the victim(s) or his/her family. 									

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 
																		Chandbati, Hooghly																																																														If there is an official rule about arresting the owner of the killer vehicle, the bus-owner will be cautious. He will think twice before appointing a driver with a record of reckless driving. Fear of penalty alone can make the bus-owner careful about being responsible in his choice of driver at the wheel of his vehicle.									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park																																																														The victim or his/her kin should file a suit against the bus-owner and also approach the accident claim tribunal judge, as per section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. After hearing the case, the court usually orders the bus-owner to pay a stipulated amount as compensation to the applicant through his indemnifier insurance company.									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Beleghata																																																														When a vehicle owner is making a profit from his vehicle, he should be liable to compensate for the accident.									

Naren Sen, 
																		Howrah																																																														The owner should pay compensation, if the victim has been run over by the bus driver. In most cases, it is observed that an accident takes place due to lack of poor maintenance of the vehicle or negligence by the driver and/or conductor. 									

Bhupen Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														Apart from the unhealthy practice of drivers overtaking buses on the same route, passengers are also sometimes guilty of compelling the driver to drive faster. In case of death of a person because of such reckless driving, the bus-owner should be held liable to pay compensation.									

Rohini Mohan Pal Majumdar,
																		Shyamnagar																																																														The bus-owner is not liable for compensation as he is not the person at the wheel of the killer vehicle. The driver should be held responsible along with the government, which is to be blamed for the low percentage of road area in Calcutta. 									

Jaydip Paul, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														Yes, the bus-owner should be liable to compensate the victim(s) if his vehicle meets with an accident. Rash driving is precisely why the city streets are no longer safe for pedestrians.									

Soni Prashad,
																		Judges Court Road 																																																														It is more important to find out the reason behind the increasing number of bus accidents. The bus-owners must try to stop this spate of deaths. The owners should impart proper training to their drivers along with a reasonable dose of civic sense. Drivers act like cowboys riding their horses in an open field. 									

Chandrani Negal, 
																		Narkeldanga																																																														If there was a law that forced bus-owners to pay such compensations, it would bring down the number of accidents. The apprehension that he would have to pay from his own pocket would make the bus-owner employ a responsible driver. 									

Jayanta Mallick, 
																		Behala																																																														The bus-owner pays the driver and conductors for rendering proper service. If they fail in their duties, it is not the owner of the bus but the driver who should shoulder the responsibility to compensate the victims. Only if the errant driver is taken to task will it be possible to decrease the number of accidents.									

Arindam Ray, 
																		Salt Lake 																																																														The bus-owner should be liable to compensate the victim(s) either from his own pocket or with money realised from insurance policies against accidents. Besides, the licence of the driver should be revoked for at least one year and unions should see to it that he does not return to work during that period.									

Seraj Alam, 
																		Bansberia 																																																														Drivers of buses are often under the influence of alcohol. They lose their sense of judgement during emergencies and their behaviour might lead to serious accidents. Bus-owners who employ such drivers should compensate the victim(s).									

Madhabi D. Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake 																																																														No, not the bus-owners, but the government should be held responsible to compensate the victim(s), because the state administration is unable to exercise necessary control over bus-owners. The public vehicles department issues fitness certificates and licences to buses without proper checks. As a consequence accidents cannot be averted. 									

Satyen Biswas, 
																		Behala																																																														The drivers seem inhuman brutes who do not care for passengers or pedestrians. The bus-owners should be liable to compensate for those killed and injured in bus mishaps. The criminal driver should be jailed and his driving licence cancelled.Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna																																																														The errant bus drivers in the city should be put behind bars and the owners penalised severely if they are found responsible for accidents. Further, arrangements may be made to compensate the relatives of the victims.									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 
																		Entally																																																														When the accident is caused as a result of a mechanical snag or complete disregard of public safety on the drivers part, the bus-owner should be liable to compensate the victim(s). But there are cases where the fault is entirely the victims. The bus-owner, then, should be held liable only for part payment of the compensation. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore																																																														The driver is not always responsible for the accident. It is often noticed that pedestrians gesticulate at the driver to either stop or slow down while they abruptly set out to cross the road. In such a case why should the bus-owners be liable to shell out the compensation amount from their own pockets?

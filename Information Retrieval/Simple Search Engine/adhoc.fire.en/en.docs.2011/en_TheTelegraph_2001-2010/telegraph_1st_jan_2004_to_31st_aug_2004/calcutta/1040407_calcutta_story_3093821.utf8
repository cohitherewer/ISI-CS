 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Girls body found, face acid-scarred
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The body of a 21-year-old girl was recovered from a playground in Howrahs Jaipur police station area on Monday night. 																								The body bore marks of several wounds and half the face was badly burnt by acid. 																								Police identified the victim as Mithun Das, a Higher Secondary 2004 candidate of a school in Raghudebbati. 																								Mithuns parents have filed a complaint with the Manikpur investigation centre that she was raped and killed by two local youths. She had been spotted with them a few days ago.																								Mithun had failed last years Higher Secondary in the language group and was repeating the examination this year. 																								But, according to the police, she neither sat for the exams nor paid the exam fees to the school.																								Howrahs superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya said Mithun went missing on April 3, and her parents filed a missing diary at the Manikpur investigation centre the same night. 																								She never returned. Her body was recovered from the playground, though we cant confirm whether an acid attack was the cause of her death. Only a post-mortem will confirm that, Bhattacharya explained. The report is expected in a week. 																								However, after preliminary investigation, the police suspect it was a cold-blooded murder. 																								According to senior police officers, Mithun lied to her parents that she would write this years examination and that she had been allotted a seat in Burikhali High School.																								We have been informed by the authorities of the victims school and those of Burikhali High School that neither had Mithuns name been forwarded to the latter school as a candidate for Higher Secondary 2004, nor had she been allotted a seat there, superintendent of police Bhattacharya asserted. 																								Inquiries revealed that Mithun had been a mediocre student and never applied herself to her books.																								A police officer elaborated: All her seriousness towards studies would develop immediately before the exams. As a result, she had to sacrifice years in school quite a number of times. Usually, at age 21, a student is almost ready to complete his or her graduation.

 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 48 couples rounded up in resort
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A joint raid on a resort at Bishnupur, in South 24-Parganas, on Thursday morning, netted 48 couples for alleged involvement in a flesh-trade racket. 																								On a tip-off, officers from the district police and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) surrounded the resort, on Diamond Harbour Road, early on Thursday. The owner and his staff were taken by surprise, said R.K. Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial).																								Local residents alleged that they had repeatedly complained to the police about the shady resorts in the area. Abdur Rob, member of a voluntary organisation fighting against the resorts, echoed the view. The male guests at the resorts would even harass local women and girls, Rob said.																								According to additional superintendent Singh: The couples rounded up were mostly in their teens. Some claimed they are married and we are checking that out. Some were college students from Howrah and we have informed their parents.																								A senior CID officer said raids may be carried out at the other resorts also. Guilty resorts will be sealed, he warned.

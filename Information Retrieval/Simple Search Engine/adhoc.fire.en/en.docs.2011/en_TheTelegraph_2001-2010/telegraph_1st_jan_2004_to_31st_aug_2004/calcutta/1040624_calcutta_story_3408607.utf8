 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Patient alive, but declared dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alive sorry, dead no, no alive Medical muddle played out a brief life-and-death drama at Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday.																								Thirty-five-year-old Namita Roy, recuperating in the female ward, was declared dead by doctors, only for the error to be rectified soon after, with relatives of the patient who had died setting the record straight.																								Basanti Bardhan, a 70-year-old woman from Hooghly, suffering from an acute case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, died on the first floor of Medical College and Hospital late on Tuesday evening.																								One of her family members, who arrived at the hospital around 8 am on Wednesday, raised an alarm after noticing that Basanti Bardhan had mysteriously become Namita Roy.																								On realising their mistake, the doctors and nursing staff sent out an SOS to the hospital authorities. 																								Rabindranath Chatterjee, superintendent of Medical College and Hospital, then rushed to the ward and assured relatives that the mistake would be rectified.																								I personally made the necessary correction in the death certificate and Bardhans family members went away with the body without any further controversy, said Chatterjee.																								Later, the hospital superintendent paid a special visit to back-from-the-dead Namita Roy and asked after her health. 																								Thank heavens, the mistake could be rectified in time before things went out of hand, superintendent Chatterjee said later.																								The hospital authorities, however, had not bargained for what Namita Roy, an asthma patient, or her ageing mother Sumitra Devi went through on Wednesday.																								Around 3 pm, Sumitra Devi learnt from her neighbours in Jogen Dutta Lane about a death certificate having been wrongly issued in her daughters name.																								I rushed to the hospital and was so glad to find that my daughter was well, said Sumitra Devi, sitting beside Namita.																								The old woman died and they (the hospital staff) told everybody that I was dead. This is not at all funny, but I cant stop laughing, smiled Namita, the mother of three daughters.																								The hospital authorities later mounted an internal inquiry and warned the nursing staff responsible for the error of stern action.																								The incident comes close on the heels of a patient walking out of a crowded ward on Friday afternoon. The patient, Asish Chakraborty, was later found dead outside the hospital building, drawing negligence allegations against the hospital staff.

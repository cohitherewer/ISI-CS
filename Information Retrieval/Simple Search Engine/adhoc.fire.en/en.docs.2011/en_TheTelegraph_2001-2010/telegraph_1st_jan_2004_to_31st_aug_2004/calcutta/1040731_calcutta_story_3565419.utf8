																																																		After a gap of two-and-a-half years, the night skies will cradle a second full moon in one calendar month on July 31. The last blue moon, as it is called because of its rare occurrence, was in November 2001. The MP Birla Planetarium authorities confirmed that the next blue moon will be seen in 2007. It is only four times in a century that a year has two blue moons. In such an event, the month of February doesnt have a full moon day at all. 2004 has only one blue moon which can be seen at night on July 31, said Dr Devi Prasad Duari, director, research and academic, MP Birla Planetarium. The western countries will witness the blue moon hours after Indians do because of the different time zones. The coinage once in a blue moon dates back from 1883, when a severe volcanic eruption in Indonesia had spewed out a huge amount of ash into the atmosphere. The dust particles remained suspended in the air for around two years, partially blocking sunlight. During this period, heavenly bodies, like the moon, appeared bluish as the thick layer of dust blocked a major part of red light from the moon.

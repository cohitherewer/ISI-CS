The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 HS examinee awaiting results hangs herself
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The gates of the Lahiri residence, in Keyatala Lane, are barred to the outside world. But word of a tragedy seeped out from inside the south Calcutta address on Sunday morning.																								Chandreyi Lahiri, 19, one of the twins of physician Ranjan Lahiri, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling fan in her bedroom sometime during the night, police said on Sunday.																								Chandreyi had appeared for her Higher Secondary (HS) examination from a reputed English-medium school in central Calcutta and was awaiting her results, police said.																								We have received a report about the unnatural death and an investigation is on. After a preliminary investigation, we have not ruled out any of the options, said an officer of Lake police station.																								According to police, Chandreyi had retired to her bedroom after dinner on Saturday night.																								She hanged herself from the ceiling fan, but this was not discovered till about 1.30 am.																								She was taken to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan, on Sarat Bose Road, where she was declared brought dead.																								Lake police station, under whose jurisdiction Keyatala Lane falls, was not informed till 8.30 am about Chandreyis unnatural death.																								After we got the information, police personnel visited the Lahiri house but preliminary investigations have not revealed any foul play so far. We have recorded the statement of the family members and will talk to them again. The body has been sent for post-mortem, an officer of Lake police station said.																								Police are even examining the possibility of a suicide arising out of the fear of failing her school-leaving exams.																								Chandreyi had appeared for her HS last year, but failed. She reappeared this year and we are not ruling out the possibility that she was scared about failing again But then again why should she commit suicide when the results are not out yet? Things have not yet fallen into place and we are examining all aspects, said the police officer.																								Another officer on the case spoke of peer or parental pressure as the possible cause of the suicide.																								No one from the Lahiri family was available for comment. 																								When Metro visited the address on Sunday afternoon, the building in Keyatala Lane where the Lahiris live was rendered off-limits.																								The guard posted at the locked gate said the family was not home and refused permission to enter.																								Neighbours denied any knowledge of the incident or of the whereabouts of the family.																								Some residents in adjacent buildings said they had heard about the suicide, but did not know why the teenager had taken the tragic step.																								Some claimed that a steady stream of reporters seeking the bereaved family members had driven the Lahiris away to some other location.																								Others felt that the Lahiris had locked themselves up at home in a bid to avoid any further questioning by the media or scrutiny by the neighbours.																								They have instructed the guard not to let any visitors in because they want to safeguard their privacy in this moment of grief, said a neighbour.																								The Lahiris normally kept to themselves and did not mix much with the people in the locality. The girl was gentle and soft-spoken, very much like her twin, he added.

Three persons were arrested. A leading private v-belt manufacturing firm had complained to the EB that fake belts were flooding the city markets and had tipped off the officers about three shop-cum-warehouses. The officers raided the premises of Industrial Belting and Machinery Mart, located at Clive Row, Western Belt Stores on Netaji Subhas Road, and Fitwell Enterprise on Strand Road. Two owners, Nazmuddin Dhenerawala of Clive Row and Badruddin Kankawala of Strand Road were arrested, along with Dilip Kumar Sonkar, the warehouse-keeper of the Netaji Subhas Road establishment. All three had violated the IPC as well as copyright and trademark laws by selling cheap v-belts bearing a fake brand name as originals at a 25 per cent discount. The buyers were mostly garages in the city. After interrogation, police found out that fakes were being manufactured locally in small units just beyond the city limits. The original v-belts are manufactured in plants located at Madurai and Hydrabad.

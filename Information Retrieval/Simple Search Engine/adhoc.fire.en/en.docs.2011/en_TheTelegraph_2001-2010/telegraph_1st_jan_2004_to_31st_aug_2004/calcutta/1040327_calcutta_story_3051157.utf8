 A STAFF REPORTER																								Armed goons struck yet again in the Posta-Burrabazar-Jorabagan belt late on Thursday. 																								Four young men stormed a commission agents office on Maharshi Debendra Road, in the Jorabagan police station area, and looted Rs 2 lakh at gunpoint.																								Preliminary investigation pointed to the involvement of a gang responsible for a string of robberies in this business hub in February. 																								We had rounded up most of the goons. Thursday nights dacoity seems to have been carried out by the gang members who are at large, said an official of Jorabagan police station.																								Four men in their late twenties raided the office of Pradip Saha, a 50-year-old commission agent, around 10 pm. Saha had just returned after collecting dues of Rs 2 lakh from the traders in Burrabazar and Posta.																								These goons are from Bihar.

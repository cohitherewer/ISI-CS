 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Campus fears over World Bank funds
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta University is set to implement improvement schemes at its six technology departments with the Rs 50-crore project recently given the nod by the World Bank.																								The bank sponsorship proposal, however, has sparked off a controversy on the campus, with a section of teachers of the technology faculty demanding that the funds  meant exclusively for the development and promotion of research in the department  not be diverted.																								Since the university is passing through a severe funds crisis for the past many years, instances are not uncommon of diversion of funds for research and development that come from the University Grants Commission and other government funding agencies, the teachers said.																								We have seen these funds being used for payment of employees salaries. We dont want the World Bank money misused, said a teacher of one of the six technology departments.																								The six technology departments for which the World Bank has agreed to hand out funds are radio physics and electronics, applied physics, computer science and engineering, chemical engineering, chemical technology and polymer science and engineering.																								The teachers say the World Bank project has a provision to recruit some clerical, technical and other employees with specialised training to work for the research schemes. 																								The teachers claim they had reports that the authorities plan to take advantage of this provision and appoint a number of general non-teaching employees, whose salaries will be paid with the World Bank assistance.																								The teachers further complained that though highly-trained staff would be needed for working in the World Bank project, the authorities planned to fill up the posts with people who did not possess the skills. Already, some were being empanelled for the general non-teaching employees posts, they added.																								Sources said the fears about the World Bank funds being siphoned off was raised for discussion at a meeting between officials of the university and the heads of the technology departments last week.																								The details of how the project will be implemented are not yet finalised. I will be in a position to elaborate on the appointment procedure only after fully examining the terms and conditions of the project, said registrar Ujjwal Basu.																								P.K. Daspoddar, science and technology faculty dean, however, said that as far as he knew about the conditions of the project, a maximum of four to five employees could be recruited.																								According to him, the World Bank project was time-barred. It would have to be completed within five years. The question of recruiting teachers in permanent posts does not arise, as the service of those who will be recruited under the project will end after its completion, he pointed out.

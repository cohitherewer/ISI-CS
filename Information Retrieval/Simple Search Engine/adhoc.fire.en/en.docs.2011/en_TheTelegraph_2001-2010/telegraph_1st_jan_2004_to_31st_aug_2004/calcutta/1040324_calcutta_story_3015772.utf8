 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Bengal model for HIV drive in four states
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Sonagachhi, Asias largest red-light district, has become a role model for an HIV prevention programme, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in four states of the country.																								Avahan, the Indian initiative for the Gates foundation, has announced a whopping $ 47-million (Rs 216 crore) grant to boost HIV prevention programmes in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Manipur and Nagaland.																								The announcement follows a special visit to Sonagachhi by Melinda Gates, on the invitation of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, which not only runs the HIV/AIDS prevention programme in Sonagachhi, but has also provided economic empowerment to the sex workers there. 																								Melinda Gates was very pleased to see how successfully we have implemented a lot of beneficial projects for the sex workers. I believe it was soon after her visit that the foundation decided to implement the same ideas in the other states, says Smarajit Jana, who steers the Sonagachhi project and is a senior board member of Avahan.																								Apart from creating a better social and political environment for sex workers, a cooperative for women and a local banking system has helped them tide over financial difficulties. 																								Gone are the earlier days of hopelessness. They (the sex workers) now want to stay alive for the sake of their children. This, perhaps, is the positive result of our projects that impressed everybody, says Mrinal Kanti Dutta, Samanwaya Committee project director.																								The grant, part of a total of $200 million for HIV prevention in India through Avahan, is the largest commitment by the foundation in any single country. 																								In October 2003, Avahan awarded $67.5 million (Rs 310 crore) in grants to support HIV prevention in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and along the national highways.																								Jana confirmed that technical assistance would be provided by Bengal on the $47-million project in the four states, including the high-risk Northeast.																								The announcement came after a meeting of the Avahan board by Rajat Gupta, senior partner of McKinsey and Co. and co-chairman of the board, and Ashok Alexander, director of Avahan. Senior officials of the Gates foundation, including Patty Stonesifer, co-chairperson and president of the foundations global health programme, and Helen Gayle, director of the foundations HIV, TB and reproductive health programmes.																								The grants will help expand access to much-needed HIV prevention programmes among vulnerable groups, said Rajat Gupta. 																								While Tamil Nadu receives $13 million, Maharashtra will get $10.5, and the twin states of Nagaland and Manipur $5 million each. More loans will be available under different heads to the four states.

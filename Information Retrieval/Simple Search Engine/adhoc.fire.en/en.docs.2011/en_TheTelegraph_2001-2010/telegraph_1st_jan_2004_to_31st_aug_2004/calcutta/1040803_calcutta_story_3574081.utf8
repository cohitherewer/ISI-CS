 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Police van fells youth
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The danger of allowing decrepit vehicles to hit the road was underlined in blood on Monday morning, when an ill-maintained police van crushed to death a student near Belur railway station, in Howrah. 																								Ranjit Singh, 18, was killed instantly when the police van, travelling at a high speed on GT Road, mounted the pavement and mowed down a group that had collected to fetch water from a tap. 																								The road was near-empty because of the bandh when the mishap occurred around 7 am. The van brakes had apparently failed. The driver was arrested in the evening. 																								Four injuries were reported, one of them critical. Three of the injured were policemen in the van. The four were taken to Howrah district hospital, where Rishidev Paswan was said to be in a critical state.																								Police said the van (WB 12A 1339) was allotted to Bally police station some time ago by the district police. The van was patrolling the area soon after the bandh began. After the brakes failed, the vehicle went and hit Singh. 																								A resident of Rajen Seth Lane, in Bally, Singh was a promising third-year student of civil engineering at Don Bosco Polytechnic and Engineering College, in Belur. 																								Residents, who gathered after the accident, complained that police haul up and fine private vehicles on any excuse. But what action will they take against the police and their drivers? demanded Jitendar Roy, a local resident.																								Protesting against rash driving and the condition of the police van, residents gheraoed additional superintendent of police (north) Laxmi Singh when she visited the spot. 																								They claimed that the body of the teenager was sent to the morgue without informing his father and family members. The district police headquarters said a case (87/2004) was initiated at Bally police station.

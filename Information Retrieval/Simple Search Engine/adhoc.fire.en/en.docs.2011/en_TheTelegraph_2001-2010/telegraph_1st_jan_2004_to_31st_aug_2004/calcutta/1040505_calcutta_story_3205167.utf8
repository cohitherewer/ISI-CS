The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Civic hitmen target telebhaja
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For years, theyve evaded a crackdown because as targets, they were perceived to be too small. But election time is different. So, the city civic authorities have trained their guns at the innumerable vendors selling telebhaja. Their fault lies in the malfunctioning of stomachs this summer.																								According to civic officials, there are over 10,000 telebhaja vendors, making a daily sale of Rs 10 lakh in Calcutta. The city fathers have added telebhaja to the list of foodstuff likely to spread diarrhoea, enteric diseases and hepatitis in summer.																								Earlier, to prevent an outbreak of stomach ailments, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) would conduct a drive against vendors of cut fruits, sherbets and dahi-vada. 																								It was the practice for civic health inspectors to round up these vendors every summer and destroy their wares by spraying the foodstuff with bleaching powder. 																								In view of the recent outbreak of enteric diseases in Entally, Topsia, Masjidbari Lane and Darapara, in east Calcutta, we have included telebhaja in the list of foodstuff to be destroyed, if found being sold on the pavements, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Tuesday.																								A senior officer in the civic health department pointed out that in the absence of a gazette notification on the status of the recently-recruited food inspectors in the CMC, it was not possible for the civic authorities to collect samples of food items from licensed shops.																								There has been no drive against adulteration for over five months, since there is officially no food inspector in the CMC at the moment, he said.																								Hence, unlicensed food vendors in the city were now the soft targets of the civic health department, the officer explained.																								Since the telebhaja vendors are not licensed, the food inspectors can seize and destroy their wares, said officer on special duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee.																								The state government has, meanwhile, referred the case for a gazette notification on the appointment of food inspectors in the CMC to chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee. Until the notification is initialled, it is not possible for the new recruits to collect samples of edibles from licensed shops.

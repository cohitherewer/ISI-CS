The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Late boost for water supply
 Swapan Samaddar, Trinamul Congress councillor  of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ward no. 30, and  mayoral council member (building), met residents of the  area to answer their queries. Participants included Biswaranjan  Roy, Madhusudan Agarwal, Harendranath Sarkar, Sumit Roychowdhury,  Sibapada Das, Anjali Nag, Birendranath Das, Nemai Banerjee,  Amiruzzaman, Somnath Biswas, Bapi Saha, Pradip Das, Paritosh  Kar, Sankar Bhattacharjee and Sasanka Ghosal				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Somnath Biswas: We have been hearing a lot about the Bagmari water distribution project. How will it help the area?																																																			I am running a little late with this project. There will be an underground network of pipes to channelise six million gallons from Tallah through an additional channel that will boost water pressure in the area. The CPM-led municipal board had initiated the project by sanctioning only Rs 10 lakh, which did not include the cost of the waterpipes. Now, Rs 17 crore has been earmarked for the project, which has mayor Subrata Mukherjees nod.																																																									

Sibapada Das: There are mercury lamps on Dhanadevi Khanna Road. But at the mouth, the bulbs are not enough to light up the spot, which is accident-prone. Can humps be constructed there to avert accidents?																																																			 There are no immediate plans to change those lights. I had recently increased the wattage of those street lamps from 150w to 250w. Often, dead insects fill up the holders so the lights appear dim. It is not possible to erect humps. First, it is a mastic road, so there is no provision to construct humps on it, as it will slow down the traffic. Moreover, permission will have to be sought from the city traffic police to make such humps. As far as accidents go, I urge pedestrians to be aware of the approaching vehicles to avert any mishap.																																																									

Sibapada Das/ Anjali Nag: We have scenes from the Mahabharata painted on the walls of our railway colony. But in the absence of lights, the illustrations cannot be seen after dark.																																																			Lighting that spot will not be a very intelligent decision. As it is along the road, the lights may break often. I will try to arrange for some illumination from the top. Anyway, we will have to touch up the paintings. I find that the colours have faded.																																																									

Anjali Nag: We need a toilet for women in the area. Could one be consturcted in the corporation- run market?																																																			There is one for women near VIP Market. We have plans for a toilet in the market but the problem is a shortage of space. When the market authorities make some space available, a toilet for women will come up there.																																																									

Anjali Nag: The market also needs a tubewell. 																																																			As far as I know, there is a tubewell in every market. Only the one near Bakulbagan does not. As I told you earlier, the problem is paucity of space.																																																									

Somnath Biswas: What about the urinal at BC Roy Hospital? 																																																			I have had a very bitter experience over that one. Hundreds of people converge on the hospital for treatment every day. They have no place to relieve themselves and so they dirty the road. Its worse for the women. So, I sought the permission of the former superintendent to set up the urinal. But the day after I got the work started, I received a letter from the present superintendent halting the construction. Apparently, the chairman of the hospital had instructed him to stop work. So, we have had to shelve the project.																																																									

Nemai Banerjee: Do you any plan to develop an integrated sports complex here?																																																			We have plans to develop training camps of some sports in our parks. But theres the question of finance. The CMC does not have any provision to fund these projects.  (Concluded)

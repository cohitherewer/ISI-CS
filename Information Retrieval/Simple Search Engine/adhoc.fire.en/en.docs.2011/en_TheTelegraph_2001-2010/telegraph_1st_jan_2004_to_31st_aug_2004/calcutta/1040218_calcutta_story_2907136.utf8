I recently got married to a school-teacher and we live in a joint family. My husband keeps relatively normal hours in comparison to my crazy schedule and the problem is that my in-laws are beginning to grumble about my routine. My husband understands the situation and his parents were aware about my job and its demanding nature much before we got married. However, nowadays, they never fail to pass snide remarks about my late hours. Recently my mother-in-law also commented that the other residents in the building were beginning to talk about me. I dont want to have to be rude but I do want the jibes to stop. I have asked my husband to explain my point of view to his parents but he keeps asking me to ignore what they have to say. How do I handle this problem? Please advise. 				 																																												A.L., Madhyamgram 				 																																												A: As long as your husband understands and accepts your late hours, it really is no business of anyone elses what time you come home. I agree with him that you should ignore all the snide comments, because if people get no reaction to their jibes they tend to stop. But if that is impossible, then I suggest you make your feelings clear to your in-laws. Remind them that they knew your line of work before you got married and it really serves no purpose to crib about it now. And once youve got that off your chest, shut your ears to all the snide remarks and concentrate on your work. 				 																																												Q: I live in a multi-storeyed building with my wife and two children. A family in the adjoining building has a pet dog, which they keep locked out in their verandah every night. The problem is that their dog barks and creates quite a ruckus throughout the night and as the verandah overlooks our bedroom windows, our sleep is always disturbed. Its most annoying and I want to approach the family and explain my problem to them. However, my neighbour told me that my request would fall on deaf ears since the family has been approached in the past and no change had taken place. Can you suggest a way to tackle the situation and get some results? Thanks. 				 																																												 S.Das, New Alipore 				 																																												A: Why dont you get the local chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) involved in this matter. It is very cruel to lock a dog out in the open and leave him there to deal with the vagaries of the weather. Meanwhile, invest in some double-glazing for your windows and a pair of earplugs for every member of the family.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 23, 2004  Beat the heat with bat and ball 
ClubSandwich These days, sports and not F amp;B drives business in a club, and generates footfall. This, coming from a man called M.J. Robertson (yesterday Tolly, today Space, tomorrow) means a lot and more.Buoyed by the stupendous success of the mercantile meet over the past two summers, the VIP Road new-age club has tossed in an inter-club meet to further popularise the indoor cricket format.The first edition of the SKS indoor cricket meet, organised by SKS Entertainment in association with Space, has attracted 24 teams from clubs all across the city.The tourney will be played on the internationally standardised format of indoor cricket, developed in 1970s Perth.The game is played on a rectangular, artificial-grass surface imported from Australia. The playing arena is enclosed in tightly tensioned netting, including a 4-metre high ceiling. The pitch and stumps are exactly the same dimensions as outdoor cricket, while the ball used is of a semi-hard variety.Games consist of two innings, each lasting eight overs. With eight players to a squad, every member of the fielding side gets to bowl one over, while each pair of batsmen faces two overs.A maximum of 10 runs can be scored off a single delivery, but a batsman can also be run out after hitting a six, while going greedy for the extra run. LBW has been booted out, but a ricochet off any part of the netting is a catch.Since everybody has to bat and bowl, the thrust is on all-rounders, quite in sync with the modern one-day game outdoors, says club CEO M.J. Robertson.Former India wicketkeeper-batsman Syed Saba Karim, who has played indoor cricket at Space on a couple of occasions, finds it challenging, yet hugely entertaining.The indoor game requires great skills and focus. From selecting the right shot for maximum purchase to dealing with the various modes of dismissals, the concentration can never flag. But its a wonderful stress-buster,  says the stumper.With a result guaranteed in an hour, indoor cricket is the most intense form of the instant game, and todays generation is getting hooked on in a hurry.Space Circle general manager Sumeet Raychaudhuri feels the essentially inclusive character of the indoor game can be leveraged even better by creating structured leagues, a goal the club is working towards.SUBHRO SAHA

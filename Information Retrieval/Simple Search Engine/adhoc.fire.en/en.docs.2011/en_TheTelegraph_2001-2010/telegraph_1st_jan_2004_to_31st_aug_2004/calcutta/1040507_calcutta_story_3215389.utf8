 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Bus falls into canal, 30 injured
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								More than 30 people, including 10 women and children, were seriously injured when a government bus fell into a canal at Bhangore, in South 24-Parganas, about 70 km from the city. 																								The accident occurred while the driver was trying to overtake a private bus. 																								The injured were admitted to MR Bangur Hospital. Later, three were shifted to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where their condition was stated to be critical. The driver fled.																								Around noon, both buses, coming from Malancha, were speeding towards Rajabazar, in Calcutta. From the outset, the drivers were vying with each other to hog the road. 																								When both vehicles reached Bhojerhat, the government bus rammed into two wayside shops, injuring the owners. Then, it fell into the canal, known locally as moila khal, at least 25 feet below road level.																								Bystanders rushed to the rescue, breaking open the doors and windows. Gobinda Purakait, a passenger later admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, said the driver refused to heed their repeated pleas to slow down. 																								Additional superintendent of police (rural) Dilip Banerjee said drivers have been told several times to exercise caution. A hunt is on for the absconding driver.

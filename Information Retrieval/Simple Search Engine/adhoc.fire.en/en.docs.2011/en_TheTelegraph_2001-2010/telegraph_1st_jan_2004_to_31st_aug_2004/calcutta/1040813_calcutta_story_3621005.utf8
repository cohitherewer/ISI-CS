The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 13, 2004 On amp; OffScreen On amp; Off

	You last saw her on the big screen in The Matrix Revolutions. And it may take some time for you to spot Jada Pinkett Smith again on 35 mm, with the India release of her latest film, the Tom Cruise-starrer Collateral, miles away. But you can actually catch her alongside real-life husband Will Smith in the acclaimed biopic Ali, on Star Movies on Monday, at 9 pm. 
	Jada, who believes in only doing substantial roles, is balancing her personal and professional lives quite well. Off screen, she has a smooth seven-year marriage with the actor-rapper and two kids to show. The 32-year-old actress, along with hubby Will, also serves as executive producers of the UPN comedy series All of Us, which they created and based on their family life. 
	On screen, there are big films like Collateral, where she plays Annie, a lawyer who catches the eye of Jamie Foxs cabbie. Both Collateral and Ali are directed by Michael Mann. Ali is, of course, the celluloid biography of boxing great Muhammad Ali focusing on the 10-year period from 1964 to 1974. Jada plays Alis first wife in the film that also won Will an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. So, book a date with the Smiths on Monday night.  Debasree and Rituparna: Glamour duo.

	What happens when the reigning queen of Tollywood shares the spotlight with the former queen? A fan frenzy. The NT1 studios in Tollygunge witnessed a rare surge of admirers and autograph-hunters on Wednesday evening as Rituparna Sengupta and Debasree Roy took the floors for Sagar Kinare, a big-budget Tollywood production.
	 Though the two of us were there in Probhat Roys Lathi, we never got to share screen space. Working with a veteran actress like Debasree helps improve your performance and we are very comfortable with each other, says the woman in red, back in Tollywood after a long stay in the US. 
	Director Sushanta Sahas film finds the two ladies in a quadrilateral love tangle, involving Firdaus and Samrat. Rituparna plays an awestruck fan of Debasree, a famous singer from Mumbai, and both are in love with the same man, says Saha, winding up the last leg of his shooting in Calcutta. The seaside romance has also been shot in Visakhapatnam, Puri and Mumbai. 
	Do you have it in you? asks the Indian Army in advertisements for its recruitment drive. To do what? is a common silent question among laymen. If new (reel) recruit Hrithik Roshan scaling barriers in Lakshya was all that viewers had to go by to form an idea about training of an armyman, here is a chance to see all the trials and tribulations up close, as it happens, on the ground.
	 Discovery Channel will air Standard Bearers, a film on the National Defence Academy (NDA), this Independence Day. The NDA, perhaps the most prestigious inter-services training establishment in India, is the cradle of some of our finest military commanders who have done India proud. Every six months, 1,500 young men between age 17 and 20 join the institution.
	 Created by the husband-wife team of Kunal Verma and Dipti Bhalla, the programme takes one through the rigorous training schedule of cadets, as they work and play, go riding or rock-climbing, imbibing the NDAs motto of Sewa Paramo Dharma (Service Before Self). 
	Discovery Channels Standard Bearers airs on Saturday, August 14, at 8 pm and repeats on August 15 at 10 am.  Jason Statham: Snatched
	His personal life might have gone for a toss but Jason Statham is a star that you can come home to on Friday night. The Snatch star, who plays the male lead in the Corey Yuen action film The Transporter, was recently devastated over revelations in The Mirror that his fiancee Kelly Brook has been secretly dating movie co-star Billy Zane. To make matters worse for the 32-year-old actor, Kelly, 24, and Billy, 38, were caught in a passionate kiss over dinner at La Colombe dOr near Cannes during a break from filming Three in France. So even as Statham struggles to put his love life in place, you can catch him in the 2002 action thriller at 9 pm on Star Movies. The Transporter is about a former US Special Forces soldier-turned expatriate mercenary who is hired to kidnap the daughter of a deadly Chinese cook smuggling his fellow countrymen into France. 				 																																									Closer home, 89 Cinemas is rolling out a ticket bonanza for the coming Independence Day weekend. Viewers buying film tickets will get the chance to roll a die. And if they roll 89, their ticket price or the snack bill will be refunded on the spot. This apart, visitors to the Swabhumi hall will also be showered with gift hampers from Power FM, Lipton, Hutch

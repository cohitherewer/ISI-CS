The countdown to the Godrej Renew Sananda Tilottama beauty pageant started on Saturday with the preliminary screening at Pala, at the ITC Sonar Bangla.																								Fifty-four contestants turned up for a shot at the first 20 slots in the ninth edition of the annual event. The girls will be judged on the basis of looks, intelligence, quick wits and grooming over the next three weeks. The first selectors they had to face included beautician Nilofer Babaycon of Womens World, singer Parama Banerjee of Rojgere Ginni, RJ Siddharth Vohra of Red FM, painter Eleena Banik, and fashion designers Abhishek Dutta and Dibyakanti Sen.We got over 2,000 entries this time around. The profile of the contestants has been getting better every year and we had a tough time narrowing them down for the prelims, said a spokesperson for the organisers. The demand for the title has only grown with the national and international attention winners of the pageant have received in the past .																								There were hits and misses at the introduction and question-answer rounds, with some contestants making the grade and others fumbling their way out of the competition.

	I visited the Iskcon Rathayatra festival on the Territorial Army institute grounds at the Maidan. While queuing to collect the free prasad, I noticed that some members who were distributing it were compelling devotees to call out loud Hare Krishna. Barring a few, most people who attended the function were genuine devotees. Then, is such a practice necessary? Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road 
	My mother purchased Indira Vikash Patra (IVP) worth Rs 40,000 from Bowbazar post office about five years ago. The terms said that it can be withdrawn in cash on maturity. However, now the post master says that we will have to accept a cheque since post offices have stopped giving amounts above Rs 20,000 in cash. He asked me to divide the eight certificates in the names of three different persons in order to be able to withdraw the cash. It would be better if the postal authorities allow people to withdraw cash as per the terms of the IVP. Madhabi D. Ghosh, Salt Lake

 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Cop stores keeper robbed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He guards the malkhana (stores) of a city police station, but was unable to protect his own house.																								Barely 48 hours after the wives of Government Railway Policemen demonstrated in front of the superintendents office against the growing cases of theft at the housing estate for officers, thieves were back in action on Tuesday night. This time, the victim was an assistant sub-inspector of North Port police station.																								Prakash Chakroborty, the officer who is supposed to look after articles like exhibits related to cases and unclaimed belongings in his police station, returned to his quarters on Wednesday morning, only to find that it had been broken into and valuables cleaned out.																								Policemens families are demoralised after this theft. They described the incident as shameful. In the past 12 days, three quarters have been burgled and attempts were made in seven others. All the cases were recorded with Chitpur police station, but no one has yet been arrested.																								As in the earlier cases, the criminals chose to break in when Chakroborty was out of town. He was on holiday. It is really surprising. All the quarters were burgled when the occupants were on leave and were not in the city, said a police officer who lives in the housing estate.																								Some of his neighbours wondered if insiders were involved. The thieves had every detail about the quarters which they targeted. Before striking, they knew that no one would be there. We suspect that someone from the quarters is supplying them with the information, said a police officer.

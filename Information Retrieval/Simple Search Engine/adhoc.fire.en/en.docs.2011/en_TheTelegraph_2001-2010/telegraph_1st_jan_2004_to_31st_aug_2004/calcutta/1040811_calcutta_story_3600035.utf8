 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Three generations of art
																								Habiart Foundation presents an exhibition of paintings by Gobardhan Ash, along with those by Nirban Ash, Chinmoy Ash, Jyotirmoy Ash and Deborshi Ash. Considered a pioneer of modern art, Gobardhan Ashs contribution at a time when India witnessed the advent of Western modernism is significant and colossal. His work on famine during World War II has left a deep impact on contemporary literature and theatre. Ash certainly had an individualistic style of his own with many charming facets, but characterised by simplified folk forms. He painted with bold courage and a free spirit, never yielding to the roles set by official art. All his paintings are exploratory, visionary and i nspiring. Primarily known for natural and other sceneries in oil, Ash conveys the value of uncompromising artistic sincerity. Art lovers have the privilege of enjoying the paintings of this family of natural artists for the next few days.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings by The Ash Family																								When: Till August 20; 2 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Genesis Art Gallery; 8B Middleton Street

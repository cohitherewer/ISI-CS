 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Foundation laid for footbridge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Saturday laid the foundation stone for construction of a pedestrian footbridge in Dhakuria. 																								The footbridge would be completed in three months, Mukherjee said after laying the foundation stone. Construction started on Saturday itself.																								The footbridge, to be constructed in front of Dakshinapan shopping complex, will meet a long-standing demand of local residents. It will reduce traffic jam and accidents in the area, officials said. However, awareness would have to be raised among pedestrians to use the footbridge, they added.																								Cost of construction of the 48-metre footbridge will be approximately Rs 50 lakh. Funds for the project will be provided by Indian Oil Corporation. We will give them advertisement rights, the mayor said.

		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Live well: keep the chi flowing 
Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: I recently moved into a big house. I would like a formal living room away from the front of the house with elaborate interiors. The rooms are spacious with many doors and windows. Is this Feng Shui-friendly?Devaki Sanyal
Calcutta																								A: An exclusive formal living room should not be cut off from the rest of the home in such a way that it becomes a storehouse for stagnant chi. When it is decorated elaborately and opened only when the guests are expected, these rooms become negative with stale energy. This adversely affects the aspiration connected with the direction the room is in. Normally, the living room should be in the front, a little away from the main door. If it is far away from the entrance, the windows should be opened every morning to let in fresh chi. Rooms with too many doors and windows are draughty and become escape outlets for chi, so you should seal one or two doors and windows. Roses kept in a bowl in the east are believed in Feng Shui to improve marriage prospects. (AFP)Q: My old house is being renovated and we plan to change the furniture of our drawing room. The rooms are spacious. How should we arrange it?Shreya Dhandania,
Calcutta																								A: Big sofa sets should be placed against solid walls. In big rooms, furniture should be arranged around a focal point in circular or octagonal groupings and should never point towards a door. Chairs and sofas should not have their backs facing the main door. -shaped arrangements of sofas and chairs should be avoided, as they create a missing corner. Feng Shui stresses balanced and complete shapes, in a house, room or with furniture arrangements.																								Q: I have unsuccessfully been trying to arrange a match for my daughter (birthday: August 12,1980) for two years. The southwest sector of our home is missing. I have kept a pair of earthen pots and green mandarin ducks tied in red ribbon in the southwest sector of her room, in the northern side of the flat. She sleeps in the southeast, and lights two red candles, but it hasnt helped.																								Name not given																								A: Your daughter is a fire person, so water represents marriage for her. This is an important year for marriage. Continue with the southwest enhancements. But extra strength and energy has to be given to the eastern sector of her bedroom as this is her personal marriage direction. Place a couples photo along with two fresh roses in water in a green shallow bowl. Highlight this with a blue light, which represents water. She should sleep with her head towards the east. Rectify the missing southwest corner with strong light. This will help tap missing energy.																								Q: I am a student of Class VIII (birthday: July 13, 1989) and want to be a businessman. I am studious, but never score more than the 60s and 70s. I am an Indian living in Ghana. We have a very large family business there. I lost my father seven years ago. I have already taken some responsibilities in the business, which deals with import, export, distributorship, wholesale. What business should I take up in the future?																								Nana Yaw Pyne																								A: According to your date of birth, earth and metal rule your life. So any business connected with these will bring a lot of wealth. Earth is connected with careers in real estate, construction, marble, stone and precious gemstones. Metal is related to iron, steel and computers. I foresee a very bright future for you as your birth chart is very good and the flow of money is quite evident in your horoscope.

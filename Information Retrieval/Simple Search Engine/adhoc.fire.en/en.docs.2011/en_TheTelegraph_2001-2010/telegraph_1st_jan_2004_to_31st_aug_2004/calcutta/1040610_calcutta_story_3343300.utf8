 Thursday, June 10, 2004  Everyday drapes Actor Chaiti Ghosal sports a Chanderi sari at Mrignayani. Picture by Rashbehari Das															The Chanderi sari exhibition at Mrignayani, the Madhya Pradesh emporium at Dakshinapan, experiments with a new range of mixed cotton and silk saris teemed with age-old Chanderi motifs.																					Once the preferred drape of the women of royal families in Gwalior and Nagpur, the saris are made trendier today with eclectic colour combinations like grey and magenta with a hint of gold along with a variety of pastel shades. The fabric is essentially light cotton and silk or a mix of both, making it ideal for the working woman, the mixed varieties more so for they double up as day and evening wear. The combinations pack in a variety of combinations like half-cotton, half-silk saris; silk saris with cotton borders and vice versa; cotton saris with cotton and silk borders and the other way around.There are subtle variations in motifs as well. Traditional gold checks, stripes and floral butis are played around with to come up with Baluchari look-alikes. Meena buti edged with gold threads is the most sought after design. The idea is to present traditional elegance with contemporary chic, said T.N. Basu, manager Mrignayani.																					The exhibition, on till June 19, is offering a discount of 20 per cent on all Chanderis which are priced between Rs 400 to Rs 3,000 for cottons and between Rs 750 to Rs 4,500 for silks.Cocktail circuit																					If you are bored with your regular doses of Screwdrivers and Pina Coladas, its time to try out some new concoctions. Spirits are truly high at Junction, the bar at the Taj Bengal, hosting a cocktail festival through June. Brice Magee, the star bartender from Taj Coromandel, has been flown down to the city to whip up some magic mixtures. Three basic international classics  Martini, Daiquiri and Margarita  have been given new twists by the master blender. Brice Magee whips up a flamb cocktail at The Junction. Picture by Rashbehari Das												There are 11 varieties of Martinis on offer. While the basic taste has been kept unaltered with gin and vermouth being the primary ingredients, a whole lot of flavours have been added to give this all-time favourite American cocktail a new punch. While there are the Classic Martini and Perfect Martini too, the menu boasts some exotic choices like Chocolate Martini, Rendezvous (with cherry brandy, Campari and cherries), Broadway Martini (with Crme-de-Menthe and mint leaves), Prince Edward Martini (with Drambuie, lemon and honey), Fuzzy Martini (with coffee and peach) and many more.																					The eight kinds of Daiquiries offered play around with a lot of fresh fruits along with the principal ingredients white rum, lime and sugar. So, there is Mango Mint Daiquiri, Banana Lichi Daiquiri, Port Cherry Daiquiri, Peach Daiquiri, Passion Daiquiri (passion fruit) and Frozen Daiquiri (a mixed fruit variety).																					The primary ingredients in the eight kinds of Margaritas are Tequila, Cointreau and a dash of lime juice. Here, too, there are quite a few fruity flavours like Fuzzy Peach Margarita, Strawberry Margarita and Melonrita. Brices favourite, however, is the Blue Margarita (a combination of Tequila, Cointreau, Blue Curacao and lemon juice). People in Calcutta seem to like sweet cocktails. They also like juicy cocktails and not clear ones. So, I have included lots of juices and fruits, he said.																					e the bartender blended the cocktails to perfection, he shared a few interesting pieces of history about each of them. The Martini was invented when America got its freedom from liquor prohibition. They toasted to the freedom with this new cocktail. The Daiquiri was invented in 1818 by an American miner while he was working on a project in a mine called Daiquiri. But the origin of the Margarita is not properly known. It is a Mexican cocktail which was invented around 50 years back, Brice added.																					The fun at the Junction, however, doesnt end with the cocktails. To spice up matters, theres a brand new duo from the Philippines  Carol and Wilson  wholl croon in the evenings to liven up the ambience at the bar.																																														Ship shape																					Body Care, a slimming and beauty clinic on Park Street, launched a weight-loss treatment on Monday. Called Cellulite Therapy, it targets those in search of a slimming therapy for inch-loss from specific parts of the body. Sanjivni Grover, director of Body Care, says that constant queries from slender clients who have a concentration of fat in particular zones of the body like the upper arm, belly, or thighs, was the thrust behind developing this solution.																					The treatment, claims the centre, works through the anti-cellulite oil which, when massaged into the skin, eliminates excess fat, water and extra-cellular waste from the body. Says Doel Roy Bishnu, slimming and therapy manager of Body Care: We have seen that often fat is not evenly distributed in a persons body. The cellulite therapy is specially effective for them as it helps in figure correction along with weight loss. The anti-cellulite oil, which is aromatic, helps with zonal weight loss. We had launched it experimentally with some of our clients and the response was very good.																					The treatment, the beauty clinic adds, involves use of weight-loss aid machines on parts where cellulite is present, followed by massage of anti-cellulite oil by trained masseurs. Hot-towel therapy helps in better absorption of the oil and a herbal thermal pack mobilises the fat and firms up the muscles. When this oil is massaged using a special technique, it helps a person lose inches from particular parts which are disproportionate to the rest of the body. South Indian spread at the Saffron. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Due south																					Saffron, the Indian speciality restaurant at The Park, will be hosting Five Gastronomical Colours of Saffron  a series of food festivals from various regions of India. The first to hit the culinary scene is the South Indian food promotion, on at the eatery till June 13.																					The idea behind the promotion is to break the common notion that Saffron is only about North Indian food and to highlight the other cuisine on the regular menu of the restaurant. The extensive fare at the first food festival gives a taste of the varied Dakshini palate, which consists of various regions like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.																					One can binge on the plethora of non-vegetarian delicacies like the hot and spicy Chicken Chettinad (chicken cooked in spicy tomato gravy with black pepper of the Chettinad region) or Era Pachadi (spicy and sour prawns cooked with red chilli, mustard seeds and curry leaf), Konju Pappas (prawns cooked in coconut milk), Chepala Kura (spicy fish curry flavoured with coconut and asafoetida) and Inji Kari Veruval (quick-fried lamb flavoured with fennel and green chillies).																					For the green brigade there are lots of choices like Melagu Paneer (cottage cheese cooked with black peppercorn and spices), Urulai Roast (baby potatoes tossed with red chilli and spices), Fresh Vegetable Kootu (yam, gourd, drumstick, potatoes and peas in coconut yoghurt gravy) and Kari Kari Korma (seasonal vegetables cooked with poppy seeds and coconut paste). This lavish fare can be accompanied by Lemon Rice (aromatic Basmati rice cooked with fresh lemon, mustard seeds and curry leaves).																					So, if you are ready for some thunder from down under  well, south is what we mean  roll up your sleeves and tuck into the treasure trove at Saffron.

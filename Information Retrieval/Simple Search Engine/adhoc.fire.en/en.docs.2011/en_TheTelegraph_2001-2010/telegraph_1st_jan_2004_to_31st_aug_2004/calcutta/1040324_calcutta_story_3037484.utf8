 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Borders and Beyond
																								The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, in association with Pro Helvetica  Arts Council of Switzerland, hosts an international exhibition of photographs. Renowned international lensmen and authors offer a panorama of examples of the implication of manmade borderlines on the lives of individuals living in different parts of the world. Borders between countries have been drawn out ever since the existence of mankind, and it is over the last decade-and-a-half that many new borderlines have been defined. Presumably enough, never has a thought been spared to the millions whose very existence is challenged each time a new border is determined. The physical and psychological upheavals of the people that suffer the brunt of such a division are smothered in a nameless darkness that refuses to see or acknowledge. The exhibition, through pictures and words, tells the stories of emigration, desperation, border conflicts and isolation struggling to survive with hope and a longing for a secure future.																								Event: International exhibition of photographs																								When: Till April 30; 2 pm - 7.30 pm																								Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Retired constables tax bill Rs 5 crore
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ananta Kumar Das, a constable attached to Golabari police station in Howrah, would draw a monthly salary of Rs 950 when he retired on June 1, 1984. 																								That, however, did not prevent the income-tax department from sending him a recovery notice on July 19 this year, demanding over Rs 5 crore as tax arrears for six years, beginning 1990-91.																								Das, who now lives at Podra, near the Botanical Gardens in Howrah, said he was jolted by the registered letter from the income-tax department, on July 23, asking him to pay a sum of Rs 53,231,988 which was still outstanding. 																								The retired constable, who is entirely dependent on his monthly pension of Rs 3,000, was also directed to produce immediately the necessary evidence before the tax recovery officer 7, Calcutta to cancel the certificated (sic) demand. 																								In the event of non-payment, he was asked to meet the same officer for hearing within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice.																								The 80-year-old, who has been bedridden with various ailments for quite some time, said: I started my career in the police force in August 1947 on a monthly salary of Rs 42. Income-tax, if any, must have been regularly deducted from my salary. I do not know what prompted the department to slap this notice on me 20 years after my retirement. 																								In a letter dated July 31, Das has urged the income-tax official concerned, A.K. Chakraborty, to look into the matter, as a wrong notice has been served on him. Das has said that no tax was outstanding from him.																								The letter that Das received was addressed to the principal officer, M/S Abhista Siddhi, Ananta Kumar Das, Podra Govt. Colony, P.O. Podra, Howrah-711109. 																								A.K. Chakraborty told Metro the tax arrears mentioned in the notice were due from M/S Abhista Siddhi. The Podra address had been mentioned in the income-tax returns of the concern. That is why we sent the arrears notice to the said address. But sending the letter to Das was a genuine mistake, Chakraborty admitted.																								Das observed: I have been living here for the past 35 years and know nothing about the company.

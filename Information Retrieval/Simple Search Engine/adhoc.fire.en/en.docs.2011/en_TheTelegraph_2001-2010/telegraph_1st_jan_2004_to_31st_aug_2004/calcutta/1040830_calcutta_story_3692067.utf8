Pictures by Rashbehari Das 															They were design students till Saturday night. Now they are designers set to storm the fashion industry. The hard work of students of the National Institute of Fashion Design, Lindsay Street, was on show at the annual graduating batch fashion fiesta at the Oberoi Grand, presented in association with The Telegraph.																					Nervous faces waiting to decipher the crowd reaction to their blood, sweat and tears and proud parents clapping their hearts out for every collection made sitting through the four-hour gala worth the effort.																					With big names like Wendell Rodricks, Sharbari Dutta, Anamika Khanna and Sumedha Saraogi from the fashion fraternity judging the event, the final winners had double the reason to pat their backs. The two categories under which the participants were judged were fashion designing and textiles.																					A mix of georgette, cotton, raw silk and jute dominated the fabrics used, and the styles were mostly contemporary with even ghagras slimming down to straight cuts and cholis going the western backless way.																					The themes were inspired by everything from the teachings of Osho to how the mind of a prisoner works. In a gutsy move, a collection depicting same-sex love saw female models walking the ramp holding hands with mutual attraction clear from their expressions.																					After what must have been a harrowing task for the judges, the final winners were declared. Nandita Chamaria walked away with top honours in the fashion design section while the joint effort of four minds put together bagged the second award in the category. Called Watch Your Step, the collection of formal outfits zeroed in on the importance of planning as its theme, designed by Amit, Khushboo, Rati and Ambika.																					The second runners-up in this category was Imprisonment, about the mental state of a prisoner before his trial, as seen by Prerna, Preeti, Avinash and Subhadeep. The most commercially viable collection was put together by Juhi, Kiran and Usha. Their collection inspired by pottery is sure to find place in the wardrobe of the fashion conscious in due course.																					The award for the best fabric development went to Sandeep Chakraborty, while Archita, Pralay, Gautam and Ranjit took home the second prize. The most commercially viable collection in the textile section came from Nivedita, Neha, Ambika and Nahid.																					Debargha Bairagi of the fashion department was crowned couture king of the batch, with his collection winning the best ramp appeal tag. His collection, My Walk to Heaven, was inspired by the deep desire to reach Allah from the war field.																					Among the other judges were principals of three leading city schools, and cinestars Nelanjana Bhowmick, Churni Ganguly and Jishu Sengupta.

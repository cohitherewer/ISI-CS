 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Doctors wife disputes ban
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A doctors wife has moved Calcutta High Court, challenging the decision of the appellant authority of the West Bengal Medical Council in striking down her husbands registration.																								Jayanta Janas registration was cancelled in March for his alleged negligence in the treatment of several patients and violation of the norms framed by the council. Petitioner Saraswati Jana alleged that both the West Bengal Medical Council and its appellant authority (health secretary, government of West Bengal) had discriminated against her husband while restraining him from setting up a private practice.																								The petitioner also alleged that her husband had not been given adequate opportunity to defend himself and the decision cancelling his registration had been taken on the basis of false complaints.																								We want justice from the court of law and seek an order asking the council to allow my husband to resume practice, she said. 																								Saibalendu Bhowmik, counsel for the Medical Council, said his client had cancelled the registration of the doctor after six persons from different corners of the city had brought serious charges against him.																								Earlier, too, the same doctor was suspended for two years by the West Bengal Medical Council. But he had treated patients during the period of his suspension. He also used fictitious registration numbers. These charges were proved during the hearing of cases in the Medical Council, the lawyer claimed.																								He also said Jana was attached to different nursing homes of the city and several patients had suffered owing to his negligent and rash treatment. The Medical Council had no option to cancelling his registration, Bhowmik said.																								The lawyer observed that the council would have to take stern action against errant doctors to regain peoples faith in medical practitioners. 																								So, the council had taken exemplary action against Jana, Bhowmik added.																								Jana had moved an appeal against the order of the Medical Council in its appellant forum. According to rules, the state health secretary hears the case. The appellant forum, on March 27, had rejected his appeal, a spokesman of the council told the court.																								According to the spokesman, this is the second time that the medical council had cancelled the registration of a doctor for life. 																								The last time, the council had cancelled the registration of a doctor after a girl died because of his callousness. Two years after the councils decision, the doctor had apologised for his act and had prayed to the council to allow him to resume his practice. The council had granted his prayer, he said.																								 The petition filed by Janas wife will come up for hearing within a few days. 																								But the persons who had originally lodged a complaint against Jana in the medical council were not made parties to the case, the sources said. 																								A few other cases against doctors are pending before the medical council. The number of cases against doctors is increasing, a council official said.

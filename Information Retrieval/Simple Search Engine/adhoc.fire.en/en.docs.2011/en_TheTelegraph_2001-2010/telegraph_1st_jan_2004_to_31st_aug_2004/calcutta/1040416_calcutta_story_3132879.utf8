																																																		The state government is getting tough with hospitals and nursing homes that are not yet treating their medical waste scientifically. Environment minister Manab Mukherjee on Thursday said according to the Biomedical Waste (Management amp; Handling) Rules, such hospitals or nursing homes can even be closed down. The government has already asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to stop collecting medical waste in the city from April 1. At least 22 hospitals and 103 nursing homes in the city and under the Howrah Municipal Corporation area are yet to comply with the order, he said. A common facility centre has been set up in Howrah for the waste to be treated. However, if any hospital can treat its own waste, the government does not have a problem, the minister added. Medicare Incin Pvt Ltd, a private company, has set up a unit at Belgachhia, where medical waste from hospitals and nursing homes is being collected. Waste from 19,731 beds is presently being treated. There is provision for treatment of waste from 30,000 beds in the common treatment facility, which amounts to roughly 6.8 tonnes a day, Mukherjee said. The charge for disposing of medical waste per day per bed is Rs 2.70 for private hospitals, and Rs 2.45 for state hospitals. 																																																		A nursing home in central Calcutta was ransacked and one of its female employees heckled following the death of a patient due to alleged negligence by doctors. Police said K.K. Sarda, 65, a resident of Golf Green in south Calcutta, was admitted to the nursing home with throat cancer on April 13. He was operated on in April but due to internal bleeding, he expired on Thursday.																																																		A motorcyclist was injured in Salt Lake on Thursday.

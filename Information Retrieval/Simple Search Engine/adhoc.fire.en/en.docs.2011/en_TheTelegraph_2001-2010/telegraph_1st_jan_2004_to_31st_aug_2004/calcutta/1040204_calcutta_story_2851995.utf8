 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Now, agony gone in a puff
 															- Analgesic gas that knocks out pain, not patient A STAFF REPORTER																								No painkilling shots of morphine or pethidine for the mother-to-be, and hence, no harmful effect on the baby. Just a puff or two on the hand-held mouthpiece renders the woman comfortably numb as she stays in total control during labour. A unique analgesic gas used at a city hospital recently enabled the mother to experience a totally painless delivery, opening up interesting possibilities in labour pain management and short procedures.																								For the first time in eastern India, Entonox, a homogeneous gas mixture containing equal parts of nitrous oxide and oxygen compressed into a cylinder, has been used on the pain management system during child delivery at the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman amp; Child Care Centre (BNWCC).																								The pharmaceutical profile of the gas offers rapid onset of potent analgesia with speedy reversal of effects when required, according to Shekhar Trivedi, national sales manager, medical, BOC, sole manufacturer of the gas in the country, which was marketed after 18 months of clinical trials. While the pain-relieving puff has been used extensively in South India before, it was deployed for the first time in the city at the Rawdon Street centre.																								Calcutta is our thrust area now, before we move westward. We chose the mother and child hospital to launch the gas in Calcutta for its specialised profile. Other hospitals like Woodlands, AMRI, Ruby and Apollo Gleneagles have also evinced interest, and we are in dialogues with them, says Trivedi. The company has launched a two-pronged Entonox awareness initiative in the city, involving obstetricians and gynaecologists on one side and would-be mothers on the other.																								The beauty of this gas is that it knocks out the pain, not the patient, quot; observes T. Biju Singh, obstetrician, consultant gynaecologist and endoscopic surgeon at the mother and child hospital.																								Entonox is an inhalation of an analgesic (a pain-relieving gas) wherein the nitrous oxide provides the analgesia, and oxygen gives additional benefit to both mother and baby. The gas, colourless and odourless, provides the mother-to-be with total control, because it only works when she breathes in and stops automatically when she breathes out, explains the obstetrician.																								It takes about 20 seconds to feel the effect of Entonox, with peak impact in about a minute. It could also come in extremely handy in dentistry, short procedures, dressings, any painful examination or short endoscopy, adds Singh.

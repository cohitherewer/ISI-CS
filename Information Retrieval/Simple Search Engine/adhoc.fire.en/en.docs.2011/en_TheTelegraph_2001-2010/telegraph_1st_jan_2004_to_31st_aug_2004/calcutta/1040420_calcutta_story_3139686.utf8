The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 Life - Passing Through:				 Family ties above family business
Rinke KhannaBorn and brought up in Mumbai, married in Calcutta, settled in Switzerland  Rinke Khannas annual calendar, therefore, is a tale of three cities. The bustling tinsel town where she started off as an actress in Raj Kaushals Pyar Mein Kabhie Kabhie is a far cry from the snow-capped climes she has set up base in with her MBA-studying husband.																								Life in Switzerland is very busy. Mumbai, too, is a place where you have to be on the move always. But Calcutta is a refreshing change from both. The city has a pace of its own. The laid-back lifestyle makes it a nice place to be in if you want a break from a hectic schedule, says Rinke, who left St Xaviers, Mumbai, to pursue a bachelors degree in communication in Boston.																								The younger daughter of Dimple Kapadia and Rajesh Khanna was in town for a couple of weeks, spending most of her time at her in-laws south Calcutta home.																								Married just over a year ago into a city-based Punjabi family, Rinke touches down at least twice a year to meet up with her in-laws. In Calcutta, I like to spend time at home with my family rather than hang out, she declares.																								Clearly, acting is low on the priority list for this member of Bollywoods GenX. A kem chhe cameo in Mahesh Manjrekars Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rahta Hai and one of the lead roles in Sujoy Ghoshs surprise hit Jhankaar Beats early last year helped Rinke make her presence felt on the big screen.																								Though quite a few projects are on her platter now, Rinke wants to finish with her previous commitments first. I have some old work to catch up with. I am pondering over two projects but would like to take up only those that really interest me, she says.																								Coming up next, a trip to Mumbai. I will be seeing my mother and sister (Twinkle) in a few months, gushes the consulting editor of lifestyle magazine Seventeen.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

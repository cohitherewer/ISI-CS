 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Fish fissure in waterbody bill
 JAYANTA BASU																								The definition of fish threatens to sink the environment departments proposed West Bengal Protection of Water Bodies Bill, 2004, in deep waters.																								According to the definition in Section 2 (iv) of the West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, the term fish includes aquatic plants and animals in any stage of their life-cycle. The definition basically means that any waterbody will come under the purview of the fisheries act, as no waterbody can be completely excluded from the animal or plant life in some form or the other... The contention leaves the proposed bill nowhere, pointed out the state governments legal officers.																								The proposed bill has run into choppy waters in the form of opposition from various quarters, including that from the fisheries department, despite being only applicable to waterbodies not connected with the activity or occupation of fishery.																								The administrative control over all waterbodies more than five cottahs lies, at present, with the fisheries department, by virtue of the West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, 1984.																								The environment department aims to take control of the waterbodies primarily in the urban areas and the fisheries department is not amused.																								The only lacuna in the inland fisheries act is that it does not cover the wetlands. The new act proposed by the environment department will apparently not serve the purpose, as it seems to be more inclined towards giving permission to fill up the waterbodies for so-called development, rather than saving them, observed retired high court judge Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee.																								I feel the existing act should be strengthened, rather than a parallel act created, he added.																								Environment department officials countered that a new comprehensive act is required, as innumerable waterbodies were being filled up illegally, despite the fisheries act being in place. This cannot be stopped unless an act is in place, said an official.																								Pollution control board member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar said a comprehensive act will be useful, but clarified that the proposed bill is in only the draft stage. The boards senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, however, added that he had no knowledge about the proposed bill.																								Departmental sources also felt that that the new act seemed to be in contradiction with the central Water (Prevention amp; Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, based on which the board has been constituted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 It takes three to tango, again
Salman, Abhishek and Shilpa at the music launch of Phir Milenge; (Top) A freeze frame from Kal Ho Naa Ho																								All love stories have a triangle. Sometimes the third angle is physical and sometimes it is circumstantial. In Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Amrish Puri was the apex of the triangle while a dead Rani Mukherjee was the third angle in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, says Nikhil Advani, director of Kal Ho Naa Ho, the last Bollywood film to champion a concept that has always found favour with the audience  from Sangam to Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.																								The success of David Dhawans latest film Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and the new films releasing in the coming weeks have reinstated the fact that the love triangle is the flavour of the season. And the best thing about it all is that the setting is not of the conventional mode with everything from voyeur spy-cams to 9/11 victims to AIDS patients thrown in.																								The big Friday release this week is Ken Ghoshs romantic thriller Fida, which banks as much on the shock value as the cricket match did in Lagaan. It is a triangle of sorts with two separate love stories, is all Ghosh will divulge. But it has this big Shyamalan twist and doesnt sport the perfect ending.																								Next Friday, Revathy returns with her old mitr of Love days Salman Khan in her second directorial venture Phir Milenge. Although she made it clear at the music launch of the film in Mumbai that it is not a love triangle, both Salman and Abhishek Bachchan come into the life of Shilpa Shetty in the film with AIDS as the main theme. The most difficult part about the film was to mould a sensitive issue into a commercially viable venture, the actress-turned-director had then said.																								Salman returns for another love triangle in Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa, slated to release on September 10. Only this time, he forms the apex with Bhoomika Tere Naam Chawla and Preity Zinta forming the other two ends. This Atul Agnihotri directorial debut is more in the Kuch Kuch mould with Bhoomika stepping into the life of Salman after the death of Preity. So you have memories playing third fiddle here.																								A week before that, veteran telly director Shashi Ranjan makes his big screen debut with Dobara, set to premiere in Lahore. The film sees Jackie Shroff play a writer who is leading a happy married life with wife Anjali, played by Mahima Chaudhury. But a call from his ex-lover Ziya (Raveena) is all it takes to get the triangle working. We have had a lot of teenybopper triangles in Bollywood but not really a mature one, says Shashi. Thats what sets Dobara apart  no clichd conflicts, no formula script!Also slated for a September 10 release is debutant Tanveer Khans romantic saga Madhoshi. The Jism jodi of Bipasha Basu and John Abraham is back with Priyanshu Chatterjee for company (or crowd?). After losing her sister in the September 11 incident, Bipasha falls in love with anti-terrorist squad member John. But fianc Priyanshu is also chasing her around. Madhoshi is a triangular thriller, says Tanveer. In the times that we are in, romance is the only source of relief. If you try something different than the conventional love triangle, your film will get beaten like an Aan or a Gayab. And unlike some of the other films, theres nothing circumstantial about this triangle. Its quite blatant  two men and one woman, says Priyanshu.																								And all this just in the next month. What follows thereafter, is equally triangular. Theres Kabir Sadanands teeny trio in Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao, Suneel Darshans musical love triangle Mere Jeevan Saathi with Akshay Kumar, Amisha Patel and Karisma Kapoor and Abbas Mastans desi Disclosure, Aetraaz with Akshay, Kareena and Priyanka Chopra. Well, if you are still not convinced, the master of romance is back after seven long years and yes, Yash Chopra is making a love triangle with Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee.

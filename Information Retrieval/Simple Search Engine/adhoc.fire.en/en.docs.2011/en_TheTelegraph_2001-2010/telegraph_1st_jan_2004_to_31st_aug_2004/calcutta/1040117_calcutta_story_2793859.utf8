 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Rainwater check for dry run
 															- Law in pipeline, estates without facility will lose plan sanction A STAFF REPORTER																								Water conservation begins at home. So, all existing and future housing complexes will have to harvest rainwater as part of a programme being put in place to tackle a looming water crisis in and around Calcutta.																								Hirak Ghosh, chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), said on Friday that rainwater harvesting would be made mandatory by legislation in housing estates on more than 60,000 sq ft or having 100 or more flats.																								We have already framed the new rules. If we do not find a provision for rainwater harvesting in the building plan, we will not give a no-objection certificate. Legislation in this regard will ensure implementation, said Ghosh. There are indications that the specification will be lowered to bring more housing complexes under the purview of rainwater harvesting.																								Ghosh inaugurated a workshop on water conservation and rainwater harvesting system, organised by the pollution control board on Friday, at which two model projects constructed on the roofs of Poura Bhavan, office of the Salt Lake municipality, and Bidhannagar College were exhibited.																								Rainwater is to be collected and stored during the monsoon on the roof of a building, before being purified and recycled. Most people use fresh water in the toilet, for gardening, washing clothes, cleaning floors, utensils and cars. It is a waste of fresh water, that should be used only for drinking, experts said.																								The initial targets are the spacious roofs of some big schools, colleges and government offices. After completion of the project at the Salt Lake municipality and Bidhannagar College, the pollution control board has plans to introduce the system at Jal Sampad Bhavan, Unnayan Bhavan, Purta Bhavan and Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake.																								We have also decided to organise awareness camps across the city on the necessity of water conservation and provide people the technical knowhow on the rainwater harvesting system, said pollution control board member-secretary S.K. Sarkar.																								Training will be provided to builders, promoters, contractors, NGOs and officials working in different development agencies. Sources of drinking water, both underground and surface, will be severely limited in future, warned water investigation and resources secretary Sukumar Das, stressing the need to act, and act now.

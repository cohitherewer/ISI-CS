 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Fresh exam offer to offset blunder
 															- Candidate barred from M.Tech test after error in calculating attendance A STAFF REPORTER																								In a strange turn of events, Calcutta University (CU) will have to reconduct an examination in the M.Tech course for one student, in compensation for debarring him from writing the test for no fault of his own.																								The authorities disallowed him from taking the exam for an undetected error that was committed by some employees. They had calculated his total attendance wrongly, which brought the figure to much less than what was required in order to be eligible for sitting for the exam.																								We cannot deny that Debmalya Banerjee had missed the first day of the exam for no fault of his own. We have requested the examination department to hold a fresh examination exclusively for him and the officials concerned have given him the assurance that they will consider his case, said Manab Kumar Sengupta, secretary of the Science College.																								As a result of the wrong calculation, Banerjees attendance fell short by nearly 20 per cent before appearing for the first semester exams, which began on May 25. The universitys examination department, too, had overlooked this error and cancelled his examination form.																								According to the universitys rules, students should have a minimum 65 per cent attendance in class to be eligible to appear for any post-graduate exam.																								I was stunned on May 25 when I went to collect my admit card from the college. My teachers told me that the university had not sent over my admit card as I had not attended the required numbers of classes, Banerjee said.																								He rushed to the universitys administrative head office on College Street the same day. I attended over 80 per cent of the classes and there could be no reason for debarring me from the examination, he said.																								However, the truth was finally unveiled in the evening, after Banerjee managed to identify at what stage the mistake had occurred. 																								It was found that the employees who had calculated Banerjees attendance were unaware that he had joined the course in February  two months after the course had commenced.																								According to the universitys rules, student attendance is calculated on the basis of the number of classes he or she has been present in from the time he or she joins the course .																								In Banerjees case, the first two months of the course should not have been taken into consideration. But the employees wrongly marked him absent for the two months, even though he had not joined the course at that time. This lowered his total attendance, though he had attended more than 80 per cent of the classes after February 20  the date he joined the course.																								After detecting the error, the authorities did issue Banerjee an admit card. But by that time, the first day of the exam was already over. He was then granted permission to take the remaining examinations from the next day.																								As for the exam that he missed on May 25, the authorities have promised Banerjee to hold a fresh test with a second set of question papers to compensate him.

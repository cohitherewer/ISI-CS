The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Detected early, cured fully
				 	 SUBIR GANGULY, oncologist, met readers of The Telegraph at his office last week to answer their queries. Participants included Kalyan Roy, Santosh Pande, Mandira Ghosal, Diptimoy Ghosh, Soham Chakrabarty, Goutam Saha, Sujit Kumar Dey, Basudeb Choudhury, Abhishek Roy and Debashree Chakrabarty				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Diptimoy Ghosh: How do the four metros figure in terms of prevalence of the disease?																																																			Going by statistics, Delhi and Mumbai top the list of breast cancer patients. Cervical cancer is prevalent in Madhya Pradesh, though the maximum number of cases of gall-bladder cancer was detected in New Delhi. In Calcutta, too, the occurrence of cervical cancer is high, and is increasing by the day. 																																																									

Diptimoy Ghosh: Is cancer curable?																																																			All types of cancer are not curable at all stages. The cure rate depends on the type and stage of the disease, and also on the nature of the patient. In most cases, if the growth of cancerous cells spreads beyond a certain limit, there is little chance of cure. In some types of cancer, a simple painless mole develops on the body surface that is often neglected, but if it remains unattended to for a certain period of time, it becomes non-curable. Similarly, in some cases of cervical cancer, women ignore blood and other vaginal discharges, perhaps due to ignorance or some other social reason. This often develops into a type of non-curable cervical cancer. However, as is known widely, if cancer is detected early, it can be cured completely.																																																									

Mandira Ghosal: What are the types of cancer in women?																																																			Breast cancer and a growth in the cervix are two of the most common manifestations of cancer among women. 																																																											Of the total number of cases, nearly 25 per cent of women who suffer from breast cancer are childless. As a result, since the level of oestrogen is high in their bodies, it boosts the disease. Cervical cancer occurs among women who neglect their health, especially personal hygiene.																																																									

Mandira Ghosal: Social conditions often force women to hide their disease. I know somebody with breast cancer. She fears that treatment will deform her breast, and take a toll on her conjugal life.																																																			We often come across such cases, where patients hide the disease fearing a psychological scar, regardless of gender. Many medical experts who treat the disease have felt the need to add a psychiatric extension to cancer treatment. It is not easy to tell a patient that he has cancer. 																																																											Then again, some doctors are not well-informed about the disease. For example, there is a scientifically baseless belief that a biopsy actually makes the disease spread, or that surgery only boosts the growth of cancerous cells in the body. In fact, some doctors prefer to stay away from cancer patients. I remember a case where a paediatric surgeon refused to treat a person who had suffered a fracture because the patient had cancer. 																																																											Exemplary punishment is called for to prevent recurrence of such incidents. At the same time, informative programmes should be organised periodically to inform doctors about modern trends in treating the disease. 																																																									

Abhishek Roy: The greatest stumbling block for a person who has just found out that he has cancer is choosing where and how to get treated. Is there any dependable organisation that can guide patients?																																																			As far as I know, there are no such government organisations. Some voluntary organisations, like Indian Cancer Society, Oncolink and Fight Cancer, had been formed earlier to provide such a platform. But most of these have ceased to exist. 																																																											A few of us, along with fellow doctors in the Indian Medical Association, are working on a plan to build such a platform to provide information. Some non-government organisations have already stepped forward to help. I personally feel that since this is a technical issue, only a council of doctors can guide any group seeking to impart information to patients about the disease. 																																																									

Goutam Saha: Dont you think a rehabilitation package is also needed?																																																			Like psychological support, cancer patients also need some sort of rehabilitation. To provide optimum relief to patients, a rehabilitation centre adjacent to the treatment centre is absolutely necessary. Presently, except for Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital, we do not have any other hospital where all the treatment facilities can be obtained under one roof.Concluded

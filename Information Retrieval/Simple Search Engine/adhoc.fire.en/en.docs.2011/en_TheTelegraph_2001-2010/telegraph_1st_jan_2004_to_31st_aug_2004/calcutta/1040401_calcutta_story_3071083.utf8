 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Court stops market work
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the police to slap a stop-work on the proposed twin-storeyed Golden City Market at Metiabruz, after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) commissioner failed to submit records relating to construction of the building.																								Justice Barin Ghosh, while passing the order, came down heavily on the CMC for not taking steps against the construction, allegedly coming up on an unauthorised plot.																								It is a riddle to us why the civic authorities had posted guards at the site of the construction and why these guards were withdrawn subsequently, the court observed.																								Some residents of SA Farooquee Road, in Metiabruz, had moved the high court, alleging that the proposed market was being constructed illegally with the direct assistance of local hooligans on a plot belonging to another person.																								The petitioners also alleged that the civic body was helping in the construction of the market by providing guards. 																								The local ruffians are muzzling protests over the illegal construction with threats of dire consequences, they alleged.																								The judge, after hearing the petition, asked the CMC commissioner to submit papers relating to the sanction of the construction plan. 																								On Wednesday, when the matter came up for hearing again, the CMC lawyer told the court that his client was not in a position to produce the papers as they were still being processed. 																								The CMC had posted guards at the construction site in June last year, but withdrew them subsequently, in the wake of a controversy over the legality of the project, the lawyer said.																								Justice Ghosh expressed his displeasure over the CMC role and ordered police not to allow construction on the plot till the dispute over its title rights was disposed of by the court.

 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Heritage plaza in hip rerun Finetune for plaza sequel
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Tollywoods shooting stars at Swabhumi. Events were bringing in the crowds, but business wasnt booming																								If the Alleppey Fish Curry, Gosht ke Parche or Bissi Bela Bhat dont titillate their taste buds, give them hotdogs, burgers and croissants. Add a swank four-screen cineplex to the existing closed-circuit Bioscope, and throw in a kids zone to spiral that footfall this summer. In other words, evolve and reinvent, in response to visitor feedback.																								After three years of showcasing culture, craft and cuisine and trying to provide a platform to promote city-based first-timers in various vocations, Swabhumi is ready to move on  and grow younger. The 6.5-acre heritage plaza on the Bypass is set to unveil a brand new facet, drawing critical lessons from its first-phase sojourn. Swabhumi was an out-of-the-box concept, meant to promote experimental food and unorganised retail, besides offering a low-cost venue for untried events and budding artistes, observes Harsh Neotia, director of the developing firm, Ganapati Parks Ltd, a joint venture between Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Gujarat Ambuja Cements.																								Weekends are fine, but a far higher weekday traffic of youngsters is needed to make the set-up viable. We have tried a few things, like childrens film festivals and puppet shows in the past. But we feel the very special experience at the multiplex, coupled with some western snacks, could do the trick, says general manager P. Sandeep.																								While a kaleidoscope of events has kept the urban courtyard throbbing, shopping activity at the outlets housed in the urban zone hasnt exactly kept the cash registers ringing. Calcuttans have also shown a marked reluctance to experiment with offbeat dishes at the ornate food court, sticking to the staid dosapao bhajikathi roll menu instead.																								In contrast, the craftspeople hawking their own creations have been fairly successful, making both the Karigarer Haat and the Meena Bazaar vibrant quarters.																								As part of its product-mix fine-tuning exercise, Swabhumi is banking on movie magic to bring in the crowds.																								A four-screen multiplex, spread across two floors and seating 1,100, propped up by a special childrens arena and a predominantly western food section, will be up and functional this May itself. 																								While opening up a more contemporary flank, the park is conscious of not deviating overmuch from its essential profile of the alternative destination.																								As Neotia puts it: True, quite a few outlets havent been doing all that well. But one has to keep in mind that most of them are first-time entrepreneurs and some have struggled to get the spread or the pricing right. On the flip side, some, like Halo Heritage, Vikalp and Parampara, have done remarkably well under the same roof.																								The Swabhumi management is keen to continue exposing visitors to experimental arts and craft and offbeat food, since it helps position Calcutta better on the tourist map.																								Its like making an art film, which doesnt necessarily translate into box-office success, but has its space and requirement to make an alternative viewpoint. After all, Swabhumi is not a hard-nosed, success-driven organisation like City Centre (set to open in Salt Lake soon), and we are happy straddling this great divide, concludes Neotia.

 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Brush with Teresa and life at large
				 	 Chandra Dasgupta																								It was a meeting with Mother Teresa that changed the life of this art graduate from Santiniketan. Chandra Dasgupta has tried to make a difference to society with small contributions of her own and from her students, ever since.																								Her art school, Nandan, had started with only one student, 25 years ago. It has now around 800 names on the rolls. And along with learning how to bring alive objects and people on canvas, Dasgupta tries to make them aware of their responsibilities to society as well. Twice a year, old clothes and books are collected from students and donated to Missionaries of Charity. Once a month, Rs 500 is donated to the organisation on behalf of the students as well. It accounts for their daal for a day, Dasgupta explains. 																								Meeting Mother Teresa was an experience that Dasgupta would never forget. I met her under quite strange circumstances, she says. A student of hers had brain tumour, but his family did not have the money required for the operation. Dasgupta managed to collect Rs 30,000 through donations, but that was not enough. It was then that she decided to turn to Mother for help. It was 4 am when I went to meet her. As I was waiting, suddenly I found someone holding my hands. I turned to see that it was Mother in a wheelchair. I immediately knew that everything would be all right, says an emotional Dasgupta.																								Mother and the missionaries arranged for the boys care during operation, and he was cured soon.																								That was 12 years ago. Since then, she has tried to be as involved with the missionaries as her schedule has allowed her to. 																								Ramkrishna Mission, Belur Math, is another organisation that she is associated with. She and her students donate money and old clothes to the mission as often as possible. Children must learn early in life that there are others less fortunate than them who are deprived of many things, believes Dasgupta.																								There are some exhibitions that she organises for her students every year. But none of the exhibits are for sale. Children dont like their creations being taken away by others, she says.																								Dasgupta had had a sheltered childhood, studying at Diocesan School. It was the stay at Santiniketan, where she took her degree in fine arts at Kala Bhaban that changed the way she looked at life. The people, the environment and everything else really helped me blossom, she feels. After Santiniketan, marriage followed, and post-marriage, the art school.																								Her plans now include a solo exhibition, for which her collection should be ready by 2005.

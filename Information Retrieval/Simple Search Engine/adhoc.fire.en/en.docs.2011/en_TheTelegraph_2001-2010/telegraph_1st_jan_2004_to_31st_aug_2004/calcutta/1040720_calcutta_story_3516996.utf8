 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Japanese cry of rape, rob
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Japanese tourist has allegedly been raped and robbed in a hotel in the heart of the city.																								The 21-year-old, on a holiday in Calcutta, lodged a complaint with Park Street police station on Sunday, naming Raju as her rapist, who also robbed her of $300 (US) and Rs 1,500.																								Mohammed Iqbal, or Raju, as the victim knew him, was arrested from his Entally residence on Monday.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that his real name is Mohammed Iqbal and he is a resident of Calcutta, and not Delhi, as he had claimed to the woman, Partha Bhattacharjee, additional commissioner of police (I), said on Monday. Bhattacharjee added that $300 and Rs 1050 were recovered from him.																								The Japanese tourist had met Iqbal in New Delhi, where he befriended her. He can speak Japanese and so he was able to win her confidence, Bhattacharjee explained.																								Iqbal checked in at Heera Holiday Inn, a hotel on Elliot Road, on July 3. He had asked the woman to check into the same hotel, Bhattacharjee said. 																								The Japanese tourist reached Heera Holiday Inn on July 5 and the two stayed there, in separate rooms, till July 16.																								Police sources said the two had a system of weekly payments at the hotel. When they did not pay up till July 16, the hotel-owner raised a ruckus.																								The same day, Iqbal disappeared from the hotel, without paying the bill and taking the Japanese tourists money with him, Bhattacharjee said. 																								On July 17, she moved to another hotel and on Sunday, she lodged a complaint with police.																								We have filed cases of rape and cheating against Iqbal, said Bhattacharjee.																								According to officials, Iqbal was arrested three months ago for duping a Japanese woman at a city hotel. There was no charge of rape against him at that time, clarified a sleuth.																								Iqbal will be produced at the chief metropolitan magistrates court on Tuesday.																								The Japanese consulate, meanwhile, denied comment on the matter.

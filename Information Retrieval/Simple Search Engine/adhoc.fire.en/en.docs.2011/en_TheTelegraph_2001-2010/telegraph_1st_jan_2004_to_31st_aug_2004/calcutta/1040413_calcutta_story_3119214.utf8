 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Two-wheeler theft trips teens
 																											- Age 14 to 17, five held for bid to sell neighbours motorcycle A STAFF REPORTER																								Five teenagers, students of a private English-medium school in Bansdroni, on the southern fringes of the city, stole a neighbours two-wheeler in a bid to earn a quick buck and quench their thirst for adventure.																								But luck ran out on Monday morning when police caught up with them while they were trying to change the registration number-plate of the vehicle before selling it off. 																								Police said the boys, aged between 14 and 17, stole Gautam Das motorcycle on Saturday night. They had been eyeing the vehicle for quite some time. They had even got a forged number-plate made so that they could sell the motorcycle without much of a fuss, said an officer of the local police station. 																								One of the boys, a 15-year-old, stole the key of the vehicle from Das house. Then, with the others, he hid the two-wheeler behind a local school building, the officer explained. 																								Meanwhile, one of the teenagers found out that Das had lodged a complaint with Regent Park police station. Anticipating trouble, he surrendered himself at Charu Market police station. 																								His tip-off helped us recover the motorcycle. We passed on the information to Regent Park police, as the complaint was lodged there, said an officer of Charu Market police station. 																								All four are students and live in Bansdroni. This morning, we arrested three of them. Later, during interrogation, the trio came out with the names of two others, who were nabbed later in the day, said Humayun Kabir, deputy superintendent of police (town), South 24-Parganas.																								 The boys were produced in Alipore court and then forwarded to the juvenile court in Salt Lake. We are trying to find out whether these boys, who come from well-to-do families, have any links with the two-wheeler lifters operating in the area. It is neither possible for these boys to get a forged number-plate, nor is it easy for them to sell off a stolen vehicle on their own. They seem to be working on someone elses instruction, Kabir added.																								The teenagers will be put through several rounds of interrogation in the next few days. None of them are criminals and we need to get to the bottom of the case. We have got to find out who these boys are working with, as there could be many others like them who are being lured into the trade, the officer added.																								Swapan Pal, officer-in- charge of the local police station, said: The boys were denied bail by the juvenile court, as this is a serious offence. Motorcycle-owner Das knows them well and has come forward to help, realising that his vehicle was stolen by boys of the neighbourhood.

 Friday, June 25, 2004 For whom world is a stage
Naseeruddin Shah puts a slice of life under the spotlight and Konkona Sen Sharma pens some passages on her passion, on Odeon 2004 eve Konkona Sen Sharma at the unveiling of Odeon 2004. (Below) Naseeruddin Shah with wife Ratna on Thursday. Pictures by Aranya Sen I am happy to return to this wonderful city with a production after five years. I had a great deal of acceptance here, right from the beginning of my career. Calcutta always embraced the off-beat, different kind of films I acted in. The city is very special for me.I had read Kahlil Gibrans The Prophet in college and the interest about the book had stayed on. I would often read it aloud to myself and wonder whether it could be held in the form of recitation. So, one day I recited it to my wife, Ratna, who agreed that we could go ahead with the idea of staging it. We worked on the project for two years. Gibrans book seemed to have a life of its own.In his book, Gibran uses the image of a ship as a symbol of death, or moving over to another plane. Having witnessed the illnesses of some people very close to me, I was intrigued by what they had been thinking on their deathbed. Was it the possibility of rebirth, punishment or reward? But being a Muslim, I wanted to be clear about certain things from the outset. For the Muslim community, the word prophet has strict, limited connotations, and I didnt want to be misunderstood. I didnt want to portray the Prophet of the scriptures. In my work, he is a bit of Jesus, Moses, Mohammad and Guru Nanak. So, I discarded the idea of setting the play in a desert with a man wearing white robes, though it might have been visually appealing. Rather, I wanted to be a person reporting what he heard the prophet say.I myself deliver the bulk of the lines; some pieces are rendered by Ratna, Kunnal Kapoor and nine-year-old Rishabh Thakker. Let us keep the setting of the play a surprise for the audience. But I am anxious about staging The Prophet in the 600-seater GD Birla Sabhagar, because I fear a large group would dilute the intensity. I would like to restrict my audience to 10 to 15 people because I want the lines to reach them with as much directness as possible. We have performed the play at very small theatres in Mumbai.Over the past few years, my group, Motley, has started doing plays in the Hindustani language. Earlier, we used to do mostly western plays primarily because there is a terrible paucity of original script-writing in Hindi.We have had three separate productions on the stories of Ismat Chugtai and Saadat Hasan Manto. Apart from the fact that Ismat was a great writer, I could relate to the milieu she created in her writings; a small town in Uttar Pradesh where I grew up. The people she wrote about were also so familiar. I could find shades of my grandfather, my uncles and my mother in them. I would love to stage Ismat Apa Ke Naam in Calcutta.Motleys fourth production Katha Collage, based on two stories by Munshi Premchand and one by Lucknow-based writer Kamtanath, will open in July.After 30 years of acting in films, I find it a rather boring job. Theatre gives you the chance to make a living contact with each and every viewer. This is the magic of theatre, which the camera cant recreate.Memories and the magicI have been associated with theatre right from my college days at St Stephens, New Delhi. What started off as dabble, a sophomoric timeout, soon evolved into a more passionate pursuit. Being a student of literature I studied playwrights like Beckett, Brecht and Arthur Miller and later put them into practice through the help of our Shakespeare Society. We performed plays of not only Shakespeare but also Israel Horowitz, Dario Fo and others.Recently, Ive been struggling to keep pace with my cinema commitments. I still manage to make time for theatre, but not as much as I would like to. Naseeruddin Shah has been my all-time favourite, and even today amid my stifling schedule I make it a point to watch his new productions. This year, Im waiting with bated breath to see the afflatus of Naseeruddin Shah, live on stage with The Prophet.For the past couple of years, Odeon has become a permanent fixture on my yearly calendar. This year, as well, Im eager to witness the stalwarts of Indian theatre create their magic in front of the theatre-loving audience of the city.Odeon, as you all must be aware, is the theatre festival encouraged and organised by Hutch. In Odeon 2003, the company decided to enhance the scope of the festival by supporting a Bengali theatre project with the sale proceeds of Odeon 2002. The idea was to showcase a new play which would be nurtured from concept to birth and premiered at Odeon. This effort is heart-warming since not only are plays from all over India staged, but provisions are also made to give the much-needed impetus to the local theatre community.The last couple of festivals have seen icons like Amal Allana, Anuradha Kapur, Rahul Da Cunha and Kirti Jain. This year, among other productions lined up for the two-week theatre festival, are Amal Allanas Erendira, the very talented Kaushik Sens Kolkatar Elektra and Subhasish Gangopadhyays Thake Shudhu Nachiketa, which deserves special mention because it is presented by Shyambazaar Blind Opera, a group comprising wholly or partially-blind participants who love and use theatre more as a cure than anything else.I believe this year, too, all the theatre buffs of the city will have their share of entertainment, awe-inspiring performances, and magical moments to savour...Last night I had the strangest dream, Ive ever dreamed before. I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war  Simon and Garfunkel.

Feng Shui
Pinky KapoorI have been suffering from a number of problems. My physical health is not very sound and I am given to violent outbursts at the slightest provocation. I am doing a professional course, but cant seem to clear the last leg of the exams after repeated attempts. I am working but wish to move up in life. Besides, my parents havent been able to find a suitable groom for me yet. My date of birth is 11.08.77. What should I do?Rekha Kedia, 
Hindusthan ParkThe Solution: Your pillars of destiny reveal that you are a strong metal person. The elements that will give you relief are water and wood. Blue and green are colours that help increase your concentration, bring success in your professional course and keep check on your temper. The fire element that represents marriage can be used to enhance your personal marriage direction, which is south. Create a love corner here with pictures of couples and objects in pairs. Burning two red or pink candles here every evening will enhance your marriage prospects.We are constructing a house and would like to know how large the main door should be compared to the other doors of the house. Is there any harm in using the wood from our old house in the construction of our new one? How can the main entrance be strengthened to invite prosperity and good luck? Vasundhara Goel, 
CalcuttaThe Solution: The main door should be bigger than the other doors. It should be at least twice as tall as it is wide. The main entrance is considered the mouth of the house, through which the cosmic chi flows, bringing with it good luck, prosperity and new opportunities. These doors should be solid and, to bring in prosperity, silver or copper strips concealed around the wooden framework and underneath the marble threshold may also prove effective. Feng Shui advises against using old wood in new houses, though using new wood in an old structure is fine. This is to avoid bringing in the negativity of the old home to the new one. Pair power: Hang a picture of a happy couple like tennis most beautiful pair Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in your personal marriage direction. You may soon hear wedding bells, says Feng ShuiFrom the day we moved into our new house, none of us are in good health. I have discovered that the east side of our house is cut off. We are on the ground floor and the cardinal directions are at a diagonal. Can you suggest remedies?Aditya Sanganeria, 
CalcuttaThe Solution: The easiest way to fill the void in the missing corner, which is the health area, is by planting a bamboo tree at the point where the eastern corner of the building would be if it hadnt been cut off. Install a water body around it with pots of bright flowers and green light to enliven the chi. Hang a round, faceted crystal along with a healthy plant in every window to attract and circulate chi. Fresh flowers, which include the colours of all the five elements, also symbolise vibrant health.We have recently selected a property where the main compound gate leads to a steep, downward sloping driveway. Everything else seems fine but this feature is making me extremely uncomfortable and superstitious. Is this Feng Shui-friendly?Name withheldThe Solution: Any kind of structural depression on entering a house is considered inauspicious. It is not good to let cosmic energy slope downwards and prevent it from entering the main building, as this represents a downward slump in life. The best remedy is to put the gate at the starting point of the slope and lift the energy by installing two tall poles on either side. The main entrance and the area around it should be highlighted and beautified so it draws attention from the driveway and invites energy back to your main door.My son has completed his MBA abroad and is now looking for a decent job there. He has some offers in hand, but they are not to his satisfaction. Can you suggest some remedies we can do here that will help him find a good job and bring good luck?Namrata Agarwal, 
CalcuttaThe Solution: The north-west area of his bedroom should be activated. Place his photo in a metal frame near a silver bowl with six crystals and six metal coins in it, as six is the number of this area and signifies help from seniors. Such an arrangement will help attract new corporate opportunities. You can also write a note of affirmation in golden ink saying he has found a good job. Place it in a silver box and actually visualise this happening. A revolving clock close by will further stimulate this area.

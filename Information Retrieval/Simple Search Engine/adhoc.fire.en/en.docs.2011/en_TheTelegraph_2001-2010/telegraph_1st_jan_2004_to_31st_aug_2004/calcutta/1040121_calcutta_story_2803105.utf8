 SUNANDO SARKAR				 	 Calcuttas ubiquitous autos: Bane or boon?																								This is as close the lowly auto-rickshaw  misused by drivers and abused by everyone else  can get to respectability. The three-wheeler, which most Calcuttans call a menace, has entered the halls of academia, in the form of a research paper by a college teacher.																								The study, by Chhanda Basak Banerjee, a teacher of history at a Calcutta University-affiliated college, gets to the auto-rickshaws roots, now spread deep and wide. It traces the vehicles journey  from its tentative entry in 1981, as just another law-abiding, metered vehicle, to the present, when traffic bosses fret and fume in frustration when it comes to controlling them. The paper is open-ended; letting the reader decide whether the auto is a bane or a boon.																								Basak Banerjee, once a regular user of the auto, suffered an accident travelling in one on September 18, 2003, to which she lost two fingers and partial use of her right hand. The accident changed her relationship with the vehicle forever. I have not given up on auto-rickshaws. But, yes, I do avoid them if I have a choice, the teacher said.																								But the mishap also set her thinking about the reasons for the emergence of the auto-rickshaw as one of the most popular modes of transport. She got to work, turning first to her brother who works in Calcutta Police. After trying unsuccessfully to get hold of the figures, she realised that her research would face many obstacles. I found that the police did not have any real data about auto-rickshaws and this made the subject even more more intriguing, Basak Banerjee admitted.																								What she eventually learnt would make the city police proud. The first auto-rickshaw rolled out on to citys roads in 1981 and was a metered vehicle, charging a minimum of 20 paise for a ride.																								But drivers soon found out that they could make a killing if they converted it into a shuttle service; so the first such auto set off the same year and the Hazra-Bondel Gate stretch became the first shuttle route.																								Since then, the auto has grown, and how. There are at least 32 routes, starting at Barrackpore in the north and Budge Budge in the south. The ubiquity of the auto can be gauged from the fact that there are only 14 auto-free stretches in the city, including Park Street, Chowringhee, Central Avenue and the Maidan.																								There are so many things to be said against autos  they park at junctions and in the middle of roads and do not care for rules  but the paper is sympathetic to the drivers. Tracing the rise of the auto from the bleak industrial scenario of the 1980s and the failure of the government to provide enough jobs, it shows how they earn an average of only about Rs 150 a day.

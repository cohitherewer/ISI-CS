																																																		Dakshinapan, one of Calcuttas better-known shopping destinations at Dhakuria, downed shutters on Thursday evening following a tussle between private shop-owners and the employees union. According to Tushar Chakraborty, secretary of Dakshinapan Traders Association, the stall-owners organisation, the 143 privately-owned shops at the market complex were forced to shut down due to lack of consensus over an agreement on the sales targets and subsequent increment of salary of the employees. In our previous meeting, we had suggested that if the employees met a sales target they would be rewarded accordingly over and above their basic salary. They had agreed earlier, but on June 29 they refused to talk about a sales target while demanding the contribution agreed upon for fulfilling the target, Chakraborty said. In response to the charge levelled by the employees union, the shop-owners said if the two sides did not come to an agreement they would go back to the basic salary system that existed prior to the proposed amendment. If someone fails to fulfil a target set by them by a whisker he would be denied the benefits. How can we accept such a proposition? demanded Gautam Banerjee, president of the Citu-controlled employees union.																																																		Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee informed the Assembly on Thursday that the proposed cultural complex at Rawdon Square would soon come up as the state government had received Rs 35 lakh from the Centre and had sanctioned Rs 2 crore from its own account.

The total cost for construction of the cultural complex has been pegged at Rs 7 crore. An autonomous body has been set up, comprising eminent personalities from all walks of life, to monitor the construction and running of the complex, Bhattacharjee said. He, however, made it clear that the proposed complex will not be used for any commercial purpose. It will be a cultural complex, he stressed.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The Howrah municipal court has stopped functioning for over a month following the cave-in of a portion of the century-old Town Hall on January 4. The municipal court used to function in a portion of the Town Hall.																								Officials said nearly 1,000 cases relating to various civic matters have already piled up causing anxiety to litigants in Howrah town and its neighbourhood. Lawyers in Howrah court said over 20 cases scheduled to be heard in the municipal court in January are still pending in the absence of a court room. 																								The administration should arrange for an alternative space so that those cases can be heard soon, said lawyer Sujit Kumar Chatterjee. Litigants from various parts of the district were returning disheartened every day, he added. 																								Another lawyer, Tafzil Ahmed, stated that the district administration should have renovated the wrecked municipal court room on a war footing. Other lawyers alleged that some hoodlums had stolen important documents relating to illegal constructions in Howrah and its adjoining areas after the cave-in.																								Asked why repair work was being delayed, Howrah Municipal Corporation mayor Gopal Mukherjee said it would begin soon. We have a plan to shift the court elsewhere temporarily so that the litigants are not inconvenienced.																								Mukherjee, however, denied that important documents had been stolen after the hall collapse. 																								Howrah District Krida amp; Sanskritik Manch, a local NGO, had petitioned the district magistrate and judge about the missing papers. A probe was initiated by the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, but the NGO is yet to receive its result.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Spare the cars that ply below
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should a toll be imposed only on cars using the new flyovers, instead of a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles? More letters will be published next week				 Sight for sore eyes:  The AJC Bose Road flyover at night
 Deba Prasad Bhattacharyya, 																		Sonarpur. 																																																														The new flyovers have helped improve the traffic situation a great deal. More such flyovers should be built so that the traffic can be even more organised. Once the flyovers come up, all vehicles will benefit, irrespective of whether they use the flyovers or not. So, an annual flyover tax on all vehicles is justified and would help earn more revenue to recover the huge maintenance cost, rather than imposing toll only on cars using the new flyovers. 									

Piyal Mukherjee, 
																		Lake Town.																																																														Levying a blanket annual tax on all vehicles, irrespective of their use of the flyovers, is not a feasible proposition. A toll should be realised only from vehicles using the flyovers in order to be fair to those not using them. 									

Biman Saha, 
																		Lake Town.																																																														Collection toll tax from cars on the flyovers is a time-consuming and traffic-stopping act. Besides, some cars may get away without paying the tax by speeding up. So, to avoid all this trouble, a blanket annual flyover tax should be imposed on all vehicles. This way, vehicle-owners can wash their hands off the frequent burden. But the rate of such a tax should be rational, because not all vehicles use the flyovers. 									

Madhusree Gupta, 
																		Anil Roy Road. 																																																														Imposing a toll tax on cars using the new flyovers, instead of a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles, is a good idea. This will leave no room for resentment among non-users of the flyovers. At the same time, we can hope for proper maintenance of these newly-built flyovers, if there is a system of taxation on the users and a proper utilisation of that money. But one thing must be kept in mind  there should be no delay at the toll booths.									

Debashish Chakraborty,
																		Cossipore. 																																																														The state governments financial condition is poor. A huge amount of money was spent for construction of the new flyovers. So, a toll should be taken from owners of cars using the new flyovers on a regular basis, to recover the entire expenditure. The daily collection of toll from all vehicles will help make up the expenses, bit by bit. But a toll should be imposed only on cars using the new flyovers, instead of a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles.									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 
																		Entally. 																																																														Imposing a toll only on cars using the new flyovers or the introduction of a blanket annual flyover tax on vehicles  these sound rather pointless when traffic jams still exist. However, imposing a toll only on cars using the new flyovers is acceptable if the given options are weighed. Introduction of a flyover tax on all vehicles will put undue pressure on vehicle-owners, regardless of whether they have ever used the flyovers. Moreover, I believe, proper security arrangements should be made on the flyovers to check any possible activities of miscreants, especially at night.									

Diptimoy Ghosh,
																		Salt Lake City. 																																																														This is ridiculous. Why should those who will not use the flyovers at all or use them even once or twice a year have to cough up the lumpsum tax for a whole year? This is a tyranny of the Left Front government, just because of their poor financial position. It may so happen that one day, they will impose tax on pedestrians as road tax like the the vehicle-owners of today. 																																																														But those who like to pay a one-time tax to avoid the hassle of paying a daily tax may be issued a hologram sticker Flyover Tax paid  to fix on their window-screens, so that they may be allowed to pass without any disruption. The vehicles which will not carry that sticker should have to pay the tax at the entry points of flyovers.									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Beleghata.																																																														Flyovers have been made from the tax paid by the people. Not all of them will gain from the flyovers. So, a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles is not welcome. 									

Bhupen Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														There are many cars from north Calcutta which seldom use flyovers. So, a toll should be imposed only on cars using the new flyovers. But a blanket annual flyover tax may be charged from private or mini buses, which include the flyovers on their routes.									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia, Nadia. 																																																														All vehicles plying in and around the city should be considered on the same footing and brought under a uniform vehicle tax. Given the backdrop, a toll should not be imposed only on cars using the new flyovers, instead of a blanket annual flyover tax on all vehicles. 									

Seraj Alam, 
																		Bansberia.																																																														A toll is a tool for filling up government coffers. A regular tax on all kinds of vehicles means more revenue. So it is welcome.									

Anirban Mandal,
																		Chinsurah.																																																														If a toll is to be imposed, it should be done only on cars using the new flyovers, instead of a blanket annual tax, because all vehicles may not need to use the new flyovers. So, why should the owners of the vehicles not using the flyovers be made scapegoats?									

Mahasweta Saha, 
																		Garia. 																																																														Most of the flyovers connect the busy roads of Calcutta. If during office and school hours, or during an emergency, a person has to stop the car and pay the toll tax, then he or she might get delayed. So, it is better to pay the tax annually. 									

Sunil Banerjee, 
																		VIP Road.																																																														No, a toll should not be imposed only on cars using the new flyovers. This will mean losing out on revenue.

 Sunday, August 01, 2004 Grumble behind the growl
Pet Passion Nelanjana BhowmickMy friends Tasneem and Viki adopted Joeye (a pariah) when he was one month old. Joeye was growing up to be an unpredictable dog. One moment he was playful and the next he was snapping at familiar faces. The vet traced Joeyes aggressive behaviour to lack of socialisation and fear of abandonment.Growling, snapping, biting are all aggressive behaviours displayed by a dog to intimidate or harm a person or another animal. From a dogs perspective, theres always a reason for aggressive behaviour. Here are some.Constitution: Particular breeds of man made animals are known to be predisposed to particular behaviour. For example, Rottweilers and Dobermans are breeds that can become aggressive for no apparent reason. Cocker Spaniels exhibit the Jekyll and Hyde syndrome. All these seem to be genetic problems. But animals should be treated as individuals, not as groups. There are always exceptions to the tendency. Before getting a pet, it is important to consider the breed.Dominance aggression: Dogs as social animals view their human families as their pack. When your dog perceives his own ranking in the hierarchy to be higher than yours, he will challenge you in certain situations. He may growl if asked to give up a favourite spot on the couch, snap at you if you try to take out something from his mouth or your presence during meals may agitate him.Starting from puppyhood, feed your dog in the presence of family members to ensure that he wont feel threatened about his food being taken away. He should be used to having his mouth touched. From puppyhood, brush his teeth, playfully open his mouth, make it a game.(More on pet aggression, next Sunday)

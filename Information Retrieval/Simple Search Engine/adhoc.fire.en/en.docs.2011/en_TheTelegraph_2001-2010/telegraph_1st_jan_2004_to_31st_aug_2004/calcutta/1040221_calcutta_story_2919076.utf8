 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Raid rerun in trade hub
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In less than a week, armed robbers stormed another sari shop on Friday afternoon in the Burrabazar-Jorasanko belt, one of the citys largest business hubs, and made off with Rs 2.5 lakh in cash, apart from the watches and gold ornaments of the shop-owner and employees. 																								The gangsters emptied out the shops cash-box at gun-point and none of the employees dared resist.																								Last Saturday, a gang of four, armed with revolvers and choppers, entered a sari shop and fled with Rs 5 lakh after hitting the proprietors son on the head with the butt of a revolver.																								Fridays dacoity took place around 2.30 pm. Three miscreants, in their late 20s, arrived in front of a three-storeyed building on crowded Tarachand Dutta Street, a stones throw away from Jorasanko police station. They climbed up the stairs pretending to be clients.																								The trio headed straight to Ram Swarup Agarwals office-cum-shop on the first floor, entered it and bolted the main door from within, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).																								Two of the goons whipped out revolvers, while the third warned the shop employees not to shout. 																								Agarwal and his three workers were ordered to sit in one corner of the room. They complied meekly, with two guns trained on them, stated Mitra. The dacoits then directed Agarwal to hand over the keys of his cash-box.																								One of the gang opened the cash-box and scooped out all the money. Then, the three young men ordered the employees to give them their watches. Agarwal was forced to part with his rings. Before leaving, the gang warned Agarwal and his employees not to raise an alarm. The culprits bolted the door from outside and walked down the staircase, Mitra added.																								Ten minutes after the gangsters sped away, Agarwal and his men raised a hue and cry. The other shop-owners rushed to break open the locked door and rescue the businessman.																								According to deputy commissioner Mitra, there are a number of similarities between the two dacoities in past six days. 																								It seems the same gang is responsible for both. A hunt is on and breakthrough is expected soon, he said by way of assurance.

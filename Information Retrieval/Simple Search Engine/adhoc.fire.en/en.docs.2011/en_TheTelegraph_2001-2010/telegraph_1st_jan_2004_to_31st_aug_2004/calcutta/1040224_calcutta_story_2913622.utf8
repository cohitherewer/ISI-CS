The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 A question of answers
 The Sardar Patel College of Engineering, Mumbai, team at the Noida studio. (Below) Quizmaster Siddhartha BasuEagle Studios, Noida, Sunday afternoon. Four young boys in shirtsleeves from Sardar Patel College of Engineering, Mumbai, face four men in suits from the International School of Business, Hyderabad. Eight hands are poised on the buzzer, nerves are taut, adrenaline is flowing fast				 				 																															The best four quizzing brains on Indian campuses have been unearthed. The local version of University Challenge, the inter-university quiz show on BBC World that has been running in the UK for 40 years, has produced its first country champions. 				 				 																															The boys from Mumbai and their B-School seniors fought it out fiercely in a nail-biting finish, never far from neck-and-neck. The results are safely under lock-and-key till March 4, 10 pm, when the episode is to be aired. But a winner has already been found by the man asking the questions  Siddhartha Basu  and duly awarded by world billiards champion Geet Sethi.				 				 																															The contest, which premiered on air in August, started with over 350 four-member teams applying from colleges across the country. After 12 preliminary rounds, pre-quarter-finals, quarter-finals and the semi-finals, the two teams faced each other on February 22. Known best as the mastermind, host Basu  better known as Babu on the sets  kept the excitement going despite the two nervous sides not performing their best.				 				 																															The techie team  comprising Shrijit Plappally, Nirad Inamdar, Bharat Jayakumar and Nishad Manerikar  had lived dangerously through the earlier rounds, with a few close calls. It had been a smooth journey for the management students Josyula Krishnamurthi, D. Bhargav, Mubin Pagarkar and Amalesh Mishra, who had sailed passed the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, team in an earlier round.				 				 																															The Indian winners then faced a foreign challenger in the form of the UK University Challenge finalists from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The friendly match will be aired on March 11. With less at stake, the teams were more relaxed at the round which was a true test of quick wits. 				 				 																															British High Commissioner Michael Arthur was the guest of honour for the second match.				 				 																															The UK team had watched the Indian finals with great interest, as they were to be the next in the dock. They seem to be more concerned with speed here, said captain Edward, though he felt the questions were of around the same standards as those back home. Their strength, added the mathematics student, was in depth of knowledge, as each of the four came from a different academic background. Edward is a final-year student of mathematics, Lameen is specialising in linguistics, Darren is pursuing medicine while Laura (the only girl amongst the 12 contestants present) is completing a Ph.D in medieval literature. This is the furthest I have ever travelled for a quiz, said Darren, in his introduction on camera.				 				 																															The show has been a success for BBC, pushing up the ratings across age groups. The format, livelier than the classic Mastermind, had an eye on bringing in youth viewership for the channel. 				 				 																															According to commissioning editor, BBC, Narendhra Morar, the show is likely to come back for a second season. And there is nothing to stop even those who have participated once from going for it again, provided they are still in college. So, for all those campus quiz junkies, hope is still alive.				 				 																
	 Ramp rhythm				 				 																															There are a number of options available for budding models nowadays. But even with training and a contract with an agency, assignments are often rare or not to the liking of many aspirants.				 				 																															A website has been available for around a year now  www.themodelsinfo.com  that tries to ease the burden of prohibitive commissions that models often have to pay their agents. Models young and old can upload their bio-data, picture and contact information on the site. After that, it is up to them what assignments they want to take up or reject. The models pay a small annual fee for the service. Offers for ramp, print, ad-film, serials and feature films have come through the site, explains proprietor Bhaskar Basu.				 				 																															On-site workshops are also held at the firms Lake Town office, that include lessons on catwalk, grooming, diet-control and ways to deal with clients. For those who prefer to be on the other side of the camera, photography classes are also a part of the organisations portfolio.

	 Meet the doc				 				 																															At school, we eat, learn and play. But do we stay healthy? We found that out at the health check-up camp organised in our school from February 18 to 20. Armed with yellow health cards where our parents had filled in our medical history, we waited for our turn with the doctors from Wockhardt Hospitals. There were ENT, dental, ophthalmology and paediatric desks, where 1,470 students were checked. The doctors were very nice and let us off without any injections!Vishnupriya (Class VII),

The party began with a speech by Probal Chail, a committee member, followed by a felicitation of teachers past and present, before the action moved to the dance floor and the dinner tables. Those spotted in the happy crowd included former principal Ila Mukherjee and ex-India cricketer Devang Gandhi.				 				 																															nFocus: small screen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 GE Capital signals March start-up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								GE Capital has finalised its Calcutta plans and placed them before the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, which has been courting the Gurgaon-headquartered company for over two-and-a-half years to set up its fifth call centre in the city.																								According to the schedule rolled out by the GE officials to IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee and state IT secretary G.D. Gautama in Delhi on Tuesday, the company will kick off its operations in Calcutta from March 2005. To begin with, they will have a headcount of around 1,500 and then ramp up the numbers along with the growth in business, Gautama told Metro.																								With Wipro Spectramind and GE Capital  two of the countrys biggest BPO (business process outsourcing) players  coming into Calcutta, the stage is now set for more IT and ITES companies to follow suit, added Gautama.																								The IT minister and the IT secretary, in Delhi for a Ficci and World Bank organised event, met GE Capital senior vice-president Ashok Tyagi and business leader, collection and centre of excellence, Mudit Saxena, on Tuesday.																								The GE Capital officials said a four-member team would visit the city on June 23 to work out the logistics and even talk about a proposed call centre.																								They have plans to set up their own facility and to roll out their plans in a time-barred manner, so they have decided to set up a camp office in Calcutta within 45 days, announced Gautama.																								The confirmation of its Calcutta commitment came from GE Capital  which employs around 12,000 people across four centres in the country  last month, when chief executive officer Pramod Bhasin called up Mukherjee with the much-awaited magic word: Yes.																								Calcutta had entered GE Capitals consideration set in early 2001. Though the company deferred its decision on Calcutta till April 2004, it kept on recruiting aggressively from the city. 																								Some of its employees from Calcutta will be relocated once the company finalises its city address.																								We will extend all support to the GE team and help it set up operations in Calcutta as soon as possible, said Gautama.

Pet Passion Nelanjana BhowmickThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated. Mohandas Karamchand GandhiOur society has created a new commodity: the disposable pet. When people cant cope with the responsibility of having a dog, they take their dog for a ride to a far-off place from where it will not find its way back home. There, they set him free. Over the years, the homeless animal population has sky-rocketed due to the following reasons:Lack of commitment in the pet-owner: Reasons for abandoning pets vary from house is not big enough to the landlords dont accept pets. (These kinds of situations must be thought out before adopting a pet.) Common behaviour problems in pets include aggression, house soiling, separation anxiety, fear-based behaviour (most of these problems can be overcome once they are identified and dealt with).Pets are disposable: People release their pets, thinking that they will have enough to eat from the leftovers on the streets. Dont they know the animal can be ill, get run over by cars, be exposed to territorial fights? (Also, prevent the spread of communicable diseases by vaccinating your pets.)Animal shelters: The misconception that animal shelters take care of all unwanted pets. (Animal shelters are meant for sterilisation and housing injured animals. They dont have the infrastructure to house every abandoned pet.)Non-neutered pets: Presence of a new, non-neutered animal will create more puppies/kittens and add to the dog/cat overpopulation problem. (Neuter your pets.) When individual owners act irresponsibly and abandon their pets, we need to step in and help those animals.

 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Station project back on track
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The tracks have been cleared for the now-on-now-off Chitpur rail terminal, on the intervention of chief secretary Asok Gupta. Last week, Gupta held a meeting with Eastern Railway (ER) officials and state agencies and cleared the hurdles in implementing the project.																								The railway ministry cleared the Rs 106-crore project on the condition that the state government would build the infrastructure for passenger dispersal. The project ran into rough weather after the government expressed its inability to invest Rs 200 crore for building roads, bridges and other transport infrastructure for passengers to use the new station.																								The government demanded that the entire amount be borne by the railway, as it was a railway project. Rail officials, on the other hand, were reluctant to spend a paisa for building infrastructure, saying it was the responsibility of the state. Realising the importance of the project, chief secretary Gupta stepped in.																								I called up railway officials to review the status of the project. They told me to make the station operational by mid-2005. The state government will build the passenger dispersal system in a phased manner. We will improve the infrastructure gradually and the railways, too, will increase the number of trains from the new station in phases, Gupta explained.																								Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, during his trip to the city on Wednesday, asked ER officials to implement the project in coordination with the state government. He discussed the status of the project with senior railway officials, who have set a March 2005 deadline to operate the new station. 																								We have already started work on the station building and laying of tracks and hope to meet the March 2005 deadline, said S.R. Thakur, chief operating manager, Eastern Railway.																								Initially, three or four long-distance trains will terminate at the new station. Raising the number of trains will be possible only after the infrastructure for passenger dispersal is increased, Thakur said.																								Initially, Canal East and Canal West roads will be used as the dispersal route for passengers. The stretch between BT Road and Beleghata will be widened and a small bridge built to reach the station. The HRBC and the CMDA will implement the project.																								Work for widening the roads has already started. We have to construct new roads, two flyovers and widen Canal South and Canal North roads to cope with the rush of passengers in future, said CMDA director of project planning Tushar Mitra.

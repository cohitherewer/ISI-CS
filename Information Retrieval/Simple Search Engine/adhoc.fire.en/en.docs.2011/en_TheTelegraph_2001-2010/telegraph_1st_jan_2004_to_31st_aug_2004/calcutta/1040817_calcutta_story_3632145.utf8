The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Clamour for kitchen secrets
				 	 Rita Bhimani and Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta with audience members at the chat session. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The Good Life Talk Show boarded the culinary caravan on Saturday evening as the guest of honour, restaurateur Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta shared recipes with readers of The Telegraph at the Bagbazar Library Hall. 																								More than 150 people, mostly housewives, braved the rain to add to their repertoire of recipes and have their gastronomic queries answered by the woman behind Kewpies. The show started off with moderator Rita Bhimani introducing Rakhi to the hall and throwing the house open to queries on cooking.																								And guess who popped the first question? Rita herself. I have always loved your Ilisher Dimer Tak. How do you make it? The highlight of Dasguptas recipe was the simplicity of the preparation. You can make it with any kind of eggs but it does go best with hilsa eggs. Fry them first, then fry mustard seeds, add green chillies, salt, sugar and tamarind water. Finally boil the eggs in this mixture.																								This set the ball rolling, with multiple queries on hilsa dishes. Dasgupta obliged by sharing with the audience popular recipes like Ilish Dum, Keema diye Ilish, Ilish Bhaate and Ilisher Pulao. The Keema diye Ilish was a revelation and pens in the audience went scribbling in top gear. 																								Take the whole hilsa and split it open. In a pan, prepare the keema separately with onions, ginger, garlic, mint and green chillies. Then stuff the hilsa with this keema mixture and bake it like paturi wrapped in banana leaves. Slice and serve.																								Hilsa was not the only item on the evening menu. Sutapa Rahas question on the most commonly used ingredient in Chinese cooking drew a serious reaction from the expert. I would advise you not to use ajinomoto (mono-sodium glucamate). It can have serious side effects. You can go for a different style of Chinese food by using five-spice powder in your recipes.																								Rakhi also passed on insightful cooking tips. She spoke on how it was easier to make potoler dolma by frying the potol first and then stuffing them with the mixture and not the other way round. 																								She spoke at length on proper usage of a microwave oven. Never use metal objects in a microwave oven. Even the metal rims of cups and dishes should be avoided. To make seekh kebabs, go for bamboo skewers only. 																								Debjani Poddar wanted to know about quick snacks that can be made in the evening for people at home and unexpected guests. Rakhi provided both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Cut cucumbers in circles and top with a mixture of finely chopped paneer, green chillies, salt and pepper. Put it in the refrigerator for some time and serve it cold. Or, take half a tin of tuna fish and mix it with three teaspoons of mayonnaise, mustard powder, tomato sauce and salt. Now make triangle-shaped toasts and spread the mixture on top and garnish with cucumbers or tomatoes.																								The master chef also learnt a thing or two from the audience. She invited Rekha Saha to share her recipes for Paneer Kofta Curry and Paneer Burger. Sonali wanted to know how to solve her kids tiffin blues. The speaker offered solutions in the form of mini pizzas and toasted sandwiches.																								In a pan add chopped onions and garlic to the oil and add sugar, tomato puree and Worcestershire sauce. Spread it over the small pizzas and then add capsicum and mushrooms for the vegetarian pizza and chicken or fish for the non-veggies.																								The evening culminated on a sweet note with an audience member Sraboni wanting to know Rakhis celebrated Bhapa Doi recipe. Beat up one tin of condensed milk with 500 grams of curd. Pour the mixture in a glass bowl and sprinkle powdered sugar on the top along with raisins and nuts. Bake this at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 25 minutes, uncovered. 																								As the crowd left the Bagbazar Hall, all sported wide smiles. Kitchens are bound to be busy these next few days...						PRATIM D. GUPTA

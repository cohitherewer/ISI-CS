The story of the lives of many brave women in our history can be a source of inspiration and constant encouragement to the modern woman. It is with this end in mind that EZCC presents the Assamese play, Veerangana, that tells us of the glorious but tragic tale of Mula Gabharu, who, after the death of her husband, a warrior in the Ahom army, fought bravely on the battlefield in defence of her motherland. A story of exceptional courage, valour, and self-sacrifice, it is also a stark example of the woman power. Produced by Purangana of Guwahati and directed by Gunakar Dev Goswami, this play makes an honest effort to revive Maati-Akhras (an integral part of Assams folk culture) by applying it in modern theatre as an expression.																								Event: Play in Assamese, Veerangana, produced by Purangana, Guwahati																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, Salt Lake

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Court rebuff for Rajnis probe 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An inquiry initiated by the West Bengal Medical Council against five doctors accused of negligence, leading to the death of budding cricketer Rajnis Patel at SSKM Hospital, received a setback after a city court rejected its petition, requesting that it be handed over the case documents by the police.																								Manoj Patel, Rajnis father, had asked the council to start a probe against the doctors, which it did, but failed to get hold of the case documents, since they are in the custody of the cops.																								Rajnis died in June last year in the orthopaedic ward of the hospital after five failed surgeries, mostly carried out by post- graduate trainees.																								The city police had initiated a separate probe and found evidence of medical negligence. The inquiry was completed and a chargesheet submitted recently against the five accused doctors. A few of them were also arrested but later released on bail.																								For the state, advocate N.K. Ghosh objected in court to giving any document to the council as the trial of the doctors was to start soon. This is a significant case and handing over documents would be unwise, Ghosh argued.

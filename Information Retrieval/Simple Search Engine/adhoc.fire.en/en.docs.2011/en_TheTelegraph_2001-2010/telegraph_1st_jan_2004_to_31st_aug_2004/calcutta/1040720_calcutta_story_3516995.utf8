 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Three freed in missing girl case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh on Monday came down heavily on the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for illegally detaining three of the four accused in the Sushmita Dhar case.																								The MA student of Jadavpur University had gone missing while on a holiday at Chandipur with seven other people in 1995. The government ordered the case reopened after her parents met the home secretary last month.																								In its order, the court said the CID had no authority to keep Debanjan Das, Rajib Chowdhury and Suparna Sengupta in custody even after the court had asked the investigating agency to release them immediately. The court had on July 17 directed the CID to free the three accused as they had already obtained anticipatory bail in the case.																								Counsel for the accused claimed a court inspector had gone to the CID office to submit the order, but the CID refused to accept it. 																								Sachin Banerjee, another accused, who had not obtained anticipatory bail earlier, was sent to judicial custody till August 2.

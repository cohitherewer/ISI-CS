 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Canal desilt boon for Salt Lake drainage
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government has taken up a project to desilt Keshtopur canal, that runs parallel to VIP Road. The canal starts from the northern end of the city, near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.																								Irrigation minister Amalendra Roy said on Thursday that the desilting drive will be conducted jointly by his department and the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco). More than 1,000 encroachers will be removed from the canal banks for the project, to be launched on Friday, according to irrigation department officials.																								We are working on the modalities to remove the illegal settlers, said H.K. Diwedi, district magistrate, North 24-Parganas.																								The project is part of the Comprehensive Drainage Scheme, with loan assistance from Hudco. According to officials, Keshtopur canal was last desilted in 1988. They said a drainage canal needs to be desilted every 10 to 15 years.																								The project includes excavation of the Bhangar Kata arm of the canal, that starts from Keshtopur and meanders to Bantala. The total stretch of the canal is around 39 km. Irrigation officials said work on the Bhangar Kata canal has already started.																								Hidco will carry out the desilting operations along the two-km-long Keshtopur canal, while the rest will be carried out by the irrigation department. 																								The desilting of Keshtopur canal will benefit residents of Salt Lake, as it is the townships main drainage canal. The residents had been complaining that the shallow and silted canal had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Work on Keshtopur canal has been a long-standing demand of Salt Lake residents. A number of memorandums have been submitted to the irrigation department on this, said Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. 																								Apart from Salt Lake, drainage at Lake Town, Bangur Avenue, Dum Dum Park and Keshtopur was severely affected last monsoon. So, said officials, if the canal is properly desilted, residents of these areas, too, will be spared the woes of waterlogging when the rains set in.

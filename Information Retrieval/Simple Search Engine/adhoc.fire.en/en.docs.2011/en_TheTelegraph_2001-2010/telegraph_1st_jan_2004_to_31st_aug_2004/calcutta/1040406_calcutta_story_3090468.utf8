 															- 12-year battle restores legitimacy to woman struck off staff rolls OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A schoolteacher on Monday won a long and lonely fight for legitimacy more than two decades after it had all begun.																								It was February 2, 1968, when Sunanda Chakladar joined Deshagourab Vidyamandir, in Narkeldanga, after the school managing committee approved of her appointment as teacher. But a decade later, things went horribly wrong, as the state education department adjudged her appointment bad in law and her name was struck off the rolls.																								To establish her claim as a permanent teacher, she embarked on a legal battle 12 years ago. Finally, on Monday, a division bench of Calcutta High Court held that the appointment of Sunanda Chakladar as a teacher of Deshagourab Vidyamandir of Narkeldanga, in Calcutta, was valid and asked the director of state education to treat her as a permanent teacher of the school.																								After the Left Front came to power in Bengal, Deshagourab, like many other schools in the state, was declared state-aided and the new pay-scale for teachers was fixed by the government. Surprisingly, Chakladars name had been struck off the school rolls, as the government found her appointment not proper.																								Saddled with a salary of Rs 150 (fixed by the school managing committee) and fed up of the harassment from state education department officials, Chakladar decided to seek legal redress. In 1992, she moved a petition in Calcutta High Court, challenging the decision of the state to declare her appointment illegal.																								After four years, the case came up for hearing. But Justice S.B. Sinha found  no merit in the matter and dismissed the petition. Chakladar appealed in a division bench of the same court in 1998.																								After a six-year wait, the appeal came up for hearing before the division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice P.K. Chatterjee. Advocate L.K. Pal argued before the bench that the state government had no right to declare the appointment of his client illegal, as there were no norms with regard to the appointment of schoolteachers in 1968.																								Last month, the division bench asked the director of school education to review the case. On March 19, the court passed a directive again, asking the official to consider the case. 																								With no response from the education department, the division bench on Monday directed the director of school education to approve and regularise Chakladars appointment to the post of permanent teacher.

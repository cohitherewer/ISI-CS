 crows and other scavenger birds scatter litter from a vat into the adjoining swimming pool. 
Pictures by Kishore Roy ChowdhuryRanjit Sengupta: Please tell us something about the swimming pool that was to come up near Selimpur.																																																													The swimming pool is ready but its a problem maintaining it. There is an open vat next to the pool. Crows and other birds pick up litter and scraps from the vat and drop them in the pool water. We have to clear the water regularly to keep the pool clean or else, it will become unfit for swimming.

 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 LifeStudy the strokesStrike a PoseAce make-up artiste Cory Walia chalks out a plan for those wanting to master the art of dolling up Make-up is a very specialised subject and someone aspiring to be a make-up artiste should have an aptitude for it. You should have some sort of aesthetic sense.No matter how much you strive, without an innate artistic ability you cannot become a successful make-up professional. If you have that artistic bent of mind and want to be in this profession, the thing to do is familiarise yourself with make-up as a medium, because it is very different from the other mediums of art.This can be done through constant observation and imitation. Keep browsing through magazines and books where you get to see various kinds of makeovers and just imitate them.Catch hold of anyone willing to get a makeover and practise repeatedly. If you cant get anyone else, practise on yourself  doesnt matter whether you are a man or a woman. It may sound ridiculous, but you have to do it. The other thing I would advise is to do a course  it really helps. It technically grounds you in the subject. But in India, we do not have too many good make-up courses.If you have the resources, it is best to go for a course in the UK or the US, where there are some really good programmes. But if you cant afford that, it is advisable to do a short diploma course from somewhere in India. What is even more effective is to assist an existing make-up artiste of some repute. In Calcutta, there are quite a few good ones like Prabir De and Aniruddha Chakladar. You can assist them if they give a chance.Even if assisting means carrying their bags and belongings, just go ahead and do that. For the amount you will learn by observing them, no course can teach you. Find ways of going to shoots with them and observing their techniques. Then try imitating them by doing the makeovers several times at home.Ask whoever you are assisting to watch you while you are doing a makeover and expect to be corrected and reprimanded. That way you will find out where you are going wrong. Assisting ace make-up artistes will also help you get a toehold in the glamour industry. Through them you will get to know the models, designers and other people related to the industry and that will help you ultimately when you are confident of doing the work on your own. You can gain that confidence only when your hand becomes fluent  your eyeliner flows straight and the eye-shadow blends so well that one cannot make out the lines.Fluency comes only with experience and there is no shortcut. Like any art, perfecting make-up is not an easy job.So, I would like to repeat that there is no alternative to constant practise.

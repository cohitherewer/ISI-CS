 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Armed goon arrested for extortion
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A notorious extortionist, Jhantu Bhagat, was netted on Saturday during an extensive hunt initiated by officials of the Entally police station. A loaded firearm and two rounds of cartridges were recovered from him.																								Bhagat had been at large since March 4 after he, along with two associates, looted two cellphones and Rs 5,000 at gunpoint from a businessmans office on Suresh Sarkar Road after the trader refused to give in to his demands.																								A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Entally police station, said Bhagat had managed to give lawmen the slip during previous raids. But this time fortune did not favour him. Sub-inspector P.K. Saha received a tip-off early on Saturday that Bhagat had returned and was planning another extortion, he said.																								Accordingly, a police team laid a trap for him on Middle Road. Dressed in plain clothes, we pretended to be commuters waiting for a bus. The moment Bhagat was spotted, we surrounded him and managed to pin him down, added Majumdar.																								Bhagat has been booked for dacoity and extortion.

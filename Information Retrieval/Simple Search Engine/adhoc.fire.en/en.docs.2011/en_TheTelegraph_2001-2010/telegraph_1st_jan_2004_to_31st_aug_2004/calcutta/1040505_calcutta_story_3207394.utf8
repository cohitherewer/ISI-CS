 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 CID raids net trio of suspected ISI agents
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two suspected Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) agents were arrested during raids by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in the city and districts in the past 24 hours. Later, acting on a tip-off from the CID in Bengal, the Delhi police conducted a raid and arrested a third agent.																								One of the three, a Bangladeshi, was rounded up from a guest house on Free School Street. The other two, including the Delhi arrest, are Indian citizens. The CID said the trio had been in hiding for several years.																								The first arrest took place on Monday night, when a CID team raided the Free School Street guest house and picked up Md Ali Ratan, who was supposed to hand over Rs 25,000 to another contact, known as Md Majirul Haque, to ensure him a safe passage to Pakistan via Bangladesh.																								The sleuths laid a trap near the guest house and when Ratan stepped out to make a call to his contact in Delhi, he was taken into custody. 																								We grilled him for several hours, during which he confessed that he was working for the ISI and was to contact Md Imran in Delhi, who would tell him about the payment and the next assignment, said additional director-general of police (CID) R.K. Mohanty.																								Ratan also told the CID about Imrans wherabouts. We immediately contacted the Delhi police and they rounded up Imran from his residence. He furnished a lot of details on the ISI network in Bengal and in Delhi, said a senior CID officer.																								Later, the CID team rushed to Rishra, in Hooghly district, where Mazirul Haque was arrested from an STD booth on Gandhi Sadak.																								We managed to catch him red-handed while he was making a call to a senior officer of the Pakistani army. He was giving him details about the troops and other army activities in Bengal and Bihar, the CID official said.																								Haque claimed he was a crime reporter of a Hindi daily in Bihar and that he held a B.Sc (honours) degree in chemistry. We are verifying his claims, said sub-divisional police officer (Serampore) Shankha Suvro Chakraborty.

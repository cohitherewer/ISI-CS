 KOEL MULLICK This IIIrd-year psychology student  of Gokhale Memorial College has her fingers crossed for  an action-packed 2004 balancing books and the big-screen  on her trek to stardom. In Shudhu Tumi, which goes on the  floors this week, Koel is cast opposite Prosenjit. After  a three-month shoot for her third film, it will be studies,  and only studies, as the pretty daughter of actor Ranjit  Mullick sits for her BA finals. Then, a comeback to face  the cameras. I want to do only sensible and quality  films, says Koel. Arnab Chakraborty Jatin-Lalit, Himesh Reshammiya,  Nikhil-Vinay a few of the music-makers hes  all set to sing for in 2004, after being Akshay Kumars  voice in Khakee (Wada raha), which hits the halls this month.  The 26-year-olds next target is A.R. Rahman. I  aim for my own album, too, adds the Salt Lake boy. ASHIM BISWAS Setting a goal and getting it  is not something one associates with footballers in this  part of the world. But one talent with eyes strictly on  the goal is 21-year-old Ashim. This son of a former minibus  conductor has moved from Tollygunge Agragami to Mohun Bagan  to Team India in a hurry, with a stunning strike on national  debut to boot. JAYASHREE CHAKRAVARTY Her 8-ft-by-32-ft paperwork recently  became part of the permanent collection of the Asian Art  Museum of San Francisco. She also participated in the prestigious  Madrids Arco art fair last February. This has  inspired me to experiment with paper on a larger scale,  says Jayashree.
 DOYEL BASU The Class-XII student is the face  on stage to look out for. Having made a silent impact as  the six-year-old deaf-mute Helen Keller in Janmodin a few  summers ago, she now plays the 22-year-old heroine in Sundar.  Her most ardent admirer is grandfather Jyoti Basu. After  Janmodin, he just wants to see me talk on stage, laughs  Doyel.

 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Citu forces club closure
 PRONAB MONDAL 				 	 The front gate of Ordnance Club shut. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Citu, CPMs labour arm, has forced the management to shut a city club. 																								The 200-year-old Ordnance Club, on Clyde Row, controlled by the Army Ordnance Corps, has a member list of 4,000, including a large number of army and IPS officers. It has been shut since August 2, thanks to Citus resistance to the club authorities changing their catering agency. Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said he would look into the matter.																								After failing to bag the clubs contract again this year  awarded to another company that quoted the lowest in an open tender  employees of catering agency Food World, along with club staff members launched an agitation under the Citu banner. 																								They demanded that the new agency, Fancy Catering Services, absorb all Food World employees, and then refused to vacate the club premises, though Food Worlds agreement with the club management expired on June 31.																								On Monday, the main entrance to the club was locked, with Food World and club employees camping on a makeshift stage in front. 																								Red flags were tied to the iron bars in front of the main gate and posters levelling charges against club president Colonel M.K. Choudhury were put up, demanding an explanation for inviting a new catering agency.																								Trouble started brewing from the first week of June when Choudhury, who had joined as president six months ago, floated the tender. Food World failed to quote the lowest rate. Fancy Catering Services did and was selected to serve the club. 																								Soon afterwards, the Citu-affiliated union swung into action. Nearly 70 staff members of the club and 17 Food World employees launched an agitation and accused the management of favouritism. 																								But, realising they would not be able to prove the charge, they demanded that Food World employees be absorbed by the new agency.																								The tender was an eyewash. We are protesting the managements malpractice for the past few months. We demand absorption of the 17 Food World employees by Fancy Catering, said Ujjwal Majumdar, assistant secretary of the Citu union at the club. 																								Fancy Catering owner Rabinder Singh is not against inducting the 17 employees, but negotiations with the union have suddenly stopped.

 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Swiftly to safety: railway adopts the SMS
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								From the spot of an accident to the divisional control room and onward to the central control room  itll take much less time now for the news of a railway disaster to travel. Officials have woken up to an innovative use of the short messaging system (SMS) through cell phones.																								A few days ago, South Eastern Railway (SER) officials at their Garden Reach headquarters had received an SMS about an accident in the Chakradharpur division. On inquiry, they found out that it was a mock mishap. We found this system of passing on news very convenient and swift, an SER official said. 																								On Wednesday, the city was swept with the news of a mock train disaster near Kharagpur. We used the SMS mode of communication here too, an official said. 																								R.R. Bhandari, SERs general manager, said: We aim to improve our communication system and bring down the response time in sending rescue and relief teams to mishap sites. The first hour after an accident is very crucial: 75 per cent of the victims can be saved if things move fast in that period. 																								SER has also drawn up extensive safety management plans, especially for the ongoing monsoon.																								A safety fund of Rs 103 crore is being used for repairing the tracks and bridges, and upgrading the signal and telecom systems. 																								We have to put special stress on safety during monsoon, the toughest time, said Bhandari. Nearly 400 km of tracks will be renewed at a cost of Rs 37 crore. Eighteen major bridges will be repaired, for which Rs 19.2 crore has been allotted. For signal and telecom repairs, Rs 19.2 crore will be spent. 																								These apart, three mock tests  in Adra, Chakradharpur and Kharagpur divisions  on bridge collapse, fire mishaps and collisions will be held. We have intensified these mock tests. They help us prepare for any kind of eventuality, general manager Bhandari said. 																								The authorities have also stepped up inspection visits, with Bhandari himself carrying out eight inspections in the first three months of his assuming office. 																								Last weeks mock fire mishap at SERs headquarters in Garden Reach was part of the effort to implement the report of the Disaster Management Committee. Around 4,000 SER employees were evacuated from two buildings after a false fire alarm was buzzed. Some faults were detected. These have to be to be rectified, Bhandari said. 																								In most rooms, he said, the rescue personnel didnt switch off the lights, fans and the air-conditioners before evacuating the employees. I found some people inside the toilet after the fire alarm was sounded, he added. Such mock drills will be conducted regularly.

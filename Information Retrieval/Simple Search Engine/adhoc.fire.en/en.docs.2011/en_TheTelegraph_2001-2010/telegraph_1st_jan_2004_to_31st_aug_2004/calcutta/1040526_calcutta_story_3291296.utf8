 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Tinderbox owners in crime case
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A criminal case has been started against Arup and Swarup Bose, owners of Orient Decorators, at 93, Simla Street, where a fire broke out around 7 pm on Monday. Preliminary investigations revealed that the warehouses, in a congested locality, were unlicensed, police said on Tuesday.																								Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh said: A criminal case has been started against the brothers Bose for criminal negligence and stocking combustible material.																								Fire-fighters were still spraying water on the embers of the buildings at Simla Street when fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee visited the spot on Tuesday afternoon. Chatterjee stated a major calamity had been averted, since the damage to property and lives would have been greater had the fire not been contained to the block.																								The warehouses had stocks of paper, cloth, paint, plywood and other highly-combustible material, and it has been discovered that residents on the premises had been using a kerosene stove, the minister said. Had the power line not been snapped, the fire would have spread to an adjacent hosiery, he added. 																								The owners of the premises will have to bear all the expenses incurred by the fire brigade, since the warehouses were commercial units, but without valid documents, Chatterjee said.																								There has been a lapse of responsibility on the part of both the local residents and the government agencies, Chatterjee said, explaining that such warehouses should not be allowed within congested residential localities. The neighbourhood, however, claimed that letters had been sent to the relevant authorities at Writers Buildings and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

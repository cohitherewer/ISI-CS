 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Govt doubts court right to ban car tax
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Confrontation appears to be the course ahead for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on the contentious matter of vehicular taxes.																								The collection of a lifetime tax from two-wheelers and five-year tax from four-wheelers had recently been set aside by a single bench of Calcutta High Court.																								The governments mood on the matter seems to be captured in a petition the state transport department has filed as an appeal before a division bench, challenging the order of the trial court staying the government notifications.																								On March 26, Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya held that owners of cars and two-wheelers in Bengal need not pay the five-year tax or the lifetime tax. He had also stated that those who had already paid would get a refund, with interest.																								The judge directed the government to refund the money already collected as taxes and penalties (for not paying the tax on time) within two months, with interest calculated at the rate followed by the State Bank of India.																								The order of the court has put the government under severe strain, as it has already collected a huge amount of taxes. The prospect of coughing up the refund, with interest, said sources, had prompted the government to go on the offensive.																								Legal experts said on Sunday that the government appeared keen to question the legal validity of the order.																								Advocate-general Balai Ray will argue the case on behalf of the government before Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee.																								If the affidavit is an indicator, the government, during the hearing of the case next week, will challenge the jurisdiction of a court in dealing with an act passed by the peoples representatives in a state legislature.																								The transport department has assumed the position that the judiciary has no authority to set aside such an act and that it is within its rights to collect revenue on the basis of a law enacted or amended by the legislature.																								According to the petition, the matter is completely administrative in nature and so, the judiciary has no right to intervene in its working.																								The notifications were gazetted in November 2003, asking vehicle-owners to pay the revised taxes by December 31. The notifications were issued after two separate pieces of legislation were passed by the state Assembly in this regard.																								So, the judiciary cannot strike down the decision taken by the peoples representatives on the floor of the Assembly, the affidavit states.

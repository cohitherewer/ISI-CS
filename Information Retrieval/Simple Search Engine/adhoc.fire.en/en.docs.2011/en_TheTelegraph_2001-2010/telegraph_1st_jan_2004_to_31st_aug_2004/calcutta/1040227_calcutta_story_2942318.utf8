 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Charges inked in bullet haul
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The city police on Thursday filed a chargesheet against seven persons arrested in connection with the haul of 25,000 rounds of AK-47 ammunition from a parking lot in the port area. 																								The detective department, investigating the case, had to release four others because no evidence was found against them.																								The seven accused, four of them from Meghalaya, were booked on several charges, including waging a war against the state and criminal conspiracy.																								A truck loaded with the ammunition was found in the Dhobitala parking lot, in the port area, on September 29. The cartridges were concealed in the ceiling of the drivers cabin. Sleuths on the job came to know that the consignment was being sent for a terrorist outfit and the truck was on its way to Jammu and Kashmir.																								The police found the truck almost a month after it reached the city. The city-based operative of the gang was waiting for a another vehicle to shift the ammunition, which was why it had to wait for a month, said an official of detective department.																								Sleuths netted footballer Syed Abid Imam from his Malda house. Imam was the Calcutta-based operative and he received the ammunition. The truck was taken to the parking lot on his orders, said a sleuth. Later, two of Imams associates, S. Ali and Sheikh Imam, were arrested.																								Imams interrogation netted four others  Karsten Momin, Sirush Momin, Farukh Mohammad and M. Hussain, who were assigned to send the consignment from Assam to Calcutta.

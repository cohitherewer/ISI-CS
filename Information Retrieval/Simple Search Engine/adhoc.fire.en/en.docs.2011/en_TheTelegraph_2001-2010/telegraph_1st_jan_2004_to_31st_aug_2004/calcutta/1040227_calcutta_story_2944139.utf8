 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Power cheque across counter
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The CESC will introduce from March 1 bill payment facilities by cheque at six offices, where receipts will be handed over immediately across the counter. 																								This facility for payment of power bills by cheque will be extended to all CESC cash offices in 36 locations from April 2. 																								Initially, cheques will be received at the cash offices at Magnet House (on CR Avenue), the north regional office on APC Road, the north suburban regional office on BT Road at Kamarhati, the south regional office at Mandeville Gardens, the south-west regional office at Taratala and the Howrah regional office on GT Road (North). 																								Samiran Ghosh, CESC deputy general manager (treasury), said currently, about two million bills are sent out every month by the power utility. Of these, approximately 19 lakh payments are made in cash. Only a handful of people use the cheque facility, by which receipts are couriered to consumers on clearance, he said. He confirmed that this facility will also remain available, so those who prefer to drop a cheque can do so as usual. 																								The CESC has issued guidelines for payment by cheque: Ghosh hinted that the CESC was considering a bouquet of new facilities for consumers, including the advantage of paying bills at weekends and in the evening. There may be a green channel bill payment facility, too, for the handicapped, senior citizens and housewives.

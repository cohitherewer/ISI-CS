 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Failed youth passes after suing varsity
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								An unsuccessful student of BA Part I, 2003, was declared passed by Calcutta University after he moved court. He scored 21 out of 50 in a subject, in which he was initially given two by the examination authority. 																								Justice Indira Bannerjee of the high court, on receiving the revised mark, asked the university authorities to pay a fine of Rs 1,700 to the petitioner-student as legal costs.																								Anadi Das, the student, obtained two marks in Bengali out of 50 in a compulsory language. In the other part of the subject, he scored 20 out of 50 in English. He was asked by the university authorities to take a compartmental examination in Bengali.																								Instead of appearing for the compartmental exam, the student moved a petition in Calcutta High Court, demanding an order asking the authorities to produce his Bengali answer-script. 																								Justice Indira Bannerjee directed the university to make a fresh review of the script. 																								After a few days, the university counsel told the court that there was a mistake on the universitys part. The university said the petitioner would be allowed to appear in the Part II examination, scheduled for 2004.

	Drug addiction and drinking habits are on the rise among youngsters. A reason for the trend may be a rise in the number of liquor shops in the vicinity of educational institutions, flouting a high court order. These are places where goons trade in drugs on the sly. NGOs and other welfare organisations should take up the cause and organise campaigns against these shops.

	It is compulsory to make a purchase at regular intervals to stop the ration card from lapsing. But the ration card is supposed to cater to the financially backward classes who cannot afford to buy even cereals and pulses at the market rate. Many ration shops in the city do not stock these essential items. So the poor are forced to buy notebooks, incense sticks and the like which they otherwise would not have purchased. When the government cant stock the ration shops properly with basic commodities, it should also withdraw the rule.

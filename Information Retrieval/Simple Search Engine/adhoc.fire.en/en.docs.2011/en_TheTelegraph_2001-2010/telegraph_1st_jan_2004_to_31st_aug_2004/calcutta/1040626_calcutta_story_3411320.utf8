 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Hooked on Hilsa 
 The spread at the Kewpies Hilsa festival. Picture by Rashbehari Das Food connoisseur Rita Bhimani on her recent trip to Kewpies for the Hilsa festival discovered 17 new facets of the silver catchThe Hilsa has no real clone Its attraction is hard to de-bone Its flavour divine 																								Is its way to entwine 																								And its paeans to ever intone 																								A gathering of gourmands at a piscean party is a sure way to ensure that the fare placed before them is tasted, tested, taunted and then impaled with hungry zeal. At Kewpies, the ushering in of the silver shad, the evanescent Ilish, was a chance for three friends to come together for an afternoon of discovering 17 new facets to the way it is cooked. 																								Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta, who is the presiding princess at the now 42-seater hangout , continues to surprise us with her innovations. At Kewpies Hilsa festival, which is only going to last until July 4, you would have to go in a large group to savour the seasons soft silver catch in its various new avatars. Fried and jholed and steamed are the classic confections. What you need to adventure into are the combining of raw mango and Ilish; another one in a mouleed form, the Ilish Deemer Ambol to give a tart ending to a meal and the Ilish Kantaar Chochori to begin the Ilish Ullhas Special Thala with, where steaming hot gobindobhog rice laced with ghee can be the counterpoint to the delicate moong dal and the mlange of veggies called chochori. The thali comes for Rs 275.																								The gourmets at my table tried the smoked Hilsa, the Ilish Keemar Dom , the Paturi, the Ilish Pulao and the Ilish Anaras. Gini Sen, advertising supremo, gave five on five to the Ilish Paturi , with its magnificent mustard coating. 																								Samta Gupta, food consultant and an adventurous professional chef, left her vegetarian moorings behind to unblanchingly give her opinion on the varied spread. The Smoked Hilsa got top marks from herit couldnt have been more perfect and thankfully avoided the tomatoed overlay that some restaurants seem to have conferred upon it. Instead, there was a discreet caramelised anchovy sauce that you could dip the delicate de-boned smoked pieces in to give it a distinct character. 																								The new dish on the block  the Ilish Keemar Dom  did not find favour with all around, who gave it the diplomatic adjective interesting. The original East Bengali recipe has been dug out of one of the first books on Bengali cuisine written in English way back when chataks were the units of measure. It calls for a whole fish to be stuffed with finely minced meat and slathered with sorshey when it is presented at the table. Rakhis rendering is a set of filleted Ilish layered with minced meat and served with kasundi. 																								It is truly worth a try for its robust flavour where the spicy meat blends with the tender buttery flesh of the Ilish . But even as we ended with the clever ambol, all of us dug into what is otherwise standard homely fare  the jhinge-aloo-posto, which was done to delicate perfection, a dish that can only come right with a homemakers touch. 																								 The a la carte option ranges from Rs 45 to 90 per Ilish dish.

	It takes anywhere between an hour to three hours to receive a Bengali book at the National Library. The prolonged requisition process upsets the readers schedule for the day. A staff member told me the delay was because Bengali books are stocked in a separate building. After the requisition slip is deposited, the book has to be fetched from that building. Can the delay be cut? Rabindra Nath Kar, 
Sankar Ghosh Lane. 
	The subway at the Bidhannagar railway station has just been opened for public use and it is waterlogged from the very outset. An imperfect construction has been declared open for public use. Sunil Banerjee, 
VIP Road.

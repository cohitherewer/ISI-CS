The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 New address for Max Mueller book collection
 ANJA DAMM				 	 A reading session at Seagull Bookstore. The books will move into its arts foundation nearby																								Until a few months ago, it was a bookworms haven. But now, its just a dark room. The glass doors, which used to beckon invitingly at one time, are now locked. Inside, there are stacks of boxes filled with books and magazines lying forlornly around. Clearly, its time to move. One of Calcuttas intellectual hotbeds, the Max Muller Bhavan library (MMB), is ready to say goodbye. 																								Since the end of last year, the news that MMB libraries in Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai and Bangalore were to become info-points was doing the rounds. The charter of the blueprint came from the mother-body, Goethe-Institut, Munich: the rich collection of books  German, English and Hindi would have to go to other Indian organisations or to the MMB library in New Delhi. The info-points would act merely as digital resource centres, where users could log in and order books from the Delhi centre if they wanted to. Though Martin Waelde, the director of MMB, Calcutta, was optimistic that local users wouldnt be hemmed in by the new system, readers were hugely unhappy. The good news is Calcutta MMB has finally come up with a solution  the only one in the country to have done so  and the precious books are not leaving the city. We have found a partner in Calcutta interested in our collection, says Waelde.																								Negotiations are now over and the partner has been named: Seagull Bookstore, on SP Mukherjee Road in south Calcutta, is going to house those 8,000-plus books, music CDs, cassettes and magazines. Although right now the first floor of the Seagull office is stacked with its own books and volumes, once the MMB books come in, these will be removed. Seagull Foundation for the Arts has had a long association with MMB, explains Naveen Kishore, the managing trustee. So when we discussed the closing of the library some months back, I felt a strong impulse to do something. Both the MMB and Seagull will remain autonomous. 																								New reader-friendly plans are on the anvil. With a library membership card, one will be entitled to discounts on books in the store. Newsletters will keep the members posted about cultural events at both the centres. The move will start after the Calcutta Book Fair at the end of January. We have two tough months before us to tidy up and change, smiles Megha Malhotra, one of the directors responsible for ensuring a smooth shift. After the move, her office will get sidelined into a little space in the hall. The rest will be reserved for the MMB library, which should be ready by March.

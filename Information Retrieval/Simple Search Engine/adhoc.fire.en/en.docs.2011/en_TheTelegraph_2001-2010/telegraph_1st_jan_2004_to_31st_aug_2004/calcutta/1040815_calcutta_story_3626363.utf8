Pictures by Rashbehari Das 																								 Chilled-out Calcutta has yet another chill-out zone. This time around, the affair is private (as was the launch), with space enough for just 30 of your closest people to get together and jam. 																								Its The Platinum Lounge adjacent to the hookah bar Shisha that we are talking about. And if you were not invited to the launch of this plush place on Thursday night, then you need to brush up your social image. 																								The guest list of about 300-odd party people ranged from the Mumbai model and actor Aryan Vaid, to resident industrialist Sanjay Budhia, a bunch of pretty faces from the Bengali beam on telly (among them Chandreyee and Deboleena) and of course the whole gang of models and regular night-outers. 																								The Platinum Lounge has, besides the usual bar and plasma television sets, an open kitchen with a range of cuisine on offer. 																								With Jack Daniel flowing free and Smirnoff being offered in interesting flavours of peach and cranberry, the fun began from the word go. Resident DJ Girish stuck to the light lounge numbers playing an occasional Karunesh track to turn up the heat. 																								Prawns wrapped in lemony coriander leaf paste and soft mutton kebabs made for the perfect snack, while grape and jasmine-flavoured hookah filled up the senses. 																								Long past the midnight hour, guests remained oblivious that they had work to go back to the next day. The Platinum party rolled well into Friday the 13th. Kangaroo call																								 Polo Club, the pub at the HHI, seems to be going global these days. While it was high on Hawaii sometime back, this week it had some thunder from Down Under in store for night birds. The club hosted Kangaroo Nites from Thursday through Saturday, a festival offering a taste of all things Australian.																								There were special cocktails to quench your thirst like Sweet Zone (a blend of Dramboi, Tequila and Australian dry whisky) and Kangaroo Hunt (Australian white wine and berries). The sippers were kept happy with yummy Australian sausages on the house that came with the cocktails. 																								The music scene, however, gave the Australian theme a miss and the regular Filipino band Lillipop played its usual numbers. For the sporty kind, there were Australian games galore to keep them busy. 																								If you are wondering why the kangaroo was missing from the whole affair, let us tell you that there was an animal outfit imported from Australia, which one could don to get a fancy dress feel.Himika Chaudhuri and Zeeshan Jawed

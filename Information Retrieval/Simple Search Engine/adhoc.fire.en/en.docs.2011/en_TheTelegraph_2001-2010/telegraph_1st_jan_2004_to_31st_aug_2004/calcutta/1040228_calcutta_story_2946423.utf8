The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Station swindle, duress dirge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Passengers reaching Howrah station on Thursday night fell victim to the tug-of-war between cops and cabbies. Most taxi operators decided to protest police pressure to toe the line by steering clear of the station.																								Instead, the vehicles parked themselves on Foreshore Road, at a mocking distance from late-night entrants into the city.																								At around 11 pm, about 150 taxi drivers started raising slogans against police atrocities outside the main exit of the station. Then, they moved to Foreshore Road.																								Their grievance  the government railway police (GRP) had started checking taxis and preventing them from fleecing passengers. The rail police even declared that from March 3, all taxis plying from the station must go by the meter or the pre-paid rate.																								This followed a campaign in Metro highlighting the plight of late-night commuters at Howrah. Once the pre-paid counters closed, taxi drivers and touts would victimise passengers. For example, those headed for Gariahat are known to have coughed up Rs 600 under pressure.																								On Thursday, passengers disembarking from the Down 210 Darbhanga Passenger at 11.25 pm were left stranded, with hardly any taxis in sight.																								A section of taxi operators at the stations pre-paid taxi counter joined in the protest against police personnel who, they alleged, were a part of the late-night extortion racket till the recent crackdown.																								If police thought they could suddenly present a clean face to the public in this manner, the harassment is only beginning, warned a driver.																								Throughout Friday, representatives of the state police and the GRP met Hooghly Jalapath Paribahan Limited chairman Lagan Deo Singh, discussing how best to avert the stand-off.																								Singh said his organisation, which runs the pre-paid booths, did not support the agitating taxi drivers, and that he would speak to the Howrah superintendent of railway police, Sunil Kumar Mallick, on March 3 to devise a solution.																								The GRP traffic inspector, meanwhile, announced that from Friday, taxis running by the meter would operate from a separate lane reserved for them in front of the new complex of the station.

 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 The call of duty
																								Why do men fight? Whom do they fight and who is it that stands defeated at the end of it? These are the questions that plague the mind of a father whose only son is at war. Bappaditya Chattopadhyays Aahaban  The Call explores the torment that rages through the fathers mind as he tries to come to terms with his sons vocation as a soldier who fights his fellow human beings in the name of duty and honour. He refuses to validate a war among men. He believes that there are more serious issues that need to be confronted than a human war. It is from diseases like AIDS and cancer and natural disasters like floods and earthquakes and epidemics that mankind needs protection; he cannot fathom why man needs to fear his brothers. As the father waits for his son to return home we are taken on a journey through the mental anguish and severe desolation that he suffers. The film also removes the veil of hypocrisy from the face of society to show that violence has spread its tentacles deep into the heart of our civilisation. 																								Event: Screening of Aahaban  The Call, directed by Bappaditya Chattopadhyay																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Gorky Sadan

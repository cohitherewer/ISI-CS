The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 09, 2004 Hilsa new and old 
 The hilsa spread at Sonargaon. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 Sonargaon, the Bengali speciality restaurant at Taj Bengal, is high on hilsa these days. A month-long hilsa festival that took off on Wednesday afternoon boasts of the essentially Bengali to the absolutely exotic ilish dishes. 																								The fish that Calcutta loves and lives on has been dished out in various mouth-watering avatars by executive chef Surinder Singh and his team. 																								The Ilish Pulao, cooked with pieces of the fish in rice flavoured with mustard and green chilli pickle, is a must try for those with a spicy palate. The fried food freaks should not miss the Ilish Bhaja, the traditional crispy fried fish seasoned with salt and cumin powder and deep fried in mustard oil. The eternal favourites, Ilish Bhapa and Sorshe Bata Ilish taste just like they do in moms kitchen. 																								A light meal could mean relishing a bowl of Ilish Jhol with steamed rice, while those with a liking for the sweet and sour could savour the Ilish Tok Jhaal. Some improvisations have come in the form of the Ilish Korma, which is probably better suited for the rohu, and the Smoked Hilsa that, though flavoured in black pepper, is not spicy and thankfully boneless. The Ilish Pulao has been priced at Rs 375 per plate that can serve three people. The Smoked Hilsa, a must try for those with a taste for the continental, comes for Rs 445. The other dishes have been priced at Rs 415 for a helping that would typically serve two people. Starry bites																								 The new menu at Starstruck, the film theme restaurant at Forum, could well leave you dumbstruck. With 40 new inclusions in the continental, Indian and Chinese sections, the eatery right now offers more than a foodie can bargain for. The guest feedback since last September, when the place was launched, has helped us frame the new menu, says Bunty Sethi, owner, Starstruck. 																								The number of items in the Indian category, which was initially a small part of the menu, has been increased on popular demand. 																								Also, the names of films or film stars that were used to christen the dishes have given way to more straight-jacket names to help guests find their favourite items. So, what was previously called Enter the Dragon Swasdee Prawns has now being cut short to Swasdee Prawns. 																								While some of the old favourites like the Mongolian Hot Pot, Kung Pao Chicken and Braised Tofu with Peppers have been retained on the menu, the Mongolian Desert Lamb and the Chicken Jade Soup are among the new additions. 																								The Mongolian Hot Pot is a very popular dish in which the guests order the ingredients as per their choice, explains Sethi. The Thai-style Stir Fried Prawn, which is also a new entry, is already a hit with the guests, he added. 																								The Indian section has some interesting new entrants like the Khatta Meetha Seekh Kebab in the vegetarian section and the Chapli Kebab in the non-vegetarian half.						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Drama of life, with a little help from friends
 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 WAY TO GO! Imogen Butler-Cole with participants of her drama workshop at Kalighat. Picture by Pabitra Das																								She was a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, in London, with a budding career in the West End. But the 27-year-old gave it up to travel around the world and conduct workshops with young people from under-privileged backgrounds. 																								And Imogen Butler-Cole hasnt regretted it since. The young woman from Devon doesnt see her self-set goal as a challenge, but rather as her calling.																								And after a month-long workshop in Calcutta, with the NGO Diksha, which works among children in the red-light area of Kalighat, Imogen says shes found the one place where shed like to be based  Calcutta. 																								It has been absolutely wonderful, and I plan to stay here for about six months, doing more such projects, she smiles.																								But thats after taking time out to visit her home and family. I havent been back to the UK in a year! I really miss it, and Im going home for a while. But I hope to be back in time for the Pujas. 																								This time, Imogen plans to put a camera in their hands, and let the children tell their stories.																								The concept of child trafficking was thought up by the youngsters themselves, and a play, Paachar, was put together by them, too. Me and a few others just chipped in to guide them. And although I have only learnt a few words and phrases in Bengali, I had help from the other volunteers in translation. After three-and-a-half months in Calcutta, I love it here, because everyones so warm, she adds.																								Children and adults from the area stood in a small room in Kalighat High School and watched as the kids got across their message. It wasnt easy, especially with some of the smaller children not really knowing what paachar (trafficking) means. But when we explained, they understood, says Mrityunjoy, one of the older members of Diksha. In fact, the story is a combination of real-life incidents that happened to us.																								Paramita Banerjee, one of the founders of Diksha, says she was moved by the childrens performance, although the kids are adept at street plays  its their medium of communication. It is the first thing they have done on their own, and its gone off well.																								Imogen, who in the past year has travelled from New York to Brazil, New Zealand to Thailand, doing theatre and acting workshops and learning languages, says she was overwhelmed by the experience. 																								I want to build an international theatre company, with youngsters from around the world. Conventional theatre is not my thing, she smiles.																								At the moment, shes working with a Delhi theatre company, which is taking its production to London later this year. But when Imogen returns, shes got a bagful of projects lined up, including some with NGOs Saathi and Seagull. But I need to go home first, she signs off.

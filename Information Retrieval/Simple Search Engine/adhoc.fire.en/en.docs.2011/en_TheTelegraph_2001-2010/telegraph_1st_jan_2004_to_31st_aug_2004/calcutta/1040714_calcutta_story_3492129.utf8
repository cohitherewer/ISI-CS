 															- Birla bestowal leaves family, friends and employees in shock A STAFF REPORTER																								Budget gave way to bequeath, and succession-drama suspense scored over the Sensex on Tuesday. The citys business fraternity just couldnt stop talking about the Rs 5,000-crore legacy tangle involving India Incs first family, the Birlas.																								From Lyons Range to Lansdowne Road and Burrabazar to Belvedere Road, the talking point was the landmark will of Priyamvada Birla, opened on Monday. The will bequeaths the late Madhav Prasad (MP) Birla groups assets to city-based chartered accountant and family loyalist R. S. Lodha.																								Though everyone knew that Lodhaji was managing the groups activities since the death of babu (M.P. Birla), no one thought that an outsider would get all the assets of this empire, said an employee with the Birlas for the past 30 years. M.P. Birla, son of Rameshwar Das Birla, and wife Priyamvada had no children.																								By evening when word filtered out that the Birlas were taking legal recourse against the will that had left the family in a state of shock, the family and its flock had closed ranks. The classic battlelines of business ownership were reaffirmed, as the Birla Building voices that were hushed in the morning grew belligerent.																								The Lodhas are professional people. They dont have any right to aspire to the ownership of the Birla Group of companies. The wealth must not, and will not, go out of the family, said an old-timer at 9/1, RN Mukherjee Road.																								The day began with speculation about the whys  of a Birla throwing open the family doors to an outsider  and the whats  ownership of the six cement plants, two jute mills, several cable companies and dozens of educational institutions and hospitals.																								The ownership issue is not clear in the Birla companies, as there are significant cross-holdings. The companies are separate entities only in terms of management control. So, I dont know how she could pass on the assets, which were not her own, observed a senior officer of a Birla Group company.																								Away from the boardroom  and the courtroom  the picture of Priyamvada Birla that emerged was one of a lonely old lady laying store by a man who had earned her trust, professionally and personally. She wanted Yash, her grand-nephew, to shift base to Calcutta, which never happened The Lodhas always stood by her and his inheriting at least a substantial amount of the assets was clearly on the cards, said a friend of the family.

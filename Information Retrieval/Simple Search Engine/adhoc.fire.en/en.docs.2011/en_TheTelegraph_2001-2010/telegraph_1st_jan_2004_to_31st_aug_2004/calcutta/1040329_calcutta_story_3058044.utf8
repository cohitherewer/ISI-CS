The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 29, 2004 Swimmers eye pool of world standards
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Indian Life-Saving Society (ILSS) on Sunday unveiled plans to set up an international-standard swimming pool, with 50-metre tracks, at the Dhakuria Lakes.																								ILSS director Sriranjan Sinha said the club proposal will be submitted to sports minister Subhas Chakraborty within a week.																								In south Calcutta, we do not have an international-standard swimming pool. But this required for swimmers who want to take part in national-level competitions. They need such a pool to hone their skills. We will meet the sports minister and seek his help in this regard, said Sinha.																								The ILSS (also known as Anderson Club) has a 50-metre track in the natural waters of Rabindra Sarobar.																								What we need is an international-standard swimming pool, with 50-metre tracks. There are certain specifications that must be adhered to for professional swimming training and expertise, he added. The project will cost around Rs 1 crore.																								During the day, ILSS felicitated over 50 national-level and state-level swimmers. Nafisa Ali was among those felicitated. Also, 25 water polo players were honoured at the function. 																								CPM legislator from Ballygunge Rabin Deb handed over the trophies.																								The ILSS said its aim was to produce more national-level swimmers and thereby, improve the quality of swimming in the state. Legislator Deb advocated swimming as a major fitness tool. Participation in swimming competitions must be spontaneous. Winning or losing should not guide the competitors, he said. 																								Shantonu Majumdar, ILSS general secretary, said programmes like Sundays would inspire the next generation. 																								Newcomers will get a unique opportunity to sharpen their skills in swimming from the stalwarts, which will help them improve their technique, he elaborated.

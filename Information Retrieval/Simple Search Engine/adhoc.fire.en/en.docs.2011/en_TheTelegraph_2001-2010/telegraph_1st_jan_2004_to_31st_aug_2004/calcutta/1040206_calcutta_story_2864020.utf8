 Friday, February 06, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Natalie Cole, singer.You  are charming and pleasant, with a love for all things beautiful  and artistic. You prefer to splurge, rather than save. You  are a family person, helpful and positive. In life, you  will be thrown amongst hysterical, excitable and insane  people. Your colours are blue and red. Avoid yellow.  Kusum  Bhandari

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Court orders marksheet fail change 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed Calcutta University (CU) to issue a fresh marksheet to a student who had appeared for the M.Sc (computer and information technology) examination last year.																								The court also ordered that the failed on the students marksheet be changed to passed.																								Following his failure, Abhisekh Banerjee had met the departmental heads of the university, who explained that the inability to score 40 per cent in a particular theoretical paper had cost him a place in the passed list.																								Abhisekh then moved a writ petition in the high court, challenging the universitys decision. His legal counsel, Uttam Majumdar, cited Rule VIII of a CU regulation stating that it was not mandatory for a candidate to score 40 per cent marks in every paper as long as he managed an aggregate of 40 per cent in theory and 50 per cent in practicals.																								Abhishekh had the required aggregate and, so, the university authorities had no grounds to fail the examinee.																								Representing CU, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya argued that a candidate appearing for a post-graduate examination needed 40 per cent in each subject in order to be given the degree.																								After hearing both sides, Justice Indira Banerjee observed that Abhisekh should be declared a passed candidate. 																								The high court judge went on to order the university authorities to issue a fresh marsksheet within a fortnight.																								According to lawyers, this order could set a precedent in several other examination-related cases.

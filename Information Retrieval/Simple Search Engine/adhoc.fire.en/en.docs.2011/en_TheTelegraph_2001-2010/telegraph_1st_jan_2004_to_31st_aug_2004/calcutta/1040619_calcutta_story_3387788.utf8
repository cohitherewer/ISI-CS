	Even a decade ago, north Calcutta boasted of plenty of roadside trees. But the widening of roads has taken its toll. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) carries out tree plantation drives in summer and winter when the plants die for want of water. The start of the rainy season is the best time when saplings should be planted. By the time the monsoon ends, the plants would grow enough to draw nutrients and water from the soil itself. The CMC should address this issue.

	Nowadays company deposits are no longer safe to invest in. Many people, therefore, rely on the various saving schemes that post offices offer. The staff at small post offices find it difficult to handle the rush of customers who opt for such schemes. Authorities should train more staffers and open more than one counter to stop the harassment to customers who have to wait long hours for service.

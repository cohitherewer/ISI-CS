The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 CMC clears air on bio-waste
 																											- Health wing pushes hospitals to private disposal unit A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic authorities said on Thursday that they had stopped lifting bio-medical waste for disposal from government and private hospitals and clinics only on a directive from the state pollution control board (PCB).																								The decision was not ours. The truth is that they (the government and the PCB) asked us not to get involved in bio-waste disposal. They have got a private agency to handle the job, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee, putting the issue in perspective.																								The cut-off date, March 31, for the CMC handling bio-medical waste of the healthcare facilities in the city was set by the principal secretary, department of environment, pointed out municipal commissioner Debashis Som on Thursday.																								I conveyed the decision of the state environment department to the principal secretary, department of health, on March 15, with a request to advise the government hospitals to make necessary arrangements with the private operator for handling their bio-waste, Som added.																								However, the authorities of 25 state-level healthcare facilities in the city were in confusion on Thursday, in the absence of any government order to accept the services of a particular private handler of bio-waste.																								We dont know how much bio-medical waste has been collected from how many hospitals and nursing homes by the private company from Hyderabad. We will start stock-taking after a week, said S. Adhikary of the waste disposal wing of the PCB.																								S.K. Chaudhury, chief executive officer of Medicare Incin Pvt Ltd, the approved private handler, too, could not provide an estimate of the waste collected by his company on Thursday. 																								Things will be alright from Friday. I have issued the necessary order for government hospitals to engage Medicare Incin as their bio-waste disposal agent, said principal secretary (health) Asim Barman.																								There are about 14,000 beds in 25 government hospitals in the city and each bed, on an average, generates 350g of bio-waste a day, said chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar. 																								The CMC would charge Rs 450 per bed a year for removing the wastes and the state health department had to foot a bill of Rs 63 lakh a year for the service. 																								The private handler will charge Rs 2.70 per bed a day and the annual cost will be Rs 1.37 crore, said mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb.

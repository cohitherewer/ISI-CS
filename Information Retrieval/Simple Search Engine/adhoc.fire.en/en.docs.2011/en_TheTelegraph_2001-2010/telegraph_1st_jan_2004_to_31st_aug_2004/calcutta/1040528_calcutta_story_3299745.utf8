	Hoodlums overrun most of the parks in the city after dark. The open spaces turn into dens of vice boosting flesh trade and gambling. And few dare to venture out in these parks for a late evening stroll. Women and children feel unsafe in even those parks which have been earmarked by the Corporation for them. Will the authorities post plain-clothed policemen near these parks after sunset to provide protection from the goons? With a severe dearth of open spaces in the city, these parks and playgrounds are all that children have for recreation. 
	B.N. Bose, Dum Dum. During a ride recently, I was pleasantly surprised to find a private bus on route 3B aesthetically designed with improved seating arrangements. Many buses ply on for decades with worn-out structures which need to be modified for passengers comfort. The journey made me feel that at least one bus had given attention to our convenience.Sekhar Basu Mallik, BB Chatterjee Road.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								The much-awaited truck terminal at Dhulagarh, in Howrah, is set to open its doors on July 3.																								Though the first phase of the joint-venture project of the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation and a private entrepreneur (Dhulagarh Truck Terminal Ltd) was ready two months ago, it could not be operated for want of a formal inauguration.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has finally agreed to do the honours, in the presence of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee will be special guest.																								According to officials, the project was to be inaugurated in the beginning of the month by the transport minister himself, but he wanted the chief minister to do so. Bhattacharjee, however, cited other preoccupations to decline the offer.																								So, transport minister Chakraborty convinced Speaker Chatterjee, who agreed to inaugurate the project. We set June 28 as the inaugural date, sent out the invitation cards and prepared the inaugural plaque. Then, on June 23, the chief minister told the transport minister that he was willing to inaugurate the project, officials said.																								The officials were in a fix. Everything, from the invitation cards to the inaugural plaque, would have to be changed. So, they went into a huddle with the transport minister and set July 3 for the inauguration. 																								But, they said, we dont know how to convince Speaker Chatterjee to stand in as special guest, instead of the man to cut the ribbon.																								The transport minister, however, brushed away fears. There can be no alternative to the chief minister. I dont think Somnathda will mind. We are happy the prestigious project will be inaugurated, after all, he said.

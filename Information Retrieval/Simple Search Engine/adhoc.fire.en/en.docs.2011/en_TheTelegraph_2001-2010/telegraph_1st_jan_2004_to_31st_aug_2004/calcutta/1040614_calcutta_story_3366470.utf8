 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Gutsy threesome in on-screen encore 
 Sreelekha, Nelanjana and Koneenica at the re-launch announcement. Picture by Pradip Sanyal The occasion: A cosy get-together on Saturday evening to announce the re-launch of Teen Ekke Teen. With Sreelekha Mitra, Nelanjana Bhowmick and Koneenica Banerjee in the triple lead, the film also stars Tapas Pal, Subhendu Chattopadhyay, Saswata Chattopadhyay and Gita Dey.																								The film: Is all about three friends  an aspiring actress, a kabaddi champion and an entrepreneur  struggling to make it big. A chain of comic situations unfolds when the pretty, gutsy and enterprising girls plan to rob a bank and start a business with the loot. Charlies Angels gone bad?																								The launch: Was on January 23 at INOX, Mohua and Aruna. The film got off to a slow start, and was later followed up by matinee slots at Priya and Mitra for a week. 																								The re-launch: Is on June 18 at Nandan. Barely six months after release, the film is ready for a rerun on public demand. 																								The makers expect Teen Ekke Teen to do well this time. The initial plan of a three-week run may later be extended to two more weeks.																								Directors cut: I have tried to make a subtle comedy without any intellectual pretensions. Its loaded with humour but carries a message, too, says Moloy Bhattacharya, who also scripted the screenplay, about his second feature film after Kahini. The fact that people want to see the film indicates that theres a demand for it.																								Producer speak: The Nandan authorities have received several requests to screen Teen Ekke Teen. Director Ansu Sur approached me with the suggestion of putting the film up at Nandan, which I readily agreed to, says producer Arjun Gourisaria. 																								The trio: Struck a great rapport after the ice cracked with a workshop conducted by director Bhattacharya four months before going on the floors. The laidback Saturday evening was just perfect for the girls to catch up with each other after a long gap. Over to the winsome threesome																								Alo: I am a wannabe actress and tend to take everything very lightly, says Nelanjana. I was a bit apprehensive initially as I was an outsider, while Koneenica and Sreelekha knew each other. But things rolled on smoothly once we started doing the workshop. We had great fun on the sets, especially while shooting the bank robbery scene, she goes on.																								Later, the three of us sat down and decided on the clothes, and even the shades, each one of us would wear, Nelanjana adds.																								Maya: I have the tomboyish role, which is very unlike me. But I loved doing it. While shooting a fight sequence one day, I got so charged up that I actually landed a hard punch on a co-actors nose. That was during the rehearsal. When it came to the real shoot, I got cold feet, says the demure Koneenica.																								Mukti: I am the mastermind behind the heist and also the most determined and pragmatic of the lot, says Sreelekha. Playing Mukti was challenging and different, too, as people have seen me more in sentimental roles. The script was demanding; it had no extra melodrama and required a lot of homework, she adds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 07, 2004  The City Diary
																																																		The city and its adjoining areas experienced widespread power cuts for the third consecutive day on Friday as the shortfall in the CESC-served areas shot up to 167 mw around 6.30 pm. The power situation worsened for the first time in 2004 on Wednesday when a giant 250-mw unit collapsed at the CESCs generating station in Budge Budge. The unit is expected to be repaired by Saturday morning. The other Budge Budge unit had been shut down for maintenance work on February 1. CESC sources said lack of supply from the Budge Budge plant led to severe power cuts in south Calcutta and in large pockets of central Calcutta. The duration of power cuts was less in the north as the area is also fed by the CESCs power generating station at Titagarh. 																																																		A meeting between broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs) on Thursday night stamped a seal of approval on agreements regarding cable operators switching service providers without clearing their dues. CableComm, the fourth city MSO and the lone voice of dissent, fell in line with RPG Netcom, SitiCable and Manthan. It was decided that MSOs should allow a uniform credit period of two months. Master control rooms of the MSOs must furnish details of the cable operators under them and their outstanding dues by the end of February. The dues of operators, who have migrated, will be collected by the new MSO, also within this month. The defaulting operators will be switched off by the MSO and not fed by others. 																																																		Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to adopt a less painful process to catch stray dogs from the city roads. The division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, passed this order on the basis of petitions by some animal-lover non-governmental organisations of the city. The petitioners alleged that the CMC adopts a primitive process to catch dogs from city streets.																																																		An employee of Shyamnagar Jute Mill committed suicide on Thursday night at his residence in Noapara on the northern fringes of the city. Police said Tarak Acharya, 36, left a suicide note in which he stated that he was being mentally tortured by two officers of the mill. Police said the officers had been interrogated.																																																		Tejamul Laskar, 55, was found hanging from a window in the male ward of the Uluberia state general hospital in the early hours of Friday morning. He was admitted to the hospital on February 1 following a renal infection. According to his relatives, his condition had not improved since his admission to the hospital, which made him depressed. Mihir Bhattacharya, district superintendent of police, said though it seemed to be a case of suicide, the body had been sent for post-mortem.																																																		A fire broke out in a medicine godown on Mangoe Lane around midnight on Thursday. Five engines were pressed into service. No injuries were reported. Documents and medicines were destroyed, fire services officials said. The cause of the fire was not known.																																																		Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the government was on its way to formulate a food policy to benefit consumers and fishermen. He was speaking on the occasion of 25 years of Benfish at Writers Buildings on Friday. He added that the state had sustained its top position in fish production for the past eight years. At the programme, the chief minister gave away insurance money to family members of fishermen who went missing in the seas. The government also gave monetary rewards to fishermens children who had done well in major examinations.

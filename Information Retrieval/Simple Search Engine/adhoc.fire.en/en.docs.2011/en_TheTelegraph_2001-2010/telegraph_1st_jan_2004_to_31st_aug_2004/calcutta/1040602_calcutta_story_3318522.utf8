Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Shes six years old and knows little about globalisation, but what Kopai does understand is that if you want to widen a road, then it means cutting down trees and destroying houses, thus making people and creatures living in the area homeless. She should know, for the little girl from Palm Avenue plays the part of an owl in a drama, whose home, a tree by the roadside, will be cut down if the path is made bigger to enable more cars to pass.																								All 15 participants in the Indian Mime Theatre theatre workshop, held in collaboration with the National School of Drama, currently on at Entally Academy, be they six or 16 years old, dont really understand what globalisation means. But the concept of the play that they have come up with centres around what happens when urbanisation and technological advancement comes calling.																								Under the guidance of Siddharta Chakraborty, a freelance theatre personality who has been conducting these summer workshops since its inception 12 years ago, the kids have thought up the idea. It is about a road losing its friends, like a lamppost, an owl and those who live nearby  all characters in the play  because cars cant pass through the narrow road. 																								The road should be left as it is, feels Jagriti Bhattacharjee, 11, who gets nods of agreement all around. The road needs to be widened for more cars, but that would mean friends will lose each other, add Debayon Chatterjee, nine, and Srijon Uzir, 11. As for a solution, theres silence. Maybe you could go to court Abhirup Datta trails off.																								They are a very enthusiastic bunch, says sir Chakraborty. While he has instructed and helped them through the production process, he explains that the children had a hand in everything, from script to dialogue and interpretation. The play is like a fairytale, but its about urban society, and it relates to their lives and relationships.																								The play, Khelar Naam NH 420, will be staged on June 6, at Lady Ranu Mukherjee Mancha, as part of the two-day 4th Children Theatre Festival from June 4, organised by Indian Mime Theatre. Kids from Garia, Haldia, Howrah and Salt Lake will also stage their productions. 																								Another highlight of the festival is Rajar Bari Anek Dur, by Hridaya Akash, a project of Indian Mime Theatre with underprivileged children in Tangra. The workshop has been sponsored by the central governments department of secondary and higher education.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Face to launch ballot-box hit
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Does participation of non-political personalities enhance/diminish the appeal of the election? More letters will be published next weekPoll call: Actor and Rajya Sabha MP Hema Malini at a campaign for the BJP Purnima Vasudeva, 
																		Rowland Road																																																														Participation of non-political personalities, comprising mainly movie and small screen stars, not only diminishes the appeal of the elections but also makes a mockery of the election process. There seems to be a tug-of-war between the Congress and the BJP to bag glamour points. Of course, such faces in the morning papers make for good viewing. 									

Kaushik Guha, 
																		SN Roy Road 																																																														Yes, it does. But to what extent this practice can help solve problems of the masses is a totally different matter. 									

Sananda Sen, 
																		New Alipore																																																														Celebrities have admirers who would follow them anywhere for a glimpse. Of late, political parties have taken to parading such faces at election programmes to woo voters. But it is day-to-day problems such as scarcity of water, power crisis and civic amenities that play on the minds of people when they cast their votes. They usually end up voting for candidates who have succeeded in addressing these problems. 									

Aparajita Dasgupta, 
																		Jadavpur 																																																														Common people drool over screen idols and get excited whenever they get a chance to get close to them. So they are too happy to spot one at political campaigns. This trend exposes the rather sad fact that along with deeds, glamour also plays a major role in our elections.									

Biswajit Ganguly, 
																		Dakshindari Road 																																																														People should vote to power those politicians who they feel can serve the country best. While the participation of non-political personalities like film stars adds to the excitement of the party workers, it may also mislead others into voting solely on the basis of fame. 									

Arindam Chakraborty, 
																		Dunlop 																																																														The recent trend of participation of non-political personalities certainly reduces the appeal of the elections. Inefficient politicians are using such methods to grab the attention of the people. However, such tactics can in no way influence the educated. Politicians can win only if they work sincerely.
	 
	Rajesh Kumar Chakrabarty, 
HowrahNowadays, all political parties try winning elections by spending large sums of money on their campaigns. Or else, they use celebrities to pull the crowds. So, participation of non-political personalities neither enhances nor diminishes the appeal of the elections. 									

Gabriel Gomes, 
																		Park Street																																																														A celebrity acts like a Triton among the minnows  instrumental in foiling the rival candidatesefforts. So any new inclusion adds to the visual appeal of elections. A non-political person acts as a binding agent between political parties and the public, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger caused a ripple in California, especially among youngsters, simply because of his stardom in Hollywood. Electoral victory depends on the party leaders, but the appeal of the elections definitely has a lot to do with non-politicians. 									

Pritha Sen, 
																		Jadavpur																																																														The glamour of non-political personalities attracts rural folk. So, in a way, the stars help in persuading them to at least cast their votes. This is significant as a major chunk of our population ignores the election process altogether. But these celebrities never mingle with the voters to understand their problems. 									

Tanmoy Das Lala, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														Non-politicians would definitely not add to electoral appeal as they are unschooled in politics. What role can they play in the elections? In case the person takes to campaigning seriously, it would mean that his or her motivation to join politics is for personal gain and not for public good. Anyway, the masses are more interested in observing how a politician works at the grass-roots level during the campaigning period. 									

T.R. Anand, 
																		Budge Budge																																																														No political party has the financial strength to shoulder campaign expenditure. So, just before elections they get hold of non-political personalities, who are popular with the masses and are also close to the business circle. Amitabh Bachchan and the Ambanis coming to the aid of Amar Singh in Uttar Pradesh for the forthcoming polls is one such example.									

Govind Das Dujari, 
																		Behala																																																														Those who understand how democracy works will never appreciate the entry of non-political personalities. Politics is no more a platform to serve the people. Fair-weather folks join politics only to boost their own status. Some actors aspire to follow in the footsteps of veterans like Shatrughan Sinha and Vinod Khanna. But one must remember that Sinha took 15 years to become a minister. Moreover, stars are also paid hefty appearance money for showing up at a function. Roping in well-known faces to attract voters is not a healthy practice. 									

Rimli Datta, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														It will diminish the appeal of the elections. Nowadays, inviting reputed singers, models and film stars is becoming a craze. But the political parties forget that Indian voters are well aware of these electoral gimmicks and current political scenario. They would not get carried away by the glitz and glamour. Therefore, campaigning by non-political personalities, especially those who have little committment towards the public, is an absolute waste.
	 Sayan Banerjee, 
Belgachhia
The recent rush of non-political personalities into politics hints that the candidates are trying to project particular persons more than the party they are rooting for. A charmimg face might be able to deliver a hit at the box-office, but it will fail to resurrect the fortunes of a party.

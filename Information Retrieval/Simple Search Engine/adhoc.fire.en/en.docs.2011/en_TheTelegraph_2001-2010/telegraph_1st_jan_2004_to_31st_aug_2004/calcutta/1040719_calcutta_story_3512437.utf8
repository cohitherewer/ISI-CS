 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 The sound of deathly silence
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 STRANGE HUSH: One of the residents of 91/3C, Tollygunge Road. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Staying awake to the wails of three-month-old Bedanta till late in the night was a routine affair for Chandeswar Rai, who lives on the ground floor of 91/3C, Tollygunge Road. Saturday night was quiet and Rai enjoyed the hush, little realising that the baby had been silenced forever by his own father. 																								Every night, I used to be awakened by the cries of the baby. Last night, I found it a bit strange when he stayed quiet, said Rai, a tenant of the Saha family. 																								When police broke into the Saha house on Sunday morning, they found the baby  fondly called Runi at home  locked with his mother, Swati, in a final embrace. 																								I wasnt aware of the tragedy even in the morning. I had gone out to the market, and when I returned, I saw a crowd in front of the house. Only when the police stopped me from entering the gate did I realise that something was wrong, said Rai, who runs a flour mill from the same building.																								Rai remembers how ecstatic Swati had been the day Bedanta arrived home. She had proudly held up her second son for all who came to see him. Elders in the family had already started planning for his annaprasan (rice-eating ceremony), he added.																								While searching the Saha household, police found a half-empty bowl of baby food in one of the rooms and deduced that Shibendu had kept aside a portion of the poison for his infant son. He had killed the rest of his family with a poison-laced soft drink.																								The family would usually be home by 10 pm. They were not noisy; I never heard them quarrelling in the six years I have lived here, Rai said. But the little one would raise quite a ruckus... I had not imagined in my wildest dreams that the baby was dead.																								Through Sunday, Bedanta lay lifeless at the Katapukur morgue. While doctors were busy ascertaining how he had been killed, officers of Charu Market police station waited outside to carry investigations forward.																								The brutality with which Shibendu killed his son has stunned his friends and neighbours. We hadnt even seen the baby. We were supposed to pay a visit to them soon. I cant believe a father can murder his infant son in this manner, exclaimed Nabarun Dey, Shibendus childhood friend, who sat in a daze outside the building.

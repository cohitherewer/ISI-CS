The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Potter casts a sellout spell
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 In the queue at INOX for tickets to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Wednesday, 9.30 am. Four advance booking counters open for business unusual at the citys first multiplex.																								Wednesday, 11 am. All shows for Friday and almost all for Saturday, sold out.																								Wednesday, 1 pm. Sunday is sold out, too.																								Blame it all on Potter mania. Yes, its back in town, big time, with the worldwide, same-day-same-date release of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, at INOX, on June 4.																								Calcutta has been at the forefront of the ticket queues, snapping up seats before you can say Expecto Patronus (to ward off the Dementors). So much so that the three shows a day planned till Wednesday morning were just not enough and a fourth had to be added hastily by evening to satisfy the young fans of the boy wizard.																								There were about a thousand people buying tickets today. We havent seen anything like this before, said Ravi Raman, general manager, INOX Calcutta. The response has been tremendous. It is all sold out till the weekend, and till Thursday its about 80 per cent occupancy, he added, around 6 pm on Day I of advance bookings.																								Sixteen-year-old Pratik Kayan of Park Street, a self-confessed die-hard Harry follower, had been looking forward to Prisoner of Azkaban ever since the first promos were released. I saw the posters at INOX a month ago I came here on Tuesday to find out when we could get the tickets. I got here at 11 this morning. There was a long queue already, and I could only get a Sunday ticket, rued the Mayo College student.																								Long lines at the only hall for Harry in town notwithstanding, loyalists and even those just curious (like Vedant Bubna, 14, a La Martiniere for Boys student), stuck to the ticket-grab task. But they all agreed that the fact that the third story in the Harry Potter series is darker, more grown-up and with more mysteries, definitely makes it more appealing than the Chamber of Secrets.																								The possibility of three main cast members  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson  not being there for all seven films after outgrowing the ages of the characters they play  Harry Potter, Ron Weasely and Hermione Granger  might have added to the appeal, felt Raman. Also, its the summer holidays, and the film should run for at least four to five weeks, he added.																								So far, the response has been absolutely amazing, said Blaise Fernandes, managing director (India), Warner Bros Inc. Admitting that the second film did see a dip in sales, he added that the same-date worldwide release this time is a big deal for the film, expected to be a huge success.

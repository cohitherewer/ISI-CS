 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Punishment chorus against slap doctor
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After relatives and friends, its the turn of medical students to rally behind Sandhya Mondol, who was slapped on her ear to induce labour and cooperate at NRS Medical College and Hospital on Monday morning.																								On Thursday, medical students, mostly apolitical, voiced concern at the recent turn of events and called for suitable punishment of the guilty post-graduate trainee Supratik Basu, who has been barred from continuing his training till the health department delivers its verdict. 																								At a time when we are striving to improve doctor-patient relations, incidents such as slapping patients inside the labour room are something we can ill afford, said students. Some junior doctors have told their superiors that they would like to study and work in a friendlier atmosphere.																								For the second day in a row, the health department was quiet on the fate of the errant doctor. A strong report indicting him has been sent to the department, but a decision is yet to be taken. Both C.R. Maiti, director of medical education, who was out of town, and health secretary K. Bagchi were unavailable for comment. 																								Doctors at NRS were still hopeful that the government would set a precedent by taking some action. The right message should go to the people now, said a senior consultant in the gynaecology department.																								Investigations revealed that the doctor, along with other junior doctors, had been involved in clashes a number of times, the latest being a fight between SFI supporters and a group of apolitical doctors in June. Police and the hospital authorities are probing the incident. 																								Doctors attending on Sandhya Mondol at the gynaecology ward said her condition had improved significantly. She has been receiving post-delivery medication and for her problem in the right ear as well. She should be absolutely fine in a few days, said P.K. Banerjee, the doctor under whose care, Sandhya was admitted.																								However, the condition of Sandhyas newborn boy continues to be serious. We have changed a few antibiotics and have kept him in an incubator. His mother is coming to see him once in a while, said attending doctors. The baby with extremely low birth weight (1.6 kg) will remain under observation, doctors said.

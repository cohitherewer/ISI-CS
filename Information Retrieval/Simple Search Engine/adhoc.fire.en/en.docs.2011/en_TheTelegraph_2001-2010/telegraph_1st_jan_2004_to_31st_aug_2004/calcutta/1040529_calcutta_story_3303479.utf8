																								Anya Chhanda presents Swarna Villa, a Bengali comedy with a pseudo-romantic twist intended to provide light-hearted entertainment for the family. Biplab Chatterjee (who also directs) and Kushal Chakraborty play the two central characters in this play, which belongs to the genre of the anti-sentimental comedy, bordering on the absurd. The plot revolves around the curious circumstances that arise from a case of mistaken identity. Though the comic streak in the human psyche is abundantly exploited in this play, it does not entirely steer clear of dealing with serious issues either.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Swarna Villa, produced by Anya Chhanda																								When: Tomorrow at 3 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

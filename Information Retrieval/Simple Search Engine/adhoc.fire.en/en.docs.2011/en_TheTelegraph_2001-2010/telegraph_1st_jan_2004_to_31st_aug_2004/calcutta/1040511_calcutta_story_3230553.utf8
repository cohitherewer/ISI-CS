 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Women queue up outside a Dum Dum polling centre on Monday morning. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								A black Bolero GLX, with a red flag fluttering from the bonnet, is meandering through the lanes and bylanes of Khardah. 																								The sports utility vehicle stops at temporary CPM camp offices near polling booths, and after spending a few minutes, sets off for its next stop.																								Amitava Nandy, the CPMs candidate from Dum Dum, was here, there and everywhere on one of the busiest days in his political life.																								From keeping track of what the Election Commission observers were doing to ensuring that the morale of the party workers was kept as buoyant as the party flag on his car bonnet, Nandy seemed determined to do it all on poll day.																								I started my day at around 6.30 in the morning. First, I cast my vote in Jatindas Nagar, in Belghoria. Now, I will try to cover most of my constituency and meet both party workers and common people, said Nandy, in starched white kurta-pyjama and chappals, as his big black car stopped at Patulia in Khardah, close to 10 am.																								The reason for Nandys mad Monday was close on his heels.																								BJP candidate Tapan Sikdar and his Toyota Qualis reached Khardah even before Nandy could set off for his next destination, Panihati.																								In some booths, the CPM goons have driven out our agents. We rushed here to sort out things, said a BJP supporter, outside Shibnath School, even as Sikdar barked instructions into one of his cellphones.																								But if call count is what it takes, Nandy beat the former Union minister of state for communications hollow on poll-day morning. The cellphones in Nandys car just refused to stop ringing.																								Tell either Manas (Mukherjee, MLA from Kamarhati) or Subhas (Chakraborty, MLA from Belgachhia East) to handle it, whispered Nandy into his phone, at one point.																								The import of the hushed tone was lost on none. After all, the CPMs prospects in Dum Dum hinges heavily on the man and machinepower mobilisation by Chakraborty and Mukherjee.																								Last time round, Chakraborty loyalists had reportedly worked against party interests to settle a score with the leadership. This time, with the transport ministers mentor making it clear that he wanted Dum Dum back, the BJP vs CPM showdown has taken on an extra edge.																								Jyoti Basu, a resident of this constituency, cast his vote at around 10.45 am in DD Block. 																								The former chief ministers arrival was marked by a media frenzy matched only by Sourav Gangulys date with democracy, in the opposite end of town, a little later in the day.																								A heavy turnout and positive feedback from party workers in Khardah  a traditional Left bastion  kept Nandy in good humour in the morning. Ruling out any tension, he said, almost parroting BJPs India Shining campaign: I am feeling good and am confident of winning.																								The feel-good factor had come under siege by evening. I was attacked in Salt Lake by some RSS workers, complained Nandy. 																								Similar allegations  against the CPM cadre  poured in from the BJP camp.

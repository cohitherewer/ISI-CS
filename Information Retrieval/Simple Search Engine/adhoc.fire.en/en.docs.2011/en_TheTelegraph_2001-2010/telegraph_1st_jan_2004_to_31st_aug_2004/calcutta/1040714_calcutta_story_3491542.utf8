The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Penalty for real culprits
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Is the bus-owner liable to compensate the victim(s) if his vehicle causes an accident? More letters will be published next week Flame of fury: Buses set ablaze after an accident at PadmapukurTapan Pal, 
																		Batanagar																																																														Sometimes accidents occur due to irresponsible drivers of two-wheelers and pedestrians, encroachment of pavements or illegal parking of cars that force pedestrians to avoid the footpaths, policemen allowing trucks on main roads in peak hours etc. The police and vehicle inspectors should investigate the accidents and only then should the matter of compensation be settled with the real culprits. 									

Shiv Shanker Almal, 
																		Lower Rawdon Street																																																														Both bus-owners and the state government should compensate the victims of road accidents. How can such careless and selfish people be allowed in public service? The state takes a large amount as tax but no regulatory body ensures facilities for tax-payers or cares about their safety. Rimli Datta,
																		Salt Lake																																																														The bus-owner should compensate the victims if his vehicle causes an accident. A certain percentage of the amount could also be taken from the salary of the driver of the particular bus. Drivers should be put behind bars for attempt to murder. Even if buses are destroyed after an accident, bus-owners suffer the least as their vehicles are usually insured.									

Vinay Poddar,
																		Howrah 																																																														The bus-owner should compensate the victim(s) if the accident takes place due to lack of maintenance of the vehicle, or due to the negligence of the driver. Thousands of people travel by buses everyday, and compensation can be a very effective way to curb rash driving.
	 Veena Sreelalan, 
Gol ParkIn no way can the bus-owner be held responsible if his vehicle causes an accident. The innocent people are victims of callousness of rash drivers and negligence of conductors. Drivers and conductors should be held responsible and strict penalty should be meted out to them. 

Ali asgar Poonawala, 
																		Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road																																																														Bus drivers, and not owners, should pay for the accidents, because it is due to their mistake that owners suffer. And if the drivers dont have enough money to pay, severe punishment should be meted out to them. 									

Puja Agarwala, 
																		Beleghata No, bus-owners should not be liable to compensate, because in some cases, the fault solely lies with the victims themselves. If the bus-owner is not at fault,why should he be fined? Basudeb Bhattacharya, 
Salt Lake There should be compensation involved only when the bus driver is at fault  be it violating traffic rules to pick up more passengers, competing with other buses, being inebriated or not possessing a valid licence, route permit or certificate of fitness. There should be no question of compensation if the victim himself is at fault or slips while boarding/alighting or the vehicle develops mechanical snags, like brake failure. 

Indranil Sanyal,
																		Dhakuria																																																														Bus-owners are definitely responsible for accidents as they are the ones who appoint the careless drivers. Owners should be careful in making strict rules for the drivers of their vehicles to follow, such that accidents can be avoided.									

Tanmoy Das Lala,
																		Salt Lake																																																														Though bus drivers are often engaged in careless competition among themselves to pick up more passengers, accidents are not always their fault. Sometimes the victim, too, is to be blamed. But burning of buses or a financial penalty slapped on the bus-owner does not bring the actual guilty to book.T.R. Anand, 
																		Budge Budge																																																														Bus-owners should compensate victims of accidents caused by their vehicles. The law allows erring drivers to go scot-free with merely a payment of a meagre fine. This should be scrapped and bus-owners should be made to pay compensation. Varun Gupta, 
																		Lake Town 																																																														The owner, by delegating his authority to the driver, should not be allowed to shirk his responsibility. He should continue to be liable to the victim and at the same time the driver should also be made accountable to him. Indranil Sengupta,
																		Salt Lake City																																																														Even if an accident is not caused due to the bus-owners own negligence, he cannot escape his liability towards ensuring public safety as he is responsible for the conduct of the man he employs as driver. It is the recklessness of the bus-owners employees that most often results in accidents today.									

Sushma Jalan,
																		Alipore																																																														Bus-owners get away too leniently if their vehicles are involved in accidents. The victims are the only ones who suffer as they neither get any compensation nor justice. Bus-owners spend money on providing duplicate licenses for rash drivers and hence put to risk lives of more and more people everyday. If the same amount is used for victims compensation and not license-makers, bus-owners might think twice before providing criminal drivers with their licenses to kill.									

Md Tarique Nisar, 
																		Collin Street 																																																														Bus-owners should definitely be made to compensate the victims if their vehicles cause accidents. The guilty should be punished. The government should make traffic rules with great care and take strict safety measures against rash bus drivers, to minimise chances of accidents.Anandadip Chowdhury,
Baguiati An exorbitant amount of money paid by a bus-owner can never be substitute for a victim who has been run over by the bus. Compensation will neither bring back the victims life nor curb other accidents. So bus-owners should keep their drivers in check and penalise them in case of accidents.

 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Lakh householders in water-tax net
 OUR BUREAU																								Read my lips: Water tax for only 5,000 to 6,000 households.																								This claim by mayor Subrata Mukherjee  to Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee  has been proved a lie.																								Civic officials on Sunday cited figures from the just-placed interim budget to confirm that the mayors water charge was actually affecting close to 100,000 house-owners, a far cry from the 5,000-odd figure he had projected to push the tax past a reluctant Mamata.																								According to the officials, the water tax, as fashioned by the mayor, was currently in abeyance but, in the absence of any legislation on this score, could stage a comeback after the Lok Sabha elections.																								The tax was collected from house-owners in the city proper with an annual valuation of Rs 5,000 and above. The minimum water tax was calculated at Rs 50 per month. 																								Both mayor Mukherjee and municipal commissioner Debashis Som have, however, held out the assurance that from April 2004, property tax can be paid as usual, minus the water charges.																								Mukherjee is under pressure from international funding agencies that taxes must be paid for civic services rendered in order to attain self-sufficiency.																								Last Wednesday, while placing the interim budget, the mayor claimed that water tax collected during the current fiscal was Rs 24.72 crore, compared with Rs 19.28 crore the previous year.																								We admit that while deciding on the method of water charges, there have been some anomalies. While the water-tax burden was imposed on a large number of house-owners in the city proper, it was not so in the case of the added areas. That is why we have decided to shelve the plan, said Mukherjee. 																								One of Mukherjees principal critics, Anup Chatterjee, mayor-in-council member in charge of roads, said: Now, it is clear that about a lakh households have had to pay water tax under the new collecting system. 																								CPM councillor Sudhangshu Sil alleged that the member in charge of water supply in the mayors council Sovan Chatterjee had misinformed the civic house by stating that the new system of water tax would bring only a few thousand under the water-tax net. 																								Chatterjees contention was misleading, he said on Sunday.																								Sovan Chatterjee, however, stuck to his stand and insisted that the water-tax collection under the new system was far better than the earlier ferrule-based system.

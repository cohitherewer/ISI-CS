Prokash Karmakar has not only painted vivacious women on his canvases, he has also done a series on horses  some in red and some in grey. Robin Mondals works are dominated by his famous Queens  all done in vibrant colours. Sanat Kars paintings have his quintessential female figures interspersed with birds. His vast range of work is praiseworthy indeed. In all 38 small paintings by these eminent painters are a viewers delight.

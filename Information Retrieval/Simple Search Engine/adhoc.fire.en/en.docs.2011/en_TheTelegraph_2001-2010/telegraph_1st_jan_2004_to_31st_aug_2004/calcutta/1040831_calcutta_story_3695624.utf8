The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has won quite a breather from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), which is funding the Rs 400-crore programme for the construction of four flyovers and development of five major road intersections in the city.																								Government officials on Monday confirmed the extension of the JBIC deadline, that came about following the intervention of the chief minister and lobbying by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty in Delhi.																								We had urged the funding agency to extend the deadline, citing some unavoidable circumstances for the delay in completing the flyovers. They were convinced and responded to our appeal, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.																								The flyovers and road intersections were scheduled to be ready by April 2004, with a buffer month kept to tie up the loose ends.																								The Lockgate flyover has just been completed, six months behind schedule. But the Park Street flyover is still a few months away from completion and is close to being two years behind schedule.																								Extension of deadline does not mean that the ongoing work will continue to be tardy. We are determined to complete it by this year and have directed the contractors and others accordingly, added the transport secretary.																								Once the Park Street flyover is ready by this year-end, we will get another year to take up some other projects, to be implemented with the surplus funds, he added.Officials said the surplus fund has been estimated at about Rs 40 crore. Several options  from part-funding of flyovers to major road repairs  are being explored for its utilisation.																								Whatever we do with the surplus funds, we have to complete it within November 2005. But, going by experience, it is not possible to complete any major project within this time-frame. So, we are opting for a package of projects on a smaller scale, that can be completed within a year, said H. Mohan, joint secretary in the transport department.																								So, road repair, installation of a signalling system, setting up guard-rails on pavements and dereservation of tram tracks are topping the to-do list. We will finalise our programme within a week, added Mohan.

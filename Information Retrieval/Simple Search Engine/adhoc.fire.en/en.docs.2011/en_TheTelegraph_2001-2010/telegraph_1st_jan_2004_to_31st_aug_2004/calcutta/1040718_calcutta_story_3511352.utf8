Those who walked the quiet corridor, often referred to it as Elegant Road that housed eminent lawyers, doctors and the sahibs. Now, its all about snazzy decor, waxed and squeaky-clean floors, polite staff, cheerful displays, right merchandising and streamlined processes  to provide total consumer satisfaction and retention. Forum (right), the fulcrum, records weekly walk-ins in excess of 75,000.SHOP STOPS																								Shoppers Stop: The four-level, 45,000-sq ft anchor inside the lifestyle mall Forum boasts around 300 brands under one roof, with a Habibs and a Barista thrown in.

Calcutta: The 125-seater, 5,000-sq ft Anjan Chatterjee signature restaurant on the fourth level of Forum is a celebration of Calcuttas cuisine bringing back on the table many lost dishes of the city. Moving out of the Park Street-Camac Street zone and creating food destinations further south makes good business sense. The entertainment zone in the city is definitely shifting, says Chatterjee.Star Struck: The 3,350-sq ft, 68-seater multi-cuisine fine-dining restaurant in Forum feeds largely on the INOX crowd. We are now doing around 300 covers on weekends, but footfalls will change to a steadier pattern once we open the lounge, says proprietor Bunty Sethi.																								Burp!: The 10,000 sq ft, 215-seater multi-cuisine food court at Forum has developed into a major draw for movie-goers and shoppers alike.

Caffeine: This 1,700-sq ft 85-cover resto-caf gets diverse walk-ins, from school and college students to quick-bite execs to after-dinner coffee freaks. INOX and Forum drive a lot of traffic into our caf and on weekends, we are doing around 200-220 covers, says Rajdeep Ghoshal of Caffeine.																								Dont forget: Baskin Robbins, Amorettos...SPECIAL MENTION																								INOX: Since Calcuttas first four-screen multiplex with stadium seating for 1,015 unveiled itself at Forum, it has changed the way people watch movies in the city of Ray. The myriad mix of reclining seats with cup-holder armrests, Christies projectors and Harkness screens, Dolby Digital EX 3-way surround sound with JBL speakers, flexi-pricing and computerised ticketing has fired the imagination of the movie buff and engineered a paradigm shift in the entertainment industry. The impact is manifest in the average footfall -- 2,000-2,500 on weekdays and 3,500-4,000 on weekends. The Refuel sip n bite counter is also a huge hit.PROPERTY RATES																								Buyout: Rs 4,000 to 6,000 per sq ft on an average, going up to Rs 8,000 for prime ground-floor spaceRentals: Rs 60-80 per sq ft per month, going up to Rs 100 for prime ground-floor space

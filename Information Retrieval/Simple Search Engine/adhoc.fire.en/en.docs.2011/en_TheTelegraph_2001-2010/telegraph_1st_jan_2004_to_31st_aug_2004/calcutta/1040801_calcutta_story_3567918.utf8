The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 01, 2004 Bon Appetease
Victor BanerjeePeople laugh at my points of view. And well they should. Thats if they tow the line of common ignorance and rap the two Bs on their knuckles (not our Big B of course, for reasons I shall divulge later) for awing, blasting and bombing Iraqis who dont understand whats good for them. I belong to that minority who are convinced that stockpiles of WMD are buried somewhere deep under the sands and will be revealed in time, just as soon as the excavations exploring Atlantis are resumed. That ought to be pretty soon say the Italian Intelligence on whom MI6 depend to feed the CIA who in turn whet and whittle, to a sharp point, Bushs appetite for what only the foolish majority consider the absurd.Who cares if people laugh at my points of view? They shouldnt. Look around you. Look around. Who can you trust any more? With Kish Adnani out, McMohan Singh in, Siren absconding and Sofia swatting mites in Kumbakonam, I fully understand why common folk are confused and unable to comprehend the isometric and barometric vicissitudes that are contributing to misplaced Parliamentarianism and an erratic monsoon.Lets play safe; if we can. Lets not take any chances. Lets depend on cricket to prove to the world, in Athens, that we are an athletic and sporting nation that is currently busy studying the loopholes in intellectual property rights so we can outdo China economically, steal a march on Myanmar, and make Rajarhat look like Shanghai.So, whom can we trust these days? Enough to make sure we are not diddled by marketing sleuths who, like Spidermen, have woven intricate webs of EMIs for everything under the sun that we cannot afford but race like cattle with dry udders on fire, to buy? The Big B.Finally, the nation, our poor nation, is being served honesty on kiosks and billboards and, for the intelligent, on television as well. Midst all the adorable titillation of anatomical re-mixes that Anupam Kher and his board of puritanical censors is bent on depriving us of, every TV channel dishes out public service messages endorsed by a man we can trust. The Big B.Today, I, like many middle-class households, refuse to buy anything that isnt endorsed by the Bachchan. He has flatly refused to endorse dubious products and that includes credit cards that once drove him to well nigh bankruptcy till he received his mantras at the hands of gurus, Amar  amp; Mulayam, his saharas  emotionally speaking, of course. The day he endorses one of the cheaper substitutes of Viagra that are being made in this country, our lives will change.Now I know our jamaibabu holds Calcutta very close to his heart. We all know that he could pick any constituency in West Bengal and send the likes of Buddhadeb and Mamata and Tapan orbiting like seven pins in a cheap bowling alley. But he wont. His wife, finally in the Upper House after years of stoically riding out turbulence on the ground floor, is out of his hair (and I wish he wouldnt wear such an obvious hairpiece), and I am going to take a wild guess and presume she has tempted his vegetarianism to succumb to the wonders of Magoor maachh  Bengals life force.Thus, to put a twist on Bengal shining, everybody smiling, let me give you a wonderful alternative to what is certainly, in fits and starts, our most devoured and revered fish. It used to be on the menu of the Baan Thai restaurant at the Oberoi Grand but, those who could afford it preferred the predictable Tom Kas and plunged a connoisseurs delight into Calcuttas gastronomic oblivion.Thai Magoor(Crisp fried whole Catfish in tamarind and chilli sauce) Preparation time: 30 minutes SStart to finish time: 45 minutesServings: 10Ingredients: 10 pieces catfish, whole, gutted and cleaned 100 grams salt  150 grams cornflour  300 ml oil, for deep-fryingFor the sauce  100 grams oil  300 grams onion, sliced  150 grams garlic, chopped  100 grams oyster sauce  180 grams tamarind, pulp  150 ml soy sauce light or mountain sauce  40 grams dried red chilli, flaked  120 grams sugar  250 milliliters seafood stock Method:Make slits on the sides of the catfish.

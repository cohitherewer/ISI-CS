 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Court solace for unsuitable groom
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The girl is 25, good-looking and has a rich father who dotes on her. The father owns a chain of restaurants in central Calcutta. 																								The boy is 32, makes good money as a transport trader but is not allowed to live with her, his legally married wife, because the rich father-in-law thinks the groom is beneath his daughters station in life.																								On Friday, a trial court directed the police to produce before it Shayar Begum, after searching the house of her father, Md Sahid Shamim, owner of Mezwan restaurant, at the junction of Ripon Street and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, and several other eateries in and around central Calcutta.																								Tenth metropolitan magistrate Asima Pal heard in the morning how Shamim and his two sons tried to break up the courtship between Shayar Begum and Mohammad Jalaluddin, and later, their 45-day marriage, because they did not approve of Jalaluddin. 																								We love each other, said Jalaluddin in a petition that was moved by his counsel Subroto Mookerjee. Ours is a perfectly legal marriagesolemnised in keeping with Muslim rites and customs. The nikahnama will bear out my position. But my in-laws are holding my wife back against her wish and denying us conjugal happiness.																								As it appeared from Mookerjees submission of the petition, Jalaluddin had approached Shamim for his daughters hand, but he had spurned the proposal, apparently because the boy was no match for his daughter. Unable to get her family to agree to the match, Jalaluddin and Shayar Begum gave up persuading them and registered their marriage before a Kazi on May 16 and started living together.																								On June 28, Sajid Shamim, brother of Shayar, invited his newly-married sister and brother-in-law over the telephone to their home on Royd Street, assuring them that he would make his father see reason and accept Jalaluddin into the family.																								When Jalaluddin and Shayar Begum reached the familys Royd Street home around 2 pm the same day, Begums two brothers, Sajid and Asif, along with 20 other goons of the locality, pounced on Jalaluddin and started beating him up, Mookerjee alleged.																								They threatened to shoot him with the guns they brandished and drove him out of the house, after locking Shayar in a room. the lawyer alleged, adding that Jalaluddin had gone to Park Street police station to lodge a complaint, but the police did not allow him to do so.																								Jalaluddin informed the court that Shayar Begums family members were torturing her physically and mentally. She is a consenting adult, well-educated, and as such, her family has no right to keep her confined against her wish.																								When Mezwan restaurant was contacted over the telephone for a word from the Shamim family, a member of the staff said the family members were travelling.																								Magistrate Pal also asked the police to start proceedings against Shamim and his two sons for their alleged involvement in detaining Shayar against her wishes.

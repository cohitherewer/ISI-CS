 																											- Doctors sew up split-open skull base, mend compound fractures BAPPA MAJUMDAR				 	 Three-year-old Sukhchain: Valiant fight																								Three-year-old Sukhchain Singh fell from the fourth-floor balcony of his Baguiati residence two weeks ago. The base of his skull was split open; he suffered multiple fractures in the jaw and arms.																								On Wednesday, Sukhchain was happy at home, playing ludo with brother Angad, while sister Kiraneep kept a strict eye on her youngest sibling, whose fall had taken the family to hell and back.																								The little fellow defied the odds and, in the process, even surprised some of the doctors who brought him back from the brink.																								On the morning of June 23, Sukhchain had trotted up to his favourite spot in the fourth-floor balcony and leaned against the grille to wave at his friends playing in the courtyard below.																								In his enthusiasm, he pressed against the grille, leaned too far forward, lost his balance and slipped through the bars.																								As he hurtled down, his tiny frame grazed against the building walls before hitting the ground with a sickening thud, landing on his face and right shoulder.																								When his friends raised an alarm, mother Paramjit, who was in the kitchen, rushed down.																								It was ghastly. There was blood all over the place and I feared the worst, but I saw him move a little and immediately took him in my arms and rushed him to a local nursing home, recounted Paramjit.																								Husband Kuldip Singh, a businessman, stood by her and shook his head, as if wanting to shut out the nightmare forever.																								Doctors at the local nursing home could do little but despair and so the couple rushed off to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.																								There, doctors set out to stop the bleeding and started investigations. A CT scan revealed extensive fractures on the upper and lower jaws and palate, which had ruptured totally.																								To make matters worse, the base of the skull had opened up and the cerebrospinal fluid was seeping out of his blood-splattered nose.																								A six-member medical team first set about fixing the fractures. Things went smoothly till the anaesthetist decided to intubate the boy by holding the endo-tracheal (a tube that maintains ventilation) between the two jaws to prevent it from slipping out.																								Since both jaws were broken, someone held the tube in his mouth, while I made the surgical moves on his tattered face, recalls Srijon Mukherjee, faciomaxillary surgeon.																								The palate was shattered, exposing the mesh of blood vessels just below the brain, and the bleeding would not stop. We then pulled the palate closer and fixed it with metal plates to stop the blood from oozing out, Mukherjee recalled.																								The boy had also suffered a compound fracture on his right arm and injuries to his head, which orthopaedic surgeon Ranjith Kuzhupilli and neurosurgeon Harsh Jain fixed in an eight-hour-long surgery.																								Since the skull in children is made up of cartilage and not bones, Sukhchains brain swelled but did not crack. Only the base of the skull had opened up and once the fractures were repaired, the bleeding stopped, explained Mukherjee.																								Everybody keeps saying that its a miracle that saved him, but we would like to thank the entire team of doctors for their efforts. The rest is Gods wish, said Sukhchains uncle, Kamaljeet.

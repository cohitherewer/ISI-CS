 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Forging ahead on wheelchair
 Asesh Kanta Banerjee Choudhury Asesh Kanta Banerjee Choudhury Not being able to use his legs since the age of two following a polio attack didnt prevent him from dreaming big. And some of his long nurtured dreams are on the verge of realisation.																								Asesh Kanta Banerjee Choudhury has worked for the physically and mentally challenged for over two decades. His school and association, Ahead, now plans to expand from the two rooms it occupies in New Alipore, to a four-storied building in Golf Green which would also house computer laboratories and marriage counselling facilities for the disabled.																								Choudhurys life has been a struggle, more so since the society he grew up in was hardly sensitised to the needs of the disabled. From the first school in a north Calcutta neighbourhood to the hallowed halls of Calcutta University, the lack of co-operation and support from authorities made Choudhury only grow stronger in spirit.																								Despite gaining admission to CU for M. Com, university officials turned him away for being wheelchair-ridden. But he not only completed the course in private, but also stood first class first.																								A job with Garden Reach Shipbuilders amp; Engineers (from where he recently retired from a senior position) provided the foundation for his dreams.																								The lifelong passion for Choudhury has been to help the physically and mentally disabled. Ahead, the association and school that he has been running for over two decades, helps train children with special needs. Exchange of his students with regular schools, vocational training, and various therapies including the use of music, are some of the things Choudhury and his team work on.																								In a departure from other NGOs, its not the shortage of funds that Choudhury complains about, but the problem of space to house various projects, and the lack of support from the government and municipal authorities.																								Despite being an NGO and repeated requests for consideration, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation charged exactly the same amount in taxes for Aheads school, as for other institutions. This system, of charging taxes according to personal opinions (as he terms it) and the lack of judicial recourse in this regard, disappoints Choudhury. The poor infrastructure environment for the disabled here is also a great concern.																								But there is hope yet as the awareness spreads and more people come forward to help. At home, Choudhurys efforts are complemented by the support from his wife Ratna and seven-year-old son.

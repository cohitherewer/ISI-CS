 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Tobacco trigger for child asthma
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Environmental factors could set off asthma in children																								Childhood asthma is on the rise globally. But those who merely point fingers at growing pollution levels may be misled.																								The Bhagirathi Neotia Lecture Series 2004 began on Wednesday with a talk on Breathing problems in children, delivered by paediatrician Chandan Ray, a respiratory specialist at the Rawdon Street centre. A combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors could be responsible for the growing incidence of asthma.																								Main worries for mothers include recurrent coughs and colds and persistent wheeze. But Ray reassured his audience that after the first six months, it is normal for children to fall prey to six to eight colds a year. Asthma can be triggered by viral infections, allergies, stress, pollutants, cockroach droppings and cigarette smoke.																								Cigarettes are directly linked to asthma, particularly if a mother smokes during pregnancy, but even if there are smokers in the house. This is one clear factor Sampa Mitra Pahari, a paediatrician at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, agreed is a leading cause for increasing incidence of asthma, pollution and allergies aside. But another reason could be improved awareness levels which have caused more cases to be treated and diagnosed as asthma, while before they were given another name, she explained. 																								But stigma attached to asthma still means parents are often uncomfortable when the doctor diagnoses a child with the disease. There is an urgent need to dispel popular myths about treatment. Inhalers are not addictive, said Ray. 																								Steroids, the mainstay of asthma treatment, when prescribed by a doctor, are not necessarily harmful, specially in a city where emergency treatment is not reliable. And colds are caused by virus, not by catching a chill, or eating yoghurt and sweets.																								The bi-monthly lecture series will address alternately paediatric and gynaecological issues. We want to help parents deal with common problems that they often find confusing to cope with, explains a hospital spokesperson. The following sessions will deal with ailments like fever, allergic skin reactions and womens concerns like effective contraception.

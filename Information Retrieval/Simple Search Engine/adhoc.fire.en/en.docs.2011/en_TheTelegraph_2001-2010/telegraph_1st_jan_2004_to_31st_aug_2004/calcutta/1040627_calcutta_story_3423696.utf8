				 All game, glib and glam				 																																																											Tired of the soppy soaps? Try the game shows, or the lifestyle talks. If loads of fun laced with a dash of attitude is what you are looking for, tune in to the Bengali beam. Take your pick from the plethora of wacky, even over-the-top game, contest, lifestyle and fantasy shows swamping Alpha, ETV, Tara and Akash Bangla.				 																																																											Though soaps remain the bread-and-butter of the small screen, TV producers are equally eager to dish out the jam for clearly-defined target audience groups. Non-fiction slots dont attract advertisements, but they are essential to spice up the programme profile. The popularity of such shows enhances the image of the channel, explains J.K. Roy, business head, Alpha Bangla.On your marks				 																																																											Be it Barishaler Bor Kolkatar Kone, Haun Maun Khaun or Chhokbaji, the game-show format boasting loud, in-your-face humour has clicked big time with Bengali viewers. Its just a logical extension of wholehearted fun. While doing a lot of work for TV, I realised that there are no spaces for silent introspection. Kaun Banega Crorepati inspired me to think along the lines of an entertaining game show, says Arjun Gourisaria of Black Magic, who conceived Rojgere Ginni for ETV and Haun Maun Khaun for Alpha Bangla.				 																																																											Targeted at the 18-25 age group, the do-or-die contest for college-goers Haun Maun Khaun is pulling in elderly viewers as well. The shows fixture is a team of celebrities that perks up the glamour quotient 				 																																																											Quick wit, a round of household chores, cracking a few family problems  all these have been woven in to interest the young crowd along with their families. Its a wholesome family entertainer that doesnt look like sermonising, says Mir, who anchors the show in trademark style. But we try not to go overboard, keeping the senior viewers in mind.				 																																																											Game shows break the monotony, give the viewers a choice, but also come with an expiry tag. These shows command instant viewership, but turn stale with long exposure, adds Roy.What women want				 																																																											Most TV programmes are women-oriented because the only FMCG major sponsoring them is Hindustan Lever Ltd, which has the largest kitty of products for women, says Roy of Alpha Bangla. Take ETVs Rojgere Ginni and Sreemati or Alphas Dhanyi Meye and Nari, Taras Taka Na Sona or Akashs Shrimati Buddhimati. If one rolls out tips on how to spruce up the kitchen garden or rustle up a dish, the other tests the IQ or handicraft skills. Whatever be the content, all the shows depend heavily on the female viewer to work wonders. Our programmes like Showcase and Esho Amar Ghare, an interior dcor show compered by actress Chaiti Ghosal, have been designed to attract sponsors like jewellery houses, admits a spokesperson for Tara Bangla.M/FTV, here we come				 																																																											What games and the gift of the gab do for some, oomph does for others. With the stylish and the saucy grabbing eyeballs, you have models flashing a leg and talking pillow while anchoring the music show Fully Fatafati Fantasy on Tara Bangla, in true MTV-style. We feature a lot of MTV albums which is why the programme has been designed in that way, reveals the channel spokesperson. In Showcase on the same channel, model Pinky keeps viewers abreast of the hip and the happening.				 																																																											With variety very much the spice of (small-screen) life, local channel surfing was never more fun, or fashionable.Catching up with Koko				 																																																											Talk theatre and her eyes sparkle, her smile broadens. The award-winning actress loses no time in telling you just how much she is missing out on the stage, because of the screen.				 																																																											I hardly get to do theatre these days, rues Konkona Sen Sharma, in town to host Odeon 2004 for the third year running.				 																																																											Right now, I am actually quite bored of acting in films. You have to sit and wait for hours on the sets. Then, you always have to take care of your makeup and dress, which is very annoying. And your own contribution is so less I would rather pursue theatre seriously. Stage acting is much more difficult than films, rattles off the three-film-old actress.				 																																																											But the Page 3 scribe sure has her hands full with filmi assignments at the moment. Starting with Madhur Bhandarkars Page 3, in which she plays a celeb-hunting journalist, Konkona has four releases lined up till December 04.				 																																																											In Page 3, the character, Madhavi Sharma, is very much like me. But I did go around Mumbai, travelled in local trains and visited a publication office to get the hang of things. Shooting for this film was a great experience. There were parties in the film that were attended by several celebrities who play themselves. I met a professional Page 3 person there. I never knew such a thing existed, says Koko (to family and friends).				 																																																											Then theres Amavas, a Hindi horror film directed by Siddharth Srinivas, where she plays a medical student living with a friend in a Mumbai barsati. The horror film genre has been highly neglected in India. But Amavas is a very well-narrated and stylised horror film. The story revolves around a night when something happens to us, says Konkona. Her co-actors: Victor Banerjee and Mahesh Manjrekar.				 																																																											Next up are a couple of English films. Amu, by Los Angeles-based documentary film-maker Sonali Basu, will find Konkona donning the look of an Indo-American girl, while for Manu Rawals Chai Pani Etc (which was screened at Cannes this year) she slips into a double role. To get my role right in Amu, I stayed in the US for a month, did workshops and picked up the American accent, explains Konkona, who has Brinda Karat playing her screen-mother in the film.				 																																																											Aparna Sens daughter, of course, nurtures a none-too-secret desire to follow in her film-maker mothers footsteps. Someday, I would like to switch to direction, if I have the talent, she trails off.Girl uninterrupted: Shonal Rawat plays show-stopper				 																																																											 Ramp shows, commercials, music videos, TV shows, film offers  girl uninterrupted Shonal Rawat has her platter full right now. The svelte beauty, who was in hometown Calcutta early this week for a Wigan and Leigh fashion show, will soon be seen as a TV show anchor. Though I have some offers for soaps as well, I dont want to get into acting just now, says she. Next up is a music video  good ol Kishore Kumar remixed  with our leggy lady in the lead. O meri Shonal re, Shonal re?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Borderline demand and dues discipline
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Visitors at the Cable TV Show 2004, which kicked off on Thursday at Netaji Indoor Stadium. Picture by Aranya Sen																								A lambasting of the central government on the implementation of conditional access system (CAS) and a plea for equal opportunity from operators in neighbouring Bangladesh marked Day One of the Cable TV Show 2004 at Netaji Indoor Stadium.																								The annual event draws around 300 operators from Bangladesh. Making a strong case for Bangladeshi channels was Nurul Alam, chief adviser of Cable Operators Association of Bangladesh (COAB).																								All the free-to-air and pay channels that are popular in India are shown by us in Bangladesh. However, our popular entertainment channels such as Channel i, ATN Bangla and NTV are not shown by operators here, complained Alam.																								We dont expect these channels, which are as good as the Bengali channels shown here, to be beamed across India but only in West Bengal where there is a Bengali-speaking majority, he went on.																								Carrying these would also not incur additional expense, he argued, since all of them are free-to-air. No immediate answers were forthcoming from Alams Calcutta counterparts.																								Earlier, at the inauguration, chief guest mayor Subrata Mukherjee was missing in action, leaving the stage for Sarla Maheswari. The member of Parliament launched a scathing attack on the Centre for its haste-gone-waste on CAS.																								The government did not consider issues in depth while taking steps to implement CAS, she said, going on to allege that there is a strong anti-CAS sentiment in Chennai, the only place where it has been rolled out till date.																								Meanwhile, away from the festivities of the cable show, steps are being taken to penalise defaulting operators, as per the common code-of-conduct agreed upon by multi-system operators (MSOs) recently.																								RPG Netcom, the citys largest MSO, has been switching off operators on the citys fringes and districts for non-payment of dues. Switch-offs have been reported from Hooghly, Barasat, Khardah, Garden Reach and Belghoria.																								But as soon as the defaulting operators are paying up, we are reconnecting them, said a senior official of RPG Netcom. Five operators were reconnected on Thursday, he added.																								Operators in areas with dense population are not being targeted as yet so that viewers are inconvenienced as little as possible, claimed RPG Netcom.																								The other MSOs are waiting till their next meet on February 25. Both Manthan and SitiCable officials said notices are being sent out to defaulting operators, after which further disciplinary action will be taken.

 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Slash and bleed to give cops the slip
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Every time Chand Mohammad was caught in the act of stealing, he would slash himself with a blade, let blood ooze out and put the police and onlookers in a dilemma over whether to catch him or let him go.																								But his ruse failed on Sunday evening, after he lifted a passengers cell phone on a crowded bus on AJC Bose Road. The police saw no reason to take pity on him. After a few minutes at SSKM Hospital, Chand landed up in the lock-up of Park Street police station. 																								He told officers during interrogation that on seeing him bleeding, the cops had allowed him to flee several times in the past. An officer admitted that a number of cut-marks were found on Chands chest and face.Arresting an injured creates a number of legal problems. We dont mind if the accused is a notorious criminal. But if he happens to be a petty thief, we usually dont want to be involved in such complications, an officer explained.																								Around 6 pm on Sunday, Chand boarded a south-bound private bus on AJC Bose Road. Immediately after stealing the cell phone, he got off and started running. The victim, too, raised a hue and cry, which alerted cops on patrol. Sergeant Amitabha Ghosh and two of his colleagues ran after Chand.																								Chand boarded another private bus. Police, too, followed him. On seeing the cops inside the bus, I decided to try the trick again. I took out a small safety razor from my mouth and slashed my right shoulder, Chand confessed during interrogation.

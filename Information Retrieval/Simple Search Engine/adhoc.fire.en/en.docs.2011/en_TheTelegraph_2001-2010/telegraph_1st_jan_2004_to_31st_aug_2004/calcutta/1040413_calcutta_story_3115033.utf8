The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Taking the heat in its stride, a select gathering went on to enjoy the remains of a pleasant season that just passed us by.																					Romantic poets like Keats and Shelley rubbed shoulders with some evergreen Rabindrasangeet as the whos who of Calcutta convened for an evening titled A Farewell to Spring, conceptualised by Sujoy and presented by Spandan.																					The unlikely venue of London Pub at The Golden Park was bursting at the seams as invitees jostled to catch snatches of poetry and music from theatre personalities Renu Roy and Dolly Basu, PR veteran Rita Bhimani, actor June Maliah, Rabindrasangeet exponents Suchanda Ghosh and Saheb Chatterjee, singer Ditipriya Lahiri and Exide divisional head Barun Das.																					We didnt want to bid farewell to spring in an archaic manner. So, we chose an eclectic mix of classical and contemporary forms to appeal to a wider cross-section, explained Sujoy.																					The evening proceeded to marry romantic poetry with original compositions by the panelists, while the music that followed blended east with the west  from Tagores Amaar Praner Pore Chole Gelo Re to Abbas Hasta Maniana.																					Whats next, surely not an ode to sweltering summer? Why not? interjects Renu, every season has its own beauty. In fact, we plan to turn the entire calendar into an extravaganza of song and dance!

Not surprisingly, The Night of the Don at Cloud 9 was treated like any other regular party this weekend. All attempts at turning the resto bar into a dons lair with innocuous cut-outs of huge playing cards, dice, snakes and skulls fell flat, though the ammunition crates and guns (all fake, of course) piled at the entrance did raise an odd eyebrow. 																					Some were sporting enough to dress according to the occasion in black overcoats, leather jackets and bandanas with a few girls turning it on in slinky black-and-gold numbers jazzed up with faux fur throws.																					The rest were just out to have their usual weekend fun. Repeated requests by the head-turner MCs to try a hand at theme games like Roulette and Dominoes yielded poor results, but a tarot-card reader sitting pretty in a corner with an apology of a crystal ball and a few flickering glass candles attracted much attention.																					DJ Sooraj kept up the tempo with a lot of pop, hip-hop and house, apart from evergreen theme tracks like James Bond and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.																					There was plenty of action at the bar as well, with vodka-based Test-Tube Shots, Smirnoff-laced Silver Bullets and Tequila  vodka Venom Shots being the flavours of the April night.

Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Crispy twist																					In a bid to pep up its regular Chinese and Thai menu, Pepper Chino is hosting a chopsuey festival from April 9 to 30.																					Different kinds of chopsuey are identified by their distinctive sauces that impart a unique flavour to each, says chef Durga.																					So, watch out for the Hunan style (white garlic sauce flavoured with Chinese rice wine) or the Hong Kong style (a sauce with spicy flavour), with Devils sauce (spicy chilli sauce with a blend of garlic and celery) and Oyster sauce (with ginger and wine flavour).																					With flavour, come freebies. Every order is complimented with a free mocktail  Strawberry Maniac (strawberry juice served with a tinge of spice and lime, topped with minty froth), Mango Tango (chilled mango extract blended with lime served over crushed ice), More Orangiee (a blend of orange and grenadine syrup), Rola Cola (a mix of cola and pepper with a hint of lemon), Between the Sheets (mint, khus and cream) and Summer Set (spicy tomato juice served on ice).																																														Cool off																					An eclectic collection of cotton garments in vibrant shades is Sashas toast to the summer of 04. The non-profit organisation unveiled a month-long exhibition with activist Nafisa Ali and artist Wasim Kapoor. From saris to ready-to-wear, accessories to home linen, body packs to herbal tea  theres something for everyone to look his or her best in the heat. 																					The ready-to-wear section has been enriched with indigo-hued cotton skirts, tops, wrap-arounds and capris in tie-and-dye and batik prints. The short cotton kurtis of phulia and kalamkari weave in earthy tones exude a cool, comfy look.																					The accessories section has all the kind of jewellery to go with the colourful saris  thewa, dokra or knotted-stone ornaments for anything between Rs 100 and Rs 3,000. The outfits can be teamed up with scarves, stoles and bags.

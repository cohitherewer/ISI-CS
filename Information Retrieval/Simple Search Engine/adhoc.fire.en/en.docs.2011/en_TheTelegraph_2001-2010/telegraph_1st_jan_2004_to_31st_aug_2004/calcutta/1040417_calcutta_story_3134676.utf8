The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Tax hike taken to apex court
 																											- Salt Lake residents seethe over unjust evaluation for property bill SANJAY MANDAL 																								The Salt Lake municipality is set to post new property tax bills, but the townships residents have taken the decision to the Supreme Court. Bidhannagar Welfare Association, a prominent lobby of residents, has moved the apex court against the Calcutta High Court division bench judgment, allowing the civic body to collect tax as per the Central Valuation Boards assessment.																								We filed a writ in the apex court on April 8, association secretary Ramen Das said on Friday. The valuation boards recommendation for a steep hike in tax was unjust and would be a huge burden on residents, he added.																								On December 24, 2003, a high court division bench of Justice Ashok Ganguly and Justice Debi Prosad Sengupta set aside a 1998 single-bench order that restrained Bidhannagar Municipality from collecting tax as recommended by the valuation board. The 1998 order was passed on a petition by the residents forum. 																								The bench observed that the municipalities had decided rightly to have the assessment conducted by the board and added that the recommendations were balanced and in no way violated any provision of the law. 																								Armed with the high court ruling, the authorities of Salt Lake, South Dum Dum and several other municipalities drew up plans to collect property tax with arrears from residents. We have asked the municipality to send bills immediately to residents based on the new tax structure. Since the court directive is in our favour, there is no bar in collecting taxes by the new rate, said Deepankar Mukherjee, secretary of the state municipal affairs department.																								In Salt Lake, property tax is likely to rise by 22 per cent, and the hike could be as high as 30 per cent in several other municipalities, officials said.																								We are ready to issue bills as per the boards assessment and the government has already given us the go-ahead. The process will start once the elections are over, said Dilip Gupta, Salt Lakes municipality chairman. 																								Civic earnings had been Rs 6.5 crore in the last fiscal, against a target of Rs 7 crore. However, once we start collecting tax at the new rate, along with the arrears, the income will rise manifold, Gupta said. He pegged the rise by Rs 3 crore in the next fiscal.																								However, the assessment has left the residents seething. It was not conducted by technical experts, but by casual workers engaged by the valuation board, alleged K.S. Sengupta, executive committee member of Bidhannagar House-Owners Association. 																								There are huge discrepancies in the valuation of different buildings constructed in the same year and covering an equal area. In most cases, the building-owners were not even consulted during the assessment, another official of the association said.

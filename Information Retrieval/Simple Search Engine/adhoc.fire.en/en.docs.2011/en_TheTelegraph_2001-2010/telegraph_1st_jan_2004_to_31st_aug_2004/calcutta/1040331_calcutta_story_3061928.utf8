(Above) Nargis and Supriya Devi, former regulars at the first store It has an 80-year history of spinning silk into gold, with a hand in dressing Nargis, Supriya Devi, Chhabi Biswas, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, P.C. Sorcar Senior, Usha Uthup and Tanusree Shankar.But Indian Silk House has now turned to what it hopes will be greener pastures  pretty young things as well as the woman next door.After eight decades at its north Calcutta address, the retail veteran has gone contemporary with a swanky new outlet on Lake Road. Exclusive saris, dress materials and salwaar-kameezes have been introduced, hoping to give an old brand a more fashionable edge.In 1926, Indian Silk House started out with a small outlet at Srimani Bazaar on Cornwallis Street. They shifted base to the present College Street outlet in 1936 and soon had the citys smart set hooked with their wide collection of silks, strengthened by the Non-Cooperation Movement.The aristocratic class was shunning foreign goods because of the political climate in the country. Our handloom silks started selling like hot cakes at that time, reminisces proprietor Dilip Samsukha.Indian Silk House Agencies at Rashbehari, a sister concern, opened in 1971. The loyal clientele base grew with time, as the store continued to come up with contemporary designs and motifs. Their in-house designers and weavers based in Murshidabad, Bankura, Varanasi, Bangalore, Kancheepuram and Arni produced Benarasis, Balucharis, Kanjeevarams, Valkalams...We have always tried to keep a finger on the pulse of the market. For example, in the 1960s, we suddenly found a huge demand for saris in light colours, not bright shades. We put our heads together and transformed our collection almost overnight, recalls Dilip.This innovative streak has earned them kudos, notable amongst which was the certificate for best designing in silk at the Congress exhibition in 1928, and being adjudged best Indian outlet in the craft of silk by Deshapriya Jatindra Mohan Sengupta. Customer and weaver inputs coupled with our own intuition is what the owner feels helps them keep in tune with the times.However, red tape finally led to stagnation at the College Street store, hindering expansion plans in recent years. Simple matters like installing an air-conditioner, renovation inside the shop and increasing the power load all require permissions and grants from the College Street Corporation Market authorities, where we are tenants, explains Dilip.So the simpler solution was a new store in a more happening locale. In the new store, the focus is on exclusivity in a very contemporary collection, stresses Kavita Samsukha, Dilips daughter-in-law and proprietor of the new branch. Real zari Kanjeevarams and Maheshwari silks rustle alongside salwar-kameez sets in cotton, georgette, crepe and a variety of silks embellished with zardozi, embroidery and sequins. The outlet will host its first exhibition, April 6 to 10.Though time and fashion may have overtaken it, the College Street original will always remain a part of Calcuttas shopping landscape. Whether this bid for modernity can work the same magic remains to be seen.SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

Picture by Pabitra Das																								Amidst the clamour for non-payment to Sony by some cable operators, Sony Entertainment Television (SET) is plotting ahead and plotting big. And Calcutta is figuring in its plans, big time.																								Its going to be another good year, promises Shantonu Aditya, president, SET Discovery, adding that a lot of importance is being attached by the broadcaster to the east, particularly Calcutta.																								Its one of our strongest markets, where activities have been very high, says Aditya.																								Recent visits by Kapil Dev (Dil Se) and Jassi (Jaisi Koi Nahin) bear testimony to that. A drop-in by brand ambassador Mandira (Extraa) Bedi is also scheduled towards the end of this month as part of the Mandira Aapke Ghar event.																								But then, theres the matter of a section of operators in the city keen to rob Sony to pay Ten Sports, with the sports channel seeking greater declaration on the eve of the India-Pakistan series.																								Im quite surprised, says Aditya from Mumbai. But we have checked with each multi-system operator (MSO) in the city who, in turn, checked with the operators. We have received a 100 per cent confirmation that all operators will continue to pay for the Sony bouquet.																								Tougher measures are not ruled out. In case payment is not made, we will issue sufficient notice and then switch off, if necessary, warns the Sony man.																								But why target an entertainment bouquet  one with hits such as Jassi to make up for a sports channel? I really dont know what is behind all this, admits Aditya.																								Our programmes and channels have been doing really well. Around 12 SET programmes are in the TAM list of top 100, and of those, Jassi, Kkusum, CID, Crime Patrol and Devi are doing particularly well.																								SET, in its bouquet called The One Alliance, has eight channels  Sony, MAX, Discovery, HBO, AXN, NDTV 24x7, NDTV India and Animal Planet. Plans for 2004 include adding to the bouquet.																								Sources said Animax, an animation channel on the lines of Cartoon Networks POGO, Discovery Lifestyle, dealing with the lives of the rich and famous (which would also mark the first simultaneous world-wide launch for a channel in India), and a regional channel are in the pipeline.

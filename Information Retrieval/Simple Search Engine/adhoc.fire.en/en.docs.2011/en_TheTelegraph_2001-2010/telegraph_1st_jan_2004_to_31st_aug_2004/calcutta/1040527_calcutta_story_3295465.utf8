 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 The serious business of watching movies
 															- Film appreciation course for school-goers 				 	 Participants are all attention as instructors train them in various aspects of the celluloid dream world. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								When most teenagers are happy making the most of their summer holidays surfing channels, a few others are busy learning how to watch films.																								The bunch that watches clips from Bunuel and Eisenstein for hours, grabs every word the instructor speaks and hurriedly jots them down at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre is sure of what it wants to be. Serious viewers, and not couch potatoes.																								About 19 school-going children (a few have just left school) have enrolled for the 11-day film appreciation course, Reading Film, that the Seagull centre started on May 24.																								The idea is not to produce film-makers, but cultivate a habit of observing and analysing what they see, said film scholar Somnath Zutshi, who conceived the 11-day film appreciation course, along with animator Sukanya Ghosh.																								The course faculty comprises Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute teacher Biren Das Sharma, head of the Jadavpur University film studies department Moinak Biswas, Zutshi and Ghosh. The teachers aim to develop in their students an eye for detail, an ability to read between the lines and a grasp of the mechanism behind some stunning cinematic effects through illustrated talks, film screenings and exercises.																								On Tuesday, Zutshi used film clips and illustrations to explain the evolution of cinema to his eager students. I want to take the kids through the various aspects of film-making. I will also deal at length with the origin and social background of Indian cinema, he added.																								If Das Sharma discussed film language in his first class, Biswas will take up Indian cinema and Ghosh will talk on animation film. This apart, Zutshi plans to give a lecture on deconstructing popular cinema. A discourse on documentary films and experimental films is also being planned. 																								Though targeted primarily at school-goers, the course has attracted a huge response from various age-groups. Seagull has been working with children as part of its Peaceworks project. Though the film appreciation course is not linked with that, working with schoolchildren seemed the obvious choice for us. We had to turn away quite a few, as we didnt want more than 20 to 25 participants, Zutshi added.																								For the kids, the course has been most rewarding. Before attending these classes, I had no idea about the history of cinema or how a film is made, said Calcutta International School pass-out Pranadhika Sinha, who wants to get into film-making.

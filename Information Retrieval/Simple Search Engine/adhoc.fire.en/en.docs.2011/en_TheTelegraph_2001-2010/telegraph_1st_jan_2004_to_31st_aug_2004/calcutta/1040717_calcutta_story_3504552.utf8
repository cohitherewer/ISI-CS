The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 17, 2004  Calcutta Column

	 The wholesale fish market at Patipukur is in a deplorable condition. A light shower makes the market and the surrounding areas muddy and slippery. Next to the market is an open drain which overflows during monsoon. Water accumulates in the market area. A market in such a wretched condition is a disgrace to a metropolitan city. Will the authorities plaster the walls and repair the floor to give the famous market a new look?Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park 
	 The seats in degree colleges, especially in honours courses in science subjects, have not been increased in comparison with the increasing number of successful candidates. Moreover, the higher secondary examination pass-outs do not get proper information about the few colleges that offer such courses. It will be of great help to the students if the colleges offer guidelines on the Net on how to get admitted in science honours courses. Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane

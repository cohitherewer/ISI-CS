 Saturday, July 03, 2004 Fun spot for little hearts

Just roll a green carpet, give them a couple of baby slips and slides and they are happily entertained for hours on end.																								The Kidzee centre at Howrah that triples as a playhouse, nursery and an activity area fills in a void for the locality as far as childs play is concerned.																								There is not a single park in the neighbourhood where kids can play. Weve tried to make this place more inviting for them by spreading a soft grass-green carpet out, hanging a couple of animal cut-outs and basically giving kids a lot of open space to run and play around, says director Jayanta Chowdhury.																								A franchisee of the Zee Interactive Learning System under the Zee Education Group, this centre follows the Zee syllabus prescribed for all Kidzee schools. The staff strength of two teachers, two assistant teachers and two attendants have also been trained and appointed by Zee.																								The 3,000 sq ft-area is divided into a central play zone and five classrooms replete with baby furniture and fixtures in bright shades. While the play area is fitted with tiny slides and climbing ropes for the development of motor skills, there are provisions for a childrens library, a computer and other educative games and accessories in the classrooms.																								Though its common practice for parents to send their children to pre-schools to help prepare for admission tests at primary schools, we dont burden them with lessons all the time. Our approach is to teach through fun and games, explains course counsellor Madhulina Banerjee.																								Children between the age of one-and-a-half years to two-and-a-half years are enrolled in the playhouse section, where they do little else but enjoy themselves. Those between two-and-a-half years to four-and-a-half years are taken into the nursery, where simple lessons are imparted in the garb of games.																								The space is transformed into an activity centre for older kids and teenagers after the tots are packed off. The curriculum lists a host of extra-curricular activities like crafts, science and astronomy clubs, both instrumental and vocal music classes, games, fitness, yoga, story telling sessions, fun with maths, computers and even a movie club with a big screen and Dolby digital sound.

Special workshops and camps are a regular feature that keep restless souls pleasantly occupied at this fun stop for kids. 																								Essentially a play-house and Montessori, Kidz Konclave now serves the multiple roles of a day-care centre, library, remedial class and club in fully air-conditioned comfort. 																								Going by the motto of understanding children, building partnerships, establishing a flexible learning environment, supporting play and exploring content, Kidz Konclave regularly organises meaningful sessions with experts and celebrities. 																								The most recent of these was a three-day Mother Earth workshop. Meant to make children aware of the wonders of nature through exhibitions, demonstrations and dramatics, the meet took children through basics like pottery making. 																								Children were seen trying their hand at the wheel, enjoying the sanction to soil their hands, a pleasure otherwise denied to them in the plastic environment they grow up in. 																								We try to go beyond the usual brick and mortar features and extend our scope to the great outdoors, says Indira Sengupta, chief co-ordinator of Kidz Konclave. 																								They claim to have a calendar full of such camps that include nature-watch tours, eco-excursions and other hands-on learning experiences for children to have a field day. 																								There is a lot of reliance on music and performing arts to make the process of learning more interesting and effective as well. You can say we literally make a song and dance about pre-primary education, jokes Sengupta. 																								Future plans include new branches in the city and a line of school merchandise under the same brand name.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

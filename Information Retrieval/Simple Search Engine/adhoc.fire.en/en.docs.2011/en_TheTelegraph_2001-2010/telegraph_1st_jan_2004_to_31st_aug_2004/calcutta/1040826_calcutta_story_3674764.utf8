 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Taps cut to mop up tax
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Eyeing an additional mop-up of Rs 30 crore before the Pujas, the civic authorities on Wednesday resumed their offensive against landlords who have not been paying property tax. Water connections to five premises  three in north Calcutta and two in Chowringhee  were snapped.																								The authorities have identified 67 premises, the owners of which have failed to clear their property tax dues despite notices from mayor Subrata Mukherjee. On Tuesday, the mayor had asked municipal commissioner Debasis Som to take immediate action against the defaulters.																								According to mayor-in-council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee, the water supply department has started blocking the supply of filtered water to the premises and sealing deep tubewells in their compounds. 																								Figuring on the hit list of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are nationalised banks, commercial houses, buildings let out for functions, apartments, clinics and institutions, explained Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer on special duty to the mayor.																								Of the 67 blacklisted premises, the top six defaulters together owe Rs 17 crore to the civic body. Most of the premises are on Chowringhee Road, NS Road, SP Mukherjee Road, CIT Road, Alipore Road and Topsia Road.																								Among the defaulters is a nationalised bank that has 21 buildings across the city. It owes us Rs 13 crore. Its employees had abused and manhandled my staff when they went to the head office to put up a notice, said mayor Mukherjee. 																								I must take harsh action against them, to set an example. Assaulting my staff is akin to assaulting me, the mayor asserted.																								On Monday, representatives from the bank had visited the CMC headquarters to discuss the matter with commissioner Som. But the latter refused to meet them, saying: I dont talk to public relations officers. Tell your highest authorities in the city to make an appointment with me. 																								According to the civic bodys assessment department, around Rs 300 crore has remained outstanding since 1964, of which Rs 130 crore was realised in 2001 under a waiver-of-interest scheme.

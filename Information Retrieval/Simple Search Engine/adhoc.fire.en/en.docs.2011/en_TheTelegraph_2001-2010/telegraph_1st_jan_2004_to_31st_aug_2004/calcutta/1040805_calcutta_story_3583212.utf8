The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 05, 2004 Reel brush with karigar craft, sport and savoury treat for allZEESHAN JAWED, SANGITA S. GUHA ROY Soumitra Chatterjee admires a handicraft at DakshinapanThe lines between tinsel town and politics have become virtually non-existent. But on Wednesday, the stars were not campaigning for a political cause. An actor and a politico got together to back the artisans of rural India.The Handloom and Handicraft exhibition at Mrignayani, the Madhya Pradesh emporium at Dakshinapan, saw Soumitra Chatterjee and IT minister Manab Mukherjee attend a live demonstration with rural craftsmen and weavers, highlighting the skill required and challenges faced in the traditional art forms.The karigars demonstrated the stages of production garments go through before finally hitting the racks. The craftsmen displayed the art from various parts of Madhya Pradesh, such as Guna, Tikamgarh, Raigarh and Bhopal, working on charkhas. As one weaver wove his magic on a kosa sari, a woman demonstrated how the threads used to make it are extracted from the fruit. Another craftsman from Tikamgarh shaped a statuette of a woman out of brass. Proline picksTop gearBranded wear just got more pocket friendly with Proline seeking to reposition itself in eastern India. The mall culture finally having taken off in Calcutta, the sportswear brand has opened an exclusive Proline showroom at City Centre, Salt Lake.Casual is still the word they are swearing by, in a bid to reach out to metrosexuals across the board. Semi-formal shirts and trousers are the new additions to the T-shirt-heavy range, with trendy checks appearing as a recurring feature. Tees get a new look as well with funky themes and motifs.We have targeted the age group of 25 to 35 years for our campaign and our clothes reflect the same spirit, said distributor Vijay Dugar. Prices, he stressed, are reasonable with T-shirts priced between Rs 225 and Rs 550, shirts at Rs 685 to Rs 750 and trousers at Rs 799 to Rs 1,099.The extensive range of FILA fare is another attraction, with Proline being the licensee for the sports brand across SAARC countries.This is the first time an exclusive FILA collection has been stocked under one roof, said Dugar. The line includes colourful tees, tracks and shoes. And you dont necessarily have to be a good sport to shell out Rs 990 to Rs 2,000 for a pair of FILA sneakers, Rs 999 to Rs 1,099 for tracks and Rs 399 to Rs 599 for the T-shirts.

 																											- Murder-bid convicts rapped for plight of victim, plea for term cut OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday slapped showcause notices on two convicts, sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment by a trial court for attempted murder. 																								Ajoy Sen and Satyajit Dutta were asked why their sentences should not be extended to life imprisonment, considering the nature of the crime.																								The victim, Behala realtor Bijan Kundu, is now confined to his wheelchair, suffering from acute paralysis in the lower half of the body because of a bullet still lodged close to his spine. According to doctors, any attempt to remove the bullet surgically may kill Kundu.																								The division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Alok Basu also criticised the trial court, as well as the state government, for their handling of the case. The government should have taken the initiative to file an appeal before Calcutta High Court against the order of the trial court, the bench commented.																								On the morning of April 7, 2000, two young men, armed with guns and knives, barged into Kundus Behala home and attacked him. They shot him in the stomach from point-blank range. The assailants fled and Kundu was rushed to hospital, where an emergency operation saved his life. But the doctors did not risk reaching a bullet lodged near his spine.																								Kundu identified his attackers as Sen, alias Mahanto, and Dutta, alias Tisu. The duo had been demanding protection money from the realtor and threatening him with dire consequences as he was refusing to pay up. Behala police arrested the duo and a sessions judge at Alipore court handed down the sentence.																								Challenging the order of the trial court, the convicts moved an appeal in the high court, along with their bail applications. The division bench of Justice Talukdar and Justice Bose heard both the appeal and the application on Wednesday.																								Petitioners counsel Sekhar Bose told the court that his clients had no connection with the attempted murder of Kundu. Public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah then drew the attention of the bench to Kundus predicament.																								After hearing both sides, the bench said: When an accused is convicted in a attempt-to-murder case and the injury of the victim is serious, the court should sentence the person to imprisonment for life. The bail prayers were rejected.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, July 26, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The roads at the Park Circus seven-point crossing have recently been widened. However, the zebra crossings have been positioned in such a way that they lead the pedestrian on to the island in the middle of the junction. It is both confusing and dangerous to cross the road this way. The zebra crossings should, instead, connect pavements on either side of the road. Jamala M. Zakaria, Beniapukur Road. 
	A waterpipe next to a public urinal on Lee Road, in front of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, needs a tap. The water gushes out by day and night, and much of it is wasted. Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.

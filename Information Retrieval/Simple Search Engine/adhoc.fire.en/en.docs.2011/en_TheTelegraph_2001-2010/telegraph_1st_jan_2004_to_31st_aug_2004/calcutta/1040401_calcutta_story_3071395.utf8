 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Students of IIMC have carried out a novel evaluation-research project on the benefits of organic fertilisers																								Its a marriage of cutting-edge management tools with the values of focused social service that is designed to discourage small farmers from selling their milch cattle for slaughter in the dry season, boost Indias organic manure exports, enthuse potential investors and possibly sow the seeds of a new national agriculture policy.																								Students of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) have conducted a novel evaluation-research project for People for Animals (PFA), an animal-welfare NGO, to establish that organic fertilisers are 18-20 per cent cheaper than their inorganic counterparts on pure economic grounds.																								The project was part of Initiative for Community Action (INCA), a programme by IIMC students in which faculty members guide them for service to those who serve others, according to Surendra Munshi, INCA chairman and sociology professor at IIMC. This is a social service that is offered in the form of free management consultancy to voluntary organisations and others doing useful social work. Students get no credit for their projects, nor do INCA projects form a part of their academic requirements. But all those who have participated in these projects have reported the satisfaction of a learning experience not available elsewhere, Munshi adds.																								The IIM students spent 150 manhours on the project, Marketing strategy amp; viability study of using gobar (cow dung) as a substitute of inorganic fertilisers. They visited several dairy farms and catchment areas to evaluate logistics and viability. 																								The draft prepared dealt with marketing strategy (including positioning, pricing, promotion and distribution), inbound logistics (like raw material costs) and process study. The marketing plan addressed: choosing a customer (plantation/farm-owner), studying his fertiliser needs, identifying the possibility of substituting it with dung manure, doing the cost-benefit study, identifying cost-plus advantages and preparing a Powerpoint presentation.																								Some of the positives of organic manure highlighted by the report are: it improves soil structure and its moisture-retention capacity, converts the menace of weed into productive virtuous material for soil improvement, provides food and fodder free from pesticides and other chemical residues, reduces consumption of fossil fuels...																								Mudit Agarwal, who coordinated the project for the INCA team, agrees. The mandate was to try and derive value from animals so that we can tell society to care for them. It was a most fulfilling exercise, since it enabled us to use the broad tools from our classroom lessons to try and generate value. After all, we are part of societys ecosystem and its our duty to give back something in return for the benefits we get from the mute animals, he says.																								We wanted them to prepare a project which would interest the potential small investor, subsequently the chambers of commerce and eventually influence government policy, says Purnima Toolsidass, PFA trustee. Even though she thinks the project report is a little too academic, it can surely form the base for an agency with domain knowledge to carry the work forward.																								Agarwal, too, feels the second part of the assignment should be to sell the idea to those who can buy, the ultimate consumers, besides political leaders and decision-makers. For that, maybe, we need to go back to the drawing board and make minor or even major alterations to the report, he admits.

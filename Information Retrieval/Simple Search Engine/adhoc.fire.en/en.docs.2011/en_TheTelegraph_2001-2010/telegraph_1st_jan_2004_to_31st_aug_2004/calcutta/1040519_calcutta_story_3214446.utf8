 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Ethical edge to B-school course
 SUBHRO SAHA																								What is more important  doing the things right, or doing the right things? Is it important to listen to the latent and unarticulated needs of the consumer or just give him/her a lousy product in an attractive packaging and make hay while the sun shines?																								In this transaction-oriented era so often marked by over-promising and under-delivering, the corporates are increasingly seeing reason in investing in todays students to become tomorrows brand ambassadors. A city-based educational institution has embarked on a mission to gracefully evolve to a new value chain and enable management graduates become responsible and honest professionals.																								Integrity is at the core of Wigan amp; Leigh College (WLC)s ethics management curriculum on the Calcutta campus, a la Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, with stress on understanding the self, basics of ethics, business ethics and self-realisation. While there is an element of cynicism among the students in Mumbai and Delhi, Calcutta has been extremely receptive to the programme, points out Vinay Pasricha, director, WLC.																								The B-school hopes to harness the fresh ideas and essential vitality in college students and let them talk from a position of strength by lending them an empathetic ear. Today, a student is aware, connected and wants immediate action bullet points. But at the same time, we want to stop them from joining the rat race, since even if you win the race, you are still a rat. Instead, they must keep discovering themselves all the time and learn with empowerment, not directives, smiles ethics management guru K.S. Ahluwalia.																								He, along with wife Harpreet, manages a significant part of the ethics programme at WLC through the structured process of Excalibre. The programme, enshrined in core human values, helps choose freedom-based goals by cultivating natural motivation and by aligning natural talents to profession. You must add will to your skills, because if you dont, someone else will do it, says Ahluwalia.																								With 40 hours devoted to the ethics programme in every semester, the aim of the faculty is to give the students resources, education and a vision and fade away from the scene. The long-term objective is to make them happier with what they are doing, which would automatically develop them into good human beings and improve their effectiveness and productivity, observes Pasricha.																								The Excalibre team works in the key facilitation areas of strategic affairs, behavioural sciences, skill enhancements, transactional spheres and personal growth, besides dealing with corporate value re-engineering, human potential surveys and talent pool management.																								It also offers customised counselling for corporations, individuals, associations, forums, students and academia in domains of goal-setting, peer pressure management, relationship management and adolescence challenges.

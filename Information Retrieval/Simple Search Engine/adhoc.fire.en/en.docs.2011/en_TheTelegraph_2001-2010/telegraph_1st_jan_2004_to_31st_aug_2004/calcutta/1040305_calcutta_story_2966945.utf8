 Friday, March 05, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Alyque Padamsee, adman.You are active and swift, both physically and mentally. Oratory and eloquence move you. You can be persuasive and instinctively understand the mind of your opponent. Money matters could do with some care; though if you are in business, you can expect opulence. Lucky days: Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  Kusum Bhandari

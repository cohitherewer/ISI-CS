The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Nothing is but what is not
																								Appearances are deceptive, be it in the case of an individual, a situation or location, or even an environment. So the spirit of lively activity and cheerfulness of an apparently well-knit group of people has every possibility of being alarmingly disturbed by a sudden calamity, leaving everybody bewildered, helpless and despondent. This is what Continuity is all about. It deals with serious problems that exist in our daily lives; perils that secretly lurk in our midst, only to surface when we are least prepared to tackle them. In the play, members of a tele-film shooting unit seem to be enjoying themselves in the course of their hectic schedule. Though they are cordial to one another, certain odd incidents make an undercurrent of tension clearly palpable even from the outset, filling the audience with an eerie sense of premonition. Disaster finally strikes when the wife of the male lead falls seriously ill, destroying the equilibrium that prevailed.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Continuity, by Natyaanan																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

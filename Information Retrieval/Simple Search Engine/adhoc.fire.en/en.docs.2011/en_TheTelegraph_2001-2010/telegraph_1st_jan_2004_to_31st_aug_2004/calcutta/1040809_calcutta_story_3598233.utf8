Picture by Rashbehari Das																								The power of five shall rule the cultural scene in Bengal for the next year. On Saturday evening, five new Shalimar Anandabazar Patrika Adwitya winners in the fields of Rabindrasangeet, Lokgeeti, Indian classical music, recitation and dance were selected at the end of a state-wide talent hunt. 																								The Science City auditorium, the venue for the finals of the contest in its third year, had regional finalists from five regions vying for the honours. Music lovers flocked to the auditorium for one of the biggest cultural competition in the state. The strictly-for-women contest was co-sponsored by LG Electronics, Senco Gold Jewellery and Himalaya Herbals.																								Backstage nerves																								The scene was tense as finalists in each category lined up to present their very best. It all boiled down to one final shot at the crown for the women who had survived two rigorous elimination rounds. The best-of-lucks and reassuring hugs that these 24 ladies (there were just four participants in the recitation category, five in the others) exchanged went to show that all would go home with new friends, if not prizes.																								Fierce competition																								With little dividing the competitors, making the decision was difficult for the panel of judges including Partho Ghosh, Gauri Ghosh, Aloka Kanungo, Shantanu Bandopadhay, Ambali Praharaj and Lopamudra. I had to go through a very tough time making the decision as most participants came quite close, said Partho Ghosh.																								Awed audience																								For the 1,000-strong audience, there was more to look forward to than the contest. Judge Lopamudra presented a 20-minute performance, singing some of her most popular tracks, among them Jao pakhi and Akash dake. Actress Debasree Roy danced to Bengali folk numbers along with her troupe, Nataraj. Pop quizzes also kept them busy.																								Winners take all																								The decision, no matter how tough, had to be made. Debarati Nath from Calcutta won the first prize in the category of Rabindrasangeet, Nazrulgeeti and Dwijendrageeti while pocket-sized Moumita Mitra took away the top honours in the Indian classical vocals section with her powerful voice. It was 52-year-old Sandhya Bhattacharya who bagged the Lokgeeti award and also took the cake as far as public cheer was concerned.																								I have never been trained in music. I participated here as my youngest son thought I should, said the lady from Raiganj. City-based Rithika Ghosh was the show-stealer in the dance category with her Bharatanatyam performance while Amita Banerjee Sarkar from Jalpaiguri won the award in the recitation section.																								I have had to leave my one-and-a-half-year-old son back home to take part in the finals. This is a prize for him, said Amita. 																								Prime Music, a three-year-old music company, has come forward to release one CD for the five winners. We always look for fresh talent and this contest is a great chance for us to tap new voices, said singer Indranil Sen on behalf of the company.

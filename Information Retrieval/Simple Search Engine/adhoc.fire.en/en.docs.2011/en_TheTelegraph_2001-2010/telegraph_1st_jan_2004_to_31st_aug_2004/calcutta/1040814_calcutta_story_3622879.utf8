 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Fortress for final act
 A STAFF REPORTER																								On Friday afternoon, Alipore Central jail was turned into a fortress. After throwing a security blanket across the prison compound, senior police officers are on their toes to meet any eventuality.																								More than 150 police and Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel have been deployed on the prison premises. 																								Police and RAF personnel are surrounding the jail. No outsider is being allowed inside, said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south). 																								Our men were deployed at the gates of all high-rise buildings in the area. No outsider was allowed to enter the buildings on Friday, he added.																								Police have received reports that some people plan to climb on to the roofs of the high-rise buildings on Belvedere Road to witness the hanging. We do not want to take any chances, an officer said.																								The prison wall has a huge water reservoir adjacent to it. Police are keeping guard at the reservoir as well, since it stands at a strategic location  right across the wall are the gallows. 																								Fearing demonstrations against the hanging by various rights groups, four prison vans are being kept ready in front of the prison gates. 																								In the afternoon, a silent march by members of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) was dispersed by the police. 																								The procession kicked off from Hazra and was moving towards Alipore Central jail. When it was about to enter Judges Court Road, a posse of policemen intercepted it. 																								Traffic was not restricted in the afternoon. However, sources in the traffic police said Judges Court Road will be out of bounds from 2 am on Saturday, two-and-a-half hours before the execution. 																								Officers said security would be beefed up further on Friday night. The Alipore police station wore a deserted look in the afternoon. 																								Most of the cops have been put on the night shift, said an officer, among the handful manning the station in the afternoon. 																								Police officers were keeping their fingers crossed. We hope the night will pass off without a hitch. We can only relax after Dhananjoys body is taken away, an officer said. 																								Curious onlookers were seen trying to grab a view of what was happening inside. 																								There is nothing visible, said Maitreyee Ghosh, a local resident, who was peeping through the small iron gate beside the main entrance. 																								Passengers travelling on buses that plied past the prison were a curious lot, too. 																								Is it going to take place here? a commuter asked a policeman, pointing at Alipore Central jail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Fairytales do come true
 princess in her palace: Sabyasachis lived-in look was inspired by the everyday woman. He captured her mood, not in a studio, but in well-hidden south Calcutta corners. Picture by Pabitra Das It is safe to say the Frog Princess has been kissed. After Calcuttas Sabyasachi Mukherjee created a stir  catching the international eye, if not that of the national design circuit  on Day Five of Lakm India Fashion Week 2004, he was named best designer on Sunday night at the only competitive round of the display. At 11 am, Monday, The Good Life columnist had this to say about his dream run																								The last few days have been like a complete fairytale...																								At 1.30 am on Sunday night, I was chosen best designer at the Freedom from the Usual show, with Rajesh Pratap Singh and Rina Dhaka in second and third place. One piece from every designers collection was on show, judged by a panel of national and international judges. 																								The prizes for this are also very interesting. I will be sent as a delegate to the New York fashion week, Rajesh will be sent to Paris and Rina to Milan. It will be a great way to learn more about the business and international cuts and finishes. It will be like a grooming class.																								The response has been overwhelming. Albert Morris from Browns has been like a godfather to me. He is confident about me as well as my work.																								I wasnt happy with last years collection at all  it was more of a phanki baji line, but this year I was confident about my work. This is such a huge boost for Calcutta, and I am sure that Anamika (Khanna) will also go places very soon. She definitely has it in her.																								The sad thing about most people around is that they do not recognise your work till you have some kind of international exposure. Many designers present here felt that my collection was about being poor; that I was selling poverty to the West. But it is not that at all. It is about aspiring artistes and confidence and contentment.																								Monday was all about business. Apart from Browns and Saks, buyers from Hong Kong, Japan and Kuwait have also expressed interest. I dont know if it did well with domestic buyers. But I am not wishing to expand my network at home. I am concentrating now on the foreign market, and the boutiques here that stock my work will get back to me after Fashion Week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004  Rough ride into realitySMITA ROY CHOWDHURY, SUDESHNA BANERJEE AND HIMIKA CHAUDHURI Sunidhi Chauhan at the Power FM studio 															 Theres a new member in the MTV family. And for 21-year-old Rannvijay Singh, the first step on the journey towards fame wasnt an easy one. He had to go through the grind of biking through seven states of India in 40 days and prove his mettle in several other tough tasks before being selected as MTV Hero Honda Roadie 2003. 																					Rannvijay will lead the trail for the new set on MTV Hero Honda Roadies II, and host the reality show to be aired on MTV. The Calcutta auditions will take place at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on Tuesday. 																					The national level basketball player from Jalandhar belongs to a family of armymen and almost joined the Indian Army when the opportunity to participate in MTV Hero Honda Roadies 2003 came his way.																					My father is a colonel. I would have been the sixth generation from our family to be in the army. While my grandfather was with the Indian Army, all other generations preceding him worked with the British army, said the sports junkie.																					He, too, had finished a B.Com degree in Delhi and cleared the necessary examinations and interviews to follow in his forefathers footsteps.																					Just when I was all set to get into the army, I heard about the Roadie thing. Since I am passionate about biking, I went for the audition last July. I got through and my life changed, recalled Rannvijay.																					The first-of-its-kind adventure-based reality show in India required the seven participants to travel 4,732 km from Chennai to Chel on their bikes and to go through a number of daring tasks posed by the MTV crew.																					There were adventure sports to weather, like bungee jumping, river rafting, camel and horse riding; civic tasks to undertake, like sweeping roads and conducting AIDS awareness workshops; creative challenges to ace, like performing street plays, puppet and dance shows and even wacky acts like ice-cream eating competitions or walking through the streets dressed like superheroes. 																					But the more stressing times were when the Roadies had to go through emotional roller-coasters and mind games. We had to vote out three of the initial seven of our team mates, who were replaced by new people. The most difficult part was when we had to vote out a girl called Mini 22 days into the contest, said Rannvijay, adding that physically the most difficult task was to do abseiling in Dehra Dun.ived a lifetime in 40 days. What we did in this short span of time, many people dont get to do in their whole lives. And I also realised how beautiful my country is. The ghats, the beaches, the waterfalls  the landscape and character of every place is so unique, reminisced Rannvijay, with a glint in his eyes. Its a dream come true that I will get to accompany the new set of Roadies from Calcutta to the Wagah border. I didnt want the journey to end, he signed off.

The turn of events took place at the One Step Up Kidzee Tollygunge monsoon splash that featured tiny tots dressed as frogs, ducks, peacocks, mushrooms and even umbrellas, dancing to rain, rhymes and rhythm.																					Most of the under-fives were dancing to their own tempo even as principal Swati Ghosh claimed to have spent a fun-filled fortnight with her team training the kids, which required very high levels of energy. 																					It was quite a job. If you spread a carpet for the children to practice their steps, some of them would go to sleep on it thinking its bed-time, recounted Ghosh. The stage act seemed to match Ghoshs description of the kids willfulness with the little dancers walking in and out of stage as and when they pleased, with a couple of recalcitrant cry babies adding to the orchestra. Probably they sensed the motive behind the show was teaching through activity. 																					The parents, however, were bubbling with enthusiasm, urging the kids to dance and pose to perfection for the benefit of clicking shutterbugs. It made them preen even more proudly to see some celebs (cricketer Deep Dasgupta and actress Chandreyee Ghosh). So what if the kids were too busy to notice?  Actress Chandreyee has a blast at the Kidzee monsoon splash. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Tune talk																					 I am in Calcutta. Yes, Im fine, thank you, Sunidhi Chauhan politely responded to the unfamiliar voice on the headphones, while ferociously mouthing the words Whos he? to RJ Sanjeev Tiwari. 																					A roomful of people chorused in reply, Its Shaan. The singer? From Mumbai? she asked incredulously, taking the headphones off for a moment. Then, of course, the conversation flowed, with another colleague from the playback fraternity, Gayatri Iyer Ganjawala, joining in. Soon Gayatri and Shaan were singing together, live on air, hundreds of kilometres apart. 																					ive talk show at the Power FM studios was part of a promotional tour for the music of the soon-to-be-released cop-and-robber thriller Dhoom, starring Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and two rip-roaring motorbikes. Music director Pritam Chakraborty had flown in with singers Sunidhi, Gayatri and Kunal Ganjawala (remember humdum suniyo re in Saathiya?) by a 6.30 am flight. 																					So the whole team was bleary-eyed from lack of sleep when they reached the Southern Avenue address. But as clips of the songs were projected on screen, the party came to life. Calcutta boy Pritam was oozing confidence, what with the title song Dhoom macha le having hit bulls eye on the charts right after the albums release.																					If he was happy to talk about his experience of working with producer Aditya Chopra and pop star Tata Young (who has done a music video in English based on the film), Sunidhi emphasised the comfort level of working with a young composer.																					We had so much fun at the recording, she bubbled. Gayatri, of Mar gayo re (Sandhya) and Mohabbat hai mirchi (Chura Liya Hai Tumne) fame, admitted that she was all set to be a corporate citizen after finishing her MBA from IIM Lucknow when the artiste in her forced her to change track. 																					As they shifted to the studio for the radio show, Dhooms peppy tracks went on air. Sunidhi rocked to the beat and listeners could hardly have done otherwise.																																													Cook in style																					 Your dream kitchen could leave you poorer by Rs 100,000. Yet there are more people than the kitchenwallas could imagine just waiting to splurge on them. 																					On the third day of Kitchenex, the kitchen expo at Ice Skating Rink, those who set up their stalls to hard-sell the modular kitchen concept went home as happy businessmen. The response has been overwhelming. Over the last three years we are seeing a change in the outlook of the average Calcuttan. He is now ready to spend as much on his kitchen as he is to deck up his drawing room, said Kiran Rajan of Kitchen Grace, a company selling kitchen interiors worth Rs 180,000, complete with a four-stove oven, chimney, microwave and water filter.																					Its difficult to ascertain the price of a typical modular kitchen as each piece is custom-made and prices depend on accessories. More people are going for modular kitchens now as they are more convenient to work in and can be packed away in sections and moved around, explained Kiran.																					Our company has set up more than 1,000 kitchens in the city. The advent of small houses has made them useful, said Suman Bose of ATI. 																					But there was something for the price-sensitive consumer as well. Another company, Zedair, is offering modular kitchens at as low as Rs 44,000. We are targeting the middle class, which wants to enjoy the benefits of a modular kitchen but cant shell out lakhs, said Ashoke Das from Zedair. Using plywood instead of wood for the cabinets can even bring the price down to Rs 30,000, suggested Das.

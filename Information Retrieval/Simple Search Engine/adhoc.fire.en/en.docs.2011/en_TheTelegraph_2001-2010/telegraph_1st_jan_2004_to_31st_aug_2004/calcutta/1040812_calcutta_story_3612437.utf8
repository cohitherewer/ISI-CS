 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Mayor eyes 100 cr mop-up for Pujas
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Calcuttas civic authorities are contemplating a crackdown on major defaulters of property tax to mop up Rs 100 crore before the Pujas.																								On Wednesday, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said he needed to harness Rs 50 crore by Puja-eve to disburse salary, pension and bonus to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) employees and to square up contractors dues.																								If only defaulters owing less than Rs 5 lakh are taken into account, the amount of unrealised property tax, including interest and penalty, will stand at Rs 180 crore, said mayor Mukherjee.																								There are about 650,000 houses in Calcutta, including those in the added areas. A total of 350,000 house-owners are required to pay property tax. A section, however, does not. The CMC is targeting the top 300 defaulters of this section.																								The action will be three-pronged, Mukherjee explained. First, the CMC will paste notices on the walls of the defaulter landlords with the intention of humiliating them socially. A three-day ultimatum later, the CMC will snap water and drainage connections to the premises.																								In the third stage, civic officials will swoop down on the premises, armed with warrants, to attach movable property if the landlords fail to pay up their dues on the spot.																								Last year, the CMC cracked down on the building housing Pantaloons, on Gariahat Road, by snapping its water lines and dumping garbage in front of the shop to realise tax dues worth Rs 1.5 crore.																								The water supply department last week drew up a list of 300-odd property tax defaulters and sent it for verification to the assessment and collection department. The premises include commercial and residential buildings, along with houses let out for ceremonies.																								According to the list, a building on Hemanta Basu Sarani has run up property tax dues above Rs 3.5 crore, said Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer-on-special duty. A house on Rashbehari Avenue that is let out for social functions owes the CMC Rs 14.07 lakh. Some buildings on RN Mukherjee Road, Mangoe Lane, Sarat Bose Road and Rashbehari Avenue have tax dues of more than Rs 10 lakh. 																								Mayor Mukherjee pointed out that the defaulters had been offered amnesty from paying interest and penalty on the principal amount of tax due for a limited period in 2002. Then, Rs 130 crore had been realised, though the outstanding amount since 1963 was over Rs 300 crore.

 																											- NRS outlet shutdown fuels fisticuffs in emergency wing SUNANDO SARKAR																								Outsiders, aided by group-D staff, ransacked a junior doctors hostel at Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital, abused doctors and then beat up some of them on Sunday for shutting down a liquor outlet.																								Four of the doctors were injured after drunken members of Adarsh Yuvak Sangh, an unauthorised club on the campus, rushed into the emergency ward to get even with them. An uneasy calm prevailed after reinforcements from Entally police station arrived, in response to an SOS from hospital superintendent Basanta Khan.																								The new house-staff quarters at NRS have two canteens catering to the 150-odd interns, house-staff and post-graduate trainees staying there. Over the past month, five of the 15 canteen staff opened a retail counter that sold both country liquor and Indian-made foreign liquor. 																								Subsequently, the hostel became a hang-out for drunks, comprising both group-D staff and outsiders, and became the scene of drunken brawls at all hours of the day and night.																								On Saturday, a few physicians, all residents of the new quarters, asked the canteen staff to wind up their business. They ordered the errant staff to stay posted at the hostel gates, telling their clientele not to enter the hostel. This the canteen boys did. But they also did something else: they told their aggrieved customers that it was not their fault and it was actually the doctors who created the problem.																								Tension simmered for a day till it boiled over on Sunday. Around 2 pm, a few customers deprived of their daily bottle started abusing the doctors. You cannot give us medicines and now you stop our liquor as well, was what one junior doctor heard while entering the hostel.																								Fed up, one of his colleagues intervened. But things started getting even uglier as the thirsty mob hurled stones at the hostel. The pandemonium continued for some time, before doctors decided to confront the hooligans. In the ensuing melee, punches were exchanged and the mob, surprised at the resistance put up by the doctors, fled.																								But they regrouped inside the emergency ward when the doctors went for duty. A group, known to be members of the unauthorised club, roughed up the doctors, injuring four.																								Then superintendent Khan called in the police. The small outpost on the campus decided that reinforcements would be necessary and, some time later, a large contingent from Entally police station arrived. An FIR against the club was lodged.																								Hospital superintendent Khan later lodged another complaint with the police, seeking a probe into the liquor racket. Entally police station officials explained that the liquor found its way into the canteen after police raids to clean up the campus.

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYAShah Rukh Khan and Friends hero Chandler: Men in demand 																								Phoebe from Friends and Ally McBeal are the women she identifies with. Phoebes funny cohort Chandler and Raj Malhotra (Shah Rukh Khan) in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge are the men she wants. I am what I am is her motto.																								Who is she? She is the GenX Indian girl (or woman, as she would surely prefer), between 19 and 24 years old, educated and affluent. And her message to marketers and men alike is loud and in-your-face  trouble lurks not too far in the future. That is, only if the old power cant keep pace with todays woman ready to take control of tomorrows market.																								If they dont take notice of these changes, advertisers are at serious risk of sounding jaded, warned Naresh Gupta, national head, account planning, Grey Cells, before a Food for Thought session, organised by the Advertising Club of Calcutta on Friday evening.																								He sounded the warning bell with the findings from Eves Dropping, a survey conducted by the research wing of Grey Worldwide India, of 3,400 girls across nine cities. They were mainly unmarried, working or studying.																								In the survey, Calcutta girls stood out on a number of counts. She, more than the girls of any other city, insisted on opting for love marriages (74.2 per cent versus an all-metro average of 56 per cent). She also led the list in urging husbands to help out with the housework (91.1 per cent vs 80 per cent). Outstripping her counterparts, she admitted frequenting pubs and discos (44.4 per cent vs 34 per cent). She was also among the loudest in saying that it was acceptable for her to smoke (32 per cent).																								The trend survey, aimed at predicting what might happen when the new age women become consumers, stressed Gupta, revealed many more interesting shifts in perception. Things most advertisers  and the rest of us  may have assumed (or at least suspected), but never had evidence of.																								For instance, she is likely to stay out late, but her parents are usually in the know. This could be the effect of cellphones, feels Gupta. Divorce is an option, career comes first, marriage and children are good, but not must-haves. Journalism is the career of choice, but only in front of the camera. She will take what she wants (big house, big car), not expecting it to come free. Take me, faults and all, she demands.																								Ektaa Kapoor should watch out, for sure. Leading the crib sheet is soppy soaps. Even the women who said they wanted to be like Tulsi (Kyunki Saas) wanted only her control over the family. The rest, they had reconstructed, adds Gupta.																								And just as impulse buys and conspicuous consumption become guilt-free, the poster girl to entice this new woman will have to be real  as she sees it. Pin-up or Superwoman will no longer do.

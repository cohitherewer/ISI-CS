The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Meeting mum on sleaze truth team
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The CPM state committee, which met on Friday, chose to skip the Merlin Park sleaze scam and defer the formation of the truth committee till Sunday, when the chief minister returns from Mumbai.																								Avtar Singh, husband of party MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, was arrested on Independence Day on charges of running a sex racket at the hotel. CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had announced on August 16 that the party would set up a probe panel shortly. 																								But after Fridays meeting, it seemed the CPM was dragging its feet on the issue.																								Asked why the truth panel had not been formed, Biswas said the state committee meeting was called to finalise the details of the partys state conference, to be held in Kamarhati, North 24-Parganas, in February. 																								Not a single member raised the issue during the meeting. Ill let you know later when the committee will be formed, Biswas added. 																								Party insiders, however, said the leadership had made it clear at the outset that the sleaze row would not be raised in the meeting. Since the police  under Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees control  are still probing the case, members better not debate the issue, read the party diktat.																								A section of party leaders from North 24-Parganas expressed displeasure over the delay in forming the truth committee. Some top leaders are trying to bury the scandal for the sake of Sikdar. But they should keep in mind that most of our comrades didnt approve of the Singh-Sikdar duos method of making money at the hotel, said a prominent district functionary.

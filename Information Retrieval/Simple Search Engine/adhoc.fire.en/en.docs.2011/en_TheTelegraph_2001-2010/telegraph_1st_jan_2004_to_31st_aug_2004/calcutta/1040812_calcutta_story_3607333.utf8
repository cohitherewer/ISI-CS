 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Private hospitals in rate-slash spree
 BAPPA MAJUMDARState-of-the-art diagnostic facilities will now be more pocket-friendly at private hospitals. A file picture																								Tired of waiting in a queue at SSKM Hospital for a blood test? Dont fret. Instead, go to Belle Vue Clinic for the same test at an equally low rate.																								Private hospitals in the city are in a rate-slash mood, as far as diagnostic facilities are concerned. To start with, the rates for 100 diagnostic tests, including 87 varieties of blood tests, have been slashed by almost 55 to 60 per cent to enable government hospital-bound patients make their way to private clinics. 																								The government and the Association for Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI)  a conglomerate of top private hospitals in the city  have recently signed an agreement to ease the load on government hospitals by offering subsidised rates on diagnostics. 																								All a patient has to do is show an out-patient department ticket of any state-run hospital or a prescription by a government doctor listing the tests that need to be carried out. There are no other norms to be followed, Sajal Dutta, AHEI president, told Metro on Tuesday.																								That is not all. The AHEI is planning to lower the rates of major cardiac surgeries for patients of government hospitals. We are considering slashing rates for cardiac packages for patients referred to us by government hospitals. More uniformity in cardiac surgery packages to eliminate the cost difference between private and government-run hospitals is also on the cards, Dutta added. CUT AND THRUST  Some subsidised rates slashed up to 60 per cent by private hospitalsECG:

Rs 60 Hospitals affiliated to the AHEI are also planning to set up cardiac facilities in government hospitals. 																								We will meet the health minister once we finalise the details. We are planning to visit government hospitals and perform complex cardiac surgeries too, Dutta said. 																								A bypass surgery in a government hospital costs anything between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the complications. In most private hospitals, the cost runs up to a few lakhs.																								Director of nedical education C.R. Maiti said the government was always receptive to such ideas, provided the agreement with private hospitals was transparent. We are looking forward to working with them. There are several tests that cant be performed in government hospitals. Besides, the hospitals are almost always over-crowded. The tie-up with private hospitals is a welcome move, Maiti added.																								Last week, P. Tandon of Belle Vue Clinic had met Santanu Tripathi, superintendent of SSKM Hospital, with an offer to get MRI tests done at Rs 3,000 for those patients who cannot afford the private sector rate of Rs 6,000. 																								I have forwarded their offer to the government for clearance. There are patients who want to avail of such facilities in clinics. It all depends on how the scheme unfolds, Tripathi said. 																								However, general patients coming to private hospitals for investigations without a prescription from a state-run hospital will not be able to get the discount. 																								The cost cut comes into effect after a request from health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who has been appealing to private sector hospitals for years to come to the rescue of over-burdened government hospitals by providing low-cost testing facilities. 																								Finally, it seems to be happening.

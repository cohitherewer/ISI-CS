 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Decks clear for hanging
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There is no legal bar to carry out the order of capital punishment on Dhananjoy Chatterjee, jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury said on Monday.																								The minister had earlier held a meeting with law minister Nisith Adikary, judicial secretary S.K. Chakraborty, inspector-general (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty and home secretary A.K. Deb to discuss the execution of the order.																								After it received the communication from the Union home ministry for execution of the sentence on Thursday, the jails department sent it for examination to the judicial department. The judicial department has concluded that there is no bar in executing the order. The state government will now set a date for the execution, Chowdhury said.																								There is no provision for waiting for 21 or 28 days before the hanging, as was reported earlier, law minister Nisith Adhikary said on Monday.																								Officials said time was allotted in such cases so that the accused could file a fresh petition. But this was not required in Dhananjoys case, since his petitions have already been rejected by all concerned.																								The jail minister said the state government was carrying out all the norms and procedures required for carrying out the execution. 																								This includes notifying the local district magistrate, the magistrate concerned and a medical officer and getting the gallows ready, Chowdhury said. Dhananjoy has undergone a medical examination and has been found fit and healthy, he added.																								A trial of the hanging was conducted at Alipore Central jail on Monday morning. 																								Jaymalya Bagchi, Calcutta High Court lawyer helping Dhananjoys family file a fresh petition in the Supreme Court, alleged that the government departments had declined to issue a copy of the order of the Presidents rejection of the mercy plea to his clients.																								Bikash Chatterjee, brother of Dhananjoy, filed three separate applications to the jail, judicial and home departments, asking for a copy of the communication. But none of the departments bothered to reply. This is injustice, Bagchi said.																								My client will move the Supreme Court without a copy of the Presidents order and in the fresh petition, we make the refusal issue a ground for the case, the lawyer added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Jailed for husband murder, absolved
 															- Cracks in doctor-nurse marriage led brother-in-law to cry foul play OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Life will never be the same again for Surita Bhattacharjee, though the high court has pronounced her innocent. The staff nurse of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital languished in jail for five years on charges of killing her doctor-husband, before the high court absolved her on Thursday.																								A division bench, responding to an appeal filed by her counsel Sekhar Basu, observed: The prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the petitioner.																								Suritas husband died after consuming tea that she had allegedly served. A viscera test detected poison in Ranjits stomach. And the Barasat sessions court reached the conclusion that Surita had administered the poison.																								Surita had been a trainee nurse at SSKM Hospital, where she met Ranjit Bhattacharjee, a doctor of the same hospital. They married in 1986. Life was peaceful. They had two daughters, Ronita and Moumita, in 1989 and 1991. Meanwhile, Surita was transferred to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and her husband sent to another government hospital in South 24-Parganas. 																								In 1991, Ranjit bought a flat in Dum Dum. Then, relations between the couple showed signs of strain. Ranjit accused Surita of having an affair with a junior doctor of RG Kar. Physical and mental torture followed on the wife. Unable to bear the torture, Surita asked for a divorce. Her husband agreed. A joint petition of divorce by mutual consent was filed in Barasat court, which was still pending.																								The couple started living separately, while the daughters were sent to their maternal grandparents in Kharagpur. In February 1994, on a request from Ranjit, elder daughter Ronita was sent to his Dum Dum house.																								On February 16, 1994, Ranjit made a telephone call to his estranged wife, asking her over to his apartment, as their daughter was ill. Surita completed her duty and proceeded to Dum Dum. On her arrival, she came to know that Ranjit had called her over to discuss their divorce.																								A hot argument followed, and Ranjit stormed out of his flat. He spent the night at his elder brothers house. The next morning, he and his brother Anil returned to the apartment. Surita allegedly served them tea. Soon after, Ranjit fell ill and had to be rushed to RG Kar Hospital, where he died two hours later.																								Ranjits brother lodged a complaint with the police, alleging that Surita had poisoned her husband. She was arrested and later granted bail.																								However, the trial judge of Barasat convicted Surita of murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment in 1999. Five years on, shes free.

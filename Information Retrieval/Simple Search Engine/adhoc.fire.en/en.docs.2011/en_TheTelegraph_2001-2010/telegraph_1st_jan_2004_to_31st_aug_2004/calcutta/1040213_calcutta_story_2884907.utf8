 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Cracker cry falls on deaf ears
 																											- Pollution board rejects Delhi plea to push up decibel limit A STAFF REPORTER																								Turning down a Union environment ministry directive to stretch the permissible limit for crackers to 125 decibels, the state government has decided to stick to its own parameters. 																								The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) allows 90 decibels as the permissible limit and bans bursting of all kinds of crackers.																								No crackers fall within the 90-decibel limit. So, bursting of crackers is banned here, said a state pollution control board official.																								In West Bengal, we had to make a lot of effort to ensure a noise-free Diwali for the people. So, under no circumstances will we shift from our stand. We have made it amply clear to the Centre that we will not push up the permissible limit from 90 decibels, said state PCB member-secretary S.K. Sarkar, reacting to the circular recently issued by the Centre directing the state government to fix the permissible decibel limit at 125.																								And not only this, the state PCB has also banned manufacturing, storing and selling of crackers. But if we go by the Centres directive, almost all kinds of crackers will fall within the range. The result will be a return to noisy festival nights, said a state PCB official.																								Ruling out any possibility to relax the existing norms, Sarkar said they were planning to make the rules even more stringent. The government was not bound to follow the central directive in this matter and the state had every right to fix the permissible sound limit, he added.																								We had to face the wrath of people while banning crackers. We were also pressured from different lobbies to relax the rules, but we did not give in. Many people had even burst crackers in front of my house and threatened me with dire consequences to protest the ban on crackers. But, we did not back down under any pressure or threat. We are determined to maintain the existing rules, said Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, who had delivered the landmark judgment on sound pollution.																								Officials of the state pollution control board said several states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have accepted the Centres directive and stretched the sound limit for crackers to 125 decibels.																								The Centre has taken the move under tremendous pressure from the cracker manufacturers lobby. With the parliament elections round the corner, the BJP-led central government is perhaps trying to please the cracker-manufacturers lobby, better known as Sivakasi, which maintains a stronghold in the southern region, an official said.

					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Arijit and Nicola  strike a pose at Anando Sundar Sandha at The Golden  Park and (below) Moon Moon Sen and husband Habi at the  same show															There was the usual line-up of PYTs posing and pirouetting, an overload of the greasepaint and the odd celebrity in the audience  all the necessary ingredients of what else, but a fashion show? The Golden Park Hotel played host to one of these fashion extravaganzas recently and this time around, the focus was on weddingwear  both for the blushing bride as well as guests who just have to make a stylish entrance. 																					led Anando Sundor Sandha, the event comprised seven sequences that showcased mostly heavy-duty saris. All courtesy Joyasree Mukherjee of Jaya Boutique at 46, Prince Anwar Shah Road, the saris came in a spectrum of colours ranging from the regular pinks, peaches and maroons to the more avant-garde blacks and neon greens. 																					lishments ranged from zardosi, mukaish, stone-work, sequins and hand-work to kantha, gota and even hand-painting. Lighter saris in chiffon and georgette and kurtas for men were also shown off by a number of models including Nicola, Pinky, Tina, Jessica, Rosy, Soma, Anangsha and Arijit. Sponsored by Maruti Auto Gen-Tech  and choreographed by Shubham Singh and Amit Pandey, the  entire show was compered by Moon Moon Sen. Looking lovely  in a pink sari, the actress was accompanied by husband Habi  and also spotted in the audience was Russi Mody.

For the designer studio at Metro Plaza is celebrating its anniversary the very best way possible  offering fabulous discounts up to 60 per cent on its entire range thats sure to bring a smile to your face and the extra bucks right back into your pockets.

The casualwear section here includes embroidered kurtis, short kurtas and salwar-kameezes, mostly in cotton handlooms and South cotton while the semi-formal line is essentially a printed one in crepe and georgette, with pintucks, patch-work embroidery and a variety of interesting cuts for that added edge. A mix and match of techniques that is a recurring feature of Amitas work comes into play especially in the formal collection, where crepes with eye-catching prints and embroidery, Indo-Westerns with embroidered pants and stoles and outfits with zardosi, ari, kantha, Kashmiri, bead and appliqu-work jostle for attention. Among the great buys in this section are the tri-coloured saris ideal for a cocktail do as well as drapes from the latest printed collection that incorporate hand and block-printing in arresting hues. Also up for grabs is a trousseau collection of heavy lehengas and ghaghras that are designed by order, and the best part about buying anything here is that after the whopping discounts of anything between 20 per cent and 60 per cent, the prices are very reasonable indeed. 																					It doesnt just stop here, though, for clothes apart, Chemb also houses a wide variety of snazzy bags, jewelled clips, shoes, jewellery boxes, lovely artificial trinkets in pretty colours as well as a range of striking knick-knacks and artefacts to do up your home in style.

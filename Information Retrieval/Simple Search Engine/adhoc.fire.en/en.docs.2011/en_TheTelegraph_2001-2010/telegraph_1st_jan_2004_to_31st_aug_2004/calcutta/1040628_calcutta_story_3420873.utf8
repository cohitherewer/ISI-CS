 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 A celebration of life
																								Transfixed between the two archetypal milestones of our existence, birth and death, is the brief span of time that we call life. We spend an entire lifetime contemplating the miracle of birth and the mystery enveloping death. We ask a thousand philosophical questions about our universe, our race and our role in the divine design. Yet, in the midst of all our mindless rambling, we ironically miss out on Gods greatest gift to mankind  we forget to experience the pure and simple joy of living our lives. It is possible to live life in a fleeting moment, to discover the meaning of life in a flash of enlightenment, just as it is possible to seize that single epiphanic moment and make it everlasting. Based on a play by Luigi Pirandello and Krishna Sobti, Mrityumukhar Ek/Dui helps us comprehend the beauty and the happiness that is life; it enables us to live the life of every moment happily, for its own sake. Directed by Saswati Biswas, the play is a celebration of life. It helps us experience the sheer pleasure and delight of living; it brings forth the wonder, the excitement, the passion, the ecstasy and the obsession that is life  if only we know how to live it.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Mrityumukhar Ek/Dui, produced by Theatron																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

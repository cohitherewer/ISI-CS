The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 Life Couture czars at new haute spot Designer Raj Mahtani with Rituparno Ghosh at the launch. Picture by Pabitra Das 															Today, he designs clothes. Ten years from now, he could be looking at traffic lights as well. A design solutions agency  not just couture  is what Raghavendra Rathore is working towards. The traffic light example may be an advertising gimmick now, but someday this might be reality.																					l then, the Rajasthan-and-Delhi based designer is busy breaking new ground with his garments. He was in town on Friday for the launch of CIMA Design, the lifestyle boutique at Forum, where a high-end Rathore collection is being displayed alongside the works of Rajesh Pratap Singh, Sonam Dubal and Sabyasachi Mukherjee.Calcuttans are not unaware of Rathores charms, with clients from the city or with roots here forming his single largest buyer group. These are families with history, in search of subtle style. Lets just say tandoori chicken is not on the platter, he laughs.																					Trying to present rich India in a contemporary way, is Rathores intention. With a client base that includes many just back from studies abroad, the effort is to keep the colour palette as cosmopolitan as possible. Apart from clothes, Rathore has diversified into chocolates as well. For weddings, people would order sweets before. Now they order chocolates, in keeping with the global touch, explains the man who is about to open his first exclusive boutique in Delhi.																					After a tie-up with Shoppers Stop for a pret line, he is trying to drum up business in New York, Italy and Dubai. We need capital. Much of our profit is consumed as we have to plough it back into our brands, confesses the 36-year-old.																					Another established name in design  Raj Mahtani, behind Satramdas Dhalamal jewellers  was also present. His collection of silver and gold jewellery embellished with precious and semi-precious stones can also be seen at CIMA Design. The line has a modernised Mughal influence, says Mahtani.																					If the Indian woman is more open to new styles of jewellery, it may be because of a change in buying ethos. It is no longer just an investment, he feels. It is now about accessorising, about joie de vivre. Jewellery is no longer serious, it is also about having fun, he smiles. Film-maker Rituparno Ghosh clearly agreed, dropping by at the launch and modelling one of Mahtanis pieces for the inaugural crowd.

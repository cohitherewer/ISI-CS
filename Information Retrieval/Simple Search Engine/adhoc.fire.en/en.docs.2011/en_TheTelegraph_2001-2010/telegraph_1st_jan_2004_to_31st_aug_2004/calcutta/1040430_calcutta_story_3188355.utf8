 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Batons quell mishap rage
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								Yet another accident and its violent aftermath rocked Nawpara, off VIP Road, on Thursday morning.																								Abdur Rauf, 22, a resident of Nawpara, was knocked down by a private car at around 10 am. The dog he was walking died on the spot, while Rauf is battling for life at SSKM Hospital.																								Residents of the stretch leading to Rajarhat gathered on the spot and blocked traffic to protest the recent spate of accidents, which have claimed two lives and left six people injured in the past two months.																								Trouble snowballed after Rajarhat police arrived to take away the car. Demanding prompt action and compensation for the accident victims, residents refused to allow the car to be taken away.																								By then, it was well into the afternoon and tempers were frayed. Police suddenly launched a lathicharge. Protestors, bystanders  and even this correspondent  were not spared.																								Poor people have no right to protest, thundered Ananda Sarkar, officer-in-charge of Rajarhat police station, as he led the lathicharge.																								Residents refused to beat a retreat, and another lathicharge followed, only to be greeted with a volley of brickbats from women in the area who had joined in the protests.																								Monoranjan Saha, additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar, when informed of the brutal lathicharge, said: This should not have happened I apologise on behalf of my officer.

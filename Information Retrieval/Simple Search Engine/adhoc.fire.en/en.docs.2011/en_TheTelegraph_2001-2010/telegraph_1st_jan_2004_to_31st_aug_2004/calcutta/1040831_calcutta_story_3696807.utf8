 A STAFF REPORTER																								After the Saha family of Tollygunge, it was the Ghosh family of Behala whose members were driven to death on Monday by the debt trap.																								Three of them were found dead in their Parnasree flat at noon. 																								Pulak Ghosh, 42, a railway accounts officer, hanged himself in the dining room, while wife Rina, 34, and daughter Moumita, 13, lay dead in the bedroom. They had moved into the rented flat 18 months ago. 																								Suspicions were fanned after Moumitas tutor, the maid and Moumitas friends dropped by in the morning and rang the doorbell, but there was no response. At noon, a neighbour spotted the bodies.																								Police arrived and removed the bodies to Behalas Vidyasagar Hospital around 2.30 pm. From there, they were sent for post-mortem.																								Hospital superintendent N.K. Haldar said: They were brought dead. Food samples have been taken from the dining table for analysis. 																								According to superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta, Ghosh left a note for his sister, saying he was deep in debt. He owed money to eight creditors. He says he discussed the situation with his wife and decided to end their lives, Gupta added.																								Neighbours said Moumita was a cheerful girl and her parents were amiable. Moumitas headmistress Sarmistha Banerjee said the Class VII student had scored 80 per cent last year.																								Police said the mother and daughter may have been poisoned. Ghosh hanged himself.

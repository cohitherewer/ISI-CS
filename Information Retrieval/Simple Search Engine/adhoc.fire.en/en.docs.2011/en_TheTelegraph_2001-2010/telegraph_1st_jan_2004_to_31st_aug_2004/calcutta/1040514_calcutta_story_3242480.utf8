Pictures by Pabitra DasHours spent conceptualising the designs and then sitting with the karigar to give shape to them. The dream of making it big, and the momentous first steps in that direction.																								Final-year students of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) went through all this and more as they put together and showed off their graduating designer collection at a glittering function in ITC Sonar Bangla on Wednesday evening.																								As many as 70 design students showcased their creations in three categories of leather, fashion and knitwear in the showdown for top honours.																								In love with leather																								The evening opened at 6.30 pm, on the trendy trail of leather outfits and accessories, including bags and shoes. Nineteen designers in this category came up with an array of smart jackets, mostly in the three classic colours of black, beige and maroon.																								Leather hipsters as also capris in the rich fabric formed bulk of the lowers into which slipped the long legs of Shonal Rawat and Candice Pinto, before Aryan Vaid gave the women in the audience some eye candy to feast on.																								Smart pleats on short flared skirts from the sporty collection of Neenti Navral steamed up the show as model Aditi Govitrikar carried them off with elan, complete with a tennis racket in hand.																								Dipannita Gangulys Trinity collection, which flaunted coloured stripes on black leather, had a different look. Leather bustiers ruled, as did metallic zippers giving the outfits a young and vibrant look.																								Old-look buckles and heavy stitches accentuated the look of the bags, most of which had rounded corners with multi-purpose pockets.																								Shweta Rastogis Split Wide Open, which also won the award for the most commercially viable collection, had bags in intriguing shapes with motifs and patches to deck them up. Rumki Biswas, who won the best design collection award in leather with her Bizarre Beige, came up with the smartest cuts and colour combination.Fashion fever																								Then, on strode the fashion line. Spotted in the second row was designer and Good Life columnist Kiran Uttam Ghosh, on a talent-scout mission to help her with a novel project in the pipeline.																								The fashion category opened with the collection of Inderjit De, who displayed distinct signs of inspiration drawn from NIFT old boy Sabyasachi Mukherjee. Inderjit, who pocketed the award for best overall performance, has been offered internships by both Anamika Khanna and Sabyasachi, said a professor.																								The students of the fashion department drew upon everything under the May sun  from the basics of soil, flower and water, to a bit of Bollywood and M.F. Husain paintings to the alphabet and even braces.																								The fabrics used ranged from chiffon to cotton, georgette and jute. Sudhir Singh, the pint-sized designer who walked tall as he picked up two prizes, one for best garment construction and the other for best academic performance, made interesting use of jamewar shawls to go with his mix  match range.																								Twenty collections from the fashion department took the total count up to 43. Two-and-a-half-hours had rolled by but the pace of the well-choreographed show by Elric DSouza refused to flag.Leather

Some really interesting ones were Maar Peet, a collection by Girish Khanna depicting the angry young man on screen, Rex Reincarnation, inspired by the Roman warriors, and Nidhi Bedis collection depicting the various stages in the life of a coconut.																								It was, however, Pradeep Ratoris Bond Girls that hit bullseye for best collection and the spontaneous applause from his batch mates proved that there was no room for rift in NIFT.																								Last bow																								After a hard days night, it was time for the felicitations and the festivities.																								But theres more in store for the budding designers as NIFT Calcutta plays proud host to Confluence, the coming together of the best design collections from NIFT centres all over the country.																								The mega show will also be held at ITC Sonar Bangla, on May 17.						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

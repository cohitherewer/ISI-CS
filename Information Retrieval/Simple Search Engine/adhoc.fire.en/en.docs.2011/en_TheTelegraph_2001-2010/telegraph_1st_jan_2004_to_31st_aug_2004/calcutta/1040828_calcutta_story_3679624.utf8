																								An oft-repeated clich, an artistic production with a difference, takes on an unusual sincerity when spoken of in reference with The Action Players  a performance group in mainstream theatre that works with actors who are challenged. Their deafness being an invisible handicap, the actors have been trained to capture their audience with their deftness in mime. Now in its 31st year, The Action Players has matured from being a pure mime troupe to one that interprets literary works by contemporary writers. Voicing actors work alongside their challenged counterparts and support the interpretation which is then presented in a mix of mime, sign language and narration, along with live or taped music. Beyond the Land of Hattamala, written by Badal Sircar, is the name of the new production by The Action Players in which the actors will use Indian Sign Language, for the first time, along with mime, supported by voicing by three hearing actors. Hearing impaired artiste Jhooma Sircar, together with Zarin Chaudhuri, directs the show.																								Event: Beyond the Land of Hattamala, a play by The Action Players																								When: Today and tomorrow; 6.30 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

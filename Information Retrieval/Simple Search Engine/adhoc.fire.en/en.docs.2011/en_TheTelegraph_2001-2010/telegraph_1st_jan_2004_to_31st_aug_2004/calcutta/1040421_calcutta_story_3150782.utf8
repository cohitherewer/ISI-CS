	Residents have to suffer ear-splitting noise during the demolition of old buildings in residential localities. The continuous noise takes a toll on the nerves and students are unable to concentrate on their studies. Authorities should frame rules to save the neighbours from such ordeals. A notice should be put on display by the civic body or the owner of the property beforehand so that the aged and the ailing can be shifted elsewhere before the work starts.

	My friends from Singapore were approached by some youngsters when they landed at the Dum Dum airport. The men handed cups of steaming coffee to the unsuspecting women without giving any hint that they were vendors. As first-timers to the city, they took the beverage to be free of cost. My friends were saved by my husband, a frequent flier, who went to receive them. But others are forced to fork out Rs 10 for a cup. Cant the airport authorities stop the vendors from taking tourists for a ride?

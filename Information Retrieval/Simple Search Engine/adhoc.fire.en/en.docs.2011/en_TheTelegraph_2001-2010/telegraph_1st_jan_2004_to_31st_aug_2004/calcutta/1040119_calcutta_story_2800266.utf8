		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Hawkers must go if buses are to roll
		 TRAFFIC-STOPPERS: The approach road to  Rajarhat-Gopalpur. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryNarayan Chatterjee: You are probably aware that private buses on route 46 and 30C were withdrawn nearly 14 years ago. We were assured several times about the services being resumed but they have not. Can you please do something about it?																																																													I have approached state transport minister Subhash Chakraborty and requested him several times to restore the services. Only recently, he has assured me that buses will be re-introduced on the routes. But before that, what needs to be done is to make the roads hawker-free. Greengrocers, hawkers and cycle-rickshaws have blocked the approach road to the township. We have got to clear the area if the buses are to ply at all. I hope you will cooperate with me in evicting these vendors and I assure you I will try my best to get the buses back on road as soon as possible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 22, 2004 				 Spread the wisdom word to fight stress
 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 At peace with oneself																								Symptoms of stress can be as incongruent as a headache, dry mouth or common cold, or as harmful as forgetfulness, depression and boredom. Either way, it is manifest in four forms  physical, psychological (behavioural), emotional and cognitive. 																								Its not news that stress is a lifestyle disease, with a gamut of causes responsible, from diet to work and family tensions, adolescence to retirement, disease to death of a loved one. But what is perhaps surprising is that there is very little awareness of the illness in Calcutta, with most people even ignorant of its causes and long term effects.																								It was with the aim of spreading knowledge about stress that the NGO Viswaas was set up two months ago, and the reason for its first workshop in the city last week. The organisation has been running a clinic for alternative medication for the past couple of years, for physical and psychological problems. But we found that 90 per cent of the patients were suffering from stress, although they had no idea, says Dr Lalita Jalan, secretary, Viswaas. 																								An advertisement brought in 18 participants, including students, a housewife and professionals. People like R.S. Taxak, manager, United India Insurance. Stress lowers efficiency and results in a waste of time and energy. At this workshop, we learnt practical remedies, which can be incorporated into the daily routine. I already feel relaxed. Such workshops should be sposored by companies to enhance output, feels the 51-year-old.																								Viswaas aims to do just that, and is offering its services to any organisation, schools to corporates, to help people identify the symptoms of stress and impart coping strategies (stress management techniques). At the clinic itself, there is a two-week package, with meditation, yoga, homoeopathy, psychotherapy and diet tips to help a person deal with the problem. The treatment costs Rs 3,000, but its free for those who cant afford it. Our target group is the middle class, says Jalan.																								The content of the four-day workshop, spread over a week, included basic information, the causes and effects and relaxation techniques  simple yoga exercises like the Brahma mudra, which can even be performed in front of the TV or in office, seated on a chair. And at the end of it, Ishani Banerjee, dietician at CMRI, felt her back problems fade away. I had come to give a talk on how eating habits influence stress, but stayed on for the rest of the workshop, she smiles.																								While Jalan talked about psychotherapy, Surdeb Punjabi, another doctor of Viswaas, based on Nandalal Jew Road, conducted the rest of the sessions, focussing on how stress can build up and create greater problems if left untreated. Stress is increasing with changes in lifestyles, to the extent that we even had a three-year-old patient who had performance anxiety, prior to a school interview, which can lead to panic. So we want to conduct as many seminars and camps as possible, and perhaps even train the trainers in organisations, he adds.																								So the word shall spread. Regional head, Centurion Bank, Jayanta Gupta says he needed to learn coping strategies and attended the workshop. He has made slides of all that he has learnt, and will now hold presentations for his managers. And Parul Sheth, lecturer in child psychology and human development at JD Birla Institute, will use the material in her teaching and in her role as counsellor in college. Malati Mukta, who works in the legal department in Shaw Wallace, says she has a high-tension job, and is happy she can now help her mind and body deal with the stress.

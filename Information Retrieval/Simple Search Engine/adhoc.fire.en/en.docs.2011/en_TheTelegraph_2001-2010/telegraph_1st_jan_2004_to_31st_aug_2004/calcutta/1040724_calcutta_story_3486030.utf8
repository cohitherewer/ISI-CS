The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The group of American teachers checks out Ramdulal Des mansion, after a cultural performance. Picture by Amit Datta																								They took the trip for educational purposes, but India literally took their breath away. Sixteen elementary and secondary school teachers from 12 different states in the US came to India to learn about the country in greater depth, firsthand. But an assault on their senses has sent them into a not unpleasant shock, and some quiet reflection is what is required to recover.																								The destination for the US Department of Education Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad 2004 programme was India, with 11 cities on the list, covering the length and breadth of the country. Teachers eligible are involved in the subject of international relations, and the application process is competitive. The United States Educational Foundation in India was the organiser. The theme was Understanding India.																								The tour included the cultural, historical, political and other aspects of India. Having arrived in Calcutta on July 20 from Hyderabad, the group left for Varanasi on July 23. During the two-and-a-half-day stay in the city, the teachers admitted to being mesmerised by the vibrant sights, sounds, smells, tastes and colours.																								We have been to museums and historic sites, and had some lively interactions at seminars and panels discussions, said Jana Eaton, the leader of the group and a teacher of international education policies. I was particularly interested in comparative government and politics, as well as how religion and education are combined. I discussed the recent textbook controversy and how the Islamic organisations are changing the way Madarsas function.																								On July 21, they attended a seminar chaired by US consul-general George N. Sibley, where a professor of international relations from Jadavpur University and a representative from the IT sector spoke about their fields. Then there were discussions on the recent elections, among other things. They also visited heritage buildings, from BBD Bag to Nandan and Mother House. The next day, they were treated to rides on the metro and tram, as well as a tour of Kumartuli, to understand the iconographic tradition of Bengal.																								They attended demonstrations by patachitra artists from Midnapore and performances of Bharatanatyam and sitar at Ramdulal Des mansion on Beadon Street, after a walking tour of old Calcutta. On July 23, before leaving, they attended an event in St Xaviers school. At the end, they were left with an in-depth experience of the unity in diversity that signifies India, according to Nicholas Dorn, a teacher of ancient, medieval and modern world history from Jacksonville, Florida.																								It has been an onslaught of stimuli. I am overwhelmed, and I cant even describe it in words. Every place is so different. India is by far the most diverse country, and Americans have a lot to learn from Indians, like acceptance, as opposed to tolerance, he summed up.

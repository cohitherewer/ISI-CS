 Malformation or abnormal growth of babyAn indiscriminate consumption of painkillers by an expectant mother to fight the familiar back pain during pregnancy may end up causing a miscarriage or affecting the foetus.																								Citing cases recorded in recent weeks, city obstetricians said on Wednesday that the random popping of non-steroid, anti-inflammatory pills (even aspirin), during the first three months of pregnancy, could cause a lot of harm.																								Any painkiller other than paracetamol can be dangerous for mother and child. It may even cause miscarriage, warned Rahul Sen, head of the medical obstetrics department at the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre.																								We have been telling pregnant mothers to take only paracetamol for the management of pain. The first four to eight weeks, known as the embryo-genesis period, is very important. It is during this time that the foetus is extremely sensitive to external factors, especially medicines.																								The fears of the citys obstetricians have been heightened by a spate of reports in international journals on new research into the impact of certain popular painkillers on the health of mother and child.																								According to latest research, as high as 80 per cent cases of miscarriage can be linked to an overuse of common painkillers, said Anita Kaul, senior consultant, Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi. 																								Other hospitals, too, have decided to urge mothers to consult a gynaecologist before popping painkillers for low-back pain, or even headaches.																								There have been cases where we have had to tell mothers that they have not been doing the right thing. Paracetamols are considered much safer than any painkiller and we are opting for them, said Gautam Mukherjee, gynaecologist at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and general secretary of the Association of Health Services Doctors.																								Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if taken during the first few weeks of pregnancy, cause liver complications and suppress the production of fatty acids, called prostaglandin, needed for successful implantation of an embryo in the womb.																								We have taken it upon ourselves to educate patients about the ill-effects of painkillers during pregnancy, stressed obstetrician Purabi Mukherjee.

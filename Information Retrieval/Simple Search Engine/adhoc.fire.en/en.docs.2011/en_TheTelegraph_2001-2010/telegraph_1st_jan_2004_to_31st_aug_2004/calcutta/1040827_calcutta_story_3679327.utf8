Anamika AngleAnamika KhannaDESIGNER ANAMIKA KHANNA WONDERS WHY WE CANT HAVE FASHION CONGLOMERATES LIKE THE WEST INDIA FOCUS: Model Jesse Randhawa flaunts one of Anamikas ethnic ensembles at the Lakme India Fashion Week 2004 Some designers come into the world and provide us with what we know we want, and need. The others change what we want, standing out on their own, creating objects of desire and providing alternatives.There is purity of power and vision and true genius lies in one who is able to adapt and offer acceptable solutions and yet has a new trick up his sleeve, always. The power of understanding the parameters of any target society and bringing about enough change to be accepted is, I think, the mantra anywhere in the world. What is the point of offering a mini skirt to someone who has never stepped out of a sari?The choice is surely ours whether we want to sell only (we have to sell, at any cost!) or we want to create and sell. This is easy: be true to yourself, convince yourself first and then others. In considerably smaller fashion societies like our own, designers are constantly inundated (I am sure my colleagues will agree) with requests for something different or for the one perfect piece. And I have to constantly look for ways to get under the skin of the client to understand what different means in her/his dictionary and just how different they are prepared to be. Dont we take pride in wearing the 500th piece of a Prada or a 1000th piece of an Armani?To try and analyse the problem, I feel we have to understand the essential complexities of being Indian. Arent we proud of being Indian? Dont we agree that the talent, craft and creativity level is considerably higher here compared to the rest of the world? How is it that India has started to rock globally?Indian elements are used freely in every way, right from food to fashion to yoga. Why is it that the West takes advantage of our heritage, craft and talent, adapts it and puts its own stamp on it while we sigh and shout India is happening!? What is our contribution?The difference lies in the fact that, with enough support of course, these guys in the West have been able to turn themselves from individual names into business conglomerates, enabling them to reach out to the world.What it takes to do so: The power of thought and the ability to translate thought into form. The vision to identify what is missing, providing it at the right time and to the right target market. Resources, which are always limited. The need is to create new things every day with the same old elements and yet be extremely innovative. Business acumen and the art of managing labour effectively and translating, through total understanding between the two, the conveyed design ideas into acceptable products. Conviction. Time management and the constant effort to not just meet deadlines but beat them. Pubic relation skills and the ability to communicate effectively. Image. Help from the government.In a nutshell, we humans have to become super human!Which businessman necessarily creates or is an artist? Most often, someone creates while someone else runs the show! Its easier said than done, but ultimately, the only way out. We do salute those who can do it all. Its a piece of cake, guys. I will do it all and still look gorgeous taking my final bow!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 A lyrical vision
																								Art has the power to enrich the human spirit and elevate everyday emotions to the level of the sublime. The artistic vision sees its subject imaginatively to tell a story through its expression of an object or an event. An exhibition of artworks by Prasanta Niyogi (one of his paintings appears along), Susanta Chakraborty and Dr. Debasis Bhattacharya does all this and more through its creative and soul-stirring representation of familiar, commonplace objects. Marked by an astonishing simplicity and a lyrical beauty, the paintings on show leave an indelible impression on the mind of the discerning viewer by their ability to communicate a thought, idea or emotion purely through their vivid imagery, childlike play of bright colours and the use of light and shade. Inauguration this evening at 5.																								Event: An exhibition of artworks																								When: Till June 8 (except Sunday); 10 am - 7 pm (Mon. to Fri.) and 10 am - 3 pm (Sat.)																								Where: Chemould, Queens Mansion, Park Street

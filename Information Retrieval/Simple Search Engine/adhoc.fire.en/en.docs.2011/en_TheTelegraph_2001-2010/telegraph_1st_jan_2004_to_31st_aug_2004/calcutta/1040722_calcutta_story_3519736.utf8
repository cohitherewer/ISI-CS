Feng ShuiPinky KapoorQ: A couple of years ago we had bought an office space in the basement of a building that is devoid of natural light. We operate a business of ad designing from here. We feel uncomfortable working from this place. Please suggest a more pleasing look.Name and address withheld																								A: Enclosed work areas with insufficient light create discomfort and affects creativity, which is of prime importance in your kind of profession. The best way to improve the situation is by getting landscape pictures framed in false windows. Colourful walls, large mirrors, green plants and bright lights are instrumental in bringing life to the environment. These also create an illusion of space and a sense of energy. A pleasant workstation always leads to greater efficiency across the board.																								Q: I live on the ground floor of a building with my father (born on 29.06.1938) who is suffering from serious lung problems. My bedroom is in the north-east and my fathers is in the south-east. I am single (born on 02.04.1977) and have been unable to find a suitable match so far. Are there any special Feng Shui charms we can keep to improve upon the situation? 																								Sumona Sarkar, Tollygunge																								A: Try shifting to a room in the north-west for better luck with your marriage. If you are unable to do this, sleep in the north-west direction of your room. Besides, energise the south-west corner of your room with symbols of unison along with a similar arrangement in the southern part. 																								As for your fathers health, the emphasis should be on the eastern part of the house, which is connected to health. Healthy green plants in the living and dining rooms and pictures of nature in his bedroom should do the trick. 																								Feng Shui is all about creating balance and harmony in a neat and clean environment, with proper corrections so that chi, which is the life giving force, can be made to circulate freely.  A refreshing landscape can enliven the dreariest of dungeons says Feng ShuiQ: I want to refurnish my five-year-old daughters room. I would like to know what kind of pictures or paintings to use. Where can I place a mirror and how large should it be?Sujata Dholakia, CalcuttaA: Childrens rooms should contain simple and meaningful pictures and symbols, rather than abstract images that are confusing for them. A lavish display of your childs artistic and imaginative work on a wall in the west is recommended for creative enhancement of the mind. The mirror should be placed in such a way that it does not reflect the bed, the bedroom and the toilet doors. It should be tall enough for her to see her full image. This will help develop a strong sense of confidence in her. You can keep moving the mirror up or buy a larger one as she grows.

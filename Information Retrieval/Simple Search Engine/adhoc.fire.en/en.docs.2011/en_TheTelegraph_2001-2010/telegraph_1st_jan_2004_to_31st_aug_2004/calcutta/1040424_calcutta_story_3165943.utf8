 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Ragpicker roots for freedom of footpath
 PRONAB MONDAL				 	 Soni Begum: Still saying no. Picture by Amit Datta																								She does not want to give up the freedom of the footpath  and the address on Colootola Street where her husband knows he can find her  even for a house and four square meals for her three children.																								Soni Begum, the ragpicker who had found Rs 7,500 while rummaging a garbage dump, only to hand it all over to Jorasanko police, refused another offer on Friday that could have changed her life forever.																								Members of Time and Talent, a womens club in south Calcutta, met Soni at Jorasanko police station and handed over a cheque for Rs 9,500 to salute her extraordinary act of honesty.																								Roma Bhagat, president of Time and Talent, and some other members spent more than half-an-hour on Friday afternoon with Soni, who had found a packet containing 15 notes of Rs 500 while rummaging a roadside vat near Mohammad Ali Park on March 10. She had then gone straight to the local police station and handed over the money.																								I asked her why she was refusing all offers for her children made by various organisations. She just kept mum, Bhagat said.																								We later gathered that she refused the previous offers of sending her three children to a boarding school for fear that it would take them away from her, she added.																								Soni told Bhagat she did not want to give up her way of life. So, she is not ready to leave her patch on the Colootola Street pavement, where all that she has is a polythene sheet over her head and a tattered mat to lie on.																								The other reason behind Sonis reluctance to leave the pavement is the link with her roving husband. 																								Also a ragpicker, he occasionally visits his wife on the Colootola Street pavement. If I leave this place and go away, what guarantee is there that he will come and visit me? asks Soni. And if he does not, where will I find him in this big city?																								Soni, who is now an account-holder with State Bank of Indias Jorasanko branch, with a deposit of Rs 17,000, has over the past few weeks been inundated with aid offers.																								But Soni has refused them all. She fears that this will take away her freedom, stressed Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge of Jorasanko police station. 																								She has never lived within four walls and is not prepared to do so now, he added.

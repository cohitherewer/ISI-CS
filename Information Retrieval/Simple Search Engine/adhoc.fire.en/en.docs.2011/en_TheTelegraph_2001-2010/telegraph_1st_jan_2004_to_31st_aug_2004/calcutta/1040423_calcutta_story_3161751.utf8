The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Moral police cue for CMC
 A STAFF REPORTER																								On Wednesday, the city police slapped a criminal case on sponsors of a programme and a city hotel that was to host it for putting up an allegedly obscene hoarding at the crossing of AJC Bose Road and Park Street. 																								Twenty-four hours later, the civic authorities, too, swung into action to clear the streets of signboards that conceal traffic signals or distract people while they are driving. 																								According to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials, the civic body has taken up a drive to clear the city streets of both political and commercial billboards that get in the way of traffic signals at junctions or conceal CMC signboards from public view. 																								Look around, and you will find banners put up everywhere  from government buildings to restaurants, atop shades at your local bus stop or right in front of the traffic signal. We thought it is high time we did something about it, the official said.																								With the help of officers from Park Street police station, CMC officers hit the road at around 9.30 am on Thursday and dismantled every banner and billboard that came their way. The drive covered Park Street, Camac Street, Lenin Sarani and Jawaharlal Nehru Road. 																								Even the railings on the road dividers on these stretches have not been spared  every few metres apart, flags and banners have been put up. Our men took out more than a 150 such posters and banners, the civic official added.																								Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh said that though the police have started a suo motu case against the organisers of the programme, to be held at a city hotel on April 23, for putting up a billboard with the photograph of a scantily-clad woman, they did not play a major role in Thursdays drive. 																								The CMC officials carried out the work on their own today. They had asked for our assistance and policemen were told to accompany them to ward off trouble, if any. Whenever we expect trouble  they were bringing down political banners  police are deployed, the deputy commissioner pointed out.																								According to Piyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), the drive against obscene billboards will continue.

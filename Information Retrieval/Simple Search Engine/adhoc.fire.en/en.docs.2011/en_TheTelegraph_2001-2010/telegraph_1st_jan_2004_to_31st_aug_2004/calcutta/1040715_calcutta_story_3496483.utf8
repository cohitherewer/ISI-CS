The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Success story spins a boost
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Impressed with the way the Indo-Italian joint venture, Roopkala Kendro, has turned out three years after its inception, a team of Italian delegates on a two-day visit to Calcutta has expressed its desire to expand the scope for more cultural exchange. 																								On Wednesday, the Italian team, including minister of external affairs, in charge of Asia, Margherita Boniver and Italian ambassador Antonio Armellini took part in an interactive session with some city writers, artists, actors and scientists. The talking point at the Salt Lake centre for film and social communication was how to further the cultural collaboration.																								The Roopkala Kendro project is an example of a successful cultural exchange programme. We want to expand the scope for cultural exchange and West Bengal will always be our top priority, said Boniver at the meet.																								We are also looking forward to introducing foreign exchange programmes involving teachers and students between the universities of Bengal and those in Rome, Naples, Zurich and Venice, added Boniver. 																								Cushioned with state-of-the-art digital and animation equipment imported from Italy, Roopkala Kendro has produced around 20 documentary films over the past three years. It now plans to broadcast these through various TV channels.																								The collaboration period with Italy has already expired, but they are keen on renewing it. They are very happy with the way the Kendro has shaped up and want to boost their technical support to us, said director Anita Agnihotri, adding that the centre will place a proposal before the ministry concerned in this regard.																								Issues ranging from cinema to regional literature, popular science to educational programmes, social work to wildlife conservation were touched upon in the discussion, with the Italian team trying to address each topic. 																								The interactive session was attended by writers Dibyendu Palit and Bani Basu, actors Chiranjeet and Sabyasachi Chakraborty, film-maker Tarun Majumdar, cameraman Soumendu Ray, artists Ganesh Haloi and Niranjan Pradhan, physicist Dipankar Home and several others.

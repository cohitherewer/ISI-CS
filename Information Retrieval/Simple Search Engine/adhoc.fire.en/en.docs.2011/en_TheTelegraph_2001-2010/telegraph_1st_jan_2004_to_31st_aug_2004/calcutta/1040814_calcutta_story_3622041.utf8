Neeraj Shridhar. Picture by Rashbehari DasThe voice and face of Bombay Vikings, Neeraj Shridhar  believes in having the cake and sharing it too. Why? He feels the Indian music industry is big enough for everyone and no one should go hungry. But prod him about duplicate versions of Chhod Do Aanchal (video girl Kamana below) and the Swedish-born crooner is not so charitable.																								The music label wanted to bring me down and came up with its own version. I told them you cant match me and I was right. I am touring all over the world with my song. Is that other lady singer being invited anywhere?																								Cooling off at the Hyatt Regency Lounge before taking off for performances at the Crossword bookstore and RCGC, Neeraj is confused as to how to treat his remix singer tag. The branding can be both negative and positive. I am really hurt when people choose to forget my original songs like Jambola and Angel Eyes and question my capability as a musician. Then again, music is finally a product and mine is a fresh one I have received a lot of praise from legends like Lataji. So I can live with the branding.																								Wishing to put Indian music on the global map, Neeraj is not too amused with the attitude from the aam janta. Everyone goes ga-ga seeing a foreign guy playing the sitar but when we Indians play an international instrument, they remind us of our values.																								Neeraj attributes his distinct sound and its success to the blend of two different musical cultures. I have lived the two lifestyles  one Scandinavian and the other Asian. You cannot learn a particular music culture at the push of a television remote control button. You have to live amongst those people and then the music is born from inside.																								The singer-composer has a different take on Bollywood music, too. Many musicians use their private albums as a stepping stone to Hindi film music. I feel, if I can make equally good money through my private albums, why should I not do justice to my private projects?																								But you will get to hear Neeraj in a Bollywood film all right. That I did just because of my friend Salman Khan. He asked me to sing for him for a forthcoming film and I had to do it. It is a freaky dance number and has been composed by Himesh Reshammiya.																								So, Neeraj Shridhar has every reason to say, as in his new video, Aa raha hoon main!PRATIM D. GUPTA

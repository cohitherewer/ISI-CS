 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Alls not well but all are together
 A STAFF REPORTER Priyamvada Birla: Will war 																								How many times in the past three days have you heard that the Birlas are together?																								The unity moves  both visible and audible  just intensified on Thursday, from Birla Building to Birla Park.																								There is nothing special in this. We meet quite often and have meals together. Besides, there has been a bereavement in the family and everyone has come together, said S.K. Birla, reiterating that the family has always been very close.																								Old-timers, however, paint a slightly different picture  that all is not well, but all are together. And thats the way it has been through the division of family wealth and the disputes over ownership since the death of patriarch Ghanshyam Das Birla.																								There have been differences, but the family has never washed dirty linen in public The entire family comes together only to celebrate marriages or mourn deaths, added a loyalist of the Birla babus.																								This time, the bonding of the Birlas has been prompted by the will left by Priyamvada Birla, bequeathing all assets of the MP Birla group  estimated at over Rs 5,000 crore  to chartered accountant R.S. Lodha.																								At stake is the sanctity of the familys business dealings. While the prospect of the Birla assets passing on to an outsider  or an outsider gaining entry into the family tabernacle  is a shock to a Birla loyalist in his 60s, this is a bittersweet moment of reckoning.																								Around three years ago, the family was together during the marriage of Aditya Birlas daughter, Vasavdatta. Theyve all got together, including Kumar babu (Kumar Mangalam Birla) after the death of Priyamvada Birla. But never has the family closed ranks like this, he explained.																								The battle bugle was sounded by BK babu, no less, from Birla Building, the group headquarters at 9/1, R N Mukherjee Road, on Tuesday. The family was moving court  together  to contest the will, he said.																								People may say various things about the family, but we know we are together, reiterated S.K. Birla on Thursday. 																								This is a great news for people like us, who have served the family for years. No one would have known R.S. Lodha without the backing of the Birla family. He even became Ficci president as a Birla nominee, said another old-timer at Birla Building.																								But these days of cohesion cannot wipe out the decades of competition. For example, all the groups have cement plants, but there is very little synergy. The same holds true for the textile companies, be it Digjam of the S.K. Birla group and Grasim of the Aditya Birla group. But now, it seems they are determined to fight as a family. This is what Ghanshyam Dasji always wanted, summed up a loyalist.

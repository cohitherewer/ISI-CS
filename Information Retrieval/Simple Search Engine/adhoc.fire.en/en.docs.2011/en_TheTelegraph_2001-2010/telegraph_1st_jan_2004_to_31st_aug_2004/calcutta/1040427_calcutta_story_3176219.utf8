 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Tannery goes up in flames
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fire broke out on Monday afternoon at a tannery on CN Roy Road, in the Tiljala police station area. According to a fire services officer, it took five fire tenders nearly an hour to douse the flames. There was no casualty.																								At around 2.00 pm, workers at the processing unit on the second floor of the tannery noticed the flames in the godown, where chemicals were stored. 																								Before they could react, the fire spread and they rushed down. Neither did the tannery have fire-fighting equipment, nor did the workers try to check the flames from spreading, as they did not know how to, the officer said. 																								Five fire-tenders reached the site within 15 minutes. By the time we reached, the fire had spread to the adjacent rooms on the second floor and it took us nearly an hour to extinguish it. Smoke was billowing out of the windows and we had to take special care to get people out of the way because of the noxious fumes from the burning chemicals, the officer added.																								Inspector-in-charge of Tiljala police station Salil Bhattacharya said the cause of the fire is yet to be established. Preliminary investigations suggest a cigarette butt started the blaze, he said.																								Police are checking whether the tannery had the licence to store hazardous chemicals.

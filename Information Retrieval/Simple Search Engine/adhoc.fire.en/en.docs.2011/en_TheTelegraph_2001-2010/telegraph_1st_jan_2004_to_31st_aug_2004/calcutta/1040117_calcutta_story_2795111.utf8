 															- Four-legged brigade HIGHLIGHTs govts bharat ii insincerity OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Goat power for greener Calcutta: Taxi operators hit the street with an army of animals to protest the governments indifference to their plight. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Friday showed up Calcuttas drive towards a greener future for what it was. Even as a four-legged force took over the city centre, in a protest procession by go-slow transport operators, the judiciary urged the government to be more attentive and serious on the matter of Bharat Stage II.																								A Calcutta High Court division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, gave vent to its frustration at the tardy progress on the auto-emission issue.																								Chief Justice Mathur said the judiciary was far from satisfied with the state governments response to the April 2003 order that had stated that all vehicles would have to be Bharat II compliant by April 3, 2004.																								We are keeping a close watch on the situation and cannot help calling it very unfortunate, observed the chief justice.																								Stressing that the government must be more attentive and serious if it wanted to ensure a cleaner Calcutta, the chief justice said it needed to get its act together on this count and be more proactive.																								The bench was hearing a petition by Bulbul Gayen, who alleged that the government was not following the courts orders directing it to deny permits to routes on which non-Bharat II-compliant buses were plying. She added that the government was doing nothing to check the flagrant violation of the courts auto-emission directives.																								If the proceedings in the court of law were an embarrassment for the government, out on the streets, the issue caused complete chaos on Friday afternoon. Taxi operators, who have called an indefinite strike from January 20, descended on Rabindra Sadan with an army of horses, donkeys, goats and bullock carts to protest the governments knee-jerk reaction to the Bharat II diktat.																								The city, said the operators, would be left with horse or donkey or maybe goat power to steer it towards greener times, as most vehicles would have to go off the streets from April 4. 																								With no funds for conversion to Bharat II, they accused the government of turning a blind eye to their problems.																								The motley group, en route to a meeting with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Netaji Indoor Stadium, reached the JL Nehru Road-Shakespeare Sarani crossing at 1.30 pm. But with the police first stopping the protesters and then resorting to a lathicharge, traffic was thrown haywire till 3 pm.																								Chakraborty, who turned up for the meeting at 5.30 pm, was greeted by an empty negotiating table. After learning that the transporters had refused to meet him, protesting police high-handedness, Chakraborty left.																								Transporters later said the police action on the streets just proved that the government was insincere in its efforts to find a balanced solution to the Bharat II problem and vowed to go ahead with the twin strikes on January 20 (taxi) and January 21 (bus).

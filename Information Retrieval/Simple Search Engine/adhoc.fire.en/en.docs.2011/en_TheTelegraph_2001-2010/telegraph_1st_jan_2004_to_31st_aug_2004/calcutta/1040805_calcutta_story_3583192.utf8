The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Solace, laced with anxiety
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Students of Welland Gouldsmith School, where Hetal Parekh had studied for 12 years, never had such a feeling of relief on an examination day. 																								More than 2,000 girls were writing their routine unit tests on Wednesday morning, silently, but with a sense of relief.																								At 9 am, a telephone rang in the office of principal Gillian DCosta Hart. The caller was the first to inform her that the President had rejected Dhananjoy Chatterjees mercy petition. 																								I could not stop myselffrom conveying the news immediately to my teachers and the children. The rejection of Dhananjoys petition has brought relief to each one of us. We all welcome the Presidents decision, Hart said.																								Despite the unanimous feeling that justice had finally been delivered, anxious questions were doing the rounds: When is he going to be hanged? Has the date been fixed? Will he be allowed to file another petition? 																								A student said: We feel relieved to know that Dhananjoy will finally be hanged. Weve heard about the gruesome killing of Hetal over and over again. The punishment will make people think twice before committing such crimes. 																								Students and teachers of the school had joined hands with Hetals classmates in June to fight some city-based human rights groups efforts to persuade the government to pardon Dhananjoy. 																								The school had written to Governor Viren J. Shah, requesting him to urge the President not to pardon the killer. 																								Hetal was a lively girl and she was loved by all. She studied here from Nursery to Class V. We were determined to fight till the end, a teacher said.																								Hetal Parekhs soul will rest in peace only after Dhananjoy is hanged. Were, however, feeling extremely sorry for his family, principal Hart said. 																								A prayer will be organised for Hetal and Dhananjoys families on the day of the hanging, she added.

 Tuesday, July 06, 2004 				 Separate home recipe to save a marriage
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday tried to save a six-month marriage by directing the husband, an advocate, to set up his own home at Behala, in south Calcutta, away from his parents on the southern fringes of the city. 																								Justice N.A. Choudhury and Justice A.K. Bhattacharya adjourned the hearing of the anticipatory bail petition advocate Saidul Islam had filed, apprehending arrest in connection with charges brought against him of torturing his wife and forcing her to leave him and his joint family.																								On Monday, Justice Choudhury and Justice Bhattacharya asked Islam to rent a house at Behala within a fortnight  the deadline was fixed on Islams request and conveyed to the court through his counsel  and start living in it with wife Gulshan Ara Khatun, whom he married last October in Durgapur, Burdwan, after allegedly taking a dowry of Rs 1 lakh in cash, 16 bhari-worth of gold ornaments and a motorcycle. 																								The division bench also asked him to leave his parents at Usthi and start living in Behala, leaving behind his parents, brother and other family members. 																								Behala was preferred, perhaps, because many of Ara Khatuns relatives lived in the neighbourhood. 																								My husband, his brother and their parents would torture me both mentally and physically, Ara Khatun had alleged in the first information report she filed with Durgapur police station, after she left her in-laws house on June 15. 																								In her complaint, she had also requested the police to make arrangements for returning her ornaments.																								Ara Khatuns father, who was present in the court, said his daughter could only stay with her husband if he set up home at Behala. Islam informed the court through his counsel that he would require at least a fortnight to make arrangements for setting up a separate establishment.

 																											- Doctor-chemist joint drive to identify and treat diabetics BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Its an alliance forged to battle the most silent of killers.																								Doctors, faced with an ever-increasing number of diabetics queuing up at their clinics, and chemists, selling more and more phials of insulin, have decided to pad up in tandem and take fresh guard against the deadly disease that preys on unsuspecting patients.																								Undertaken by the Diabetic Association of India (DAI) state branch, the Partners in diabetes-awareness programme is an attempt to replicate a similar initiative in Canada that proved immensely successful, say the men behind the mission.																								According to the plan, around 60 oft-frequented retail chemists outlets will be assigned the job of identifying and then treating diabetes patients. The patient will not have to queue up in front of a doctors chamber. Instead, the infrastructure necessary for diagnosis and treatment will be at his/her disposal so that no time is wasted.																								We are confident of kicking off the programme within a month, DAI state unit vice-president and head of the department of endocrinology at SSKM Hospital Subhankar Chowdhury said on Sunday. We are now in the process of identifying the outlets to be used in the project, he added. The 60 chemists selected will be asked to target, according to initial plans, around 1.5 lakh Calcuttans in the six months, over which the programme will run its course.																								India, with more than 32.7 million cases, is already the diabetes capital of the world. If the situation is grim, the outlook is grimmer still. By 2025, World Health Organisation estimates say the country is heading towards a pandemic level, with more than 57 million cases of diabetes.																								The metros, with their stress-filled lifestyle, account for a bulk of the diabetics. A National Urban Diabetes Study, undertaken recently, put the number of diabetics in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad at one in every eight. 																								Calcutta fares slightly better than the all-metro list, with around 10 per cent of its adult population affected. More and more young adults  in the 20-30 age group  are falling prey, warn the organisers.																								All the 60 chemists to be picked must be at prime locations, preferably the busiest intersections, like Hazra, Gariahat, Bhowanipore and Shyambazar. One person from each outlet will be selected for a training course. He will have to interact with potential patients, convince them of the need to go in for a blood-glucose estimate (to be done at the outlet itself) and inform them of the nearest doctor and diabetic clinic.

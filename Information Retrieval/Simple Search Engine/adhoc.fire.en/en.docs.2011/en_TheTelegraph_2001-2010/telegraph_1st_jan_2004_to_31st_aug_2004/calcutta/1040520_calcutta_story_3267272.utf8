 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Sun turns up heat, Howrah taps dry
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								As the mercury climbs, the taps of several wards of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) have gone dry, compelling residents to buy drinking water. 																								Every summer, we face this problem. The HMC hibernates, instead of providing us with water, complained Sudhir Bhattacharya, a resident of ward 26. The area has been going without water for over a week. 																								Residents said Prasanna Kumar Dutta Lane, Dayal Banerjee Road, Gangamani Road, Ramji Hazra Lane and Neelratan Mukherjee Road are the worst-affected. At a local girls school, the authorities were forced to employ people to bring in drums of water.																								There are several handpumps in this area but most are not functioning, said Shankar Ghose, a local resident.																								The affected wards are 1, 2, 3, 26 and 45 to 50. Residents of parts of wards 45 to 50 are buying water from young men of the locality, at Rs 5 for 10 litres. 																								Its expensive but we are forced to buy drinking water, said Arati Das. Others pointed out that the added areas of the HMC face water scarcity every year and residents buy water.																								As expected, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee gave the assurance that the problem will be resolved soon. He, however, could not explain the steps he had taken to solve the age-old problem.																								HMC officials said unless the second phase of the Padmapukur water project is ready, no effective measure can be taken to solve the problem. The first phase of the project supplies 33,000 gallons of drinking water a day to the HMC areas. 																								The number of pumps utilised is eight, with a stand-by for emergencies. The water supplied is insufficient for the present population. 																								The project could not be completed earlier for lack of funds. This time, we think that it would be completed before the Pujas, said the officials, on condition of anonymity. 																								Other causes of insufficient water, the officials said, are the highrises that are illegally drawing water from the road lines of the water supply. 																								Second, the tap lines on the road are draining out a few gallons of drinking water a year. 																								The third cause, they said, was wastage of drinking water by residents. 																								Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said: We are trying to implement a water tax in Howrah from the coming month, and I think these problems will be solved automatically.

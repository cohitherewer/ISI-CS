The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Bus in race claims life
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Another mishap  barely a few metres from Fridays spot where a school-goer was mowed down by a bus  occurred on Saturday, taking another life.																								And, again, the unsuspecting woman was the victim of rivalry between two buses trying to overtake each other. One of them mounted the pavement at Chiriamore  also on BT Road  crushing 40-year-old Baby Bhaumik under its wheels.																								Both buses were impounded. The driver of one was arrested, the other fled.																								While the crowd at Chiriamore was not provoked into creating a disorder, there was a rerun of the mayhem on BT Road at Taratala on Friday. The busy Diamond Harbour Road was shut down for over three hours after a bus sent a 32-year-old motorcyclist to hospital.																								Md Islam of Ekbalpore was hit by a bus, which, too, was trying to rush ahead of another bus, at the Taratala crossing. Angry residents blocked the arterial road for nearly an hour in the morning, causing a bumper-to-bumper snarl.																								The bus, which caused the mishap, was stoned. A similar fate awaited the police vehicle that rushed there with reinforcements to control the situation.																								According to police, the incident took place around 10.40 am on Taratala Road near the third gate of Calcutta Port Trust. Apparently, the incident took place when the driver was overtaking another private bus. He managed to flee though he left the vehicle behind, an official of the traffic department said.																								Islam was admitted to SSKM Hospital, where his condition was stated to be serious.																								Confronted by an angry mob, officials from the local police station initially tried to reason with the demonstrators. But the mob would not listen; very few traffic policemen were to be found at the spot despite the rising number of mishaps. The blockade was lifted only around 1.30 pm, when senior police officials rushed to the spot and intervened.

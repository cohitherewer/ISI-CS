 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Appeal against no-tax verdict
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government will move an appeal on Friday against the verdict of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya, who struck down the governments decision to collect five-year taxes from owners of four-wheelers and a lifetime tax from owners of two-wheelers.																								Last Friday, Calcutta High Court ruled that owners of cars and two-wheelers in the state need not pay the five-year or the lifetime tax, and added that those who had already paid up would be refunded, with interest.																								A certified copy of Justice Bhattacharyas order was received on Thursday by the office of advocate-general Balai Ray. According to a government spokesperson, a brief meeting was scheduled for later in the evening to discuss the appeal strategy.

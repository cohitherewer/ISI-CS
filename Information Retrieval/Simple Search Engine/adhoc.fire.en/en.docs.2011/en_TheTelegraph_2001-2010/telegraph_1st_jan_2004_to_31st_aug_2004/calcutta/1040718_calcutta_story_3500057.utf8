The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 18, 2004 Of customs and characters 
clubsandwichIt was one of the most venerable of senior citizens conclaves those days. Every afternoon, Sir Josna Ghosal would preside with his close friends Nawab K.G.M. Faroqui, Sir Biren Mookerjee and Sisir Mullick at what was then referred to as Joes Corner in the Mens Bar.Basanta Chowdhury, who later inherited Nawab Faroquis vintage coin collection, though a teetotaller, joined in at times. Other club members kept a studied distance from this exclusive assembly.The Mens Bar at Calcutta Club, that distinguished watering hole where the average age of lunchtime tipplers was once a formidable 75, has now become the Regal Bar. True, it still remains an exclusive bastion of male members, but the institution is keen to shed its frightfully posh and proper persona.Post-Independence, the days of the Nawabs and Maharajas are gone and the club management committee doesnt comprise six knights and three sitting judges anymore. Since the tenure of the last European president A.G.M. Twinning, the expats too have taken their leave.Now, theres a conscious effort to present a younger face. The whole idea is to create an atmosphere wherein youngsters wont feel intimidated, observes club CEO and secretary S.N. Banerjee. Acknowledging the fact that liquor drives revenues these days, the management has been renovating the various bars and the dining hall in a phased manner.If the Regal Bar and its annexe on the first floor sport a new look, the Royal Coochbehar Lounge  which was donated by Maharaja Nripendra Narayan Bhup of Coochbehar  has been made a mixed bar, with women allowed in even unescorted. The two other bars on the ground floor, the Passage Bar and Room No. 7 amp; Srimati, have also got a facelift.The customs and characters of the bars have also evolved with time. In the early 1970s, whenever the club president walked in, every member at the bars had to refill their tumblers with a club peg (less than half a peg measure) to raise a toast in his honour, remembers D.K. Roy, manager, welfare and maintenance. Those were the days when some sahibs were still around at the bars, like the Silverstones, the Blacks and the Crawleys.Such practices have mostly been done away with. Still, members have their pet corners. While men in the evening prefer the tall bar stools of the Passage Bar, the lazy afternoons at the Regal are often the exclusive preserve of bureaucrats, lawyers and doctors, says the CEO. The for senior gentlemen only aura, which once hung so heavy, is slowly lifting, but a lot of work still needs to be done. So the upgraded air-conditioned sports complex, the Tandoori Corner, the solar heating system in the swimming pool, the floodlit tennis court, the renovated cards room We will ring in many more changes in the lead-up to our centenary celebrations, promises Banerjee.

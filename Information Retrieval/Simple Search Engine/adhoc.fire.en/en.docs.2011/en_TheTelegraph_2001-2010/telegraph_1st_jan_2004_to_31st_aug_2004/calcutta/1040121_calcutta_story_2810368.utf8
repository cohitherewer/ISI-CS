		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Making new beginnings
 Feng Shui / Pinky Kapoor																								Feng Shui lovers can make new beginnings in life on this Chinese New Year, which falls on January 22, a very auspicious New Moon day. It is believed that old worries and conflicts should always be resolved or forgotten in the old year and never carried forward as they influence the good luck of the new year.																								We all know that each year of the 12 years of the Chinese lunar calendar is named after an animal. As the story goes, there were 12 animals who had come to bid Lord Buddha farewell before he departed from the earth and they were all blessed with a year named after them. People born in the year 1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992 and also this year 2004 belong to the Monkey sign and its amazing how people born in the year which is ruled by a specific animal, attain its characteristics. For example, people born in the Monkey year are very energetic but impatient and restless at the same time. They are extremely intelligent, always willing to take on a challenge and helpful by nature but tend to be great show-offs at times.																								People born under the sign of the Monkey will definitely gain more power this year but people born in the year of the Tiger would feel a greater impact. Tiger people are those who are born in the years 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986 and 1998. The reason behind this is that the monkey clashes with the tiger that confronts it directly in the cycle of the 12 earthly branches. Moreover, the monkeys element is yang metal, which directly threatens the tiger whose element is yang wood. As a result, the Tiger people will be under a lot of mental and physical stress. They will have to be extra careful regarding their health and business finances and if they are students, then academic pressure will weigh them down. The animal that makes these two compatible is the snake, which is why the snake becomes a powerful lucky mascot for Tiger people this year. They are best advised to keep a figure of the snake on the office or the bedside table or its picture in the wallet. If any couple has a combination of these two clashing animals, then they have to be extra careful about their relationship this year. This clash comes after a cycle of 12 years and hence is a powerful and significant one. The best remedy for such a couple would be to keep a figure of a snake along with the couples photo in the south-west section of their bedroom.		 Tomorrow is Chinese New  Year, the year of the Monkey, when people can make a  fresh start in life, putting old troubles and grievances  behind themThe Chinese prepare for and celebrate the new year by undergoing extensive cleansing of the house much before this day and rest on the New Year itself. No cleansing is done on this day as they believe that the good luck could also be washed away. They do not use sharp tools like scissors and knives, taking extra care that nothing falls or breaks in the house. They keep away from quarrels and arguments as they believe that whatever occurs on this day will somehow set a pattern for the rest of the year. On New Years eve, they burn fire crackers, light incense sticks, candles and bright lights, ring bells and wind chimes so that the noise that is made by them cleanses the previous years energy. They start the New Year by taking blessings from God, grandparents and parents and then visit friends and relatives to exchange such gifts as lemon plants along with three Chinese coins tied with a red ribbon, red flowers, bamboo shoots and baskets of oranges which are symbolic of good fortune and prosperity. Finally they have a great feast and eat the best of everything so that they get good food for the rest of the year.																								The year 2003 marks the end of the period 7 and a new age of 8 now begins. It means that the ruling number 8 is in power and signifies prosperity for the next 20 years. So buying houses, cars or mobiles where the numbers sum up to eight and dates like 8th, 17th, and 26th are considered to be very auspicious. You can also give strength to this number by energising the north-east sector that it rules. Simply placing eight pieces of semi-precious rubies in a crystal bowl in the north-east corner of the house can enhance good luck.																								Tip of the week:																								Please remember that January 22, 2004 is a very powerful day to make your wishes. The auspicious time to do so is at 2.30 a.m. Believe me, it will be worth disturbing your sleep to write down your wishes and to keep the piece of paper in a red envelope in your place of worship. Light a scented candle and sit and meditate on your wishes for five to 10 minutes. The intensity of your wishes will certainly make them come true.

		 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 For urban use, electricity from refuse
 SUN-DRIVEN: Moushumi Island, in South 24-Parganas, the countrys largest solar power plant, serving 700 consumers. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySanjana Basu: What are the types of energy that can be generated for urban use?																																																													Though we mostly work in the rural areas, renewable energy is also fit for urban use. For the urban areas, we plan to generate energy from urban waste. Recently, we have entered into a collaboration with a US-based firm to assemble a micro-turbine to convert waste into electricity. The project will take off soon after the Lok Sabha elections. However, this process, like solar assemblies, cannot be set up individually, as a large amount of waste is needed for power generation. The turbine, too, is very costly for an individual to maintain. However, for community use, such power will be a boon, as it will also help clear up the garbage of the area.

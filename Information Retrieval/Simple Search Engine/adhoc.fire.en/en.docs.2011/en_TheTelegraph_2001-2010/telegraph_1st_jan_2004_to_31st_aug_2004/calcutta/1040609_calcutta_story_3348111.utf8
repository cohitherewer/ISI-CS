 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Killer identified, cops baffled over motive
 A STAFF REPORTERIn the Maidan murder, the cops have a name to clutch on, but about the rest they remain clueless. In the Jorabagan killing, the veil may have been lifted on the identity of the assassin, but the motive remains shrouded in mystery.																								Rekha Chandok, 30, was strangled with the wire of an electric iron and her throat was slit with the sharp edges of a broken bottle on Monday evening in her north Calcutta apartment.																								By Tuesday evening, police were in a position to name the prime suspect  Narendra Kumar Bagri, cousin of the victims husband, Shibprasad Chandok.																								The motive is not clear and the whereabouts of Bagri and his associates are unknown.																								Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said: Preliminary investigations suggest that he (Bagri) had no plans to kill her (Rekha) when he approached her for money for the third time on Monday. He desperately wanted some money and if Rekha would have handed over the cash and jewellery (worth about Rs 13,000) without any resistance, we feel she would have been left unhurt.																								But the money motive remains murky, said sleuths on the case. Can Rs 13,000 be reason enough for such a violent crime, is the unanswered question ringing the loudest.																								It is only Bagri who can tell us why he killed her. He could have just gagged her and walked out of the house with the cash and jewellery, said an officer of Jorabagan police station.																								It could be that one of his accomplices came to know that she had called her husband up (Rekha had slipped out of the house and rung Shibprasad from a phone booth). He (Bagri) may have panicked and acted in haste, he added.																								What is clear is that Bagri and his accomplices entered the ground-floor flat of the Chandoks Haradhole Lane residence around 3.15 pm on Monday. They asked Rekha for a glass of water and some paper to write something important.																								Sensing trouble, she hurried to a nearby phone booth, called up husband Shibprasad and told him about his cousins visit. She returned home after her husband asked her to tell Bagri to meet him at his garment store.																								What happened then remains a blur  Rekhas body, bathed in blood, was found lying in the flat around 4.30 pm by her neighbours. The assassins had strangled her with a wire and slit her throat.																								They then left the place unnoticed. It was only when Rekhas two-and-a-half-year-old daughter came crying to the neighbours did they discover the womans body, said Dulal Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of the local police station.																								According to police sources, Bagri had been driven out of his house by his parents a few months ago, after falling into bad company. He has been living somewhere near Teghoria since, said an officer.

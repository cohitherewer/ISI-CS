Skinny Alley, the Calcutta-based band of veteran musicians, belted out tracks from their album Escape the Roar. They also rendered a power-packed performance of popular covers and newer songs that are set to feature in their next album.																					Pune-based Derek Julien, popularly known as one of Indias finest guitarists, was the star of the evening, in town to jam with old friends Jayashree and Gyan Singh. Jayashree, the vocalist and lyricist of the band, was absolutely thrilled to have the 53-year-old virtuoso accompanying them. Please put your hands together for a very old and dear friend. Weve never really played together and we look forward to the jam, beamed Jayashree while introducing Derek.																					The silver-haired musician, lovingly dubbed the Sultan of Stringz for the evening, in turn regaled the packed pub with his unique pick as you pluck style of playing, with an overgrown fore-fingernail. What followed was an eclectic repertoire of originals and covers including impromptu sequences of untitled tunes sans lyrics, dubbed work in progress. 																					The bonhomie and camaraderie among the band members was clear even though the gig was the result of just some last minute practice with Derek, who has been in the city for the past couple of days. 																					The veterans talent was clear with original tracks like Pleasures of Suburbia from Escape the Roar, and covers like Voodoo Chile by Jimi Hendrix, Tutu by Miles Davis, John Mayers Why Georgia, Audioslaves Like a Stone , and Smile and Wave by Screaming Headless Torsos.																					Fans got a glimpse into their next venture when brand-new numbers like Swunk, Child Bride and How It Is premiered. The songs  featuring a new rock sound tapping into the bands mastery over various styles like jazz, country, fusion and pop along with rock, developed over years in the profession  will be part of an experimental album.																					This one will be very different from the last in the sense that we wont be recording it in a studio. It will just be recorded live at home without any overdubs. A raw sound capturing the music of the moment is what we are looking at, revealed Jayashree.  The cutting chai stall at Tantra on Saturday night. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Filmi beats																					The weekend action continued at The Park on Saturday night. Tantra, the nightclub, resembled a sinful den straight out of a Bollywood flick. The action started almost on the street with the path leading up to it resembling a typical alley in Mumbai, complete with posters and paan shops.																					You can never really go wrong with the biggest religion in India. Bollywood numbers  both old and new  drew in more than a usual turnout this weekend, with the crowd jiving with a passion rarely part of the Calcutta party scene. A free flow of alcohol added fire to the mood, with a couple of rowdy stags adding to the ambience.																					But not too many people were complaining as the potent smell of gajras (flower garlands), being handed out free at the entrance, linger in the muggy air and filmi songs like Aisa Jadoo from Khakee, Dekh Le, Ankhon Mein Ankhein from Munnabhai MBBS, Bin Tere Sanam by DJ Suketu, Chhod Do Aanchal by Bombay Vikings and Sajna ve Sajna from Chameli pumped up the heat.																					Those in need of a breather took a break at the stalls outside. They were seen hogging pav bhaji, egg rolls (the only Calcutta touch), paan or cutting chai (half glass, in true Mumbai parlance), while the formidable looking bouncers in black banyans and trousers, sporting black tikas and surma, with gajras wound around their wrists, kept gatecrashers far away.																					The mood changed somewhat when the Channel [V] crew including VJs Kim and Sarah-Jane (in town for the Get Gorgeous model hunt, which rocked Tantra on Sunday night) dropped by in the wee hours to shake a leg. The DJs then spun out a little house and hip-hop to satisfy the demand of the hour. By that time the crowd had, in any case, danced to their fill of the Mumbai diet. But Kim was not too tired to make a trip to the cutting chai stall outside. Skinny Alley perform at Someplace Else on Friday night. Picture by Rashbehari Das												Keep it cool																					A new look for the season is breathing new life into Shoppers Stop. The Forum mega-store launched its spring-summer collection under the brand names of Life and Stop on Saturday. Titled Escape, the collection features summery hues and easy cuts in comfortable cottons. 																					The idea behind Escape was to provide relief from the stress that has become part and parcel of our life today. Weve done our bit by introducing styles, cuts and fabrics that are all about understated style in a chic way, says Somnath Sarkar, manager, operations, Shoppers Stop. 																					e Life is targetted at teens looking to celebrate the sultry summer in flirty florals and pale pastels, Stop features mainly formals for office wear but packs in some lounge wear as well. Shirts in checks and stripes are balanced by elegant evening wear in satin and georgette. 																					Vettorio Fratini  the purely desi brands foreign sounding name is just a gimmick to lend a touch of class  is a new premium shirt label. The collection offers semi-formal and formal wear ranging from business wear to evening and weekend wear in wrinkle-free cotton and polyester blends. 																					Kashish, the ethnic line, has both short cotton kurtas for him and kurtis for her, featuring embellishments like beads and mirrors along with festive colours like flaming reds, oranges, turmeric yellows, indigo blues and majestic purples. 																					e the Life range is priced between Rs 399 and Rs 999, Stop ranges from Rs 599 to Rs 999, Vettorio Fratini from Rs 740 to Rs 1,499 and Kashish from Rs 1,295 to Rs 1,595.																																													No rock, no roll																					All those at Big Ben on Saturday expecting the blasting sounds of vintage rock from around 40 years ago were in for a shock when Hindi music  the same you might hear on any night, at any disco  ruled the sound system on Woodstock Nite.																					ive band was on hand but didnt do much playing. Saffron scarves with om prints dangled from the walls, and were sported by the waiters as headgear, in an attempt to creating a hippie feel. A caricaturist and body-painter were posted at the entrance. But with reigning pop hits like Chhod Do Aanchal and Its the Time to Disco pounding through the pub, the music (the good ol rock and roll, we mean) was treacherously close to dying.																					It was supposed to be a Woodstock night, but it turned out to be more of an attempt at a Dum Maro Dum night, remarked one disappointed party-goer.																					But Big Ben, the otherwise charming nightclub at The Kenilworth, has a lot more lined up for the next few months, in a package called the Norwester Months. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays will see the live bands Cognac, Barefoot and Blue Mist perform. Mumbais DJ Bhaves is playing for the next month. Theme nights and special Saturday parties are also to be held, all part of the clubs attempt to jazz up its 40-plus image, and bring in the young crowd.

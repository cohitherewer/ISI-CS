The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Private agents to monitor fire safeguards
 DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY																								Crippled by a serious shortage of manpower, the fire services department is eyeing help from private agencies to prevent commercial buildings in and around the city from going up in flames. Department officials said they were giving the project its finishing touches. The collaboration, they explained, comes in the wake of several fires in the city lately.																								Commercial buildings marked dangerous will have to obtain a fire safety certificate issued by the department and highrises will require a no-objection certificate before occupancy. This, the officials said, needs strict monitoring and physical verification to ensure that the norms have been followed by the owners and promoters of the buildings. However, with the city limits expanding fast, and given the departments existing human resources, it is difficult to take up monitoring duties, officials said.																								So, we have decided to introduce a licensed agency system. Agencies with experience will be engaged, Baren Sen, director of fire services, told Metro on Monday. Initially, a particular agency will visit a building and submit reports. On getting the reports, the fire safety certificate will be issued, he said. 																								Officials said they plan to start off with central Calcutta and its adjoining areas, where the incidence of fire in commercial buildings was highest. 																								In the past three months, there have been at least three major fires in the Burrabazar area, apart from other small incidents across the city, causing concern to the authorities.																								Although a single or two-storeyed building will not require a clearance certificate from the fire services department, a physical verification will be conducted to ensure that there was no office or commercial establishment being run by the owner, Sen said. A private agent will study the nature of risk associated with a particular building, he added.																								That apart, agents will also visit a building after periodic intervals to see whether the owner was abiding by the departments norms. An owner who has failed to instal or maintain certain fire-fighting equipment will be asked to comply immediately, Sen said. For this, a building-owner will have to pay a fee, the amount of which will be determined soon.																								Already, a number of agencies have applied and a final selection will be made on the basis of their past performance.																								We feel that if such checks are conducted regularly, the incidence of fire can be curbed, an official said. In addition, people will become conscious of the need to maintain the safety of their buildings, he added. In several recent cases, a residential building razed by flames was actually housing godowns of combustible goods, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004  Lounge leisure, the French wayHimika Chaudhuri, Zeeshan Jawed															The Chambers, the members-only lounge at Taj Bengal, has revamped its offering of fine French cuisine.																					The new menu retains the popular dishes and includes some new names too. A classic French meal can consist of as many as 13 courses, but here they restrict the courses to four  starters, soup, main course, dessert. Starting from the Scampi Souffl with Boursin Herb Cheese to Fresh Asparagus and Pine-nut Soup, to seafood and red-meat options for the entre, the items promise to floor even the toughest critic. The French connection being explored at the Chambers lounge in Taj BengalThe experience and treatment is designed to pamper privileged guests. Every move you make once inside the Chambers is aided by a group of well-trained stewards. Caution: those not used to such attention and navigating their way through the large range of forks, spoons and knives might feel a little like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman before the makeover.																					The croissants served here are baked at 5.30 am every morning, the ice cream is freshly made every day, too. The food is made in real time  everything is cooked, from start to finish, only after a guest places an order. Our guests usually come for a relaxed dinner so we get ample time to pamper them, said chef Surinder Singh.																					The taste of many of the dishes we serve here has to be acquired over time or through special inclination for fine French food, added Singh. With the biggest names of Calcuttas social and business circuit seen in this exclusive lounge, it always helps to make those little changes in the menu to surprise diners.																					Class of LSE																					Members of the Calcutta alumni association of the London School of Economics (LSE) came together at a private event last week for a walk down memory lane. From a graduate of the 1958 batch to one that finished in 2003, the turnout was diverse and impressive. 																					In the plush Southern Avenue drawing room of Calcutta alumni leader Nayantara Pal Choudhuri, the evening moved from a formal introductory session of all members present, to a rewind back to life at one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world.

From 21-year-olds enrolling in Economics courses to a serving Indian Administrative Services officer going for a year-long course on sustainable development, the new batch has a dozen students headed for LSE from Calcutta.																					How difficult it was to maintain the required grades at LSE and how lonely a foreign city can get without some good friends were some of the issues broached at the meet.																					LSE, which already runs an external programme in Techna, Salt Lake, is thinking of starting more courses in association with Presidency College and Jadavpur University.																					Discount deal																					It might be a bit too early to feel the Pujas in the air but the festive mood has started flowing at city malls.																					On Saturday, film-maker-actress Aparna Sen launched the Shoppers Stop Sananda Pujor Bazar Privilege Card, which will enable Sananda readers to get discounts at the chains outlets. 																					The shopping fiesta kick started on August 28 and will continue till October 10. The card is available with the magazine issue dated August 30.

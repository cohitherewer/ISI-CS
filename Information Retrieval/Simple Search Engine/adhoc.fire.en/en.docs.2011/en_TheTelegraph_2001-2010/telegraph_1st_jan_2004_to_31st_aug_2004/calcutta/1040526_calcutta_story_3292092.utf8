The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Penalty broom for poll mess
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should candidates be penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days? More letters will be published next week Paint-and-run: A party worker in action before the electionsSushma Jalan, 
																		Burdwan Road																																																														Once the elections are over, graffiti serve no purpose but make the city look dirtier than ever. Political parties then do not bother to come forward to remove the clutter. Only if a few errant candidates are penalised will others take the initiative to clean the walls for fear of stern action against them. One can make out whether or not the politicians will work for society by their eagerness to participate in the anti-graffiti drive. 									

T.R. Anand, 
																		Budge Budge 																																																														Yes, candidates should be penalised if poll graffiti is not removed within a week. It is high time some kind of discipline is infused in politicians or else things will go awry. Whether the politicians will abide by the rule is a million-dollar question, answer to which should be sought from the politicians themselves. The Lok Sabha elections are long over and a new government at the Centre has come to power. Then, why havent the graffiti been removed till now? The state government should take this matter seriously and slap hefty fines on offenders.									

Shalini Mitra, 
																		New Delhi																																																														Poll graffiti is necessary as it informs the citizens about the contestants in the fray. Once the poll is over, the banners and pamphlets on the walls and the trees make every street corner look like a garbage dump. The politician represents the common people. Therefore, his foremost duty is to be a responsible citizen. Hence, he owes it to his people to erase the graffiti he had put up. Otherwise, imposing a penalty is the only option. 									

Sandipan Paul,
																		Salt Lake																																																														Candidates should be penalised if their partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days of the elections coming to an end. Party workers who enthusiastically put up the banners and posters should have a sense of responsibility to dismantle the hoardings once their purpose is achieved. 									

Rajarshi Ghosh,
																		Surya Nagar																																																														Small fines have no effect. The candidates should be heavily penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed. It is really annoying to see billboards, hoardings, flags, banners and posters lying in tatters all over the city. These candidates create much hue and cry over issues of cleanliness. Once elected, they tend to suffer from amnesia. 									

Biman Saha, 
																		Lake Town																																																														Poll graffiti or banners are not always responsible for visual pollution. They add to the citys beauty if written artistically and disposed of in an organised manner. The lampoons also are a source of humour for passers-by. But poll graffiti should be removed post-election, especially if they are on private property. But a week is not enough. At least a month must be given for the job. If the concerned candidate does not adhere to this rule, then he/she should be penalised. 									

P. Pramanik, 
																		Santoshpur Avenue																																																														Yes, the proposed rule should be immediately and strictly enforced. The whole city looks ugly with the poll graffiti. 									

Indranil Sengupta, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														Not only the candidates, but also their respective parties should be brought to book if poll graffiti is not removed within seven days of the elections. Usually, after the polls, the candidates simply do not bother about the dirty walls. The eyesores can be avoided if strict rules are framed and implemented against this practice. Punitive action must be taken against both the candidates and the party for flouting rules.									

Piyal Mukherjee,
																		Lake Town. 																																																														After elections, most of the candidates do not care to clean the poll graffiti as they are reluctant to incur the expenses for the job. But introduction of a penal clause, if implemented in letter and spirit, will go a long way in removing these ugly writings on the walls. 									

Bhupen Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park. 																																																														Definitely. Poll graffiti completely ruins the look of an area. They must be thoroughly cleaned within 48 hours of polling. Seven days is a very long period. 									

Deba Prasad Bhattacharyya, 
																		Sonarpur.																																																														Yes, why not? The elections may be over but political graffiti, banners and festoons continue to crowd the city. Busy celebrating victory or reflecting over defeat, party leaders and workers have little time to clean up the city. Then who will clean up the poll mess?									

Pitam Deb, 
																		Belgachhia. 																																																														It is undoubtedly the moral responsibility of the candidates to clear all the graffiti after the election. But in case of failure, punitive action against them will be unjust. Actually it is the legal responsibility of the civic bodies to keep our surroundings clean. Electioneering is a part of the democratic system. Hence, if necessary, the government should meet the expenses for clearance of graffiti as it does in conducting elections.									

Utpal Dutt, 
																		Purba Sinthee.																																																														Of course, it is the moral duty of the candidates. These graffiti are a source of visual pollution which must be taken care of by them.									

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 
																		Barasat.																																																														Campaigning is a part of electioneering. The political parties think that they are within their rights to paint poll graffiti on our walls despite requests to the contrary. Our aesthetic sense receives a severe jolt when we find poll graffiti, including doggerel, on our walls. What a defacement of public property to woo the voters! The houses are ours, but the outer walls are theirs. We want a Daniel to save us from this onslaught. 									

Debasish Chakraborty,
																		Cossipore. 																																																														Candidates should definitely be penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days as they have no right to deface walls of buildings belonging to others.																																																														 But it is often found that they are not wiped even the poll is over. They ought to do so within seven days merely to keep clean both the urban and rural areas simultaneously failing which the higher authority should penalise them for defacing the entire areas.

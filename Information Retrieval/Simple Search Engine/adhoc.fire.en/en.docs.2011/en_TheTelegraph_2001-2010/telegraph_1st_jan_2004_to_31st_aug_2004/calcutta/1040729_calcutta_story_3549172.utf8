 															- Enter, mystery shopping audit services SUBHAJIT BANERJEE																								Shop floor managers, beware. Mystery shoppers are on the prowl. They look and behave like any other shop-hopper  housewife, college kid or young exec  but besides picking up products at random, they also make mental notes and rate the establishment on its soft skills.																								And its not consumer firms trying to do their job through these sneaks, but the companies themselves, who are trying to improve services by appointing third parties to detect the problems.																								With new malls coming up and international chains opening their outlets in the city, companies are realising the need to offer the customer a better shopping experience, says Suparno Moitra, manager, business development of SGS India, which is offering mystery shopping audit services.																								The Switzerland-based testing, inspection, verification and certification agency claims to have recently introduced the concept of mystery shopping audit in India. Calcutta may have been a little late in catching up with this, but its picking up very fast, Moitra adds. The list of SGS clients includes clothing retailers, jewellers, opticians, footwear chains, theme parks and even private nursing homes.																								Some factors on which evaluation is done include parking space availability, behaviour and adequacy of staff members and display of product line.																								Generally, for services and product qualities, companies have an internal checking mechanism. But that lacks a professional outlook and expertise, explains Moitra. As an unbiased third party, we are able to provide that.																								Based on the experience of the SGS shopping team  comprising its own employees and regular shoppers who are briefed accordingly  the agency provides a detailed report and factsheet to the company, pointing out the problem areas. 																								Most clients, says Moitra, have returned satisfied to the agency for a second round of introspection and self-evaluation.																								Initially, some of them were hesitant with the new concept, adds Moitra. We convinced them that the idea is never to spy on what employees are doing, but to look at whether the customer is receiving the treatment he deserves.																								Interestingly, its not only the new shops and malls offering similar product lines that are trying to stay ahead of competition with better service and atmosphere, but also old-schoolers attempting to stem losses. That includes old bookstores and confectioners hoping for a turnaround.																								Product testing is also offered by SGS, particularly for apparel, leather, toys, food, medicine and packaged drinking water through its 16 labs across the country. 																								One of the more interesting projects was commissioned by FIFA to test the quality of footballs manufactured in Sialkot and Punjab, prior to the last World Cup.

 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Buddha boon for blind student
 															- He  told me to continue my studies and not worry about money  SANJAY MANDAL				 	 KUDOS AND A HELPING HAND: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has kind words for Rinku Das at the felicitation of meritorious Madhyamik 2003 candidates. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Rinku Das cannot read a book  without holding it to her eyes, and that, too, only under  a bright sun. Father Badal is a daily wage-earner at a tailoring  shop in Howrah and mother Urmila rolls bidis to feed  her three children, of whom Rinku is the eldest.																								A cruel lack of sight and a woeful lack of resources could not stop the girl from Debinagar Balika Vidyalaya, in Habra, from scoring 566 in Madhyamik 2003, topping the list of blind girl students, according to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.																								On Thursday, some of her struggles stood vindicated and a bit of her burden was eased when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took special note of Rinku at a function to felicitate meritorious students.																								The chief minister, on learning of Rinkus extraordinary success story, promised to bear her educational expenses and asked the West Bengal Board for Secondary Education to ensure that she could continue studying humanities at Kalyangar Balika Vidyalaya.																								There was no missing the relief that Rinku felt. After all, she had been heartbroken when her parents told her that it was becoming impossible to meet the expenses of her higher studies. Our other two children are also studying, explained mother Urmila.																								The chief minister told me to continue my studies and not to worry about money, Rinku later smiled.																								And it all happened in a flash. As she was led on to the Rabindra Sadan stage by one of the volunteers to receive her award from the chief minister, Rinku spoke softly to Bhattacharjee. The chief minister held out an affectionate hand and was seen nodding at her words.																								Then, in the middle of the function, Bhattacharjee called Rinku and her mother backstage to learn in detail about the girls plight.																								The chief minister immediately assured Rinku and her family that the government would bear the expense for her education, said Board president Dibyendu Hota. We will send all her details to the chief minister on Friday. On behalf of the Board, we will ask the school authorities and her parents to keep in touch with us, he added.																								Till the other day, Rinku could study only under sunlight and was unsure how far she could pursue her studies. But now, we have a high-powered bulb, under which I can read, even if it is dark outside, she explained.																								And with the chief minister coming forward to help, the darkness in Rinkus world seemed far less forbidding.

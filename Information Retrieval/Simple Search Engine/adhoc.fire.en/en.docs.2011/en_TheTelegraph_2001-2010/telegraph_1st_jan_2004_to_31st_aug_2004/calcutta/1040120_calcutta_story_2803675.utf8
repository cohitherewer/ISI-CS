The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004  Beauty buzz									Models at the Oriflame show at Science CityA speciality from the Noodle Fest at Trincas Ming Room				 															Oriflame, the Swedish cosmetic major has plans to splash Calcutta with colour. Towards this end, it recently hosted a mega-event at Science City on the E.M. Bypass. While brilliant navy-blue banners screaming out the brands name fluttered in the late-afternoon breeze, a 2,000-strong crowd pushed and jostled to secure the best seats in the auditorium.																																																				And Oriflame did not disappoint its patrons. The event that followed was a two-pronged one, and took in two power-packed hours of business punctuated with unadulterated fun. Titled Oriflame Kicks Off 2004, the show took off with an introduction to Oriflame, the brand, and the launch of the February catalogue, which takes in a sensuous new fragrance for women called Freya. Modern and sophisticated, Freya is a subtle mix of natural freshness and vibrant femininity, named after the goddess of beauty and love.																																																				A direct-selling company, Oriflame also took the opportunity to felicitate its beauty consultants in Calcutta and treat them to special stage sequences  one based on the Giordani Gold range of cosmetics for sophisticated men and women and another titled Oriflames Fun for Kids. The event, organised by V-Extreme, was rounded off with a presentation on income opportunities offered by Oriflame and an address by Thomas Ekberg, the CEO of Oriflame India Pvt Ltd. And thats not all, all present took away special gifts from Oriflame as well, and were offered a chance to take part in a lucky draw which had exciting prizes up for grabs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 S.R. Banerjee								Vice-chairman, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners																																							An eight or nine-lane facility to collect tolls, as is done on Vidyasagar Setu, is undoubtedly the best option. But in the absence of the space or the infrastructure in the city, it is impossible to collect taxes on the spot. Different cities have come up with different solutions. In Mumbai, which is more congested, a tax is collected at the entry points to the city for maintenance of the 50-52 flyovers in the city. How many people know that a portion of the proceeds of the tickets that we buy at Howrah station goes for the maintenance of Howrah bridge? So the logic that vehicles that do not use the flyovers will not pay the annual tax does not hold ground.

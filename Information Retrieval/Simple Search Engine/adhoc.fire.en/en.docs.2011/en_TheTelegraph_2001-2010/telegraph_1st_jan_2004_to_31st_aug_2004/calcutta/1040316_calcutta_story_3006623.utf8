																								An exhibition of the recent works of Sekhar Roy reveals how the painter has matured from a melancholy romantic, to an artist who fuses romance with modernism, presenting a view of life that is emotionally intense yet refreshingly realistic. Combining intellect with imagination, and logic with the absurd, his present series of paintings firmly establishes his concern for a more engaging art that transcends an artists need to portray his own state of mind. The deliberate use of subdued pastel shades in conjunction with vibrant, earthy hues, has converted his palette into a riot of controlled colours, positively contributing to his quest for a post-modernist approach. In his paintings, the curious mixture of imaginative figures, set against glimpses of present-day reality, succeeds in showing that Roy has conquered an uncharted territory with effortless ease.																								When: An exhibition of recent works by Sekhar Roy																								When: Till April 3 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

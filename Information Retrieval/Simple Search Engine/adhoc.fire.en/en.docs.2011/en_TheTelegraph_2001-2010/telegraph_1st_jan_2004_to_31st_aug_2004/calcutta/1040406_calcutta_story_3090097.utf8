 A few specialities from the Taajas spread. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								My menu never stops growing, its become like a dictionary, laughs Bibi Sarkar, proprietor of the bistro-style multi-cuisine restaurant, Taajas.																								A flip through her thick menu and one immediately knows what she means. It has gained girth, becoming more voluminous since the last trip to the popular Ballygunge Circular Road restaurant.																								Now, Bibi is tempting previously untapped clientele with a brand new Indian section as well as additions to the World Cuisine spread. The self-styled creative eatery has redone its look as well. The 54-seater, split-level restaurant is constantly making innovations, especially with its international dishes, to suit the Indian palate better.																								Like the fast-moving paella. We dont serve this dish, which is basically a Spanish khichdi, in its original form. We make the rice lighter and more flaky and serve it with a spicy garlic sauce and green chillies as our customers prefer it this way, explains Bibi.																								She keeps coming up with original concoctions too, of which the Capsicano, she reveals, is one of the hottest draws at Taajas. Its basically a chilli, garlic-flavoured gravy with capsicum served on a bed of rice, is all Bibi is willing to offer of her trade secret.																								What she readily presents is an array of exotic dishes from around the globe. In the Indian section, she has steered clear of the hackneyed north Indian menu. Instead, she has tried to assimilate recipes from all four regions of the country. So while kebabs do make it onto the new menu, so do favourites like Dab Chingri, Bekti Paturi, Dhansak and Vindaloo. Bibi feels the Chettinad selection should go down well with diners.																								Calcuttans have always travelled a lot. Now, their exposure has made them very experimental with food. They are forever demanding new stuff, says Bibi.																								Taajas serves up a wide variety of cuisine, like Italian pasta and risotto, Mexican nachos, Greek Moussaka and Burmese Khau Swey. Exotic dishes from the east go beyond China. Vietnamese Com Chay (babycorn, vegetables, shitake and button mushrooms in a mild sauce served with rice), Ayam Bali (delicate peanut sauce from Indonesia), and Thai Kaeng (fiery Thai curry in red or green sauce served with steamed rice) are a few of the unusual offerings.

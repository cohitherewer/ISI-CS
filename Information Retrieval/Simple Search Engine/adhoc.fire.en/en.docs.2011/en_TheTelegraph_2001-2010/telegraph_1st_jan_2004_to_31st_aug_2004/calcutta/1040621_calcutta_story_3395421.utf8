The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 City host to neighbours pride pageant
 Models in Orissa drapes at the Swabhumi show. Picture by Rashbehari Das The Telegraph zeroed in on the Orissa festival, that started at Swabhumi on Saturday to coincide with rath yatra, as one of the hottest spots in town.																								Visitors thronged the heritage plaza on the rain-drenched evening, armed with coupons printed in The Telegraph for a 50 per cent cut in entry charges and 15 per cent discount on food at any of the venues eateries.																								Inaugural day kicked off with a glittering fashion show, organised by The Telegraph, where Sananda Tilottama 2004 winners and finalists and other city models walked the ramp in traditional Orissa weaves. 																								Bomkais and Odissi drapes provided by Benarasi Gharana in Gariahat, Mehers and designer Sujata Patnaik of India Ethnics from Bhubaneswar were presented in an array of silk and colours, adorned with patachitra and tribal motifs from the state.																								The second annual week-long festival, organised in association with Utkala, is aimed at promoting the cultural heritage of the neighbouring state, showcasing its unique textiles, handicrafts, music, dance forms and cuisine.																								Calcutta is the cultural hub of the east and we felt it was a good place to organise the event as the art forms of Orissa were not getting propagated. We had excellent response last year and plan to make an annual feature of it, said additional general director of police, R.K. Mohanty, one of the advisors of Utkala.																								Apart from colourful stalls hawking Odissi filigree, terracotta, dokra, stone, horn, appliqu and lacquer handicrafts, Sambalpuri saris and dress materials, the cultural extravaganza will see the Urban Court come alive with dance recitals and musical performances every evening.																								Late Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra will be posthumously conferred with the Utkala Samman, Aloka Kanungo and her troupe will perform a dance recital, Natya Chetana will present Oriya drama, and an evening of music are the highlights of the line-up.																								Providing a tangible taste of Orissa are prasad packets on sale at the ABP stall, the same that devotees receive at the Jagannath temple at Puri. Lord Jagannath is at the heart of Oriya culture. All art forms and cultural activities in the state revolve around him, said Prasanna Kumar Das, advisor, Utkala. 																								If you missed out on The Telegraph Hot Spot bonanza this weekend, make sure you queue up to catch a glimpse before it comes to a close on ulta rath on June 27. 																								You may just be in for a longer sojourn, too, if you are the lucky winner of the Hot Spot game that offers a special holiday package to the state.

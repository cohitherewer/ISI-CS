 																											- Salt Lake campus submits project proposal to boost central drive SANJAY MANDAL																								The consumer is king, but a large section is unaware of it. Concerned over this lack of awareness, the Bengal government is implementing schemes drawn up by the Centre, and West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (WBNUJS) is the first campus in the state to submit a project proposal.																								The campaign includes setting up of consumer information centres in districts and forming consumer clubs. Fifty schools in each district will form 50 such clubs, which will gradually include colleges, universities and research institutes.																								We have asked all the universities in the state to implement the Centres awareness drive. WBNUJS has already submitted its project proposal, said Santanu Chatterjee, joint secretary, consumer affairs department.																								The project to be undertaken by the Salt Lake campus comprises three parts  prepare a handbook on consumer-friendly laws, point out the flaws and propose rectifications, and impact the assessment of district fora and the state consumer dispute redressal commission to create awareness among consumers.																								We are trying to assess whether non-government organisations and voluntary consumer organisations are being able to play their roles properly and whether consumers are getting relief, said Souvik Chatterjee, WBNUJS faculty member and part of the project team.																								According to him, Units I and II of the Calcutta consumer dispute redressal commission are flooded with cases, while the one in Darjeeling is hardly approached by consumers.																								Figures reveal that till January 31, Unit I had heard around 25,000 cases and disposed of more than 24,000. In comparision, the Darjeeling forum heard 296 cases, of which 283 were disposed of.																								WBNUJS will also organise two consumer awareness festivals, one on its campus and the other at Bidhannagar Government College.																								Apart from the state initiative, a consumer awareness body is also holding a seminar on the changing face of the media in consumers cause. It is to be organised by Consumers Unity and Guidance Forum, in collaboration with the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture on Saturday. 																								State consumer affairs department officials said till January 2004, of 869 grievances received on its website, 306 were redressed. Most of the cases involve banking, insurance, postal services, electricity and telephones, said joint secretary Santanu Chatterjee.

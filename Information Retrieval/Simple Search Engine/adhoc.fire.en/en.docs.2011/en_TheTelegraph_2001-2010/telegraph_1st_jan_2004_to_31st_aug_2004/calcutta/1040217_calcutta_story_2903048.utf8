 Janab Y. Masihuddin  Tucy with some of the specialities from the Lashkari  food festival at the Eden Pavilion Pix by Rashbehari  Das															Nothing pampers the Indian palate quite like Mughlai food. And lovers of Mughlai food in the city are in for a major treat as ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers is hosting a Lashkari food festival, which offers foodies the opportunity to savour the best of this cuisine. Lashkari cuisine, which is a part of Mughlai cuisine, is prepared according to the recommendations of hakeems and is cooked in such a way that all the requirements of the body are met. It is aromatic and contrary to what most people think, not very spicy. Mughal emperors Akbar and Jahangir gave a fillip to the medieval Lashkari cuisine by adding items to it in accordance with the climatic conditions in India.																					The spread on offer at the Eden Pavilion includes such delicious items as Murgh Shikinja, Lehmi Pasanda, Tarmezi Korma and Tomato Murgh Ka Salan. Theres no need for vegetarians to feel left out either as for them, there are such dishes as Arbi Ka Korma, Paneer Tandoori Tikka, Mehlathi Dopiaza, Tarkari Biryani and Gulezar Biryani. Theres a choice of Mughlai soups as well, including Murgh Shorba and Lashkari Shorba as well as Yakhni Shorba for vegetarians. Finally, rounding off the meal on a sweet note are such delectable desserts as Quooba, Ursooa and Saviya Ka Muzafar.																					When the subject is royal cuisine, can royalty be far behind? At the Sonar Bangla, the Lashkari cuisine is being promoted under the guidance of Janab Y. Masihuddin Tucy, who is a great grandson of Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zaffer. Janab Tucy, a food consultant with the ITC group of hotels, who started the research work on his family cuisine, especially recommends Turani Biryani for the main course. 																					The Lashkari food festival will continue till February 22. The meal (lunch or dinner) comes at Rs 600 (plus taxes). For reservations, call 2345 4545 . Rina Mitra (extreme  right) looks on as beauticians from the newly-opened  Kabari attend to clients 												Come into my parlour																					When it comes to primping themselves silly, women can never seem to get enough, which probably explains the huge number of beauty parlours shooting up all over the place. The latest to join their ranks is Kabari, an off-shoot of the 43-year-old salon by the same name, located at 5, S.R. Das Road, barely a stones throw away from the original outlet owned by Ruby Palchowdhury.																					ming the new-look Kabari is Rina Mitra, a beautician who has been in the business for over 25 years now. And despite not having any formal training in the field, Rina has a wealth of experience under her belt, which she puts to good use in the new salon that offers a wide variety of treatments that one can indulge in. Apart from the usual hair-cuts and facials that make the most of products from Lotus, Shahnaz Husain, Biotique, Blossom Kochhar and more, Kabari also has plenty more in store. There are galvanic, gold, pearl and oxygen facials for that extra glow, vegetable peeling for treating those stubborn spots and scars, thermoherb facials to combat ageing and wrinkled skin and even treatments for dark circles and double chins. Hair problems are taken care of as well while rounding off the list of services are manicures, pedicures and make-up, both for parties as well as weddings.																					At Kabari, the hair-fall or dandruff treatment costs about Rs 150 per sitting, while facials are priced up to a maximum of Rs 500 for the gold variety. The aroma treatment is priced upwards of Rs 250 and the salon also specialises in bridal-make-up that costs anything between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500.

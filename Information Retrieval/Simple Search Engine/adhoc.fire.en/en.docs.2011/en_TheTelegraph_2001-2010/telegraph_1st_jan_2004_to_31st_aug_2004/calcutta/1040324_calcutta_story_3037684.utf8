 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Grievance cell for civic tax-payers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Failing to stop employees from harassing tax-payers, the civic authorities have decided to open a permanent grievance cell at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters after the Lok Sabha election. 																								The grievance cell will be set up as a part of the capacity-building programme in the CMC, being carried out under the aegis of the British Department for International Development (DFID), said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Tuesday. According to municipal commissioner Debashis Som, the CMC will get Rs 212.25 crore of technical and financial support from the DFID for capacity-building over the next six years.																								The grievance cell will work under the direct control of municipal commissioner Som. I hope it will ease interaction between the civic authorities and tax-payers and dispel the bad name that civic employees have earned for themselves over the decades, said Mukherjee.																								There is in the civic body at least one employee per five property tax-payers. This, the mayor said, explained the corruption and harassment in the CMC. There are more than 43,000 employees on the monthly payroll of the CMC and the wages work out to Rs 320 crore. 																								According to officer on special duty (OSD) to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh, the grievance cell will entertain specific complaints from tax-payers and return feedback by post.																								In case of a serious charge of corruption, a complainant may be asked to appear for a hearing before the municipal commissioner or an officer in the commissioners office.																								A senior officer in the civic vigilance wing said at least 30 cases are received by his department every year and of them, more than 20 are found valid. Most complaints are against employees of the assessment, building and licence departments. 																								Corruption and extortion take place in the CMC every minute of a week day but hardly 0.01 per cent is reported. Hence, the number of cases investigated has been just the tip of the iceberg, the officer said. 																								He explained that the brand of cigarette smoked by employees of an organisation could be used to gauge the level of corruption in the institution. In the CMC, the cigarettes that do the rounds are on the expensive side.

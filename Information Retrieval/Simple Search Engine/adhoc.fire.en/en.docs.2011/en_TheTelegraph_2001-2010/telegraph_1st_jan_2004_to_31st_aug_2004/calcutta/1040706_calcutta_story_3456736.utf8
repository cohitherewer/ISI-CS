 Tuesday, July 06, 2004 				 Retribution of an innocent
																								Women have always held an unenviable position in our society. Oppressed throughout their lives by their menfolk, they have silently endured the abuses and insults meted out to them. What is ironical about their plight is that they have even been made victims of discrimination by their own husbands. Swabaks play, Shasti, based on Rabindranath Tagores short story by the same name, attempts to highlight this grievous injustice and to make us aware of the hypocrisies and double standards that men live by in order to justify their callous attitude to women. The play tells us the tragic story of Chandara, a young bride who is made to bear the guilt of another mans crime in order to save him from the gallows. Directed by Nilima Chakraborty, this play is particularly poignant in the way it first conveys Chandaras utter shock and later her defiant acceptance of death as a more welcome alternative when she learns that her husband thinks nothing of having her convicted so long as his own brother is saved.

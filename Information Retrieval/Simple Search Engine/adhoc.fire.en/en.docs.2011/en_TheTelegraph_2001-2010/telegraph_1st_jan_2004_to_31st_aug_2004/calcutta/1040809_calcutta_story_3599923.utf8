The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Crime bane of urban sweep
				 	 Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Sukhen Chakrabarti, Binoy Mukherjee, Tanima Dutta, Bacchu Roy, M. Ganguly, Soma Choudhury, Prasenjit Guin and Sujit Banerjee				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Prasenjit Guin: Crime is on the rise in the area, especially connected with realty. Many illegal buildings are coming up in violation of the law. 																																																			We know some promoters are carrying out illegal constructions. The building plan that we sanction is not always strictly followed. But we are short of hands to keep a tab on all builders. We offer completion certificates only after inspecting a building. If a building does not grossly violate the original plan, we grant it a certificate. But if we get information  even over phone  that some illegal construction is taking place anywhere in the municipal area, we take immediate action. Anyone can call me over the phone, even at my residence, to report any violation of building rules. As for the criminal activities, I can only say that this is the curse of urbanisation. Initially, the area was looked after by panchayats and some areas are yet to be developed. As more and more buildings come up, rivalry will mount and it is only the police who can stop such criminal activities.																																																									

M. Ganguly: Rickshaws and vehicles are parked on roads, making it difficult for commuters. 																																																			I understand the problem but we are not in a position to restrict the number of rickshaws by giving them a licence, as is done in some municipal areas. But we are trying to check these slow-moving vehicles. Recently, we held a meeting with senior police officers to discuss how to go about it. Also, we have decided to remove encroachments along Baguiatis main road, Kestopur and the areas adjacent to Bagjola canal. We find encroachment has assumed serious proportions in wards 13 and 9. We will evict all illegal settlers.																																																									

Binoy Mukherjee: As it is, roads inside the blocks are not spacious. Some builders block whatever space is available by dumping building material on it.																																																			The problem is more of social than of administrative relevance. We have inspected several areas of the municipality and admit the seriousness of the problem. We will soon introduce some checks on these suppliers . We plan to charge a fee for the number of hours they keep the material on the road or to restrict their loading and unloading only in late hours. Once our councillors are distributed their portfolios and the new civic board is formed, we will finalise the most effective method to tackle this problem.																																																									

Soma Choudhury: Tell us about the tax to be imposed by the Central Valuation Board (CVB).																																																			The CVB has completed its survey. Once the portfolio of the chairman-in-council is decided for our municipalitys revenue department, we will set up a standing committee to fix the rates and notify the tax-payers. Please keep in touch with us or your local councillor. In case of any grievance, you may come to us but in any case, we cannot minimise the amount by 25 per cent of the new amount imposed by CVB. I think we will be able to realise tax by the new rate within three to four months.																																																									

Sukhen Chakrabarti: The streetlights need immediate attention.																																																			I know. We do not have any full-fledged department to look after electrical affairs. Neither do we have any electrical engineer to supervise the job. Sometimes, we are forced to requisition local youth to repair our streetlights.																																																									

M. Ganguly: Ward committees are filled by people with political links. We commoners are ignored.																																																			Actually, any political party that controls a public body wants to execute its plans and ideas. But still, a few apolitical persons with proven skills are always inducted into the panels. We are set to form ward committees soon. Anybody keen to join them may contact the local councillor or even me for nomination.

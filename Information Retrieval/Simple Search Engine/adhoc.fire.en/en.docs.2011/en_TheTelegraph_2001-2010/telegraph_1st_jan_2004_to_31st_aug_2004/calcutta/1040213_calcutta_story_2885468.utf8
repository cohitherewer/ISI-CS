 															- Personal billboard, giant card platforms for public display of Valentine spirit A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Actresses Priya Karfa (left) and Antara Biswas post their messages on a Valentines Day card. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Friday the 13th holds out little fright, so save all the screams for Saturday the 14th.																								Aishwarya Rai gets ready to slip into the lead role in a simple love story by Rituparno Ghosh in Tollygunge; Adnan Sami belts out romantic hits like Kabhi to nazar milao and Aao na at Salt Lake stadium; young lovers scrawl their mush messages on the Astor Hotel walls; giant billboards play public host to private matters of the heart... If youre in love, its time to shout out loud, to come on and let it show.																								For, thats whats scripted in the stars, points out astrologer Kusum Bhandari. While Friday the 13th has no scare value on the Indian calendar, Saturday marks the beginning of the month and the season of love. February 14 is also the first day of Phalgun, heralding spring and Holi, the festival of colours, and is the right time to put on those rose-tinted glasses and say I love you, insists Bhandari.																								For those with love on the cards, theres the 50 ft wide and 10 ft high one designed by artist Arindam Sengupta at Astor, on which messages can be penned till midnight on Valentines Day. The Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records authorities have been approached, says hotel general manager Deepak Palta, unofficially touting this as the worlds largest Valentines Day card.																								But if you have Rs 500 in your pocket and are looking for a higher trajectory with Cupids arrow, then sign up for the Selvel offer to post a love letter or note on one of its 17 billboards in the city.  Weve even had people calling  in for messages to patch up quarrels, says Nandini Dharwarkar  of Selvel. If the mobile is your medium,  then love SMS on Airtel can win dinner coupons, chocolates  and CDs. An astrologer service is available to check the  compatibility of couples on the Love Barometer.  Romance is ruling the airwaves  as well, with FM the firm favourite. We already have over  8,000 letters, 782 e-mails and lots of Valentine calls and  SMS from even Bangladesh and the US, reveals Jimmy Tangree  of Red FM. While there are plenty of shops  and hangouts in town with special events lined up for February  14, unusual is the theme at Coffee Pai, the Camac Street  caf, with a band of 11 and 12-year-olds, Martian Eclipse,  to serenade couples with love songs, including live requests.  At MusicWorld, 10,000 rare songs and old hits have been  compiled in 1,000 albums for music-lovers. The big do of the day, however,  is Adnan Samis heart to heart concert at the Salt Lake  stadium, amidst a show of blazing lights, laser beams, a  sprinkling of stars on stage and a dance troupe from Bollywood. For the young at heart, size does  matter this V-Day.

																																																		Classes in all the departments of Jadavpur University are likely to be affected on Friday and Saturday as the Jadavpur University Teachers Association, (JUTA) has decided to observe ceasework. The teachers will not attend duties protesting the state governments decision to grant enhanced dearness allowance (DA) to the varsity teachers from January 2004, instead of from July 2003. JUTA general secretary Chittaranjan Mondal said the government had increased the DA for state government employees from 41 to 45 per cent in July 2003. According to him, the same was also promised to all university teachers and employees from the same date. But the government has sent a letter to the varsity authorities last week saying that university teachers would be paid enhanced DA with effect from January 2004. However, examinations will not be affected as they have been kept out of the purview of the ceasework.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Rule flout powers mall raid
 																											- Packed items seized for retail act violations, shop fined amp; warned  SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The charge: The supermarket at City Centre has flouted the Packaged Commodities Act, taking both the consumers and government for a ride.																								The penalty: A cash fine of Rs 5,000 and a declaration to abide by the rules in future and rectify the mistakes.																								The hugely-popular C-3 in the just-opened Salt Lake mall has come under the scanner of the consumer affairs department, with raids being conducted last Friday and again on Tuesday.																								Several packaged commodities, including some imported items, were seized. Consumer affairs department officials said they feared there were some fakes among the packaged rice, dal, sugar, mosquito repellent, fruit juice, chocolate, perfume and cheese seized.																								Some packets were not sealed, others did not contain the packers names or the packaging and expiry dates. Some did not have the maximum retail price printed on them. Some seized goods were without necessary import documents and numbers, said Ashok Bhattacharya, controller of legal metrology.																								All this points to gross violation of the packaged commodity rules that prompted us to seize the items and issue notices to the departmental store concerned, he added.																								Pabitra Deb, manager of C-3, said: We were not fully aware of the rules. We are not responsible for the packaging of items and generally procure them from different companies. As for the imported goods, it is for the importers to observe the rules. But from now, we will try and plug the loopholes, 																								Expressing concern at the gross violation of retail rules, consumer affairs minister Naren De has directed legal metrology department officials to convene a meeting and discuss the matter with representatives of all major departmental stores in the city.																								Under the Packaged Commodities Act, names and addresses of the packers, packaging and expiry dates, net content, maximum retail price (MRP), the batch and packaging licence numbers must be printed prominently on every sealed packet.																								We sent a team of inspectors to the departmental store concerned on the basis of complaints lodged by some consumers and found them to be true. We have already served a notice for payment of a cash fine and cautioned them, explained Bhattacharya.																								Consumer affairs department officials said a close watch would be kept on all departmental stores and leaflets would be distributed among consumers at malls to make them aware of the rules.

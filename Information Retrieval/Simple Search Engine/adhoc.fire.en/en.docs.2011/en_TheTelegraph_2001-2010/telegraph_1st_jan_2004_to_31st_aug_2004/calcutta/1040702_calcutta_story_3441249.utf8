The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 02, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The ever-increasing prices of diesel cause bus fares to soar. And commuters keep suffering. Buses being the cheapest mode of transport, commuters cannot help but use them. But passengers also want some comfort. Roofs of many private buses leak during the monsoon. Seats have very little legspace between rows. What is worst is the tendency of buses to break down in the middle of the journey during peak hours, much to the inconvenience of office-goers. Why cant we have pleasant bus rides like in other cities such as Mumbai and Bangalore?

	Walls of educational institutions are covered with graffiti and posters of various students unions. For the all-round development of youngsters, a neat and clean environment is a must. The government should take steps to stop such defacing of college walls. This will go a long way in improving the education imbibed by students.

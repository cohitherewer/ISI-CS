The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Better ways to be safe than sorry
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Forum: Equipped to fight the flames																								How does one alert the local police station at the discreet press of a button during an armed break-in or put in place a foolproof burglar-alarm device? How to monitor heat-and-smoke detectors to ensure they dont choke and falter at the crucial juncture?																								Daylight robberies and murders, burglaries, abductions, personal threats by anti-socials/terrorists, extensive loss due to fire-related accidents and a host of other safety and security concerns creasing Calcuttans foreheads everyday will come into focus next Friday.																								A unique seminar, Suraksha 2004  trends and technologies, organised by the International Institute of Security amp; Safety Management (IISSM) in association with Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India)-Bengal aims to provide valuable critical inputs in areas of vulnerability.																								The security ambience in Calcutta is extremely sensitive during this crucial rebuilding phase and the seminar couldnt have come at a more appropriate time, observes D.C. Nath, ex-special director, IB and a founder-member of IISSM. The institute is a non-profit educational society devoted towards promoting professionalism among security and loss-prevention practitioners.																								Nath will share the interactive podium with leading lights in education and practical management of security and fire-safety issues. Among the speakers are Sujit Sarkar, director-general, fire services, West Bengal, H.K. Singh, chief of security amp; safety, Sahara Amby Valley, P.N. Rao, ex-chief of security amp; safety, State Bank of India, Sudhir Gauriar, chief of security, CB Richard Ellis South Asia, besides senior police officials.																								Fire services chief Sarkar feels while the old buildings, with a maze of wiring and tenants, remain the most vulnerable, the new highrises pose a different challenge. No ladder can go up as high as 35 floors. So it is absolutely crucial to have concealed sprinklers all through. Fortunately, most of the new constructions, including commercial developments like Inox in Forum, are installing sophisticated fire-fighting devices. But its equally important to ensure proper maintenance for them to remain effective over a long period, he says.																								The Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) West Bengal chapter has prepared a structured presentation for the seminar, marking out the specific areas needing built-in security in new constructions. We hope solutions will come from the experts. But, the government should also lay down security norms and make them mandatory, says Pradip Kumar Chopra, honorary secretary, Credai-Bengal.																								Chopra stresses everyone who owns some property and responsibility could benefit from the conclave, especially those who build and finance projects  the real estate developers, bankers and financial institutions.																								Among the security and fire-safety topics to be discussed are fundamentals and challenges, changing face of threat perception and solutions, protection, detection and communication, suppression and control and retail security and fire-safety. New equipment and systems  their role and range will also be showcased.

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Bank robbers star in cop rogues gallery
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Unable to track down a single culprit involved in the bank dacoities over the past few months, its time for the sleuths to seek information from citizens, instead of relying solely on their own sources. And for this, the city police have drawn up an identity kit, with the photographs and whereabouts of wanted bank dacoits. The dossier has been placed on the cop website.																								With the arrest of 16 gangsters in two weeks, police claimed they had solved the string of dacoities in the Burrabazar-Posta-Jorasanko belt in the past two months. When asked about the bank robberies, the sleuths were silent.																								A span of six months from July last year saw a string of bank robberies. The looting of Rs 85 lakh from Central Banks Watgunge branch on December 14 last year is still considered one of the biggest bank hauls of late. Five gangsters toting revolvers and choppers walked into the first-floor bank and took out the money from a strongroom. They melted into the crowd with the gunny bags containing the cash. Last July, armed dacoits struck at Punjab National Banks Gariahat branch and walked away with Rs 6 lakh. Two months later, a trunk containing Rs 13 lakh went missing from the cashiers room of the same banks Bhowanipore branch.																								After every bank robbery, police arrange a meeting with the bank officials and advise them to instal gadgets to strengthen the security system. But as far as tracking down the culprits is concerned, the outcome is a blank.																								We know the culprits were from the neighbouring state of Jharkhand. We went there several times, but non-cooperation by the local police prevented any arrests. And it is impossible for us to conduct a raid without informing our counterparts, said an official of the detective departments dacoity wing.																								The total failure led the sleuths to put up an updated list of their wanted men on their website. Fresh faces, like those of Sanjay Prasad Singh, Tanqueer Khan and Dablu Singh, find a place in the gallery, too.

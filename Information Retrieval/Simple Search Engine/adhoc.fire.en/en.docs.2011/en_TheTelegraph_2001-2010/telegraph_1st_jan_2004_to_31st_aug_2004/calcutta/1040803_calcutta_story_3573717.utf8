 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Ethics thrust in IT sector
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the information technology (IT) industry in West Bengal all set to hit a higher growth trajectory and fuel the states development, the Centre for Social Markets (CSM) is drawing up plans to help it adopt the principles of responsible entrepreneurship, ethics and accountability. 																								The non-profit organisation, through its offices in the UK and India, is working on issues of corporate citizenship, sustainable development and human rights. 																								We believe that markets are social institutions and should work for not just profits, but also include people and planet. Thats why we are trying to promote the triple bottom-line concept and raise the awareness of Indian companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR), explained Randiv Mehra, adviser, CSM. 																								The IT industry  already being recognised as the bellwether sector  is selected as a sample for its potential to perform, added Mehra.																								The NGO has a host of sister outfits, including Institute of Directors, NRA Certification, World Environment Foundation and Centre for Corporate Governance. 																								According to Mehra, CSM  with support from various multilateral funding agencies in the US and Europe and global bodies like the United Nations  will increase its focus on West Bengals IT industry and work towards aligning social development with economic growth. 																								At its recent conference in the city, organised in association with the IT department of the state government, eminent speakers were lined up by it to speak on a gamut of issues involving CSR. 																								The topics ranged from describing the linkages between the new economy and sustainable development in West Bengal to sharing of experiences in other states and industry-government partnership in promoting high standards in the information, communication and technology (ICT) sector to presenting international case studies. 																								The response has been very satisfying and companies like Oracle have got in touch with us, expressing interest in working jointly, added Mehra, an expert in quality certification and author of Getting to Transformation, a book on e-business. 																								As part of its look-Bengal objective, the NGO  set up by Malini, sister of Mehra, around three years ago  is also installing a West Bengal forum to thrash out issues, organise regular workshops and bring put publications, conduct qualitative and quantitative research and implement various programmes. 																								Mehra is happy that the government is keen to take part in the exercise. 																								Besides, we are getting some interesting assignments from the UK, which we will be delivering from our Calcutta outfit as the talent pool here is abundant and the cost of manpower is low, explained Mehra.

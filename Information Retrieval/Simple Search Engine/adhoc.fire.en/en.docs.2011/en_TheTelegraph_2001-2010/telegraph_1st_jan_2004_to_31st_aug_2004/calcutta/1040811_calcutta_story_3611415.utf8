 Rani
	Big projects and Rani Mukherjee go hand in hand these days. Even as she balances the critical acclaim of her battered wife role in Mani Rathnams Yuva and the mass approval for her glam avatar in Kunal Kohlis candyfloss flick Hum Tum (you can still catch two shows of the film at INOX, Forum, at 4.45 pm and 7.25 pm), she is already on to bigger things. In fact, she has as many as five mega projects in her pretty kitty. 
	First up is, of course, Sanjay Leela Bhansalis ambitious venture post-Devdas titled Black which has Rani playing a desi Helen Keller with the Big B as her teacher. The Bengali star  who often manages to breeze through town, hush hush, to catch up on family matters  also gets to share screen space with the Abhishek Bachchan (after Bas Itna Sa Khwab Hai, Yuva and Hum Tum) in Shaad Alis second directorial venture, Bunty Aur Babli. 
	Then theres Ketan Mehta directing Rani in his mammoth project The Rising opposite her Ghulam (Aamir Khan). Thats not all  Ravi Baghban Chopra has cast Rani as the Big Bs daughter-in-law in his next film titled Babul. And to top it all, she plays the female lead in Yash Chopras yet-unnamed film.
	 For the plain  and plump  Jane who started off playing sister to Indrani Halder in an obscure Tollywood flick named Biyer Phool, all one can say is that she has really raced ahead of the rest and, whats more, shows no signs of pausing for a pit stop!  Rachel Weisz: Fountain head
	Stepping into shoes not in use is the mantra in Hollywood. And thats what actress Rachel Weisz (last seen on the big screen in the film adaptation of John Grishams Runaway Jury) has done by slipping into the situations vacant female lead slot in director Darren Aronofskys dream project The Fountain, which was reportedly first offered to Cate Blanchett.
	 Even the male lead drifted down from Brad Pitt to Hugh Jackman, but the project in danger of being shelved has suddenly come alive as hot property in Hollywood. Based on a script by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, the story centres on a mans life in the present as well as his travels 500 years into the past and future. The first shooting schedule for The Fountain, a science fiction epic in a post-Matrix vein by the maker of Requiem For A Dream is ready to roll some time in November. 
	Rachel, meanwhile, has another potential winner in her bag  the Keanu Reeves-starrer Constantine, scheduled to hit the halls in early 2005. Rachel plays a female police detective named Angela who helps Keanu investigate the suicide-like death of her twin sister and strike deals with representatives from heaven and hell! 
	 While both The Fountain and Constantine will take time to hit theatres near you, you can feast on a whole lot of Rachel in her big breakthrough film The Mummy. Directed by Stephen Sommers and co-starring Brendan Fraser and Dwayne The Rock Johnson, the film will be shown on Star Movies on Thursday at 9 pm.  Jishu Sengupta: Inching on
	The first of the five films slated to roll out of the strategic alliance forged in May between Jhamu Lagaan Sugandh and Tollywoods leading man Prosenjit is set to hit the floors. 
	At Rs 1 crore, Janmadata could be right up there with big-spending masala films made on the east coast. Yet another project from the Swapan Saha stable, it also flaunts the longest line-up of actors roped in for a film of this genre in Bengal. With Jishu Sengupta and Rachana Banerjee as the lead pair, the cast includes Ranjit Mullick, Shankar Chakraborty, Rajesh Sharma, Dolon Roy, Kanchan Mullick, Shubhasish Mukherjee and Anamika Saha.
	 It will be a big challenge to hold ones own among so many established actors. Unlike the traditional housewife-type roles I have been doing of late, this film will see me as a modern girl, very vibrant and jovial, says Rachana Banerjee, who will play the granddaughter of Ranjit Mullick. 
	Shooting for the Saha family drama  but with more glitz  starts the morning after I-Day. 
	Guess who was the most sought after in the Premadasa stands during the Asia Cup finals in Colombo? ESPN anchors like Mini Mathur or Gautam Bhimani shooting spots or star commentator Wasim Akram out on a brief round? None of the above  it was the beer boys. 
	The Calcuttan accustomed to not carrying even a harmless bottle of precious H2O to Eden Gardens will gape in amazement to hear that beer in the stands is cool in Colombo. And dont worry if youre not carrying it, there are people in plenty to serve it up.
	 Beer companies with a reputation deploy uniformed personnel with a cloth bag on their shoulders that has a pipe attached to it (resembling the good ol bhisti). On request (and payment) they fill your cup with the much-desired drink.
	 On paper, theyre supposed to do the rounds of the stadium and people are supposed to ask (politely) for a thirst quencher. But in real time, it was quite different at the Premadasa on the day of the finals. 
	The beer boys were literally peppered with paper pellets, caught hold of and dragged to a particular enclosure (some never to return till the sack was empty) and what have you. And we must admit that a section of the Indian fans did anything but fight shy of the frothy fun. Why? A large cup of beer cost 50 Sri Lankan rupees or Rs 25 only! Next stop for the beer brigade, Eden Gardens? High hopes! 
	Survive on a deserted island, woo a millionaire and be his wife or chase a prize around the world. What will reality shows come up with next? A role in a Hollywood movie for the winner, for starters.
	 But first, participants must survive explosions, dodge bullets and display on-screen chemistry with co-actors.
	 A brainchild of Matrix producer Joel Silver, Next Action Star made its Indian debut on AXN last Tuesday. Participants from around the US try to outdo each other for cash prizes and a role in the NBC movie Hit Me (working title).
	 Over 10 one-hour episodes, the participants are given star treatment, including a stay at a Hollwood mansion and coaching by the experts in the industry. The climax is a particular scene that makes or breaks it for the participant. In the first episode, 30 were selected from 7,500 hopefuls across the US and flown to Hollywood for an audition. On AXN, every Tuesday at 9 pm.

The vegetables, grown with bio-fertilisers in Hooghly and North 24-Parganas, have found a market in the UK and the first contingent of ladys finger, brinjal and capsicum will be airlifted to London shortly, state food processing department officials said. 																								UK-based Ansib Limited is slated to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Agri-Horticulture Corporation in the office of Sailen Sarkar, minister in charge of the food processing department, on Friday. The corporation sent a trial consignment of vegetables and cut flowers to England last month and the response has been satisfactory. Ansib, which has its office at Mount Drive, Middlesex, is headed by director S. Ganguly, who is here for inking the MoU. He is related to skipper Sourav Ganguly, and Souravs father, Chandi Ganguly, will be present when the deal is signed. 																								Sudhangshu Sil, chairman of the Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samity, said on Thursday that the firm has decided to take the responsibility of marketing the flowers and vegetables from West Bengal in the UK. Initially, it will import flowers and vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh every week for a year. It will also market mangoes and litchis from the state in England during summer, Sil said.																								The vegetables will be collected from special farms in the Tarakeshwar-Arambag belt of Hooghly district, and Habra, Gaighata and other areas of North 24-Parganas, said deputy manager of the corporation Subrata Bose. No chemical fertilisers or pesticides will be used to grow these vegetables, he added.																								The corporation, already exporting cut flowers to several countries, is also planning to explore the UK market, where there is a high demand for the produce. The cut flowers to be exported include jarbera from Madhyamgram, tuberoses from Rajarhat and gladioli and cockscomb from Panskura. The corporation exports cut flowers worth Rs 6 lakh to the Netherlands, Singapore and Sharjah every week. Besides, a firm in Malaysia had placed an order for 500 tonnes of kufri jyoti potatoes at Rs 9 a kg. We are expecting more such orders this year, added corporation deputy manager Bose.																								Meanwhile, on a central government prod, the state has already created five agri-export zones in different districts. The zones are Malda-Cooch Behar for pineapple, North 24-Parganas for vegetables, Malda for mango, Murshidabad for litchis and Hooghly for potato and other vegetables.

 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Stray-check model gets global pat
 SUBHRO SAHA																								At a time when animal welfare organisations around the world have trained their guns on the Greek capital for poisoning stray dogs to present a squeaky-clean image at the Olympics, Calcuttas trap/neuter/return (TNR) programme to control its street-dog population has got an overseas pat on the back.																								Animal People of the US, among the most respected animal welfare publications in the world, has lauded the efforts of city-based NGO Compassionate Crusaders Trust (CCT), which runs the TNR programme in town in tandem with the civic body.																								Decrying the killing streets of Athens and a pre-poll campaign encouraging demagogues in some cities like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Kochi to blame street dogs for disease and filth, Merritt Clifton, editor of the magazine, has referred to the CCT initiative as a model worth emulating. The programme is carried out with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.																								Cliftons editorial quoted CCT founder Debasis Chakrabarti explaining the basic tenets of the city scheme. We impress upon all our people that the calls of municipal councillors, other government departments, hospitals and housing estates, and other public places must get priority. Then we remove sick and injured dogs from the roads, wherever our people see them. A concentrated effort makes the roads free of badly-diseased dogs. This silences many of our critics, since the remaining dogs do not look like a public health threat, Chakrabarti stressed.																								He said the NGOs volunteers are tutored to soothe people who become indignant when dog-lovers refuse to understand their fear or dislike of dogs threatening their children or soiling the common areas in a residential complex. 																								Most often, people grow adamant due to a personal grudge against a neighbour, who refuses to admit that their grievance has some validity, Chakrabarti observed.																								With some understanding and pampering, they begin to agree that they have no wish to harm an animal, but it is just this one dog which is a habitual nuisance. Then our people offer to sterilise and return the rest, removing just this one villain, and they usually agree, he adds. 																								Animal People felt the Calcutta approach is equally applicable to side-stepping potential conflicts over cat TNR.																								Images of poison-contorted canine corpses from the streets of Athens have triggered a maelstrom of protest from the outraged sports fraternity and the world media.

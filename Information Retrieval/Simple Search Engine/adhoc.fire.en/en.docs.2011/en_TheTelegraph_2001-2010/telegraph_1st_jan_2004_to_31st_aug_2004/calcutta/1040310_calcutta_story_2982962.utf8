 A STAFF REPORTER																								At least 10 persons were injured, and several dozens had a lucky escape on Tuesday morning, when an overcrowded private bus on route 24A crashed into the guard wall of the Brabourne Road flyover. The bus brakes had failed.																								Had the railing and the guard wall not held, the bus would have plunged down to the road about 40 feet below.																								The accident is alike a mishap barely a month ago, in which a man was killed and six people were injured after a state bus rammed into several cars. The brakes of that bus, too, had failed. 																								Police said at about 9.30 am, the bus (WBS 2798) was on its way into the city from Howrah. On the flyover, the bus, packed with office-goers, veered out of control after the driver slammed the brakes. It swerved to the left and smashed into the railing.																								By the time the vehicle came to a halt, passengers were screaming in panic. Then there was a rush to get off, leading to a near-stampede. The driver fled in the confusion. 																								Policemen on Brabourne Road rushed to help the passengers. Reinforcements were sought from Burrabazar police station to shift the injured to hospital. They were, however, released after first-aid. About half an hour later, the bus was towed away to the local police station.																								I was standing at the rear. There was a traffic jam on the flyover and the bus was caught in it. Passengers were asking the driver to speed up as many of them were getting late for work, recounted Debal Mitra, an LIC employee. 																								When the bus was almost halfway on the flyover, it veered sharply to the left and hit the railing, Mitra added. Initially, we thought the bus had hit another vehicle. Then we realised the enormity of the accident.																								Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Piyush Pandey said a major accident had been averted. The vehicle had been moving slowly and there were no pedestrians on the flyover. The police and public vehicles department will conduct separate inquiries to ascertain the mechanical faults in the bus.																								President of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates Sadhan Das said the vehicle-owner is a member of the council. Though the bus is old, it is mechanically sound. What can the driver do if the brakes fail? he asked.																								Transport department officials, however, said brake failures could be minimised if the buses are maintained regularly.

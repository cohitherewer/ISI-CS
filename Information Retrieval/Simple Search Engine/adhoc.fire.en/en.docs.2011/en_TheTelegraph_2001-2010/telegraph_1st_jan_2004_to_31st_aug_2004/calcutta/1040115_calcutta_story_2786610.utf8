 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Bullets pumped into Bangla fugitive
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Bangladeshi living in hiding at Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city, was shot dead from point-blank range on Tuesday night by unidentified assailants.																								Pratul Biswas had fled Bangladesh and taken up a rented apartment in the Netaji Pally area of Barasat, where he would eke out a living as a private tutor. 																								His wife, Minati, and five-year-old daughter lived with him for the past two years, but he was in regular touch with his family across the border.																								On Tuesday morning, after Pratul, 45, left to tutor a student, four youths arrived at his two-room apartment on the ground floor of a multi-storeyed building. Is Sir at home? I have come to ask him whether he will teach my younger sister. I have heard he is a good tutor, one of the youths asked Pratuls wife.																								Minati told them her husband would not be home till late in the afternoon and went back to her chores. The youths returned, but Pratul was still away. Minati informed them that Pratul was held up elsewhere and would return around 11 pm. 																								At 11.30 pm, the four were back. Pratul came out and introduced himself. In a flash of the eye, one of the youths pulled out a revolver, while the others pinned Pratul back. Four bullets were pumped into him. As Pratul fell in a heap, the youths fled.																								Minati rushed out of the house and raised an alarm. Neighbours called in the police, and a team, led by Bhuban Mondol, sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Barasat arrived.																								 Preliminary investigations revealed that Pratuls enemies in Bangladesh had carried out the murder. The police recovered a letter, written by Pratuls father, warning him of possible attempts to kill him. A voters identity card issued in his name in Bengal was also recovered from his house. 																								It is clear that a group or some individuals from Bangladesh had carried out the killing here. We will have to find out why, SDPO Mondol added.																								What is puzzling sleuths, though, is that if the killers were genuine Bangladeshis, then why had they not recognised Pratul? He may have been living here under a fictitious name, Mondol concluded. 																								Minati, however, insisted that Pratul had not changed his name after coming to Bengal. Police will now contact their counterparts in Bangladesh to find out Pratuls political affiliations, if any. We are checking whether he was a victim of any political vendetta, Mondol added.

 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Weaving themes for Puja dreams 
 Michael BoseMichael BoseIf kasba today is the theme Puja capital of south-east Calcutta, credit has to go to its clutch of theme-makers for wresting the crown. While the big names hail from neighbouring Picnic Garden, Michael Bose, who debuted with as many as three pujas in the area last autumn, is a son of the soil. 																								Michaels work found appreciation with his creations picking up five prizes and he is busy giving shape to surprises for the coming puja. He also runs the most popular art school in the locality. Who thought I would ever see this day? says the bespectacled artist. When Michaels father passed away, he was barely seven, with a brother two years younger to him. My mother was at sea. The three of us often went with a single meal a day, he recalls. To make ends meet, the eight-year-old would peddle newspapers. That was how I paid for my tuition fees at school. After three years, Michaels mother found a job as a school teacher, with a princely salary of Rs 165 a month. It was a start, he muses.																								Michael was a busy sketcher from the age of 4. I would draw on the floor with slate pencils. That skill, honed by free tuitions from drawing sirs Dilip Banerjee and Sushanto Dutta, came to use when he started earning by painting signboards for Gariahat market shops as a teenager. At 16, he was allowed to participate in an exhibition. One of my pictures sold for Rs 6,000, the amazement still apparent in his 36-year-old voice. This gave birth to a dream  of becoming an artist.																								The next few years saw Michael moving from art college door to academy classrooms, picking up diplomas and certificates. Wherever he heard of a fair, he would take his paintings along. Some days, I brought back Rs 500-600, on other days nothing sold. 																								In 1986, Michael opened his own school. In a month, I had 150 enrolments. People of the area loved me so much that the name spread by word of mouth. 																								Tulika Art School now has about 650 students, hailing from the posh Ballygunge to the suburban Canning. There are about 80 students whom I teach free of cost. Most of them come from such backgrounds that I even have to buy them colours and drawing books. But such is their talent and enthusiasm that it is a joy to teach them. They remind me of my own childhood.																								As for his involvement with the Pujas, Michael feels that this gives him a platform to raise awareness about issues close to his heart. The pressure of education, terrorism and violence in daily life... I have created pandals on such themes last year. Whats in store this year? Michael isnt speaking.

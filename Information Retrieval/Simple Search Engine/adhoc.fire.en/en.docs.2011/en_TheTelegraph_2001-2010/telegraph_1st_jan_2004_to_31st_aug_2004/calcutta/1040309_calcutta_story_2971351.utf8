The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Procedure check for Parkinsons
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 76-year-old Calcuttan had been running from doctor to doctor in search of a proper diagnosis for his neurological disorder. On a trip to the US, he was detected with Parkinsons disease. 																								The expert referred him back to Jaslok Hospital, in Mumbai, to one of the few experts who could perform a procedure to ease his agony.																								Parkinsons is a disease that cant be detected till its symptoms set in, with no lab test to catch it. It leaves an able mind struggling inside a disabled body for largely unknown causes. 																								In India, Jaslok Hospital has operated on the largest number of patients in India, at over 130. A handful from Calcutta have also been treated there.																								Neurosurgeon Paresh Doshi, heading the functional neurosurgery wing at the Mumbai centre, was the doctor the elderly Calcuttan was asked to see. An expert in treatment of epilepsy, chronic pain and spasticity, Doshi was in town last weekend to attend an epilepsy conference and to see a few patients.																								Parkinsons is caused by the degeneration of cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain, resulting in a reduction in the amount of Dopamine produced, explained Doshi. 																								The disease affects millions in India, and is usually detected in those in the 50s and 60s. Medical advances over the past couple of decades have helped. 																								The drug Levodopa was developed in the 1960s, which controlled the symptoms very well. But in the 80s, it was discovered that after five to seven years of use, it caused side-effects, Doshi added.																								That is when procedures like deep brain stimulation can be used to control symptoms. Electrodes are implanted in the brain to control abnormal activity affecting motor functions. 																								In some patients, areas of the brain are selectively destroyed to restore the chemical balance, said Doshi, who has trained extensively in Europe to master this minimally invasive procedure, conducted on a conscious patient.																								With risk of complications as low as two per cent, promising a chance of a normal life expectancy, the surgery is only limited by financial resources  as costs can run up to Rs 5,00,000  and whether a patient seeks help at the right time. 																								The surgery is of no use if the patient no longer responds to medication, stresses the doctor, as drug treatment continues after the procedure.

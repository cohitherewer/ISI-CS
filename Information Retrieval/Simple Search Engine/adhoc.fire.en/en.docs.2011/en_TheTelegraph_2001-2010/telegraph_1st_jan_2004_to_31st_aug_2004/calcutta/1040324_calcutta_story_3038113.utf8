The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Makeshift shops have sprouted wherever there is a little open space on the roadsides. A large number of people prefer to buy from these vendors, too, who come from the suburbs with fresh vegetables and fruits and sell them at prices lower than the market rates. But is there any guarantee that the weights and balances they use are not faulty? The civic authorities should earmark areas where the vendors can open shop. The sellers must also dispose of the litter properly.

	The stretch from Chowringhee to the Gandhi statue on Mayo Road has no security cover after sunset. Though streetlights are on, petty thieves hang around in the area to steal scrap iron and other materials dumped on the road for the flyover construction. They have, in the past, also robbed pedestrians. Police patrol should keep vigil, as the only outpost on Mayo Road remains shut for most of the time. 
	Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street.

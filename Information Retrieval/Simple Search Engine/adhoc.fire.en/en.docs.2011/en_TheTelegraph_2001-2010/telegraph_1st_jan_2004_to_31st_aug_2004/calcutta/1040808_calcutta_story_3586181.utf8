The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 Its all in the stars, okay?
AdLibBollywood has always lived by its own marketing norms, with the hero or heroine as the selling pointSHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY(Top) Preity and Hrithik in Koi... Mil Gaya, (above) Shah Rukh promotes Main Hoon Na: Name gameThis is a true story. A cousin had just returned from England, joined a multinational and got married. After the din of the marriage had settled down, he took his wife to watch a Hindi movie in a hall near his house. This was a weekend 9 pm show and the movie was a recent release. No balcony seats were available. They settled for the rear stall but their row was not so rear.The initial period was uneventful. Then the scene featuring the super hit song started. The front stall erupted  whistles, claps, cat calls and then a few stood on their seats and started dancing. The best dancer amongst them was also closest to the couple. The man was their domestic help  who ostensibly had gone to Cossipore to meet his ailing aunt. Our back from Britain man never again accepted a non-balcony seat. He was deeply embarrassed by the classlessness of Hindi movies.The market for Hindi films has always been huge and unsegmented in our country. The temptation has always been to create that one magic thing that appeals to all sections of the society in all parts of the country. What is interesting is that over the decades of its existence, the Hindi film industry has followed its own marketing practices. It has survived and prospered with its own norms, however unusual they may seem.Take the issue of branding. Conversation between friends on the Metro: A new movie is coming to INOX (silence). It is a BK Films production (yawn). Anand- Milind has done the music (ok). D. Saxena is the director (God bless him). Preity Zinta is the heroine (really?!) Hrithik is the hero (hey, when do they start advance bookings?)Stars are the brands, because they possibly carry the promise most strongly from a forthcoming movie to its prospective audience. Yet, the companies or individuals that produce a movie do not own these brands. These are available on hire.Suppose a movie fails to entertain as most Hindi movies do. The interesting question is who pays for the broken promise? The person who made the movie or the person who promised on his behalf? To the audience this is not even a debate  to him Main Hoon Na is a Shah Rukh Khan release rather than a Farah Khan movie, Hum Tum is a Saif movie rather than an Aditya Chopra production.The promise was from Shah Rukh or Saif, Rani or Preity. It is the same brand that has to get hurt. Yet, stars usually do not make the movie. They have very little control over the way a movie shapes up. The stars are paid astronomical prices. They deserve it. The moot point is whether they deserve it for their skills or for their courage?

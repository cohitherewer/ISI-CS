The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, February 02, 2004 				 Allied, to nail the knaves
 Supratim Sarkar				 	 Supratim Sarkar, additional superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph at his office in Barrackpore to reply to their queries. Participants included Samir Bhattacharjee, Shyamsunder Dey, Papri Banerjee, Arindam Chatterjee, Abhisekh Gupta and Abhirup Chanda				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Samir Bhattacharjee: Petty crime, like eveteasing and snatching, is on the rise on the railway platforms of Barrackpore, Sodepur and Titagarh.																																																			The government railway police and railway protection force look after the platforms. But the criminals are from pockets that fall under the jurisdiction of local police stations. So, we cannot shrug off responsibility. We have been ordered to maintain a liaison with our railway counterparts. We maintain a regular coordination with them to check such petty crime. 																																																									

Samir Bhattacharjee: Officials of some police stations in Barrackpore are reluctant to record complaints relating to landlord-tenant problems. It needs a strong recommendation from a local heavyweight or politician to get a complaint lodged.																																																			This is a very old allegation against the police, particularly in the colony areas. More than 30 complaints pour into each police station of the area every day. So, we try and solve the dispute between the parties to avoid further complications. This is often taken as police reluctance to register complaints. Sometimes, it so happens that the complainant cannot express himself or herself properly and takes the help of local leaders to come to us. We advise them to move the civil court rather than take recourse to a police case. 																																																									

Abhirup Chanda: Ghola and Titagarh police often turn down commoners pleas to register a complaint.																																																			As far as rules go, police cannot refuse to take a complaint from any individual. But sometimes, sporadic instances may occur to the contrary. To keep a check on that, superior officers not below the rank of sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) make surprise visits to the police stations and check the records of pending cases. Recently, we found some cases pending and sought an explanation from the thana official concerned. If anybody faces any problem in lodging a complaint, he can call me anonymously at 2592-0022 and inform me. The problem will be looked into.																																																									

Abhisekh Gupta: Traffic arrangements at Dunlop have been reshuffled but the stretch between Bonhooghly and Dakshineswar remains a nightmare.																																																			I am aware of the traffic snarl on BT Road. It is caused mainly by the trucks parked on the PWD road between Bally bridge and Dunlop. As the trucks do not have to pay any toll tax on this road and their movement through Howrah bridge is restricted, they prefer to park here. The trucks will have to be shifted. However, I have instructed the traffic inspector of Dunlop to station himself at the crossing during rush hour and supervise things. Now, you will find our officers at the crossing every day between 8 am and noon and again from 4 pm to 9 pm.																																																									

Shyamsunder Dey: Wetlands are being indiscriminately filled up in Khardah. In some cases, the municipality itself is the offender. The police turn a blind eye to such things.																																																			Strictly speaking, these violations are to be looked into by officials of the land revenue department. But one can lodge a complaint with the local police station and we are bound to inquire into the case. If there is any violation of law, we will take action against the offender. 																																																									

Samir Bhattacharjee: Traffic at Chandanpukur bazaar, near Barrackpore railway station, comes to a standstill during rush hour.																																																			We have noticed the problem in some other pockets, too, like Chiriamore, Barrackpore station and at Gate no. 15. We have petitioned the police superintendent for a few more traffic guards in these areas. We are also thinking of installing electronic signals to control the traffic in these pockets.

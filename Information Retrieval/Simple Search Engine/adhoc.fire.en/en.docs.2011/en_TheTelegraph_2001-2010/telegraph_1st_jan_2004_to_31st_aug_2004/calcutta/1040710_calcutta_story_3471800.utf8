 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 The art of dancing
Bharata Natyam is one of the oldest and most respected dance forms in India. And just like every other art form it has undergone its share of modifications that are essential for the continuation and fruition of art. EZCC had earlier hosted the Nritta Nattuvangam workshop, which was designed on the works of T.S Kadhirvellu Pillai and was based on his system of tala training and the unusual technique of cross-tempi rhythm. Suddha Nritta is a dance presentation on the unique style of cross-rhythm choreography by Prakriti Bhaskar, one of the most talented disciples to have trained under Pillai, and participants of the four-day long workshop. Bhaskar combines in her pursuit of the art a rare blend of an elegant performer, meticulous teacher, innovative choreographer and flawless nattuvanar. She promises to brighten up the monsoon evening with an enthralling performance.																								Event: Bharata Natyam by Prakriti Bhaskar																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, Salt Lake

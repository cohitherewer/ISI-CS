 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Dhaka fog downs flights in Calcutta
 OUR BUREAU																								A flurry of international flights descended on Calcutta airport on Thursday, but by default. As Dhaka displaced Delhi as the fog capital, the city tarmac was forced to cope with the fallout.																								It was an action-packed morning, as six Dhaka-bound international flights, including one empty craft, touched down at Calcutta. The cause: the dense fog enveloping the Bangladesh capital and preventing flights from landing there.																								Three Bangladesh Biman flights, one British Airways and another Gulf Air flight were diverted to Calcutta. All were headed for Dhaka from various international destinations, but were grounded at Calcutta by the time the clock struck 10 am.																								At one point, the international flights were landing at three-minute intervals, reminding us of the golden days of Calcutta airport, when it was one of the busiest in the country, said an Airports Authority of India (AAI) official.																								The AAI authorities had a tough time coping with the unexpected passenger crush. Over 700 passengers had to be accommodated, said an AAI official.																								The three Biman flights managed to leave for Dhaka in the afternoon, but the British Airways flight, with over 222 passengers, initially scheduled to take off at 1.30 am, was left stranded as the fog over Dhaka intensified in the evening. Late on Thursday, the London-Dhaka flight was pushed back to 8 am on Friday. The Gulf Air flight, too, could not take off.																								If fog over Dhaka played the devil for air passengers, those travelling by train to and from Delhi were slowed down horribly by the poor visibility on the north Indian tracks. The Rajdhani Express, to both Howrah and Sealdah, led a long list of leading trains fouled by the fog (see box). Eastern Railway officials blamed dense fog at Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana and northern UP for the delay.

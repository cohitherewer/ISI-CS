 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Trucks in twin highway mishaps kill 7
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Seven people were killed and 15 seriously injured in two road accidents in Howrah on Monday afternoon. 																								In the first case, a truck collided with a dumper on National Highway 6 at Malanchaberia. In the other, a speeding truck rammed into a tea-stall at Kanchanberia, barely a kilometre from the first mishap spot.Two bystanders were killed. 																								Witnesses said the first truck was carrying sand from Howrah to Kolaghat and the dumper was returning from Uluberia to Calcutta. The truck in the second mishap was carrying grapes from Uluberia.																								Disclosing details of the highway collision, additional superintendent of police (rural) H.K. Kusumakar said the truck was travelling at a speed of more than 80 kph when the driver lost control of the vehicle.																								The dumper belonged to a multinational company engaged in the central governments road project on the highway. It was carrying 25 labourers when the truck rammed into it. 																								Police said the victims in this mishap comprise the two drivers and three labourers returning after night shift.																								The injured were shifted to Uluberia state general hospital in a critical condition.																								Inquiries revealed that work on extending and renovating the highway is at its peak. As a result, vehicles bound for Calcutta and those moving towards interior Howrah move along the same lane, posing an accident risk.																								Local residents complained of regular traffic snarls on the stretch and reckless driving. I remember that last year, officer-in-charge of Liluah traffic guard Rupak Chakraborty was killed in a road accident here, recalled Bibhas Hazra.																								Police officers said they had taken enough measures by posting traffic constables on the particular stretch of road but they could not check the mishaps. They said till the road was ready, the risk of accidents could not be ruled out.																								Since September last year, there has been a spate of mishaps on the spot. Residents pinned the blame squarely on the officers on duty in the Bally and Dhulagarh Traffic Guard outposts. They claimed the police sit tight in the offices and emerge only to collect money from the truck-drivers.																								The asking rate, according to sources, is Rs 100 for an overloaded truck. Trucks carrying goods within their capacity have to shell out Rs 50. Mini-lorries and Matadors pay between Rs 30 and Rs 50 for crossing the road between Bally and Dhulagarh.

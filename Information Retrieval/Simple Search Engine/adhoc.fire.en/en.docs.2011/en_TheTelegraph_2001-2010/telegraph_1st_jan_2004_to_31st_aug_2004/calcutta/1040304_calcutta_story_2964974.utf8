 																											- Police father-in-law shielded man from arrest for torture, assault OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A son, who had driven out his parents from their Thakurpukur house, was given a dose of his own medicine by the judiciary. 																								The man had dared to throw out his parents because his father-in-law is a police officer. Earlier, the parents had lodged a complaint with the local police station, but only in vain. The father then moved Calcutta High Court, which asked Thakurpukur police to evict the son and allow the parents to return home.																								The high court order on Wednesday directed Thakurpukur police to make all arrangements to throw out Shankar Chowdhury, along with wife Ujjala, from the premises and immediately reinstate Paritosh Chowdhury and his family. 																								The court order followed a petition filed by 69-year-old Paritosh, who alleged that younger son Shankar had driven him and his family out of his house and Thakurpukur police did not take any action because Shankars father-in-law is a senior officer of the Special Branch.																								Paritosh, in his petition, told Justice Barin Ghosh that he used to live in the building, jointly owned by him and his two sons and daughters-in-law. In early 2003, Shankar demanded that his father give him legal ownership of the first floor. Both Paritosh and elder son Shibu were against the proposal. 																								That prompted Shankar and his wife to torture Paritosh, his wife Niharbala, a cancer patient, along with Shibu and his wife Lopamudra. In May last year, Shankar had allegedly beaten up his elders in front of his policeman father-in law.																								This forced my wife, elder son and daughter-in-law to leave the house and rent a flat. I moved Thakurpukur police but no step was taken by them. I could not leave the place because it was my property. Last November, my son beat me up and I had to be admitted to Vidyasagar Hospital, in Behala. Again, I informed police, but they threatened to arrest me if I did not withdraw the case against my son, Paritosh said.																								Finally, Paritosh told the judge, he had to leave the house. His elder son, who is a lower division clerk at Police Hospital, then wrote to the city police commissioner, who immediately directed Thakurpukur police to take action against Shankar. But police did nothing and he had to appeal to Calcutta High Court.

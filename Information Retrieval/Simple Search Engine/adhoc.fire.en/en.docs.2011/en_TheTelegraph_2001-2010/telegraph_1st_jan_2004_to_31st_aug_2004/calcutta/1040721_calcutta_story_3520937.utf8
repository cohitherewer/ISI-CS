 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 				 Widow cry for justice
 OUR BUREAU 																								Kanika Pal, widow of murdered doctor Sushil Pal, pleaded for justice on Tuesday from the highest authority in the state administration  chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Kanika had sought an appointment with Bhattacharjee nearly a week ago. She met him in his chamber on Tuesday afternoon, and pleaded that her husbands killers be brought to book. 																								Director-general of state police Shyamal Dutta was present when Kanika called on Bhattacharjee. 																								The chief minister has reportedly assured the gynaecologists widow that the case is being handled with utmost care and some of the senior-most officials of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) are working on it. 																								Kanikas sister Monika Bhadra and cousin Snehashish Mondol accompanied her to Writers Buildings, along with representatives of West Bengal Association of Health Service Doctors. 																								The widow reportedly told Bhattacharjee that she wanted justice and people to know who killed my husband. 																								Pals body was retrieved from a canal bank at Sankrail, in Howrah, on July 3. After serving for 16 years in a Jalpaiguri hospital, Pal had joined Walsh Hospital in Serampore three months ago. 																								The 45-year-old doctor had left his in-laws residence on Bright Street, in south Calcutta, the day before as usual for the hospital, but had not attended office. 																								When he did not return late into the night, Kanika lodged a missing diary at Karaya police station and then at Serampore. Pals elder brother Nihar Ranjan had alleged that his brother had been murdered. 																								On Tuesday, Bhattacharjee assured Kanika and the group of doctors that the cops on the case would be able to crack the mystery. The chief minister also inquired if she was facing any other problem. 																								To this, a tearful Kanika reportedly replied that her peace of mind would return only after her husbands murderers were punished.

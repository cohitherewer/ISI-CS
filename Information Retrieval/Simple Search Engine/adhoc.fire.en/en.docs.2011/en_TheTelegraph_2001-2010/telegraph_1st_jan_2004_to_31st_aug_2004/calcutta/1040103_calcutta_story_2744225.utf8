The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 City Lights
				 If its tinsel, it has takers METRO Money-spinners: (From top) Charlies Angles  2: Beautiful people; Koi... Mil Gaya: Bollywoods  hi to sci-fi; On the sets of Abar Aranye; Finding  Nemo: cartoons cool  Its no surprise, nor is it new   Bollywood in India is the cinema supremo, and Hollywood  only has a small market share. The likes of Charlies  Angels 2 and Pirates of the Caribbean cant really  compete with Kal Ho Naa Ho and Koi Mil Gaya,  particularly since Bollywood was back with a bang last year,  striking the box office  in India and beyond  with not  one or two, but several hits.				 																																																											And Calcutta was no exception. At INOX  that clearly emerged as the movie-going address in town  adding a twist to the local-over-foreign tale, the footfall for Bengali films was as consistently high as 90 per cent. Not only did a few big Bollywood stars touch down in Tollywood, but  even better  they brought in the audiences and the revenues. Abar Aranye and Chokher Bali (still playing) ran the big budgets close, and Bombaiyer Bombetey has the makings of a winner.				 																																																											For Hindi films, the citys first multiplex recorded over 85 per cent takers, topped off by a 91 per cent demand for Kal Ho Naa Ho and LOC Kargil. For Hollywood, the four-in-one Elgin Road counters clocked 60 per cent-plus  less than expected, but slightly up from 2002.				 																																																											It was healthy pickings all round for the film industry. Shah Rukh Khan to Amitabh Bachchan, Priety Zinta to Hema Malini, the Hindi film industry re-invented itself and called in the multiplex crowds in 2003. Baghban, Bhoot, Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon, Chalte Chalte, Gangajal, Pinjar  the names just kept rolling off the tongue and setting the cash registers ringing.				 																																																											Hollywood, however, did manage to hold its own, even increasing its market share to a little over five per cent. According to industry officials, the average figure for 2003 was Rs 1.8 billion, over Rs 1.3 billion in 2002.				 																																																											And its action that sells hotter here than all else. Case in slam-bang point  Welcome to the Jungle, starring The Rock, bombing at the box-office in the US but raking in the rupees in India, according to Columbia Tristar and INOX. The vernacular dubbed versions, including Hindi and Tamil, were the most welcome.				 																																																											Fox or Paramount, Columbia or Warner, a cursory look at the movies that mustered the maximum money shows action-packed thrill rides, with plenty of adventure to keep the adrenaline pumping, zooming to the top. Spiderman, Bad Boys 2, Terminator 3, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Jackie Chans Shanghai Knights, X-Men 2, Daredevil, Tomb Raider (the second Lara Croft film) and, of course, the two Matrix sequels, were some of the hits of 2003. While Matrix Revolutions fared better than Matrix Reloaded, the two combined were the top grossers for Warner Bros.				 																																																											Another genre doing well is comedy, for kids and adults, with the makers of the Jim Carrey-starrer Bruce Almighty and Finding Nemo laughing all the way to the bank. Even Jungle Book 2 was a bestseller  proof that kiddie flicks are favourites, at least in this part of the world.				 																																																											A sneak peek at a few new entrants this year makes for exciting viewing  the Tom Cruise-starrer The Last Samurai, the final offering in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and, finally, the third in the Harry Potter series. 				 																																																											The period: January 9 to 13				 																																																											The venue: Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) campus, on the EM Bypass				 																																																											The screenings: 2 pm to 4 pm and 5 pm to 8 pm, daily				 																																																											The open-house forums: 4 pm to 5 pm, from January 10 to 13				 																																																											The entry permit: delegate cards to be collected from SRFTI				 																																																											Following up on the success of the first edition of Clapstick last year comes this edition, involving about 20 film schools from home and abroad, with about 100 films being shown, including 40 international ones. Theres even a Young Filmmakers Forum, with a special focus on schoolchildren. There is a package of films made by high school students of Atlanta, USA, and a film by the youngsters of Birla High School and St Thomas School, in Calcutta.				 																																																											One of the highlights of the festival is an open-house forum on the relevance of film schools in the present-day film industry. Also lined up are the Subroto Mitra Memorial Lecture, felicitation of veteran film-maker Nabendu Ghosh and online video-conferencing with internationally-acclaimed film-makers and technicians. Walter Murch, double-Oscar-winning sound designer, will also feature in the online audience interaction.		 Sitar maestro Ustad Shahid Parvez and  Hindustani classical vocalist Rupali Dalal of the Kirana  gharana enthralled audiences at Kala Mandir on  the first day of the new year. The two paid tribute  to Parvezs late father, Ustad Aziz Khan.

Notable performers in this years festival are Bala Kondala Rao (Kuchipudi), Puspita Mishra (Odissi), Malabika Sen (Bharatanatyam), Preeti Patel (Manipuri), Aloka Kanungo (Odissi), Debjani Majumder (Bharatanatyam), Chandreyee Basu Thakur (Mohiniattam), Judhajit Roy (Hindustani classical vocal), Siddharta Bhose (sarod) Besides, the students from various city branches of Kalamandalam will present group choreography throughout the festival.				 																																																											The dance festival was started at its present venue in January 1996, according to Kalamandalam secretary Somnath G. Kutty. Today, we are all the more aware of our rich classical heritage as it is acknowledged the world over. Love for classical dances has also grown by leaps and bounds, especially in this part of the country, where fine arts are looked upon with respect, leading to a steady rise in the number of trainees and practitioners, observes Guru Thankamani Kutty, vice-president of the centre.				 																																																											For the past four decades, Kalamandalam has been spreading the nuances of Bharatanatyam, Mohiniattam, Kuchipudi and Kathakali, first throughout the country and then across the world, says president Guru Govindan Kutty. Pupils and alumni of the centre have collected scholarships and appreciation in Europe, the US, West Asia and Southeast Asia, he adds.				 																																																											The school presents performances, workshops, training and short courses to visiting students, besides dance ballets in Sanskrit, Tagore dance-dramas and other contemporary subjects. The artistes of this region are very competent at the national level and beyond, but there is a severe lack of opportunity for them, since the few prominent festivals characteristically have to invite internationally-acclaimed exponents, and struggle to accommodate local artistes, laments Somnath Kutty.				 																																																											The government has given the centre the plot of land at Golf Gardens to construct a performing arts complex, complete with a library, audio-visual workshop, a studio, a students hostel, an auditorium, etc. The plot now has a stage with a classroom where a rural ambience has been created and classes, workshops and programmes are held.

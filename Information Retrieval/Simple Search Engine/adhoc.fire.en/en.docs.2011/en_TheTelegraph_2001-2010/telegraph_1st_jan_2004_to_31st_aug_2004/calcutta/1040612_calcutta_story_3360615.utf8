 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Sergeant reaps the kudos
 																											- Morale-booster for force as top cops car fined for rule flout A STAFF REPORTER																								Luck may have smiled on traffic sergeant Partha Chatterjee but he could as easily have been made to pay for sticking to the rulebook, as did his colleague Rajat Krishan. 																								Unlike Krishan, who was shunted out one-and-a-half-years ago after stopping minister Asok Bhattacharyas red-light car and forcing him to walk more than 50 yards to the Eden Gardens club-house gate, Chatterjee, on Friday, was congratulated by both his departmental boss and the city detective chief, whose car he fined on Thursday evening.																								I appreciate his move. A policeman should be like him, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department). The law will take its own course against the violator, whoever he is, he added																								Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic) was proud of his officer. I appreciate his work. As far as a policemans duty is concerned, his decision was right, Basu said.																								Chatterjee, sergeant of the south traffic guard who is known in his circle as a strict law-enforcer, spotted a white Ambassador parked on Outram Road on Thursday evening. The entire stretch of the road  diagonally opposite the Indian Museum leading to the Gandhi statue  is a no-parking zone.																								Chatterjee found two men sitting inside. When he asked them why the car was parked in a no-parking zone, the driver promptly replied: This car belongs to your department. (The vehicle had no red light and the word Police was not written on it.) 																								Without losing his nerve, Chatterjee asked: Does it make any difference? The driver was asked to produce the papers of the vehicle. The offender got out and told the sergeant: Do you know this is the car of the deputy commissioner (detective department)?																								So what? No car can be parked in a no-parking zone, even if it is a police vehicle. You have violated traffic rules and you will have to pay for it, said Chatterjee. He seized all the papers and issued a compound slip against the vehicle. A case of parking vehicle in a no-parking zone (fine Rs 100) was slapped on the offender.																								An official complaint was later forwarded to Pandey from the south traffic guard office in the Maidan area. On hearing about the incident, Pandey released the driver from duty, saying further action will be initiated according to the law.																								Chatterjee told his superiors that as a police officer, he would always try and perform his duties to the best of his ability. His colleagues congratulated him in private for the good work.																								There was a sigh of relief in the force, whose morale would have been battered had he been taken to task. Chatterjee has a record for never sparing anybodys errant vehicle  be it a high court advocate or a top cop.

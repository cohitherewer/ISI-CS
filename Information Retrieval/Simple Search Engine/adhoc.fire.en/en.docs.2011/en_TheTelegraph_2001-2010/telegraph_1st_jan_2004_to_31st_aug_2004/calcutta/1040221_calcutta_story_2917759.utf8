 Saturday, February 21, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Sabitri Chatterjee, actress. You are kind and generous, and make an excellent parent. You are cheerful and fond of travelling. Though a little belated, fame and reputation are yours. You have a strong sense of self-respect. Your colours are purple, yellow and green.  Kusum Bhandari

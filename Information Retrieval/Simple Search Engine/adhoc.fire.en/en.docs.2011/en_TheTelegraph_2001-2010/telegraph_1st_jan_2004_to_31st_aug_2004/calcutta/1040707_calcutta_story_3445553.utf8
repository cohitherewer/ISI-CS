 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Intrusion by cadre on plot
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A six-acre plot of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) in Ultadanga, earmarked for a commercial complex, is being taken over by musclemen of the CPM. They have extended a part of their party office into the complex.																								The party office was not on our land. They have made an illegal construction on it now, said a senior CMDA official on Monday. We plan to demolish it soon, he added. Sources said the demolition was planned last week but deferred because of infrastructural problems.																								The land now houses the CMDAs work-cum-living centre. It has 384 flats in 16 buildings. The buildings, which came up in the 1970s, were initially planned to rehabilitate families evicted during the construction of the Sealdah flyover. Later, there was a decision shift and CMDA employees were quartered there.																								The CMDA now plans to set up a 10-storeyed commercial complex on the plot as part of its drive to generate revenue for a turnaround. 																								The Rs 2.5-crore project was scheduled to start last year but problems cropped up after some occupants refused to vacate the flats in spite of an eviction notice from the authorities. 																								A number of occupants have moved out, but there are some who refuse to, the official said. Adding to the problem is the CPM party office, a brick-walled construction with a tiled roof.																								CMDA sources said the local party has been asked a number of times to demolish the structure. We hold cultural activities there, a local CPM leader said. If the CMDA decides to demolish it, it is their affair, he added.

 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Mothers cry against 11 rogue cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Digging up graves in her quest for justice, Sunila Majumdar has sent to chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy and state chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee the names of 11 policemen, including six officers, with a plea that they be barred from election duty. 																								The policemen had been indicted by the state human rights commission for gross violations after the mysterious disappearance of Sunilas son, Partha, alias Bapi, seven years ago.																								Partha was shot in the leg on September 5, 1997, in a police raid and subsequently admitted to a Habra hospital. He was transferred to Barasat as his condition deteriorated, under the false name of Lakshman Giri. Partha was last seen four days after he was arrested. 																								As a wife of a freedom fighter and a senior citizen, I appreciate the steps taken by the election commission against certain police officers of dubious repute. In this context, I have appealed to the chief election commissioner of India and state chief electoral officer to take similar steps to bring to book the culprits responsible for the unexplained disappearance of my son, Sunila said in her statement.																								On September 5, 1997, a police team, led by Sunil Kumar Haldar, then sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) of Barasat (currently additional superintendent of police, Durgapur) had engaged a gang led by criminal Suresh Barui in a shoot-out. Partha was arrested from the spot with a bullet injury in his leg. 																								When his family realised on September 9 that Partha was no longer in police custody, a case was started against Haldar at Habra police station. The case was registered on August 13, 2000. Partha had been allegedly admitted in both hospitals in the guise of one Laxman Giri, a male aged 32, under the care of SDPO, Barasat. Giri was released on September 6, after one Biman Chatterjee, working in the SDPOs office, signed his release bond. 																								Parthas brother Deepankar had seen him in a police jeep in Churghat village, where raids were being conducted by Pranab Dutta, former officer-in-charge of Habra police station, and Basudeb Bag, then additional superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.																								When Deepankar asked the officers about his brother, they denied having arrested any one by the name Partha Majumdar, and identified the man in the jeep as Laxman Giri. 																								Deepankar then filed a writ with a division bench of Calcutta High Court, seeking an order to direct the deputy superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, to produce all related papers for disposal of the case. The court, however, passed an order directing the state human rights commission to probe the matter. 																								Since then, mother Sunila and brother Deepankar have embarked on a legal battle and knocked on the doors of several government officials but failed to nail the 11 accused policemen.

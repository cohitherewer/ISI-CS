 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Cops have no time to keep kids off crime
 PRONAB MONDAL																								A month ago, 50 police officers were directed at a three-day training programme at the Lalbazar headquarters to be kind to streetchildren and juvenile delinquents.																								A month has passed, yet not a single police officer has spoken to one child belonging to the streets. 																								The training programme, initiated jointly by the National Institute of Social Defence and the detective department, was focused on training officers to counsel juvenile delinquents and help them get back to the mainstream. The trained officers were described as juvenile welfare officers.																								The programme was a mere eyewash. We have not been able to talk to a single child so far. Not because of our neglect, but because of our daily duty schedule, said an officer who attended the programme. When we are free, it is midnight. And, then, it is more important for us to get back home.																								The city police wanted to get closer to these children after realising that they were getting involved with the citys underworld. Some pockets in the city have become breeding grounds for criminals. These children will grow up to be future criminals, pointed out an officer at Lalbazar.																								Children are the eyes and ears of criminals. Whenever we raid an area, the criminals we are looking for get to know about our arrival from children of the locality. No one suspects them. They act as the informers of gangsters, said a trained officer.																								The officers were told during the training session that if necessary, they would have to buy toys and sweets to become friendly with young people. 																								We were asked to build up a strong network among the children so that they can inform us about the criminals whereabouts, instead of working for them, another officer said, adding: The idea is great. But for us, its implementation is next to impossible.																								Asked about her contacts with juvenile delinquents, a woman sub-inspector promptly replied: After the completion of our daily duty, its difficult to find time for our own children. Where is the time to spare for streetchildren?																								During the course of investigation, police found children involved in a number of burglaries and thefts. Last year, there were at least 30 cases in which juvenile delinquents were involved.																								Criminals engage children so that they can wriggle easily into a shop or flat through a small outlet. These criminals even teach the juveniles how to pick up valuables without leaving any clues behind, said an official of Jorasanko police station.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 Sea shells for a happy home
Feng Shui
Pinky KapoorQ: We recently went to Puri and collected lots of shells from the beach. Can you please suggest Feng Shui-friendly ways in which we can make use of these to decorate the house?Sakshi BanerjeeThe Solution: Shells belong to the earth element and can be placed in the south-west, north-east, west and north-west of the house. You can create a cosy love corner in the south-west of your bedroom by placing two shells filled with semi-precious rubies. Light two pink candles near these every evening to enhance the effect. The north-east can have a cluster of eight shells with red or yellow decorative items. The west can have seven shells along with some soft toys in the childrens corner. The Chinese believe that this arrangement may help childless couples to conceive. Place six shells in the north-west corner along with silver or Chinese coins or other regular coins in each one of them to attract blessings from heaven. They can also be placed in the wealth corner (south-east) as they come from water. Water in Feng Shui is akin to wealth. Placing four of these filled with pearls will help to increase your fortune. Ensure that you clean them thoroughly with salt and water before placing them.Q:I am a 17-year-old girl born on 2.02.87. I share my room with my sister (DOB 06.06.85). Our room lies in the eastern part of our house and I keep my books in the north side of the room. It is painted light green. Soon, I will start studying law. I would also like to give tuitions. What are my favourable number, direction and colour? How can I succeed in studies, tuitions and personal relationships? Divya DamaniThe Solution: You belong to the west group, but eastern rooms are in general productive for growing teenagers. Face north-east while studying and teaching. Your favourable number is 2 and it reveals north-east, west, north-west and south-west as your auspicious directions. You are a weak water person. Eastern rooms take blue very well. Therefore, bring blue colour lavishly in the room in the form of accessories like bed sheets, bedspreads, curtains and rugs etc. A small blue night light when left switched on throughout the night will help you to absorb and strengthen your self-water element.				 	 According to Feng Shui, one can create a love corner in the south-west of the bedroom by placing two shells with semi-precious rubies here. Seven shells, placed along with soft toys in the west, can bring luck to childless couples. Q:Presently we are staying in a small flat near Kalighat and are planning to buy the flat opposite ours. That flat has three sides open (east, south and west) and has an extended south-eastern side. The main door faces the window on the opposite side and the kitchen door is opposite the platform, which according to Feng Shui is not good. What should we do? Also, if the temple is placed in the north-east corner, which direction should it face? My son is in class XI. Which direction should he face while studying? His DOB is 01.06.87. Sumitra MehtaThe Solution: There is no problem in buying a flat that has a projection in the south-east, as it attracts wealth and fortune. The main door that faces the window can always be remedied by keeping the curtains drawn or by placing a potted plant or hanging a crystal or a chime from the window to slow down the chi or by simply closing it. The stove can be moved away from opposite the kitchen door but care should be taken that you face east while cooking. The temple should be in the north-east corner on the eastern wall facing west. Your sons kua number is 4 and accordingly north is his most favourable direction for studying. Q:I was born on December 14, 1980 at 8.35 am in Calcutta. I have appeared for the Civil Service Exams on May 16 this year. I would like to know whether the career I have chosen for myself will bring success. I have always had a lot of obstacles in even the smallest of jobs. I would like to know ways in which I can boost my career and make my relationship corner strong. Manju NatarajanThe Solution: Your kua number is 4 and a special warning is that any important decision in your life should not be made by yourself. You must always seek guidance from your parents or partner. You are an extremely strong-headed person and will have to make an extra effort to make relations work, whether they are with the family or your spouse. Display family photographs in the east and couples photos in the south-west to strengthen family and marriage relations respectively. You have chosen the right career and will definitely succeed. Face north or east while studying and ease out excessive metal in your body with water and wood elements. Keep a bowl of water with petals floating in it on the east or north of the study table to help boost your career.

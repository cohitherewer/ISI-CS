The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Industry steps forward to clean up air
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The states industrial sector has finally decided to extend a helping hand to clear the mess it has created over the years.																								The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is now all set to start its environment management division (EMD) in Calcutta, under the supervision of the EMD headquarters in Delhi. 																								The unit will liaise with manufacturers and the law-enforcers to contain the rising pollution levels. More EMDs are on the cards across the country. 																								The EMD here will provide consultation to industries on environment-related issues, said Sudhir K. Tyagi, chairman of CIIs eastern region environment sub-committee, on Thursday. Now, industrial units need not consult our Delhi wing on pollution-related matters. We have experts right here, he added.																								The state government welcomed the move. The CII has informed us about the move, which is expected to address environmental issues, state environment minister Manab Mukherjee affirmed. 																								He added that the government, in collaboration with the Indian Chamber of Commerce, is already running a Cleaner Productivity Unit to address pollution problems faced by manufacturers.																								According to Tyagi, the EMD will provide consultancy mainly to small and medium-scale industries on how to expand without flouting pollution norms. Most of these industries do not have the resources to comply with the changing environmental norms. They require proper guidance, he said. 																								CII officials said although vehicular air and noise pollution are issues in Calcutta, pollution caused by foundry, chemical and plastic-manufacturing units are also primary concerns. 																								They felt the situation would become unmanageable if industries do not contribute in finding a solution to the problems.																								West Bengal Pollution Control Board officials said that the list of high pollution units include dying and bleaching units, tanneries, chrome-manufacturing units, foundries, rolling mills, secondary lead smelting, rubber manufacturing and ceramic units located in the city and districts like Howrah, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas. 																								The CII held a workshop in the city on Thursday on environmental management systems and related legislation in India. 																								The demographic pressure on Calcutta is one of the highest among all cities in the country, A CII official said. 																								Calcutta has to shoulder the pressure of 14 neighbouring states. Bhutan and parts of Nepal and Bangladesh add to the burden, he pointed out.

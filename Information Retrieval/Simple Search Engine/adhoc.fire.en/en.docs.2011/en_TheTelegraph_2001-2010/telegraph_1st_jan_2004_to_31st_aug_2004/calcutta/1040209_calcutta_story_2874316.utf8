 Monday, February 09, 2004 				 Showcase of the best of private healthcare
 SANJAY MANDAL																								In an effort to showcase private healthcare facilities in Bengal, a major health fair is being organised later this week. The three-day fair, starting on February 13, will exhibit various medical equipment and health insurance facilities, with seminars on common healthcare problems.																								The show, at Netaji Indoor Stadium, is organised by Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), a joint forum of 11 private hospitals in the city. We have decided to showcase the progress achieved jointly by the private healthcare sector over the past few years, said Sajal Dutta, AHEI president and managing director of Ruby General Hospital.																								The idea is to let people know and judge for themselves the advanced facilities in Calcuttas private hospitals, he added.																								The ultimate aim is to showcase the best and stem the systematic exodus of Calcuttans  south, west or north  when it comes to critical medical care. 																								According to Dutta, the citys health sector is poised for a turnaround. In 1992-93, the number of bypass surgeries in city hospitals was below five a day. 																								But now, the figure has gone up to 20, which indicates that more people are preferring to undergo treatment here, Dutta said.																								Health check-ups at a low cost will be an important part of the fair, along with 12 seminars hosted on various medical aspects. Exhibitions on surgical equipment and health insurance will also find a place.																								Stalls would be set up by manufacturers and distributors of drugs and pharmaceuticals, herbal and ayurvedic medicines, fitness and sports equipment and providers of alternative medicine. Clinical waste management providers, hospital management, software and service sectors would also be on hand.

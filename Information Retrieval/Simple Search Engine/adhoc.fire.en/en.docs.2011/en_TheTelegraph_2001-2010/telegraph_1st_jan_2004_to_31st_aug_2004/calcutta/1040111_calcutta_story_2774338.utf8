 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Additive pushes back CU diary
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								The demand of some Calcutta University (CU) teachers for adding Prof. to their names, irrespective of their actual designation, has forced the institute to deviate from the age-old tradition of publishing the CU diary at the beginning of the year.																								The controversy, which started after the university registrar requested the vice-chancellor to allow all teachers to use the honorific, is unlikely to die down soon. Though some senior CU officials have not found anything wrong with the proposal, many teachers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, have ridiculed the strange and unethical bestowal of the honorific.																								CU registrar Ujjwal Basu recently sent a note to vice-chancellor Asis Banerjee, seeking the latters go-ahead for the use of Prof. by all teachers of the university and colleges affiliated to it. The names of all lecturers, senior lecturers, readers or assistant professors should be preceded by this honorific, the letter said.																								Vice-chancellor Banerjee, despite getting feedback much of which was not positive, gave his consent. This created a stir not usually witnessed in CU circles and pushed back the publication of the diary, officials admitted. The diary, printed and distributed at the start of a year, contains the names, addresses, telephone numbers and other details of all members of the universitys senate, syndicate and faculty and is considered to be a useful aid.																								Till last year, only professors used to get the honorific due to them and the names of all lecturers, readers or assistant professors were preceded by either Dr (if they had a Ph.D) or the usual Mr or Ms. The university decision has upset academicians.																								It requires at least four years for a lecturer of any under-graduate college or the university to become a senior lecturer. At least eight more years are required to become a reader. One becomes a professor  at the earliest  eight years later, making a lecturers journey to professorship at least 20 years long.																								Many in the university, therefore, feel that it would not be proper to distribute the honorific that should be earned. Besides, there is the question of maintaining the sanctity of the university statutes, they feel.																								Even vice-chancellor Banerjee felt that readers or lecturers could not be called professors technically. The professor is a post that one has to achieve after decades of work in classrooms and laboratories or libraries, he said. Still I have accepted the registrars proposal because of popular demand, Banerjee added. The registrar, however, had nothing to say on his note that led to the never-before delay in an annual exercise.

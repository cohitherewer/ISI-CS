The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Price for safe amp; smooth ride
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should taxis charge 50 per cent extra from midnight to six in the morning? More letters will be published next week Daylight duel: A familiar bargain in front of Howrah stationSantosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park.																																																														Nothing can be more disgraceful if passengers are held to ransom by a taxi driver after a long and strenuous train journey. Once I had to pay an exorbitant amount under duress to reach home with family. The pre-paid taxi booth at Howrah station closes at 10 pm, so even if the said rule is implemented the taxis will start charging 50 per cent extra from 10 itself. For proper enforcement, the taxi stand outside the railway station should be under the supervision of senior police officials who can keep tabs on the corrupt constables and the touts.									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
																		Behala.																																																														If a 50 per cent hike in fares, between midnight and 6 am, solves the taxi problem then most people will have no objection to the proposal. The practice of charging extra at night is already prevalent in some other metros. The motor vehicles department should be allowed to fix the rate of increase in charges. But is there any guarantee that the move would reduce taxi refusals and harassment by cabbies? The police and the administration should ensure that if the decision comes to force it protects the interests of the passengers.									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Beleghata.																																																														People dont have a choice when it comes to conveyance at night. So the question of paying the drivers extra fare does not arise.									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore.																																																														Fifty per cent extra is too much. There is no denying that taxis are the saviours at night when other means of transport are unavailable. Considering the interests of commuters as well as taxi drivers, a 20-25 per cent extra fare would be ideal.									

Asif Nadeem, 
																		Serampore.																																																														I dont see anything wrong in it, as there are many people who hire taxis between midnight and 6 am. With the crime rate on the rise, 50 per cent extra is a little to pay for reaching home safe and sound. Passengers must be thankful to the drivers for being at their service even at odd hours. When we are enjoying this facility, whats wrong in paying a little more?									

Sukumar Dutta, 
																		Jagaddal.																																																														It is not at all welcome. Even poor people are forced to hire a cab between midnight and 6 am. They will be in trouble if they are asked to pay 50 per cent extra.									

Seraj Alam, 
																		Bansberia.																																																														Taxi drivers are more extortionists than knight-riders these days! Since buses go off the roads by 11 pm, hapless newcomers to the city are bullied by cabbies. The experiences of C. Mathew and Ajay Lamba at Howrah station are cases in point. Instead of hiking the fare, seeking help from the GRP and the SRP when harassed by taxi drivers would be a better idea.									

Saadia Sitwat, 
																		Linton Street.																																																														No, I dont think so. The existing taxi fare is high enough and we usually end up paying more than the stipulated amount, thanks to doctored meters. Increasing the fare further will be inconsiderate towards the general public.									

Biman Saha, 
																		Lake Town.																																																														This is not a bad idea. Given the security problems and lack of rest due to the nature of their work, taxi drivers should be allowed some incentive for toiling through the night. Otherwise, they would not take the risk of venturing out at night. However, the extra charge should not be more than 25 per cent. The taxi associations should take care that an adequate number of taxis is available at night, particularly near hospitals and nursing homes.									

Biswanath Mukherjee, 
																		Address not given.																																																														An extra 50 per cent fare cannot be allowed. Commuters who might need a cab at night need not necessarily be financially better off than those travelling at daytime. What if a passenger gets aboard a taxi at 11.30 pm and reaches his destination at 12.30 am? How will he be charged?									

Sandipan Dutta, 
																		Sukantapally.																																																														Extra charges cannot be allowed for a ride on a taxi between midnight and 6 am as passengers do not grow any richer during this time. An extra fare will be a burden to commuters who often avail of a cab at night only due to unavoidable circumstances. Commuters cannot be classified on the basis of the time they opt for a ride.									

Virendra Shah, 
																		Amratalla Lane.																																																														An extra 50 per cent fare will not guarantee passengers a safe and hassle-free taxi ride, especially in the districts. It would rather be a burden on the less affluent. It is no good to blame taxi drivers. Instead, those who have been entrusted with the responsibility to discipline them should do their job. The authorities should stop playing the blame game.									

Mahasweta Saha, 
																		Garia.																																																														Other metros have a half-down meter system. If such a system is introduced in Calcutta, the passengers would not have to be at the mercy of drivers fancy. We cannot blame the cabbies entirely. Some policemen and politicians are also involved in the malpractice indirectly. The half-down meter system will effectively put a stop to them.									

Tanushree Mukherjee, 
																		Chandernagore.																																																														It is the duty of the taxi drivers to cooperate when passengers are in a spot at night. So they should not charge extra money. It is wrong to assume that all taxi drivers are greedy and the only way to satiate them is to pay more. They can, at best, charge a little more than the normal fare, which will be profitable for them and affordable for the passengers.									

Anuradha Raza, 
																		Darga Road.																																																														Absolutely not. The extra fare will not affect the car-owners but those who cannot afford the luxury of a personal vehicle will be dearly hit. Taxis are for public service and should be affordable for all round the clock.

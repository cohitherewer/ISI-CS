The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 Life Global tag for hair care prosHIMIKA CHAUDHURI (Top) Claudia Schiffer and Andie MacDowell, brand ambassadors for Oreal and (above) Sabina Yah of Sunflower 															They have already earned a name for themselves in the city. Sabina Yah of Sunflower and Raman Bharadwaj of A.. John are two people who have been bringing the best in hair dressing, styling and care to both men and women of the city. 																					Now, they will represent Calcutta as part of the 14-member creative team of hair designers headed for a hair show in Paris, come September. Not only does this prestigious trip organised by Oreal Professionnel mean better international exposure for these stylists who have been handpicked for the event, it also means the latest international styles, cuts and colours will be brought back to Indian salons by the delegates.																					Their stint in Paris will entitle them to witness the autumn-winter colour collection 2004-2005 showing. They will be working with Parisian hair stylist Laurent De Creton, an internationally renowned hair dresser and a member of the International Haute Couture Francais, a platform for global hair designers.																					A first-hand experience of the current international hair trends is what the two stylists will return with. Improvisations on the same themes to suit Indian hair texture and weather will follow. They will then educate hair stylists across the country through workshops and seminars to be held in various Indian cities in October. 																					The Indian consciousness with regard to hair care and hair styling is increasing. This is the right time to educate people about international styles and trends, feels Sabina Yah, winner of the Oreal creative hairdressers award in 2000.																					Raman Bharadwaj, the 26-year-old stylist agrees. The information will trickle down to the public only after we have spread awareness about hair styles and trends amongst other hair dressers around the country. 																					Though awareness is on the rise, there is a lot of scope for improvement in Calcutta, feel both the experts. In fact, the only problem that hairdressers in India face even after their international exposure is that not many clients are ready to try outlandish or wacky hair-dos. 																					Indians are still conservative about the way they dress their hair so its impossible for us to try out new styles as often as we would want to, said Sabina. However, if awareness increases as it will once these workshops are conducted, we will have more people willing to experiment. That is when we will take our first step to going truly international, said Raman.

 Sunday, July 04, 2004 Bending of Beckham
When a star is a brand, his prowess as a public performer must not diminish, by David! Shiloo ChattopadhyayadLIB(Top) Beckham: Down and out. (Above) Victoria:Family matters The dateline is London, June 29. The story is from Reuters. It says, and I quote: A photographic portrait of David Beckham was defaced today featured in an exhibition of the worlds greatest footballers at Londons Royal Academy of Arts.An act by hooligans? So feels the curator of the exhibition, David Grob, who says, You expect this sort of hooliganism to happen at a football ground, not at an art gallery.Good point, Mr Grob. It also raises a what if question. If England had won the match against Portugal, courtesy a Beckham bender and if the so-called soccer hooligans had then thronged the art exhibition, would he have complained?What happened at the high-profile art exhibition could have happened to a Beckham display in a Kensington shop window. That is the risk you run, if you are using a celebrity for your brand. On the other hand, the fruits of enhanced celebrity popularity  a Sehwag triple hundred, for example  can endow your brand as well. That is the lure anyway. Perhaps a good summary of all the reasons why a celebrity is chosen as brand ambassador is that people (read consumers) love him or her. That affection is what you as the marketer wish to capitalise on.Many argue that media make a star. Presumably that is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Media cannot make you and me a star. There has to be a threshold level of performance prowess. More importantly, for a brand to benefit continuously, a star has to remain a star. His prowess as a public performer must not stop. Can you imagine Rajesh Khanna endorsing credit cards anymore? On the other hand, exactly for the opposite reason, Big Bs presence in ads continues unabated.And there is this other thing that the lay public expects from its heroes  a certain degree of morality as defined by contemporary society. Many may argue that this is an unreasonable demand. Private life of a public personality should be left alone. Well, people consume only that part of a stars life that is visible. The onus is on the stars to keep their private life invisible, media notwithstanding.David Beckham has recently failed both these tests. His on-field performance has left most of his ardent fans disappointed. Two missed penalties that could have changed the fortunes of the national team are not easy to condone. Perhaps, more importantly, his effort levels in the Euro 2004 matches left many questions unanswered.The feeling of let down possibly exaggerated the other disappointment. The star with a famous wife and two lovely children was alleged to have had an extra-marital affair. Fans kept quiet. Till the on-field efforts raised the question, is he too pre-occupied with off-field matters?Many complain that Beckham at the best of times is an overrated midfielder. His stardom thus is unjustified anyway. Perhaps, there are a few lessons to be learnt. First, mediocrity of talent cannot be hidden too long by hairstyles and tattoos. Second, even Beckham cannot afford to bend it publicly.

 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Legal hiccup for infotech dream project
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees dream project to put Bengal on the info highway roadmap has hit a legal hurdle.																								The Banglar Mukh e-governance project, to decentralise information through kiosks across the state, has not only run into controversy, but a forum of kiosk-owners is also planning to drag the government to court for breach of contract.																								The project was launched with much hype in January last year, with the chief minister himself inaugurating it. Webel and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were the nodal agencies, and 82 kiosks were set up across the state to provide access to the portal, Banglar Mukh. 																								Online information of all state government departments was to be available from the portal. The government also charged each kiosk-owner Rs 40,000 as licence fee for setting up the kiosks.																								The project, however, has had a rough ride since its inception and the government was accused of not keeping its promise. A forum of the kiosk-owners has sent a legal notice to the information and technology (IT) department, accusing the government of a commitment breach. 																								As per the agreement, it was licensor Webels responsibility to provide, among other facilities, viewing and downloading of government tenders, examination results, value-added e-mail services, agricultural information, technical education, health-related services and other facilities, including Internet access, only through the information kiosk, the notice said.																								These commitments were not fulfilled, said a spokesperson for Tathya Bipani Owners Pavilion. Our pleas for justice have gone unheeded. So now, we are compelled to seek legal redress, he added.																								IT minister Manab Mukherjee, however, said: We have not breached our contract and, instead, provided them with all necessary information. 																								But Webel officials admitted: What the kiosk-owners say is true. Said C. Rudra, general manager (IT), Webel: Discussions are on and things will soon be sorted out. He said the operators woes stemmed from the projects teething troubles.																								The kiosk-owners had paid a licence fee of Rs 40,000 for setting up their pavilions. They had spent another Rs 2 lakh, on an average, to set up the necessary infrastructure, including computers and telephones. 																								We have to bear a monthly recurring cost of Rs 10,000 for running the kiosk, one of the owners pointed out.																								However, the returns are yet to flow in and for this, they blame the authorities. The government has not provided us with the services it had promised, one of the owners said. 																								At a recent meeting with kiosk-owners at Writers Buildings, IT department officials assured them that initiatives would be taken so that state government departments cooperated with the kiosk operators to help them distribute all relevant information. 																								But this, the operators allege, is yet to be implemented. We are turning away people as we cannot provide them with any information, one of them said. 																								Many among us were unemployed youths and we wanted to build our fortunes through this. But now, many kiosk-owners have to sustain their business by borrowing money from family or friends, he said.

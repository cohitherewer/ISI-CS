 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Six held for chit fund fraud
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Six persons, allegedly involved in a chit-fund racket worth lakhs, were arrested on Monday morning during simultaneous raids on three offices of two share-trading companies. 																								According to deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra, the miscreants, most of them with criminal cases to their names, had floated two companies, Delta Alliance and Max Portfolios. They advertised in prime dailies, soliciting deposits, with a promise of paying 120 per cent interest per annum. 																								The kingpins, Sanjiv and Rajiv Kapoor, who were arrested several times earlier for fraud here as well as in Delhi and Chandigarh, were picked up from their British India Street office. Sanjivs wife Arpita Kapoor (Dey), her sisters Samarpita and Jyoti, and an associate, Virender Ganeriwala, were also netted during the raids on offices in Regent Park and Syed Amir Ali Avenue , Mitra said.																								The Kapoors have cases pending against them. They had floated the companies a few days ago and had forged documents of approval from the Reserve Bank of India to cheat the customers. Nearly 100 investors had deposited money with them, lured by the high benefits offered. The amount runs into lakhs, Mitra said.

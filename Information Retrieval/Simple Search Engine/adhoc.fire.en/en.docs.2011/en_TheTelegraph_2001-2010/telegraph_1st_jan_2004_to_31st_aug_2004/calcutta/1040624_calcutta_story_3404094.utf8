 Thursday, June 24, 2004 Life Quack callSANGITA S. GUHA ROY A scene from Healthy Wealthy amp; Vice. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															Bedroom farces and over-the-top slapstick comedies are best digested after the lull of a pleasant cocktail hour. Healthy Wealthy amp; Vice, a play that takes a sarcastic dig at the rampant corruption in the medical fraternity, was presented at Pala at the ITC Sonar Bangla in association with Spandan recently. The play was lapped up by a select gathering even though the script was laced with politically incorrect innuendoes.																					The unscrupulous nature of the protagonist, Dr Luthra, in dealing with his patients and his myriad adulterous affairs may have been included to spice up the proceedings, but it did little to hide distasteful remarks like the one about his daughters friend from Burundi. Statements like Burundi! Must be somewhere in the middle of Sahara surrounded by Somalia and Ethiopia! failed to tickle a funny bone. 																					Nevertheless, the play successfully managed to highlight the corruption in the medical profession that makes victims of unsuspecting patients. 																					aywright Nicholas Kharkongar said that much of the inspiration for the comedy came from real-life experiences. The ordeal I had to go through in Delhi running from one doc to the other to treat a shoulder pain inspired me to pen the play. The over-the-top scenes are nothing but artistic license that I have taken to dramatise and caricature, said Nicholas. 																					Our job is to take a message to society and make people more alert to the ills that plague us, added director Sita Raina f Prime Time Theatre.																					Point taken, but perhaps next time a little editing between the scenes should help in the making of a more wholesome fare like the canaps on offer, Corn Crusted Fish Croquettes, Chicken Gung Bao, lamb kebabs and Jalapeno Peppers, to name a few.

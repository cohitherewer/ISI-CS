	1972-73: Govt acquires nine acres from Ghosh family at Harishpur
	1974: Irrigation dept takes possession of land
	1976-77: Objection filed by Ghosh family, wants more compensation
	1981: Howrah land tribunal court rules higher compensation 
	2002: Calcutta High Court orders auction of DMs bungalow to fund compensation
	2004: Howrah district awards petitioner proceeds of bungalow auctionThe official bungalow of Howrahs district magistrate was auctioned on Wednesday  for Rs 31.1 lakh.																								A part of the proceeds will go towards the acquisition by the government  over 30 years ago  of a nine-acre plot, some 40 km from the bungalow that went under the hammer.																								The sale can, however, be prevented if the government rustles up Rs 7.91 lakh for payment to the landowners of the contentious plot by Friday.																								Based on a contempt petition filed by the heirs of Satish Chandra Ghosh, owner of the agricultural land at Harishpur, in the Pero area of Uluberia, Calcutta High Court had, on January 31, 2001, ordered that the bungalow and the 5.25 acres it stood on be auctioned. 																								The aim: to pay off the heirs.																								Real-estate agents pegged the market value of the land and the bungalow at anywhere between Rs 6 crore and Rs 8 crore. 																								The bungalow, built in the mid-19th Century, has been declared a heritage building recently. It can be sold, but its character cannot be altered.																								The Howrah land acquisition and tribunal court ordered the execution of the high courts directive on Monday, paving the way for Wednesdays auction, held at the Howrah court complex. 																								Of the four bidders who responded, Howrah businessman Jahangir Mondals call was the highest.																								It all started in 1972-73 when the state government acquired the Harishpur land to implement the Damodar Improvement Scheme and offered Satish Chandra Ghosh Rs 18,424.20. 																								The family immediately rejected the pittance of an offer . 																								And when the irrigation department sought possession of the land a year later, it filed an application in the land acquisition tribunal court under Section 8 of the Land Acquisition Act.																								The court then ordered that a proper valuation of the nine acres be carried out. The government, however, ignored this and began implementing the improvement scheme.																								The matter remained mired in litigation till the high court directed the government to pay the petitioner, Mritunjoy Ghosh, a legal heir to the late Satish Chandra Ghosh.																								The amount the family had to be paid was fixed at Rs 7.91 lakh, comprising Rs 1.37 lakh towards the basic value of the land, plus 30 per cent as legal costs and interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum.																								Ghoshs lawyer Shankar Bera said that if by Friday the government pays up this amount, then we will allow the case to be disposed of and the bungalow can stay with the government.																								The government pleader of Howrah has moved the land acquisition tribunal court, saying that the amount to be paid was too high and that the state government be granted a hearing.

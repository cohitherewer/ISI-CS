The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004  Star Spot
 Biswarup Guha BiswasBiswarup Guha Biswas																									Is this 17-year-old. And although hes not yet the master of one, Biswarup is keeping his options open. From photography to social work, debating to acting  the interests of the Class XI student of National High School for Boys are as varied as his talents.																									Is the former South Point student, but only when it comes to his trusted camera, formerly a 15-year-old Canon that was passed down from father to son. The member of Drik India is passionate about human rights, and can be found clicking away in every corner of Calcutta on weekends, attempting to catch a glimpse of the essence of life.																									And the foibles and strengths of humanity are what he likes to capture through the images. His last self-set project was on relationships. Biswarup also learns about the subject  the subtleties, not the technicalities  from his mentor, photographer Subhendu Chatterjee, through hours of discussions. And in his free time, the boy from Kankurgachhi devours all the books that he can find on photography.																									He is, but of a different kind. The commerce student has coordinated with NGOs Sanlaap and Apne Aap on book-making projects, documenting the stories of the children of sex workers in the red-light areas of Bowbazar and Sonagachhi. While the kids told their tales, Biswarup helped them pen their thoughts and ideas.																									Aside, he also finds the time to take part in debates in inter-school fests, act in school plays, and do the occasional assignment for The Telegraph, not to mention his previous occupation, doing Internet market research for a software company.																									For Biswarup is definitely variety. Despite not doing well in his Class X Board exams due to a serious bout of jaundice, hes determined to pursue academics in future, with a specialisation in research on human resource development.

  Lap of honour: The Olympic flame rally outside the Red Fort. (Reuters) Apropos the report  Foolproof plan for afforestation monitor, May 15, on every other occasion saplings are planted on the roadside in Calcutta, usually never to be nurtured. No care is taken of the plants which are left in their enclosures  they are never watered, and more often than not, they die soon as mere saplings.  The saplings are supplied and planted at the behest of the forest department, which takes money from organisers of the plantation drive for this. But the problem lies elsewhere. The forest department takes part merely in the ceremony of planting the saplings. The department manages to get mileage from the programme and also by the display of an inscribed board, proclaiming the departments contribution to the green-drive. But, thats where the effort ends.  On a recent visit to Singapore, I noticed how the authorities concerned take diligent care of the saplings lining the roads. The saplings are monitored daily and watered by hose-pipes from mobile tankers. And so, most roadside trees in Singapore are healthy and green, adding to the beauty of the city.  We should take a leaf out of the Singapore governments book. For a few days during the forestry week in July, our officials work overtime, distributing saplings and planting a few themselves. But does their responsibility end there?  Merely maintaining a few gardens is no service to the cause. The forest department should be ashamed of neglecting the citys green cover. Madhabi D. Ghosh, 
Salt Lake City.The report Relay sprint duo with Olympic flame aloft, May 6, reminded me of the time when the torch came to New Delhi in 1964 before the Tokyo Olympics. It was flown to the capital by a chartered Japan Airlines flight and reached Calcutta on August 29. I have retained the Hindustan Standard front-page report, dated August 30. The torch was kept at Grand Hotel for the night. The Olympic flame had also touched down at Calcutta for half an hour on November 5, 1956, en route to Melbourne. It is a matter of pride for the country when the Olympic torch lands, letting people soak in the spirit. And it is not the first time that India has been chosen for the honour, as the report mentioned. Chitta Biswas, 
Sree Colony.The story Duster fling wounds boy, May 18, again brought forth the appaling state of our primary schools. It showed that our teachers lack knowledge of child psychology and tolerance, which should be the essential requirements. Govinda Bakshi,
Budge Budge.The article Band cries Murder over tune lift, May 20, failed to shock us since Anu Malik, the music director of the film, is reportedly more famous for his cheated scores than original ones. However, he calls it experimentation and his producers and directors support his stand. The law should take its own course and because of Maliks shameful act, albums of the film Murder should be banned. Kunal Ray,
Santragachhi. Dominique Lapierres books have always been a joy to read. It is heartening to know (Peace crusade, in words and deed, May 21) that the author will inaugurate a home for challenged children near Uluberia. His City of Joy Foundation has been involved in social welfare for a while and runs four hospital boats in the Sunderbans. He has invested $1.2 million in Bengal. May God bless him for his humanitarian work. B.N. Bose, 
Dum Dum Park.This refers to the report Meter overload sets off highrise blaze, May 17. It is shocking that for their personal gains, promoters do anything, even at the cost of harassing the masses. Authorities should take immediate action against the wrongdoers. Anil Kumar Sen,
Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. Apropos the report Demolish cry over Bypass billboards, May 17, the CMDA plan to clear both sides of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass pulling down all the illegal billboards from June this year is undoubtedly a praiseworthy step, which should have been taken long ago. Sunil Banerjee, 
VIP Road.

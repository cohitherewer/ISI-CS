																																																		The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday expressed its failure in reaching a conclusion in the baby-swap case at Medical College and Hospital (MCH) that rocked the city six years ago. In its report, the CBI said since the state government officials and the Medical College staff members did not help them in the investigation by providing them with the necessary documents, it was not possible for them to reach a logical conclusion. The division bench of Justice G.C. De and Justice P.K. Biswas disposed of the case after recording the allegation of the CBI and expressing unhappiness as investigations failed even after so much money was spent. In July 1998, Anup Bhattacharya had filed a case in Calcutta High Court alleging that his new-born male child was missing from the hospital. He told the court that his wife Keya had given birth to a male child at MR Bangur Hospital and as the baby was sick, the hospital authorities sent him to the child care unit of MCH. After her release from Bangur Hospital, my wife went to fetch her son but the hospital authorities gave her a female baby. When she refused to accept the female child, some staff members of the hospital assaulted her, the petition had alleged. The CBI was investigating the case for the past four years.

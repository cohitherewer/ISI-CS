 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Consumer groups ready case
 																											- Memorandum ahead for Sonia to scrap NDAs deposit fee rule shift SANJAY MANDAL																								With a Congress-led government all set to take charge at the Centre, consumer protection groups in the city will launch a movement against introduction of deposit fees in consumer courts and other anti-consumer amendments introduced by the NDA government.																								The amendments brought by the NDA government was enacted on March 15, 2003. However, it came into effect from last week, when the central consumer protection rule was amended. 																								Protection groups have decided to take up the issue with Prime Minister-in-waiting Sonia Gandhi, soon after she assumes office. 																								We will submit a memorandum to Sonia Gandhi on the amendments in the Consumer Protection Act (COPRA) introduced by the NDA government and request her to scrap the commercial aspect of the amendments, said Jayanta Bhattacharya, Rajya Sabha MP and adviser to the Bengal Federation of Consumer Organisations, on Monday.																								After the amendment, one has to pay a minimum fee of Rs 100 to file a case in a consumer court. Earlier, no fee was charged to file a case in any consumer fora. To initiate proceedings, one will have to deposit fees by demand draft or postal order in the name of the registrar, state commission, and the same is to be placed under treasury challan at the office of treasury, said Biswajit Sengupta of Thinkman, a social organisation working on consumers rights. This is harassing consumers, he said.																								At the inception of COPRA, the fora in districts had original jurisdiction to redress a complaint up to a claim of Rs 1 lakh, whereas the state consumer redressal commissions had jurisdiction to entertain grievances over Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, and National Consumers Redressal Commission (NCRC) entertained cases seeking compensation of more than Rs 10 lakh.																								In 1993, after an amendment, the jurisdiction of district, state and national commissions were enhanced to Rs 5 lakh, till Rs 20 lakh and over Rs 20 lakh, respectively. 																								The 2003 amendment has raised the jurisdiction of district commissions to handle cases seeking compensation up to Rs 20 lakh and state commissions will decide cases above Rs 20 lakh up to Rs 1 crore. NCRC, according to the new amendment, will deal with cases seeking compensation of only more than Rs 1 crore apart from appeals and revisional matters.																								While the workload of the NCRC has been taken off, the district fora will be grappling with a huge backlog of cases, said Prabir Basu, general secretary of Consumers Unity and Guidance Forum.

	A bunch of stray dogs causes a lot of trouble to morning-walkers  on the Victoria Memorial grounds. The dogs roam around near  the eastern gate, opposite St Pauls Cathedral, where they  forage the leftovers of the fairs held on the Maidan. For  the elderly, the canines are a bother. The grounds should  be rid of strays.  
	Sunil Garodia, Sushil Sen Road.  
	Budge Budge does not have a computerised railway counter.  So, residents have to go to Majherhat, Rabindra Sadan or  Koilaghat to book tickets. A booking counter must be opened  either at Nungi or at Budge Budge station. 
	 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	About a week ago, customers at the New Alipore municipal  market shopped in the dark after power supply was cut off.  The decision to snap power had resulted from a dispute over  payment of bills. But people should not be made to suffer  this way. 
	 Ronodeb Goho, New Alipore.

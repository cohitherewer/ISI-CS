The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Urmila Matondkar Expect the unexpected this year. Some things in life will change, possibly for the better. The emphasis will be on energy, power and advancement. Though you are choosy about friends, you will be drawn to those influenced by the numbers 1, 2, 7 and 8. Dress in shades of white, grey and violet to make the best of every situation. Sundays, Mondays and Saturdays will prove lucky for you.  Kusum Bhandari

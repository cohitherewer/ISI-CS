Feng Shui Pinky KapoorIf you want to set up a new factory or renovate an existing one Feng Shui guidelines may make them more lucrative.																								The first thing to keep in mind is the site should not be lower than road level and construction should be at least three feet above the road, as, over time, the factory land generally settles, creating a depression. Machines may then remain idle, as orders may dwindle.Build right The factory temple is best in the northeast of the plot. The main factory structure should be built towards the southwest and an independent administrative block can be to its north. Care should be taken that they are either square or rectangular and that the administrative office block does not loom over the factory.																								Important managers should be seated in the southwest of the administrative block. The rest of the management unit can sit in the west or south. Workers and staff should be in the northwest. The cashiers and accountants are best in the southeast.																								During construction, ensure that no column, pillar or beam runs through the centre of the factory. 																								The central area, or brahmasthan, should be well marked to remind you that no heavy machinery is ever kept there. If the factory is split-level, the back should be at the same level or slightly elevated to give the business support. If it is sunk, the support is lost and the factory may not progress.																								The second phase of construction is most critical. Even if the business is expanding, an unthinking building plan could adversely affect business. Heavy machines in the southwest can provide stability.																								Raw materials should be kept in this sector. These are best processed in the west and then the finished products should be readied, stored and delivered from the northwest. This will ensure fast movement. The northeast should be kept light.Water works Underground water stores should be located in the east or north, but as far away as possible from the north-south axis. Do not store water under the ground or in tanks in the southern sector. This is the fire area, and it clashes with the water element.																								Another area that is inauspicious for the underground water tank is the southwest. Creating a depression here may cause instability.Water fountains are productive in the north. This being the business area, it is recommended to have a slow, soft and meandering flow of water, because such a feature ensures continuous prosperity in business. Rivers or canals running in the front of the factory are symbolic of wealth, but if they are behind the factory, they bring misfortune. In such cases, a high wall or tall trees planted behind will give support and protection to the factory.Crowning glory																								In front, the companys name should be on the top of the building on a stable platform with a powerful light overhead, as a symbol of taking the company to great heights. A signboard hanging mid-air is sure to turn business shaky. Auspicious religious symbols can be placed above the entrance to bring in good vibes and to ward off evil.																								Tip of the week: Newspapers and magazines will sell faster if the machines are placed in such a way that the paper goes in from the southwest and the finished products come out from the northwest. The same applies to the manufacture and resale of other products.

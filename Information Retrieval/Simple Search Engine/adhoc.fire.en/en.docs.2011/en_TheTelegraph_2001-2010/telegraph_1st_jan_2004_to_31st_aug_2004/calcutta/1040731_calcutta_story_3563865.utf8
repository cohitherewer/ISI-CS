 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 European novel from Indian pen
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Basu at the book launch on Friday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Kunal Basu is known to be a romancer of the strange. In his first novel, The Opium Clerk, he straddled British India and Southeast Asia. For his second, The Miniaturist, he receded further back in time to Mughal India in the 16th century. His third work takes a leap altogether from the Indian shores. 																								It will be a European novel, says the 47-year-old professor of strategic marketing at Templeton College, Oxford, while admitting that the exercise will be a departure not just for himself but also for Indian authors writing in English. It is a novel about biology set in Victorian England and has no connection with Asia.																								The management teacher had to educate himself about the subject as he did not study biology at any point of his career, not even in school.																								Basu has taken the venture as a challenge. There has not been a single piece of work (by Indian authors writing in English) in my knowledge which does not have a significant component of the Indian or the Asian experience. This, he hastens to add, is natural for authors of any nationality. Tolstoy wrote of Russia, Stendhal of France, Mark Twain of America...																								But Basu looks to follow in the footsteps of the exceptions, like Joseph Conrad, who have grown up breathing the air of one world but have written about another.																								This has required a fair bit of imagination and research. Thankfully, there is a lot of writing about race science in Victorial England. 																								Basu admits that working in an area of which he has no direct experience lays him open to risks of historical inaccuracy. In 1846, if someone walks into the Royal Academys craniology laboratory in London, what would he be served  tea and cakes or biscuits? I call this foreground research, which takes a lot of time. But as long as the novel reads plausible, he is not worried.																								Nor is the resident of the UK worried about the response of the English-speaking reader. If I were strategic I would never write this novel. I know some people might say, You are an Indian. Go, write an Indian story. But the British have written about everyone. Its time somebody wrote about them, he laughs.																								Basu is in town for the launch of a collection of critical essays on his works at the British Council by Tagore-Gandhi Institute and Shakespeare Society of Eastern India on Friday. 																								The author, who will be off to Thailand for a seminar on Monday, plans to undertake a drive from there to Myanmar. The journey takes no less than four days. Travel is an important therapy, he smiles, adding that he is attracted by the notion of the author as adventurer. 																								So will it be the roads of Rangoon after the morgues of London? Basu is not telling.

 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 High court cuts down on backlog of cases
 															- THREE-PRONGED FORMULA YIELDS RESULTS				 	 Calcutta High Court: Justice becomes speedier																								The number of pending cases in Calcutta High Court has come down by a lakh over the past two-and-a-half years, though the count of new cases being filed has gone up by 10 per cent annually.																								At the end of 2001, about 3.2 lakh cases were pending in the court. As of today, this number has come down to 2.2 lakh. Court sources say several steps taken by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur after he assumed charge have led to the quick disposal of pending cases. Calcutta High Court had the highest backlog among the high courts in the country.																								Justice Mathur took three major steps. He fixed two days  every Tuesday and Thursday  for hearing the old cases. He advised his fellow judges to settle writs by clubbing similar ones together. Last, he took the initiative to decrease the number of holidays enjoyed by the court, the sources said.																								Court officials say it will take another five years to bring the number of pending cases to nil, provided the present rate of disposal continues. 																								Some of the high court judges, like Justice Barin Ghosh, Justice N.A. Chowdhury, Justice Pinaki Ghosh, Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya, Justice Subhrakamal Mukherjee and Justice Pratap Roy, are showing the way in speedy disposal of cases.																								Another reason for the quick disposal of pending cases is the screening of matters brought to the court. The chief justice had clearly proclaimed that public interest litigations (PILs) that were being filed for personal, political or business interests would not be entertained by the judges. 																								Justice Mathur himself refused a number of cases for hearing, as he found they were moved for personal gain, a high court official said.																								Filling the vacant posts of judges will ensure better results. At present, there are 39 judges in the court, against a sanctioned strength of 50. The sanctioned strength should, however, be at least 70, said Uttam Majumdar, executive chairman of the State Bar Council. He said the revised system of appointing judges from the same states was yielding good results.																								The successful implementation of concepts like fast track courts and Lok Adalats had reduced the number of pending cases in the lower courts of the state. 																								In 2001, the backlog in the subordinate courts had reached seven lakh. State judicial department sources said the number has dipped to 4.9 lakh.																								The judicial department, however, claims that the proposed block-level boards for conciliation of cases before admission in the courts (block-level pre-litigation conciliation boards) could solve the backlog problem further. Out-of-court settlements not only lessen the burden in the courts but are also beneficial to the aggrieved parties.																								The court is also paying special attention to assessing the performance of the subordinate court judges. As the administrative authority of the lower courts, the high court has also taken several remedial measures to dispose of cases quickly, the court officials claimed. 						 TAPAS GHOSH

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 From China...with love
																								An exhibition of Chinese oil paintings revisits the cultural city of Calcutta after a hiatus of close to two decades. The last exhibition showcased paintings which were the perfect embodiments of what one would understand by typically traditional Chinese art, expressed through conventional motifs. The current exhibition is an expression of the creative freedom that subtly invaded Chinese art, an aesthetic freedom that infused new life into the traditional fabric which lent a realism to it and unshackled it from the essentially feudalistic association of the dynastic regimes. The collection on display in the city is but a speck on the kaleidoscopic variety of Chinese art and will leave art connnoisseurs with a wider understanding of it, yet thirsting for more.																								When: Till February 10																								Where: Victoria Memorial

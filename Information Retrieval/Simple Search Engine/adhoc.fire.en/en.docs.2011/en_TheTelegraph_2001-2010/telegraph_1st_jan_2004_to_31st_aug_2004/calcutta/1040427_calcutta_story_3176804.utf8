 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Sit-in over rival party atrocities
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Congress workers and supporters of Sudip Bandopadhyay blocked the intersection of PK Tagore Street and Mondol Street, in the Jorabagan police station area, on Monday afternoon to protest alleged atrocities by local Trinamul Congress activists. The roadblock was spearheaded by Congress Block 24 president Gautam Vajpayee.																								According to local thana officer-in-charge Dulal Chakraborty, the roadblock sparked intermittent clashes through the day and several arrests were made.																								What triggered the trouble was an alleged assault by Trinamul supporters of a former compatriot, Sanjay Verma, who had followed Bandopadhyay out of the party. Verma was beaten up on Sunday night while on his way home. Verma was returning from Bandopadhyays house when he was accosted by Rakesh, Amar and associates, all Trinamul workers, in front of his house on Mondol Street, block president Vajpayee said.																								Both Congressmen and Bandopadhyays supporters alleged that police were favouring Trinamul supporters and had resorted to a lathicharge on their roadblock. Many of us suffered injuries and had to be hospitalised. We have warned them that if this continues, we will gherao the police station, Vajpayee said.

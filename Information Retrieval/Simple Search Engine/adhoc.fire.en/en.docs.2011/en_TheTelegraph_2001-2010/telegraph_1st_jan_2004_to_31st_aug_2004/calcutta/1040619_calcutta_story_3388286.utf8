 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Night guards for women and long-distance trains
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Forget kulhars, it is time to keep vigil. Laloo Prasad Yadavs trains will now have escorts to provide security to passengers. 																								Although the Railway Protection Force (RPF) Amendment Act 2003 will be implemented from July 1, the South Eastern Railway (SER) authorities have already started night patrolling in trains jointly by the RPF and the Government Railway Police (GRP) from June.																								The new rule has made the RPF and the GRP jointly responsible for security of passengers and passenger areas. The rule has also empowered the RPF to prosecute anyone on the railway premises.																								The responsibility of vigilance in long distance and local trains at night has been divided between the RPF and the GRP. We have started night patrolling from June 11, Baldev Raj, chief security commissioner (CSC), SER, said on Friday. To start with, RPF personnel have been entrusted with maintaining night vigil in 51 long distance trains while the GRP will take charge in 43 trains.																								SER sources said the vigil was started following instructions from the new railway minister. The railway ministry has instructed us to enhance night patrolling in trains with immediate effect, an official said.																								We have also started providing lady RPF personnel as escorts in ladies compartments on late night and early morning local suburban trains. The practice has been reintroduced, Raj said. Groups of four lady RPF personnel are patrolling the compartments. We will increase the strength of the force soon, he added.																								Eastern Railway (ER) will implement the rule from July 1. B.F. Passah, CSC, ER, said they would also escort long distance trains and ladies compartments of late night and early morning local trains. 																								Every day, 67 pairs of long distance trains run to and from Howrah station in the ER and the SER sections. Seven pairs of long distance passenger and 256 pairs of local trains operate daily. In Sealdah, 19 pairs of long distance trains run, along with four pairs of long distance passenger trains and 278 pairs of locals.

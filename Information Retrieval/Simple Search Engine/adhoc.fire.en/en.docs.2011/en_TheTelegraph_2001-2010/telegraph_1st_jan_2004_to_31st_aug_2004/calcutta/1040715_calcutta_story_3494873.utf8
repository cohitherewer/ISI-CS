Pinky Kapoor Q: I have been stuck in the same job for the past five years. Though I work very hard and am appreciated highly in my organisation, my salary is far below my expectations. I (born on 04.11.1975) have been looking for another job for the last two years, but nothing seems to work. 																								Prasanta Das, Dum Dum																								A: You are a strong wood person and need to be balanced with fire and earth elements. Fire element represents intelligence and earth symbolises wealth. Wearing vibrant colours or keeping red coloured objects around will help you think better. While wearing earthy colours like beige, cream, yellow or brown will help enhance your fortunes. Facing north-west while working will be beneficial as well. 																								Next year, you are entering the metal period. This will reshape your life dramatically and bring about a change in residence, job and a definite improvement in your finances. But take care as you will be facing a clash from the Rooster at this time. Keeping a picture or a figure of a Dragon on your bedside or worktable will help. ENTER THE DRAGON: Its impossible to go wrong with this good luck charm in Feng Shui. (Reuters)Q: We are building a new house for which we are now doing up the interiors. We have four children  two daughters (born on 05.10.1982 and 29.10.1985) and two sons (born on 22.07.1988 and 10.05.1991). Our youngest son is mentally challenged. What paint colours should we use, especially in the childrens bedroom? Also, what Feng Shui items can one keep in the childrens room to bring better luck?																								Jagdish Gope, Dhanbad																								A: Your childrens pillars of destiny show that all of them need a colour scheme that blends blue and green. If possible, give them rooms in the northern or eastern sectors of the house, where they will be nourished with water and wood energy. The northern wall can be painted in any shade of blue and the eastern wall green. As north is connected with childrens future careers, their aspirations will automatically get energised when the northern wall is painted blue. Keeping round metallic objects like pots, bowls, boxes with blue engravings and a round metal clock will also be beneficial.Q: My job entails promoting computer packages for an educational institute. I (born on 29.07.1976) have to visit various schools and convince the respective principals to implement the packages. I have been doing this job since December 2003 and so far have not been able to sign up even a single school, though I work very hard. I dont have an office and operate from home. Please suggest a solution.Aarti Sharma, Hooghly																								A: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a very weak water person. Beginning this year, you have entered a phase where your self-element is on the rise. Take support from water and metal elements by wearing and surrounding yourself lavishly with the colour blue. Wear an ornament that is made with a blend of five metals. 																								For marketing your product, keep brochures of computer packages in the north-west of your workroom along with the contact addresses and telephone numbers of your prospective clients. Wear blue clothes and approach the principal of a good school on an auspicious day like July 22.Q: I have been seeing someone for the last couple of years who is four years younger than me. We both work in private firms and are quite well settled. I (born on 12.08.1972) am very serious about the relationship and want to get married next year, as I am almost 32. My boyfriend (born on 09.02.1976) loves me, but is not keen on marriage at present. I live in a 2,000-sq ft flat and my bedroom is in the east. Please suggest appropriate measures to activate my marriage prospects.Amrita Saha, Lake GardensA: Your birth charts show that the time of marriage is ripe for both of you, and it should materialise either this year or next year. It is advisable to get married within this time period. 																								You should activate the south-west and the west of your bedroom by keeping a photograph of the two of you near an image of a deity. He should have a similar arrangement in his room.

 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 One-man gang robs train
 OUR BUREAU																								A single man raided a compartment of the 209 Up Howrah-Darbhanga Fast Passenger on Saturday morning, held all the passengers to ransom and made off with cash and jewellery. Only one passenger dared to raise his voice and received injuries on his hand and shoulder.																								The train had just left Howrah station at 7.10 am when the dacoit, identified as Sukumar Addhi, whisked out a knife and demanded that the passengers hand over their belongings to him.																								Addhi started off by snatching a gold chain from Rashila Patel, 38, a resident of Uttarpara. He then took away money from another woman. But Bhagirath Mondal, a 53-year-old resident of Sauj, Birbhum, refused to hand over the cash he was carrying and tried to raise an alarm. Addhi dug the knife he was carrying deep into Mondals hand and shoulder. As he lay writhing in pain, Addhi pocketed his money and jumped off the running train near Liluah workshop.																								Passengers and Government Railway Police (GRP) officials took Mondal to Walsh Hospital when the train stopped at Serampore at around 7.40 am. Agitated passengers got involved in an argument with the GRP over allegations of lack of security on trains.																								Addhi is a notorious criminal who operates in both Sealdah and Howrah sections, said Sunil Mullick, superintendent of railway police, Howrah. He is usually alone but creates an impression among passengers that he has a big gang, Mullick said. 																								According to him, Addhi had been arrested earlier but had to be released due to lack of evidence. When a crime is committed in a train compartment, we hardly get any witness as most passengers are from far-off places, Mullick said.																								Police have conducted raids at Dakshineswar, Kalighat and Sealdah in search of Addhi. We will conduct more raids at other possible hideouts, including one at Tarapith, he said.																								In another incident, passengers of Katwa local staged a demonstration at Chinsurah station, in Hooghly, after a woman jumped off a train reportedly to avoid ticket-checkers. They alleged that although the woman had received head injuries, railway officials refused to issue orders to hospitalise her. The woman was identified as Amriti Chowdhury, 40, a resident of Kalna. Station officials denied the allegation.

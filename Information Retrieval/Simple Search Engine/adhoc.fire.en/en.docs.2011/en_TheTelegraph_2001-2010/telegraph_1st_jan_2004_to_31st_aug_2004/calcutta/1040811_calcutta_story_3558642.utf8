The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Face-off over casual staff
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Citu-backed employees union of Balmer Lawrie has threatened a major stir over the confirmation of services of temporary workers in the public sector undertakings Calcutta unit near Taratala.																								Leaders of Balmer Lawrie Workmens Union have charged the management with violating a bipartite agreement. 																								The management has violated an agreement on absorbing 55 temporary workers in phases, said union general secretary Sambhu Nath Mukherjee on Tuesday. Many of these casual workers have been in the company for the past 20 years, he added.																								He claimed that the temporary employees were working under inhuman conditions. They get a daily wage of Rs 65, the minimum a company can pay. This is injustice, Mukherjee said. 																								Balmer Lawrie makes steel barrels required by Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Indo-Burma Petroleum. The company was nationalised in 1972 under administrative control of the ministry of petroleum. 																								It is also associated with industries like grease and lubricants, leather, chemicals, tea, tourism and packaging.																								The memorandum of settlement was signed in 1993 between the management and casual workers engaged in warehousing activities. By the agreement, the services of six casual workers would be regularised from April 1995. 																								From April 1995 to April 1, 2003, 13 workers were to have been inducted into the permanent rolls. But this has not been done, union general secretary Mukherjee alleged.																								Company officials denied the allegation. There was a bipartite agreement, but there were other clauses too, they said. According to the agreement, if the companys contract with the Indian Iron and Steel Company (Iisco) was terminated and the company was unable to find an alternative assignment, the workmen would automatically be laid off. 																								Although the company has never incurred a loss in its history, there are units in Calcutta that are not showing profits, an official explained. There are problems of excess manpower and infrastructure costs. When, on the one hand, the company is implementing a voluntary retirement scheme, how can it regularise the services of a temporary workforce? That will be contradictory, he added. 																								The union claimed some workers were beaten up by security guards while holding a protest rally recently. The company rubbished the charge.

 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Teasers in Howrah cop glare
 BHAJAN GANGULY																								Concerned at the alarming rise in cases of eve-teasing in Howrah town and its neighbourhood, police have decided to crack down on offenders. 																								Superintendent of police (SP) Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya said on Sunday over 100 complaints have been received in the past six months. 																								Senior police officers, who met last week to take stock of the situation, said women, particularly teenagers and school and college-going girls, are either teased or psychologically tortured. Most of the incidents reported occurred in the vicinity of girls schools and colleges. 																								Almost every day, we receive complaints from guardians that their daughters are being harassed on the roads. From now on, we are not going to spare the culprits. Offenders will be brought to book and strict action will be taken against them, the SP elaborated. 																								Certain areas have been identified as the most disturbed zones. The roads adjacent to womens institutions are the worst affected. We have decided to deploy plainclothesmen in these areas. Specific instructions have been given to arrest the offenders after they are caught red-handed, he added. 																								Heads of womens institutions in the district have been asked to instal complaint boxes on the premises for victims. 																								While making complaints, a girl student need not mention her name. The school and college authorities will have to collect the complaints and inform the police, Bhattacharya added.																								Officials say girls are being heckled inside state and private buses, too. We have decided to deploy women constables in plainclothes on public vehicles. Whenever a passenger disturbs a woman, the woman constable on duty will ask the driver to stop the bus and she will arrest the person, they added. 																								Offenders will be produced in court for instant legal action.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								With few teachers showing interest in evaluating answer-scripts, the publication of results of the BA and B.Sc Part I examinations (honours and general) of Calcutta University (CU) hangs in the balance. 																								The written tests were conducted over a fortnight ago, but most of the scripts are still lying undistributed. 																								There is an acute shortage of examiners this year, especially in subjects that are studied by a large number of students. But we are trying our best to announce the results within the target date, said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs). He hastened to add: Students need not panic from now. 																								University officials said a large number of teachers who had already evaluated BA and B.Sc Part II (honours and general) scripts were refusing to mark the Part I answer papers.																								For instance, the university has around 300 teachers in political science. Nearly 150 of them have examined BA Part II scripts. 																								According to the universitys rules, a teacher cant be asked to examine the scripts of more than two examinations in a year. 																								So, if a teacher has already evaluated scripts of both honours and general examinations of BA or B.Sc Part II, he cant be forced to examine Part I scripts as well. 																								An official said more than 113,000 students had taken the Part I test (honours and general) in political science alone. Is it possible to get these many scripts examined by only 150 examiners? And even if we do so, the quality of evaluation will not be satisfactory. 																								The situation is identical in the history and education departments. 																								The teachers, on their part, complained that they were being asked to examine too many scripts. 																								If were to be engaged in evaluation duties most of the time, how will we catch up with our reading? Our lectures will suffer if we are not relieved of the burden of evaluating scripts almost round-the-year, a teacher pointed out.																								Rattled by the crisis, the university authorities are contemplating whether to approach the higher education department for penalising the teachers whove refused evaluation duties. 																								The university has already lodged a complaint with the principals of state-aided colleges against teachers who have not reported to their respective head-examiners for collecting the scripts. 																								A complaint has also been lodged with the state director of public instruction (DPI) against the errant teachers of government-run colleges. Many teachers have started reporting to their head-examiners after the complaints were lodged, said pro-vice chancellor Das.

 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Following the herd
																								The Red Curtain presents Eugene Ionescos satirical comedy, Rhinoceros. Performed by a group of promising young actors, this play humorously lays bare the follies of human behaviour. It questions the herd mentality prevalent in our society where it is always safer to fall in line with the herd than to break away from it. The play begins with people being gripped by panic as all those living in their town are turning into rhinoceroses. One individual, however, refuses to succumb to this tendency, and complications arise out of his resistance to follow the herd. With Dhruv Mookerji and Prithviraj Choudhury in the lead roles, this maiden directorial effort by Shuktara Lal literally has the audience in splits. An unusual plot, excellent acting and interesting stage devices together contribute to deliver the perfect ingredients for an enjoyable evening.																								When: Play in English, Rhinoceros, produced by The Red Curtain																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

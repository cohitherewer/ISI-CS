The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Factory hand finds, returns a lakh
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bhowmick: Honesty alive. Picture by Amit Datta																								Amritalal Bhowmick is a machine operator with a telecom factory on AJC Bose Road. His annual earnings fall far short of the Rs 1-lakh mark. So, what does Bhowmick do when he stumbles upon Rs 1 lakh wrapped in some paper and lying near the factory gate? Simple, he calls in the cops and hands all of it over, so that it can reach its rightful claimant.																								Honesty was not such a lonely word on Monday night, with Bhowmicks good deed after a hard days work. He was on his way out of the factory compound at around 8 pm for a tea break when he spotted the paper parcel in front of the main gate.																								I picked it up, but was unable to figure out what it contained. So, I went back to the security room and opened the parcel under the lights. And there lay a bunch of hundred-rupee notes. It was the kind of money I had never seen before in my life. I immediately asked the security chief of the company to call up the local police station, Bhowmick told Metro on Tuesday.																								When Nanda Dulal Pal, officer in charge (OC) of Hastings police station, arrived, he found Bhowmick sitting in the factory security office with a dazed look on his face. I remembered the words of my late father, who had always asked me to be honest and sincere. He would say that every man has his moments of weakness, but to overcome such moments is the best gift one can give oneself, he explained, asked what he was feeling like.																								Moments before Bhowmick, working at the central government factory for the past 25 years, spied the parcel, 22-year-old Tanmoy Santra had met with an accident on that spot.																								According to OC Pal, Sarkar was speeding down the road on his two-wheeler when he skidded and fell. Sarkar, an employee of a private iron store in Behala, was on his way back after collecting payments on behalf of his company. As he fell, his right leg got trapped under his motorcycle and he suffered a deep wound near the shin bone, added Pal.																								Sarkar was taken to SSKM Hospital in an unconscious state. When he regained consciousness in the emergency ward, the first thing he inquired after was the bundle of Rs 1 lakh he had kept in a compartment of his motorcycle.																								Nothing was found on the two-wheeler, but soon after, we received the call from Bhowmick. When I informed Sarkar about the money being recovered just before he was wheeled into the operating theatre, he was so relieved, recounted Pal.																								Bhowmick is happy that the money is back where it belongs. I have absolutely no regrets. If I find a parcel with an even larger sum again, I would do the same. I felt good when I realised how much trouble the young man (Sarkar) would have been in had he not got back the money, smiled Bhowmick, who has emerged as a hero for some of his colleagues.

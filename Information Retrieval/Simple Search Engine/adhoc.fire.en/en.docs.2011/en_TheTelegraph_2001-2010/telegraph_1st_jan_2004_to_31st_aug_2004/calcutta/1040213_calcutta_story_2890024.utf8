 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Bridge mix-up in mishap spurt
 A STAFF REPORTER The common confusion over choosing  the right flank on the approach roads to Vidyasagar Setu  claimed the life of a 35-year-old man for no fault of his.																								Uday Seth died on Thursday morning when a speeding jeep rolled down the wrong lane and collided head on with his two-wheeler.																								Seth turned out to be one of the victims on a day that claimed four more lives on the streets of Calcutta and Howrah.																								According to police, the resident of Padmapukur Road was riding up the right flank leading to Vidyasagar Setu at around 10 am, when a jeep came out of nowhere and crashed into him from the opposite direction.																								Seth was thrown off his vehicle and rendered unconscious. He was rushed to SSKM Hospital where he was pronounced brought dead. The jeep was impounded but the driver fled the spot and is absconding, said a Hastings police officer.																								Police later claimed that there was a no entry sign at the base of the flank that the jeep had taken. That the notice might not have been prominent enough was left unsaid.																								Early in the morning, making a mockery of the traffic awareness week, a lorry rammed into another vehicle before slamming into the traffic booth set up by the Howrah police. It then crashed into an adjoining medicine shop near the Salkia four-point crossing on Grand Trunk road. Two pedestrians were killed.																								The lorry was moving at breakneck speed and after colliding with a Tata Sumo coming from the opposite direction, it lost control. The unidentified victims were passing the booth when the lorry ran them over. The two were rushed to T.L. Jaiswal Hospital in a critical condition and later succumbed to their injuries, said Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police, Howrah.																								Police impounded both the lorry and the Tata Sumo, and detained the drivers.																								Also on Thursday, an unidentified body with multiple injuries, which was recovered from the Jorabagan area and was initially suspected to be a murder victim, turned out to be another hit-and-run case. According to deputy commissioner of police, detective department, Soumen Mitra, the body was found at around 5.30 am the crossing of Strand Road and Brajagobindo Saha Lane.																								Tension ran high as residents suspected that the person had been murdered. But later it was revealed that the unidentified man was hit by a speeding vehicle. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said Mitra.																								In the fourth mishap of the day, an unidentified woman was run over at around 12.10 pm, near the Brabourne Road-Lucas Street crossing in the Burrabazar area by a minibus. The 25-year-old was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where she was declared brought dead. The driver fled, local police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Vessel awaits water level to set sail
 A STAFF REPORTER																								MV Nicobar is set to sail, after all, water level willing.																								After three days of being docked by Citu-led protests over a dues dispute  and after 756 passengers have disembarked  the Port Blair-bound vessel was finally nudged out of troubled waters by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office on Monday.																								If Sundays deadlock had left the crew with a sinking feeling, Monday found Captain Manoj Kumar gearing up to welcome his passengers back on board.																								I can finally heave a sigh of relief and sleep peacefully. The ship will finally set sail for Port Blair once the water level touches 6.5 metres, revealed Kumar.																								The port authorities have tentatively fixed April 29/30 for the ships departure, earlier scheduled for April 23.																								Under mounting pressure from the shipping agencies, S.A. Ahmed, special secretary to the chief minister, had called an emergency meeting at Writers Buildings on Monday.																								Representatives from the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), along with the MV Nicobar captain and Sadhan Kanjilal, general secretary of the agitating Citu-backed Forward Seamens Union of India, met Ahmed and other officials around 11 am on Monday.																								Kanjilal, on behalf of the 24 agitating staff members, agreed in principle to accept a proposal to extend their contract by another month. 																								We have decided to accept the governments advice and go in for negotiations during this 30-day period. The ship can now sail to Port Blair with the 24 seamen on board, said Kanjilal.																								A three-member team from the Directorate of Shipping Services (DSS) of Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration in Port Blair, meanwhile, arrived in town on Monday to hold talks with the government.																								The immediate concern was the fate of over 1,200 teachers from Bengal and other parts of eastern India, who work in various schools in the Andamans and are scheduled to return home for the summer holidays.																								Every year, at least one voyage by the MV Nicobar is reserved for teachers who come back to Calcutta and other eastern Indian towns in early May, said a DSS official.																								The stand-off comes at a time when the port authorities are offering less stringent duties and concessions on all ships sailing to and from the Andamans.																								Apart from passenger-cum-cargo liners MV Nicobar, MV Akbar and MV Harshavardhan, four large cargo vessels ply regularly between Port Blair and Calcutta. This Citu-led deadlock has sent out very wrong signals. We hope they continue to send their vessels here, said a spokesperson for SCI, agents for MV Nicobar.

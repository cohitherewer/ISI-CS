 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Bludgeon find in Saha bedroom
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police on Thursday began  and successfully ended  a hunt for the blunt object that Shibendu Saha had used to bludgeon his father and brother on the head after poisoning them.																								Preliminary findings suggested that Shibendu had possibly used a nora (grinder). And a scan of the murder spot on the second floor of 91/3C Tollygunge Road revealed the nora lying next to a window grille in a bedroom  not in the kitchen, where it is meant to be.																								Sleuths also noticed a white powder on the sheel (stone slab), suggesting that something had been ground on it, possibly the poison dissolved in the bottle of the soft drink that was then served to the Saha family.																								Though police are still waiting for the forensic report, investigating officers believe the gamchha Shibendu used to tie his legs before hanging himself was also the one he had used to strangle some of his family members.																								In a curious twist to the tale, domestic help Soma Das admitted to her interrogators that she did not have the soft drink that Shibendu had offered her as she was not used to it.																								Yet, days ago, Soma had told officers from the local Charu Market police station that she had sipped on the soft drink after serving it to Shibendus sister Jayashree and her husband. Thereafter, Shibendu had asked her to put the bottle in the refrigerator. Post-dinner, she had been asked to fetch the bottle again.																								Police expect the forensic report on the nature of the substance used to kill the six members of the Saha family to arrive in 10 days. Once we get the report, the picture will be clearer, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department).

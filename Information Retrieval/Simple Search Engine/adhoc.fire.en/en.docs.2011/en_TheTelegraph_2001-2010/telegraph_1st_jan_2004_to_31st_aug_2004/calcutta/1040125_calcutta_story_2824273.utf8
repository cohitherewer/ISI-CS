The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Rain, chill return on weather radar
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcuttans can keep the woollens out. The light showers that started on Saturday evening are expected to continue on Sunday, causing a drop in temperature in the next few days.																								The minimum temperature recorded on Saturday was 19.5 degrees Celsius, about five degrees above normal. Alipore weather officials attribute this rise to the cloud cover and resultant humidity, which hovered at around 91 per cent. However, with the wind-speed building up, it is expected that the cloud cover would start drifting. With a clearer sky, the officials expect the humidity level to drop to about 56 per cent, leading to an immediate dip in temperatures around the city. 																								Even as rain looms large on the horizon, fog continued to pose problems for passengers on Saturday with trains from north India running behind schedule.																								In the city, a cable fault on the third rail disrupted Metro Rail services for an hour and a half on Saturday morning. Six coaches of a Dum Dum-bound train had left the station and two were still inside when the cable fault occurred. The train stopped without power. From 9.57 am, a truncated service was started between Dum Dum and Maidan, a Metro Railway spokesperson said. Normal services were resumed at 11.30 am.  Student kills self																								A 21-year-old student of Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur, Bisweswar Hazari, hanged himself from the ceiling fan of his hostel room on Friday. Authorities said he was suffering from depression. The body was recovered on Saturday afternoon and sent for post-mortem. Police said Hazari, a resident of Ghatal in West Midnapore, was in the third year. Cave-in: Gita Dey, 35,  died at Ultadanga on Saturday when the roof of a shop in  which she was working caved in.

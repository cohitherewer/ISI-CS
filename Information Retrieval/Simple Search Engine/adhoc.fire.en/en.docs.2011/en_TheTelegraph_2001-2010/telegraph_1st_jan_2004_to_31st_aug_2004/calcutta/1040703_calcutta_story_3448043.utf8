 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 At ease after verdict 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The message from the police force is clear: the Bapi Sen episode is a thing of the past and so is the need to keep a stern eye on the men in uniform.																								The strict stand taken by senior police officers following the death of the sergeant after being assaulted by five constables has been relaxed in the wake of the conviction of the accused.																								There has been no special roll-call session in the past two days in the Reserve Force barracks, the city police wing the five rogue constables belonged to. The headcount was carried out only once in the morning, just as it was before the Bapi Sen tragedy.																								The sergeants death  a brutal example of an indisciplined act committed by the personnel of a disciplined agency  had forced the Lalbazar top brass to initiate a process of enforcing a strict code of conduct in the force.																								We had called all officers and company commandants of the Reserve Force and given them a dressing-down. A special roll-call session was introduced at the barracks to check whether all constables were returning on time or not, recounted a senior official at Lalbazar.																								The shackles seemed to have lifted at Sulekha Building, the four-storeyed apartment that houses one of the Reserve Force barracks, where the five guilty constables used to stay, from Wednesday.																								We have been attending the roll-call sessions only once a day from Wednesday. And when we are off-duty, returning to the barracks at night is up to us, admitted a constable.																								The detective department, that has been investigating the death of the sergeant, is now gearing up to move Calcutta High Court.																								We have come to know that the family members of the five accused will be moving high court. We will have to be prepared, though we are confident that the verdict delivered by the city civil and sessions court will remain unaltered, said an official of detective department on Friday.

 SWATI SENGUPTA 				 	 The new brilliant green look of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. An afforestation plan has been drawn up to plant more flowering shrubs and ornamental plants on the boulevards of the citys vital corridor. A Telegraph picture 																								A greener city with cleaner and fresher air to breathe. With that end in view, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has drawn up a major afforestation plan for the city along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. More trees will be planted on Rashbehari Avenue, CIT Road and Narkeldanga Main Road, as well.																								The 16-km stretch of the Bypass from the Garia connector to Ultadanga will be covered with greenery, according to a state forest department plan. We are planning to plant grass and ornamental and flower plants on the boulevards, that are 1.8 metres wide on an average, along this stretch. A spot survey for the work has already been completed, said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests of the governments urban and recreational forestry division, on Saturday. 																								This move is prompted not by the state governments environmental concerns alone. The new brilliant green look for EM Bypass, that is emerging as the citys most vital corridor, is part of the state governments image-building exercise.																								Only stretches covering rotaries close to connectors and crossings are being left out as there are no boulevards there. These cover about one km and, thus, the total afforestation will be done along 15 km, Mukherjee added. 																								Now, the boulevards are mostly lying in a state of neglect, overgrown with shrubs and bushes as they are. We have to first clean up the boulevards and then begin the afforestation programme. We are hoping to get funds to the tune of Rs 20 lakh from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the state environment department, Mukherjee said. 																								Once the funds come through  as they are expected to very soon  the entire stretch can turn green by August. Three months is good enough time to do it, because June, July and August are the best months for planting trees with the monsoons round the corner, the deputy conservator of forests said. We are not planting large trees here, because we dont want to disturb the underground utilities, he observed. 																								At a later stage, trees might be planted at some points on either side of the Bypass. This plan will become clear once the widening  scheduled over the next two years  is completed, he added. 																								Besides the Bypass, 1,920 trees will be planted in several parts of north and south Calcutta as well. As per a high court directive, for every tree cut down, six trees must be planted. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had felled several trees to widen roads. To compensate for these, 1,920 trees will be planted in parts of CIT Road, Narkeldanga Main Road and Rashbehari Avenue. 																								There will be some trees on boulevards, but mostly along pavements on both sides of the roads, Mukherjee added. The CMC will pay for the work, that is going to be executed by the state forest department.

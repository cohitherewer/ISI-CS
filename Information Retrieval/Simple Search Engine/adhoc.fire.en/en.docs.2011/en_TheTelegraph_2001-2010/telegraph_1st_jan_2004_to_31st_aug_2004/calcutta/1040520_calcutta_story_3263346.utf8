Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ I have a small patch of garden in my house. I am extremely fond of plants and different varieties of flora fascinate me. As a result, I keep picking new varieties from my friends place or the roadside wherever I spot something that catches my fancy. Besides, I have plenty of cacti in my garden, which I understand is not too auspicious according to Feng Shui principles. However, I am extremely fond of all my plants. Please suggest corrective measures so that I can retain my cacti.																								 Ramesh Talwar, Calcutta																								A: There is no harm in bringing plants from your friends house with their consent. But avoid picking plants from the roadside, hospitals, cemeteries, prisons or from the house of a person you happen to dislike. Thorny plants like cacti do emit negative energy. However, if you really want to keep them, place two aromatic plants near every cactus. The sweet-smelling plants help reduce the damaging effects to a great extent. Cactus gets Feng Shui all thornyQ: My kitchen is in the west and the oven is placed beside the western wall. Of late, my inter-personal relationships have been deteriorating. Is it because of the position of the kitchen by any chance? Its not possible for me to shift my kitchen at the moment. So, kindly suggest other alternatives.Name and address withheld																								A: The location of your kitchen is fine as long as its airy, spacious and well-lit. 																								Arguments and clashes occur in the house when the oven and the sink are placed next to or directly opposite each other. In which case there should be a reasonable gap between the two that can be achieved by erecting a screen in between. Also, ensure that there is no mirror in the kitchen or outside reflecting the oven. 																								The oven in your kitchen, however, is incorrectly placed. This area is ruled by metal and lighting fire in the direction has an adverse effect on the future of children. Try to relocate it towards the eastern wall and cook facing the direction of the rising sun. Q: My bed is placed in such a way that while sleeping my legs point towards the door of the bedroom. It will be difficult for me to change the position of my bed immediately. Is there any other way to combat the negative consequences? 																								Name and address withheld																								A: The best position for a bed is to keep it diagonal to the bedroom door. Relocating your bed would be ideal, as Feng Shui does not recommend keeping it opposite the door. If you are unable to do so then the best alternative would be to either increase the height of the footboard, or keep a cabinet or a screen, so that it acts as a barrier between your bed and the door.Q: I study hard but I seldom get the desired results (DOB: 20.01.83). My house faces the east. Please suggest Feng Shui-friendly tips that will help improve my career prospects.																								Poulomi Ghoshal, Chandernagore																								A: Northeast is the ideal direction associated with knowledge and education. Thus it is advisable to keep this area of the house free of any clutter, especially your bedroom. Even a basket of dirty clothes or a wastepaper basket is supposed to emit negative energy. It pays to keep your room well organised to the extent that even the closets are not chaotic. 																								Place the study table in the northeast corner and sit facing north in a comfortable chair. Keep your books here along with a bright study lamp that will help you concentrate. 																								Do not introduce anything in your study area that depicts movement. Instead, keep something that symbolises stability. Try displaying artwork that is soothing and inspirational, like the picture of a mountain, a quiet place or a wise man.

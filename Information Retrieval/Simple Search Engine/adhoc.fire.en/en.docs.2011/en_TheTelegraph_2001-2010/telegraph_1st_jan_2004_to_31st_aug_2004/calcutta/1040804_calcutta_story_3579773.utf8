 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Rs 10 for jaywalk, 900 pay
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The traffic police on Tuesday slapped a fine of Rs 10 each on 900 jaywalkers at five road intersections. This was the first time since the fourth anti-jaywalking drive was launched on July 27 that errant pedestrians were fined.																								As part of the drive, school students with colourful placards can be seen campaigning at five points: the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass-CIT Road crossing, the Rashbehari Avenue-Cornfield Road crossing, the Mahatma Gandhi Road-CR Avenue crossing, the Sealdah intersection near Prachi cinema, and the Park Street-AJC Bose Road crossing.																								The objective is not to impose fines, but to make the people aware of the hazards of flouting traffic rules, said Arun Sharma, deputy commissioner (traffic). The drive was suspended over the weekend and on Monday because of the Trinamul Congress bandh. 																								In the first one-and-a-half hours on Tuesday, the cops booked 247 jaywalkers. The effect was spontaneous, said Prabahan Roy, officer-in-charge of Jorabagan Traffic Guard. Those who saw us booking the offenders hastened to the zebra crossings. 																								Given the fact that people are used to crossing the road wherever they want, it will be difficult to discipline them, deputy commissioner Sharma said. But if we keep up the effort, we can at least ensure that the main crossings are free from the menace.

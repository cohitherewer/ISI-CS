 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Bird flu fades in season of ballot amp; bride
 SANJAY MANDALThe price escalation 
(Rs per kg) is steep:
	Live birds
Pre-bird flu price: 45
Bird-flu phase: 25
Present: 60 to 65
Dressed chicken
Pre-bird flu price: 70
Bird-flu phase: 45
Present: 90 to 100
Boneless
Pre bird flu: 110 to 120
Bird-flu phase: 80
Present: 150 to 160What does it take to beat the bird-flu fear? Ballot power and marriage platter, for sure.																								The dual demand sparked by pre-poll programmes and biye baris has resulted in a strain on supply and a price rise to match a six-year high.																								Bengals poultry industry, yet to recover from the staggering Rs 2 crore per day losses suffered during the bird-flu phase earlier this year, feels that the demand-supply mismatch could aggravate in the days ahead.																								The present prices are the highest in the past six years, said Azmat Hussain, partner of National Poultry, in New Market.																								From New Market alone, 10,000 live birds are being sold to both retail and wholesale customers. The figure had nose-dived to around 4,000 during the bird-flu scare.																								The supply of live birds has gone down by at least 15 per cent compared with last year, but the demand has really risen in the past month, said P.K. Ray, managing director of Arambagh Hatcheries and spokesperson for the Eastern India Poultry Association.																								A large number of small and medium hatchery firms had to close down during the crisis triggered by bird flu. More than 35 per cent of those hatcheries have not been able to restart operation, causing a severe dip in chick production, explained Ray, adding that at Arambagh Hatcheries, too, production had gone down by nearly 20 per cent.																								With elections round the corner, wholesalers admitted they were finding it difficult to cope with the huge demand from political parties feeding their election machinery.																								Also, with the marriage season approaching its peak, after having started up around mid-April, a huge demand for chicken reshmi kebab, chicken tandoori, chicken gold coin, chicken pakora and other favourites has left catering services struggling.																								The hosts at several recent marriage gatherings have opted for mutton preparations instead of chicken because of easier availability.																								With the price of chicken so high, we preferred to spend a little more and go for mutton on the menu, said Raja Sen of Garia, who hosted nearly 400 guests at his daughters wedding on Sunday.																								Usually, 80,000 to 100,000 live birds are consumed every day in the city, sources said, with the figure leapfrogging during weekends.																								But with the marriage season peaking and pre-poll tempo picking up, the demand has increased by almost 20 per cent.

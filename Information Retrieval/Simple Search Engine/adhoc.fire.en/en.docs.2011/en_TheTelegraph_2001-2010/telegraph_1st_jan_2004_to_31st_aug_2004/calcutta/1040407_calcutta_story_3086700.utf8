 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 Life - Pick Of the week Not just dosas
Pick Of the weekPicture by Rashbehari DasDosas and idlis are just a tiny part of South Indian cuisine. Banana Leaf, which recently turned a year old, is trying its best to popularise the range of the treats that are usually ignored. For its birthday, the 72-seater Lake Market restaurant offered special items like Iddiyappam, Ragi Dosa and Kanjeevaram Idlis, and pineapple pudding to go with every order. A thali is priced at Rs 50 plus taxes and includes two sambars, rasam, two curries, raita, karakurumbu, fruit juice, papad, rice and puris. The choices of dosas and idlis seem endless, if you are ordering a la carte, from the cone-shaped Mandir Dosa steeped in white butter to the Onion Rava Dosa, Methi Dosa and Vendayam. The Appams are a great favourite. Mini idli bowls containing 14 small idlis dipped in sambar and the three-foot long Paper Butter Masala Dosa keep the restaurant house full.Prices range from Rs 16 for idlis to Rs 45 for a Cheese Butter Masala Dosa. The air-conditioned interiors are clean and simple, with Carnatic music setting the mood. The restaurant is open seven days a week, from 7 am to 10 pm. For those lucky enough to get a table after 6 pm, there are special dishes. On Mondays and Thursdays, customers can dig into fusion food like Dry Fruit Rawa Dosa, Puliyogare Rice, Gobi Masala Dosa and Peas Masala Dosa. Adai with Avial, Andhra Preserat, Dosa with Vada Curry are available on other days after 6 pm.Banana Leaf will soon serve vegetarian Chettinad dishes. We will introduce the dishes on a trial basis. If they catch on, we will include them on our menu, said B. Rajesh, owner, Banana Leaf.

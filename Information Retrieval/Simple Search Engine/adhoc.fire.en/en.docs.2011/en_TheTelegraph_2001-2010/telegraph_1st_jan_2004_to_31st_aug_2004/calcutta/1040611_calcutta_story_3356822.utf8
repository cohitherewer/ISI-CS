 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Sleuths fan out on killer hunt
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Almost 72 hours after the grisly murder was committed, the detective department of the city police took up the case of Rekha Chandok on Thursday. Immediately thereafter, sleuths interrogated the victims husband, Shibprasad Chandok, and got some vital clues from statements made by him that could lead them to the killers.																								According to Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), it was not possible to question Shibprasad all this while on compassionate grounds. 																								Rekha Chandok, 30, was killed in her Jorabagan apartment on Monday evening when she reportedly stopped Narendra Kumar Bagri, prime accused and her husbands cousin, from taking away cash and jewellery worth about Rs 13,000. Rekha was first strangled with the wire of an electric iron and then her throat was slit with the edge of a broken glass bottle.																								For the past three days in joint operations, officers of Jorabagan police station and the city detective department have carried out raids on Raja Katra, the Burrabazar area and in and around Teghoria, on the northern fringes of the city, to hunt down Bagri. As of now, we have rounded up a few of his friends but could not lay our hands on him, said an officer of the detective department homicide wing.																								During interrogation, Shibprasad made conjectures about the whereabouts of his cousin. 																								Narendra Bagri would always switch from one circle of friends to another when he was still considered just a spoilt brat. But all along, he kept in touch with Shibprasad, till he was driven out of his home. That is why we believe that he could help us find Bagri very soon, the officer added.																								I had not met him since he left his parents and started living with his friends. As far as I know, he has made friends with anti-socials operating in the Teghoria-Baguiati belt. Usually, these groups are hand-in-glove with promoters and building material suppliers of the area, Shibprasad told the police.																								According to the officer, Shibprasad has come up with a few names who could lead the police to Bagri. He told us that Bagri would, from time to time, contact him for money. Though it was always not possible for him to pay up, he did help him a couple of times. At those times, he had sent a couple of friends to collect the money. We have got a detailed description of the men, too, said another officer.

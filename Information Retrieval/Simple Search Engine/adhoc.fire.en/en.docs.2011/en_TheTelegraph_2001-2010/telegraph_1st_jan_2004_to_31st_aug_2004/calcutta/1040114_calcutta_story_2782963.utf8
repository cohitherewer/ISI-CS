 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Sinha spanner in Strand warehouse handover
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The governments efforts to commercially develop four warehouses on Strand Road, along the Hooghly, and preserve them as heritage structures, have been undone by the shipping ministrys decision not to hand over the 300-metre stretch north of Millennium Park.																								The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), current owners of the warehouses, will not hand them over to us. Instead, the CPT authorities will maintain and preserve the warehouses themselves, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Tuesday. 																								Shipping minister Shatrughan Sinha has turned down the governments request that CPT hand over the four warehouses  Armenian, Canning, Clive and Strand. I met him yesterday when he was here and he said he had decided not to hand over the warehouses to us. The CPT will do the work itself, Bhattacharya said.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had written to Sinha in December, asking him to instruct the CPT authorities to help the government develop the Hooghly riverfront and the four warehouses. The government had sought land to expand Millennium Park and beautify the stretch. Sinha had agreed to hand over a 300-metre stretch north of Millennium Park to the state government for development and beautification of the Hooghly riverfront.																								Bhattacharya did not elaborate on the state governments disappointment. The government took keen interest in the matter, and had been coordinating with the London Rivers Association (LRA). There are pending cases on illegal encroachment in three of the warehouses. It might be possible to commercially develop only one as of now, if the CPT wants it that way. The state governments primary objective was preservation of the warehouses as heritage sites. The idea was also to make people aware of the heritage value of the warehouses, he said.																								The government wanted to involve private parties to help develop the warehouses as commercial centres. The CPT will preserve and develop them adhering to the concept paper drawn up by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the LRA, the minister added.																								The riverfront regeneration project includes development of the stretch between Fairlie Place and the first Howrah Bridge approach, preservation of the warehouses and declaration of the area off BBD Bag a heritage zone. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has been disappointed by the Centres decision, an official said.

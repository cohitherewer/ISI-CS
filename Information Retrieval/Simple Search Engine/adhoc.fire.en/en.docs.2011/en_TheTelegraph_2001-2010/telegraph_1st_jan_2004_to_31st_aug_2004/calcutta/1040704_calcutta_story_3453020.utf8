The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 04, 2004 Next weekend you can be at...JUNPUT
Another Friday, another trip to Digha. Another weekend strolling the beach dreading a face from the city saying Imagine meeting you here!It was habit that took me to Digha almost every week and, over time, the seemingly meaningless banter with co-passengers on the bus was what I looked forward to. It was during one such journey that I met Nityananda, a government servant and resident of Contai. Chances are youll meet all the people you did not meet in Calcutta throughout the week, in Digha during the weekend, was his take on the tourist destination. But you will agree that we do not have much of a choice, I said.Have you heard of Junput? he asked, as the bus crossed the Kolaghat power grid. I latched on to the thrilling thought of visiting a place that was NOT Digha. Where is this Junput? I asked. His answer was drowned in an explosion that jerked the bus to a halt. Here, he said, casually picking up his bag and moving towards the door. SURVIVAL KITTorch

 Mosquito repellent 
 TowelsI followed him and heard him out as he gave me directions to the Contai trekker stand while the other passengers cursed the driver for the flat tyre denying them quality time in Digha.Contai is around 150 km from Calcutta and Junput 9 km on a trekker from there. This place is nothing like Digha. For one, I was the only visitor there. For another, the sea was placid. The only footsteps that led to the sea, through the casuarina forests, belonged to fishermen heading out to the deep. In the distance, there were lakes made by the fisheries department.For those who like the sea to look like one, its a 2-km walk to Haripur beach. There are sightseeing options, too. Half-a kilometer from Junput Resort are the Dariapur lighthouse and the Kapalkundala mandir. Legend has it that the kapalik (tantrik priest) brought Kapalkundala here to be sacrificed to appease goddess Kali. When the village lass was taken to the sacrificial altar, the priest saw the goddess in her. After two days of solitude by the sea, I was ready to head home. I have never met Nityananda since, and I might never be able to thank him for my secret beach.How to get thereCatch any bus to Digha from Esplanade or Howrah. Get off at Contai and take a private car, auto or bus to Junput ResortWhere to stayJunput Resort (Ph: 22101822)

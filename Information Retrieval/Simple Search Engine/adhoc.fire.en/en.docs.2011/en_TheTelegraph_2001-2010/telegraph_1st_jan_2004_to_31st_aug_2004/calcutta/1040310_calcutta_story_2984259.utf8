 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Doctors end hunger strike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Junior doctors of Nilratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital, who worked through Monday despite being on a hunger strike, called off the agitation on Tuesday, after senior health officials visited them and promised adequate security on the campus.																								Outsiders, helped by some group-D employees, beat up a few house-staff members on Sunday for protesting the sale of liquor in a hostel canteen. The protest led to the immediate closure of the counter but ignited the clientele. 																								Clashes followed, with several interns, house-staff members and post-graduate trainees getting roughed up, some in the emergency ward and in front of hospital officials and policemen. 																								Though the police later intervened, they have failed to arrest even one of the trouble-makers. This inaction led to the junior doctors hunger strike.																								The fast was called off on Tuesday afternoon in the presence of director of medical education Chittaranjan Maity, who praised the junior doctors for their bold stand against lawlessness on the campus. Police initially tried to shrug off the problem, saying they could not arrest any hospital employee without permission from the authorities. Superintendent Basanta Khan promptly dashed off a written affirmation.																								NRS doctors will wait and watch. The police should prove they are interested in improving the situation on campus. If they fail to net the trouble-makers, we will have reason to believe that they are in league with them, they said.

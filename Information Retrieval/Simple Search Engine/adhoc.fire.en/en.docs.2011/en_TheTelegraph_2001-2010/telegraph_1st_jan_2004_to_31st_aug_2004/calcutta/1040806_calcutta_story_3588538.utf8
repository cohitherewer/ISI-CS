 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Pin-blame scurry, 10 years on
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								When the stage is all but set for the execution of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, some criminal lawyers of Calcutta High Court want to find out why a rapist and murderer has not been hanged for 10 long years.																								We want those responsible for the delay to be punished. Justice N.K. Mitra, former judge of the court, had on February 23, 1993, passed an interim stay on the execution of capital sentence. But the state had been sitting tight for nine years, till the Supreme Court gave a stricture on September 2003, asking it to vacate the stay order immediately, said Partha Bhattacharya, an advocate of the court.																								He demanded that the judiciary direct a probe into the matter to identify those who did not approach the court to vacate the stay. It was the duty of the state panel lawyers to move the court, he said.																								Arunava Ghosh, another advocate, asked: Dhananjoy will be punished for his heinous crime. But what about those people who created legal problems by not performing their duties in time?																								Advocate Subroto Mukherjee said: I am seriously thinking of moving a case before the court, asking it what crime eight members of Dhananjoys family had committed to suffer mental agony for 10 years. This is only because of the callousness of the government panel lawyer. He stressed that Dhananjoys family should move court on this issue.																								Unlike the vociferous lawyers, representatives of the government are keeping mum and fobbing off questions. 																								The past is past. What is the need for a post-mortem? asked public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah. He said a series of petitions, either by Dhananjoy himself or by his family members, was behind the delay.																								Criminal lawyer Sailendu Rakshit disagreed. The public prosecutor is shielding his men. It is a fact that he had taken the initiative to vacate the stay after the apex court directed the state to execute the order to hang Dhananjoy. Some of his colleagues are responsible for the delay.																								He said a case can be heard by the court even after Dhananjoys execution to find out the culprits. He demanded that exemplary punishment be meted out to the guilty. Dhananjoys brother Bikash is waiting for a copy of the presidential order before proceeding to Delhi so his lawyer Colin Gonzalves can move a petition in the Supreme Court.

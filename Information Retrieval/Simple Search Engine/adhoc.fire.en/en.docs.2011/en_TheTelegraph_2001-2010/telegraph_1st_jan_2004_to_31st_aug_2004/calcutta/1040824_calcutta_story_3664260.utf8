 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Survival against all odds
																								In the midst of a turmoil that rages both without the human mind and within, the only saving grace is a determined struggle to ouster the harbinger of discord. Bhisam Sahnis Tamas is a journey from profound darkness to light. It is the story of those who were for long suppressed and tortured in the name of law and ordered to forsake their socio-religious beliefs to appease the ruling class. Set during Partition India, Tamas is the tale of the teeming millions who were subject to innumerable sufferings by the British, who were engaged in a diabolical power game to retain their supremacy over India. It gives an account of the socio-political complexities that dictated the lives of the people who fought to earn the freedom that for long evaded them. Tamas teaches us the lesson of survival against the odds. 																								Event: Play in Bengali, Tamas, produced by Shilpayan																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

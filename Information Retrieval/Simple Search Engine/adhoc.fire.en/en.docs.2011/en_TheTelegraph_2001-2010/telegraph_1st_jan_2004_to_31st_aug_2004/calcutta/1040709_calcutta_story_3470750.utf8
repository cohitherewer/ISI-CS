 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Cops zero in on murder accused kin
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								After interrogating Sampad Mukherjee and Arijit Pal for five days, the police suspect a close relative of the Mukherjees as the fifth person involved in last Fridays murder of 18-year-old Kuntal Sain. 																								Though we had suspected the presence of a fifth person from the outset, we did not think he would be such a close relative of the Mukherjees, police said.																								The fifth suspect is a government employee who had shifted from the neighbourhood a few years ago. He had returned only recently, to seek the familys help in bailing him out of a debt trap. 																								To provide him with the money and start a business of their own, Sampad and Pal planned to kidnap Kuntal and raise Rs 25 lakh from his father. Pal has confessed to making the ransom call. But they never waited till the deadline, which they had set for Monday, police said.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 A class to pass on lessons of life
				 	 Bashab ChatterjeeA Teacher to some, a father to others is this Good Samaritan. Bashab Chatterjee had to leave a comfortable life behind in Bangladesh when he came to Calcutta around 1970. But he carved a new life here for not just himself, but scores of youngsters too. He has since set up two NGOs and helped educate and make a better life for many children in need.																								The MA in Bengali from Dhaka University was a producer of childrens programming in Bangladeshs national television channel. Here, after completing a B.Ed from Calcutta University, he began teaching the under-privileged, first in Kanchrapara and then in Tangra.																								When I saw how hungry and needy they were, I started going from house to house in Tangra after school, offering my services as a teacher and giving them free books, recalls the 58-year-old. In 2001, he started Hriday Akash, with about 12 students. Now, there are 100 from Class III to X. Of the nine students who passed Madhyamik this year, a boy who doesnt have electricity at home got letter marks in three subjects.																								The youngsters are tutored and trained in cultural activities like theatre, mime and music. It is also a medium to pass on social messages to them, he adds. The NGO also has computers, and the children are taught by volunteers, some of whom were once students of Hriday Akash. It is run on annual sponsorships of Rs 600 per child. I have received a lot of help from people like police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty and wife of the chief minister, Meera Bhattacharjee, he points out.																								But this isnt the first brush with social service for the man from Garia. In the beginning was Shilpi Angan, now in its 28th year, a free academic and cultural coaching centre for children from his neighbourhood. 																								While teaching remains Chatterjees aim, his passion is culture and the performing arts. He had a theatre group, which was involved in numerous teleserials. But his pride was working with director Buddhadeb Dasgupta on the film Tahader Katha, where he helped with the script and assisted Mithun Chakraborty pick up the Bangladeshi accent. He then moved on to work with Childrens Little Theatre, organising props, costumes and everything in between for the shows put up by the group.																								His newest project is removing political graffiti from Tangra walls and putting up messages on malaria to educate the locality. 																								The father of two attributes his success to the woman behind it all  wife Suchita. I couldnt have done it without her support, Chatterjee smiles.

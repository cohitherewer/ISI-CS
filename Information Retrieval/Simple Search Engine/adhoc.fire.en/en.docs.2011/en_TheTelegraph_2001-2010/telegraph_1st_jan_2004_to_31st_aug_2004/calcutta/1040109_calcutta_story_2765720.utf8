 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 An oil on canvas by Ram Kumar																								Looking at Ram Kumars canvases, one wonders whether he had in mind Wordsworths observation on the nature of poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. While engaged in the act of painting, Ram Kumar seemed to do just that. As he contemplated nature, he had the rare ability of translating into a painterly language his vision of the beauty of the underlying scheme of things. With a very limited palette, confined to various tones of yellow, bright blues, soothing greens, viridian and white, he mapped out the blueprint, as it were, of hills and dales, crevasses and streams, bodies of water and streams. An exhibition of the 80-year-old artists works opened at Galerie 88 on Thursday evening.																								As Ram Kumar recalled the topography of a certain region, the fury and turbulence inherent in nature seemed to recede into the distance. In his minds eye, he could clearly see the contrasting planes of colour that constituted the terrain. The swells of a hill, undulating meadows or the soaring heights of a mountain are there. So are the vertiginous cliffs. 																								However, the transformative power of his imagination reduces these gigantic, heaving masses of rock and earth into thin layers of paint that from a distance seem to embody the philosophical calm achieved through objectivity. By consciously stepping back from the chaos, by allowing the dross to settle down, he recaptures with measured brushstrokes his understanding of the mysteries of nature.																								It was only after his masters in economics from St Stephens of Delhi that the artist had started taking lessons in art in evening classes at the Sarada Ukil School of Art. Later, he studied painting in Paris under Andre Lhote and Fernand Leger. Marked by austerity, Ram Kumar never goes in for vibrant or pulsating colours. His is a very grey world, as if soot had been rubbed into all the tones. Perhaps this heightens the sense of meditativeness.																								In his paper works, he uses brighter tones  even metallic colours. But he uses the blues and reds with such economy that they heighten the sense of seeing the bare bones of his compositions. Even when he had attacked Varanasi, the ancient town that he says refuted all logic, and that is so quintessentially Indian in its infinite variety, Ram Kumar captured the abiding sense of timelessness in this eternal city. He seems to have a deeply analytical mind that is capable of unravelling the most complex situations. As is so evident from these canvases, he eschews detail. Only suggestive gestures, obscure images, he said, and this, more than anything, captures the spirit of Ram Kumars philosophy.

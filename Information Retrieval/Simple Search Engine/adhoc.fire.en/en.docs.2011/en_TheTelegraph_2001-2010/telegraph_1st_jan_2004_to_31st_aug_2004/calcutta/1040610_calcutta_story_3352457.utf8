 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Wife choked with pillow
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Barely able to provide for his family, Bhabasindhu Halder, 43, smothered to death his wife Sumi, 32, early on Wednesday at West Kodalia, in Ghola, about 10 km from Calcutta. Halder is absconding and we have started combing the area, said Prasun Banerjee, sub-divisional police officer of Belghoria.																								The man had no stable job and with three children to feed, quarrels were a daily affair. At about 3 am on Wednesday, during a squabble, Bhabasindhu choked his wife with a pillow. Realising that she was dead, the man fled. Neighbours discovered Sumis body around 4.30 am. It was sent for post-mortem.

 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Neglect cataracts at vision peril
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In India, people in both urban and rural areas have a tendency to neglect problems relating to cataract. Blindness is the result if one does not go for treatment. Eighty per cent of the population above 65 has cataract. The lens tends to turn opaque with age, said P.K. Munshi, managing trustee of the Centre for Eye Microsurgery and Inter Ocular Lens (IOL) Implant.																								Our effort is also aimed to raise awareness about how cataract can be detected and why one should go in for a surgery, Munshi added.																								The centre conducted 25 free IOL microsurgeries for the rural poor of Bhagavatipur in the Sunderbans on Wednesday. The microsurgeries were carried out on the occasion of the 11th anniversary of Dr Nihar Munsi Eye Foundation. 																								According to Munshi, the aim of the organisation is to provide a support system to the common man for specialised eye treatment. 																								He said it was unfortunate that 80 per cent of the affected could not afford the cost of IOL microsurgery. That is the reason why we also have a fund for the poor.

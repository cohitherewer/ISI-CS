 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Howrah township on track
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government is determined to set up the integrated satellite township in West Howrah. 																								At least, the urban development ministers claims of having compensated all landowners displaced in the first phase of the project sounds optimistic.																								Slated to come up on 390 acres at the junction of Howrah-Amta Road and National Highway 6 in another seven years, the township project will be implemented by the Indonesia-based Salim Group, one of Asias fastest growing conglomerates. 																								State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said in the Assembly on Thursday: We are ready to set up the satellite township. But we want to ensure that we compensate each and every person whose land is acquired.																								Referring to the allegations by Opposition MLAs, including Asit Mitra of the Congress and Manju Basu of the Trinamul Congress, that the government is yet to provide compensation to many land-owners, Bhattacharya affirmed that each and every land-owner, whose land had been acquired in the first phase of the project, has been compensated. 																								An area of 17.65 acres was acquired in this first phase. The final phase of the land acquisition is still on. 																								In addition to providing compensation to the displaced land-owners, the township will also have a separate provision for the displaced persons, the minister reiterated.

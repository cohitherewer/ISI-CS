 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 English department bags centre of advanced study tag
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE																								Jadavpur University (JU) has another feather in its academic cap. Its English department has been crowned centre of advanced study by the University Grants Commission (UGC). 																								This makes the citys most-talked-about English department the first and only such centre for the subject in the country.																								The status is the highest possible recognition that the UGC can give to a department. The universitys English department has excelled in all parameters of consideration and has been upgraded to this status, N.K. Jain, joint secretary in charge of the UGCs special assistance programme, confirmed over telephone from Delhi.																								The institution was declared a centre of excellence by the UGC about three years ago. The present upgrade comes into effect from April 1, with English joining philosophy as another CAS department on the JU campus.																								The special assistance programme was a scheme introduced in 1963, keeping in mind recommendations of the government of Indias education committee, to facilitate a select number of university departments having some potential in research and teaching.																								The programme is meant to encourage the pursuit of excellence and teamwork in advanced teaching and research to accelerate the realisation of international standards, explained Ratnabali Banerjee, deputy secretary in charge of UGCs eastern regional office, adding that teamwork was a vital consideration.																								It has three stages  department of research support, department of special assistance and centre of advanced study  through which a department applying to the UGC has to work its way up.																								Teachers of the department, which has started the semester system along with the rest of the arts faculty from this session, are understandably delighted.																								We were the first English department to have been granted department of special assistance status by the UGC in 1991. The UGC was so satisfied with our work that we were allowed to skip the last stage of that programme and then promoted to centre of advanced study, said Sajni Mukherjee, head of the department.																								We will now enjoy direct assistance from the UGC for research, academic development and innovation, added the departments DSA coordinator Prof Supriya Chaudhuri, who will take over as coordinator for the centre of advanced study.																								As for the other English departments in the city, Calcutta University already has the department of research support programme running.																								Rabindra Bharati University, according to sources in the department, could not put together an application for the special assistance programme during the latest round of applications a month ago.																								Presidency College, once the most-sought-after department in the discipline, cannot apply for the recognition as it no longer has a teaching post-graduate (PG) intake. 																								The department did have PG teaching till 1997. We have applied to the government for full-fledged post-graduate autonomy, said Prof Jayati Gupta.

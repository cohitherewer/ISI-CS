The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 In CBI net for Rs 600 bribe 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Handcuffs and a possible jail term, all for Rs 600. This is the plight of a senior railway official.																								Divisional materials manager of Eastern Railway B.N. Prasad was caught in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) dragnet on Monday while accepting a bribe of Rs 600 from a supplier. The accused was caught red-handed from the building that houses the office of the divisional railway manager (DRM), Howrah.																								Last Saturday, CBI sleuths raided the residence and office of a Calcutta Telephones officer and recovered Rs 32 lakh in cash, besides assets worth Rs 52 lakh. Earlier, eastern region director of Airports Authority of India N.K. Puri and a senior customs official were also caught in the act of accepting bribes.																								CBIs anti-corruption wing had been tipped off on the malpractice at the DRM building in Howrah. We had information that Prasad takes bribes from his clients regularly, said a CBI official. The sleuths didnt inform railway officials about their plan. We quietly collected information on Prasad, before swinging into action, said the official.																								A team of CBI sleuths arrived in front of Prasads office, masquerading as visitors. The supplier used to provide computer parts, printers and other office equipment and every time, Prasad demanded a price, ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 25,000, from him, said a CBI official.																								But this time, he got unlucky, and for a paltry sum of Rs 600. As soon as the supplier handed over the money to Prasad, the detectives surrounded him. He is being interrogated and we are yet to ascertain how much money he has made through such coercion, the official said.																								The CBI has requested Calcuttans to inform the bureau of any malpractice at government offices over phone at: (033) 2240-9942 or 2240-9319.

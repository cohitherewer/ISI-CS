		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004  K.K. BanerjeeK.K. Banerjee								Director, National Library																																							It is unfair to block public access to heritage artefacts. If we can go to the Louvre in Paris and see the Mona Lisa without a hassle, why should we not be prepared to exhibit our national treasures for tourists? We have rare books in our collection at the library, like a copy of Babarnama or Warren Hastings impeachment records, which people can check out with prior permission. If such access is restricted, research as well as tourism will suffer. Some time ago, I saw the Nizams jewellery, which was showcased for months at Salarjung Museum as part of a countrywide tour. The security was impeccable. That is the way it should be.

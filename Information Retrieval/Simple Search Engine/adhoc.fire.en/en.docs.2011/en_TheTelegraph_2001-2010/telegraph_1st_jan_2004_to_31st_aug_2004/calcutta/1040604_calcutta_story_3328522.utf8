				 	 One of Kiran Uttam Ghoshs crushed creations																								If you thought coiffured hair and neatly pressed business suits were the order of the day, you may be cooped up at work for too long. Easy dressing is the buzz this season, with the slightly careless look defining chic.																								Riding the comfort crest is the crushed cotton skirt, enveloping some old world charm in its voluminous folds that is at once trendy when teamed with a spaghetti or a bustier. The dress up, dress down element of the garment seems to have captured the imagination of couture queens as well. Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh has a whole new line comprising crushed skirts called the Gota Collection. Ive used gota on the hem of crushed coloured mul skirts for an element of drama. Besides, I like to shape my skirts so that they drape the body and not just give the volume, says Kiran.																								Yet more designer chic sans shimmer can be sampled at Be:. Mainly Rajesh Pratap Singh lines, the skirts have been cut into 12 to 14 panels to give it shape as well as volume. Available in shaded and solo colours of sky blue, beige, yellow, green and of course, white, the skirts have been a rage, says fashion consultant and retail manager Be:, Indrani Basu. Weve completely sold out this season. Given the huge demand for the skirts, we hope to get another lot soon, she adds.																								This is the year of the skirt says Kiran. A year ago, I would rather wear a pair of trousers when going out. But this summer, skirts, especially crinkled ones, have made a comeback like never before, she adds.																								The reason for their popularity is their versatility. You can wear the same skirt to the office in the morning and dress it up slightly with a snazzy fitted top for a party in the evening, says Kiran. 																								The flexibility features in the east-west factor as well. You can treat the same skirt as a ghaghra with a little embellishment or as a western outfit when teamed with a tee, she says. The Indian chic element can be immediately transformed into an international look with a scarf, she advises.																								Foreigners, however, freak out on the comfort factor of the garment more than stylistic considerations. 24-year-old Vishal was seen scouting around for a crushed skirt for girlfriend Jenny based in Taiwan. Taiwan is a hot country too and these skirts are ideal for the weather, says Vishal. 																								Designer Seema, of the Swapan amp; Seema label seen shopping at Anokhi, swears by the easy maintenance aspect of the skirts. You can just wash and wear them without any hassles of ironing. In fact, the more crumpled the better, she said, while picking a block-printed skirt in multi-coloured stripes. 																								The grunge appeal rules various shops and hawkers stocking up on crushed cotton skirts in and around the New Market area as well. If you bargain hard you could walk away with sheer crinkled skirts in floral and animal motifs for as little as Rs 120, sometimes jazzed up with silver or gold threads. Tie and dye skirts in a variety of pastel shades and bright colours are quite a rage as well. 																								When it comes to turning up the glam quotient though, shimmer rules for the well heeled. June Maliah, spotted in her summery best at many a party about town of late, swears by Priyadarshini Rao and Aki Narula skirts in sturdy cottons. 																								Even though I live in cottons and linens in the scorching summer months, I am very particular about my cuts and things like colour fastness, said June, spreading the crush buzz around in a stark white Rao creation.

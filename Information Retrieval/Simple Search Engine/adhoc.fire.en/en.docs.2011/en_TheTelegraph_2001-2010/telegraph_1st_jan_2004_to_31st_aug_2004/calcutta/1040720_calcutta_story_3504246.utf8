				 	SOUNAK CHATTERJEE																	Is this 25-year-old, with a voice that has wooed a thousand ears. The Indian classical vocalist might have wanted to be doctor, and would have managed it, too, with 88 per cent in science in Class XII. But music is in his blood, and Sounak followed his heart. Countless prizes from school days could not be ignored.																									Were the gurus of the former DBPC student, like Ustad Mashkoor Ali Khan and Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan of the kirana gharana, and Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta. Having begun shahgirdh at age 11, the best promising talent in inter-school fests has graduated to the Ustad Amir Khan Memorial Award for the best vocalist. The student of ITC Sangeet Research Academy regularly works for organisations like SPICMACAY and Jagadis Bose National Science Talent Search.																									With a plethora of performances and awards in the kitty, has Sounak. Salt Lake Music Conference, Dover Lane Music Conference, All India Music Conference, Surasagar Music Conference, Dakshini Sangeet Sammelan, a recital for Medha at Ustad Ali Akbar Khan s residence and recently the Pratibha Utsav by EZCC  these are just a few, with accolades aplenty. The six-footer was also awarded the National Scholarship for senior students in Hindustani classical music, vocal, in February 2002.																									Is the CU graduate, having being invited to sing across the country, from Gujarat to Pune, and Ranchi to Mumbai, where he won the Suramani title at the Sur Singar Sansad last month. Has also performed on TV recently, as well as for Taal Tantra with Tanmoy Bose.																									Babam has, photography being one of them. Trusted Nikon camera in hand, the MA English student (correspondence course) shoots everything in his path, in technicolour and black-and-white. While reading is a hobby  Dickens and Shakespeare are faves, though Pather Panchali is at his bedside now  researching Rabindrasangeet he takes seriously.

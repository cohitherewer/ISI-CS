 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 ID cards for domestics
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Spread awareness, distribute identity (ID) cards and tailor uniforms  all to curb the crime count at residential complexes.																								Alarmed at the rising incidents of crime  from burglary to murder  with a domestic help link, Calcutta Police has, for the first time, started distributing photo-ID cards in a highrise under Shakespeare Sarani thana jurisdiction. A move to introduce uniforms for domestics has also been initiated. 																								Some new-age housing estates have already introduced the system of ID cards for domestics through private security agencies manning their gates.																								The past one-and-a-half years have witnessed a dramatic change in the attitude among servants taking to crime. Earlier, it used to be simple cases of burglary or robbery. But now, it has assumed far more organised and dangerous proportions, pointed out Subrata Ghosh, officer-in-charge, Shakespeare Sarani police station.																								During a recent meeting with city police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty, it was decided that a detailed database of domestics working in residential complexes would be maintained at the local police stations and photo-ID cards would be issued to them, added Ghosh.																								Cops from Shakespeare Sarani visited a multi-storeyed apartment block on Jawaharlal Nehru Road a few days ago and appealed to the residents to cooperate with them.																								The response was spontaneous and we immediately got down to work. On Sunday, we distributed 61 identity cards and notified the police stations of the areas these domestics come from to send us their antecedents, said Ghosh.																								According to deputy commissioner of police (south division) Anuj Sharma, the programme will soon be extended to other police stations. We are awaiting feedback from the people, but hope to introduce this in other areas by end-May, said Sharma.																								The first step, of course, is to create an awareness among residents and urge them to register the names of their domestic help with the local police station. 																								Two officers of sub-inspector rank and a dozen other personnel will be assigned a specific segment in each police station area to distribute the registration form, get it filled and then keep an eye on the domestics.

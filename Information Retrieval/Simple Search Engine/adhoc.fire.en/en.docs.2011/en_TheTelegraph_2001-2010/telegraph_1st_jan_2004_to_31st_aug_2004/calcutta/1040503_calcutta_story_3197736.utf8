The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 03, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The pool at Puddapukur has lost all its charm as some residents of the area regularly wash dirty linen and bathe in the water. Some even throw garbage into it. Its high time that other residents voice their protest against the pollution. 
	A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, Chandni Chowk Street. 
	An automobile dealer at the Alipore Road-Sterndale Road crossing has successfully encroached upon the entire stretch of the footpath and a portion of the road by parking cars on sale. Cops on duty just five metres away and those near Kothari Medical Centre are indifferent. 
	Tapan Pal, Batanagar.

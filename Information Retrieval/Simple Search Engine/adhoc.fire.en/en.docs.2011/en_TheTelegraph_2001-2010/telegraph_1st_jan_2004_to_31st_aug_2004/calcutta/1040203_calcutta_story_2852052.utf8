 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Business losses trigger suicide
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Prabir Santra, 42, committed suicide on Monday morning in his Lalabehari Thakur Road residence, in the Bowbazar police station area, by hanging himself in his bedroom. Preliminary investigations suggest that Santra was suffering from depression over losses suffered in his silk-screen printing business. 																								Police said Santras wife Tumpa, a caterer, was away from home on Monday morning. Santra sent his 12-year-old daughter, Mamoni, to the local grocers to fetch some eggs at around 8 am. Fifteen minutes later, Mamoni returned home to find her father hanging from the ceiling. Her cries attracted Santras brothers, who live in the same building, said an officer of the local police station.																								Asit Jana, a friend and neighbour, said: Santra was going through a rough patch over the past year. He attempted suicide twice  once by consuming poison and later by jumping off the roof of his two-storey building. His wife would keep a close watch on him. Her absence today resulted in Santra succeeding in killing himself, Jana said. 																								Another neighbour echoed Jana. Santra could not bear to be dependent on his wife. Tumpa worked hard at her catering business and was doing quite well for herself. Santra was also a habitual drinker and could not suffer the humiliation of having to ask his wife for money.																								A.K. Das, officer-in-charge of Bowbazar thana, said Santras body has been sent for post-mortem and an unnatural death case registered.

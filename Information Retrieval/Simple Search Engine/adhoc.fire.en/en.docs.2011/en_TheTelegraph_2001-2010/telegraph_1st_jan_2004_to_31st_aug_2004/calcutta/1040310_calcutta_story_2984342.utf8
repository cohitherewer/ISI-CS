 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 First verdict: life sentence
 																											- Fast track court sends man to jail for matricide on wifes testimony BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND TAPAS GHOSH																								The first judgment delivered by a fast track court in Calcutta sent a man who murdered his mother to jail for life, based on the testimony of the only eyewitness  his wife.																								Mohammad Wasim, 32, was handed a life sentence for smashing his mothers head with a pestle on October 6, 2002. 																								The crime, committed at the familys Phears Lane home at 3 am, would go unpunished, Wasim had thought, for lack of witnesses. Little did he expect Saphiya, his pregnant wife of a few months, to help bring him to book.																								Wasim, a small-time dealer in perfumes, had got married in the summer of 2002. But within four months of marriage, the profits from the family business plummeted, causing trouble at home.																								Matters came to a head when, on October 5, Wasim asked for money from his 60-year-old mother, Saleha. She refused. 																								You have wasted enough money. I cannot give you any more, she reportedly told her son.																								While everyone was asleep, an infuriated Wasim grabbed a pestle from the kitchen, sneaked into Salehas room, and struck her repeatedly, smashing her head. Saphiya rushed to the room and watched in horror, trying in vain to stop her husbands act of matricide. Saleha was taken to a nearby hospital, but was declared brought dead.																								The next day, Saphiya mustered up the courage to go to Bowbazar police station, where she filed a first information report against Wasim. Soon, police picked him up from their home.																								A few weeks later, a chargesheet was issued, and the case came up for hearing at Calcuttas fifth fast track court. 																								Yes, I can identify the murderer, said Saphiya, now the single mother of baby Saihan. He is my husband and he is standing in the dock, the court heard her say.																								The entire case hinged on Saphiyas testimony. I sometimes wonder what will happen to Saihan, but I have always stood up for what is right and I couldnt compromise here, Saphiya reportedly said.																								On Tuesday, after 14 hearings over eight months, additional sessions judge Madhusudan Dutta sentenced Wasim to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5,000 for murdering his mother in cold blood.																								This case will also be remembered because of the exemplary courage shown by a woman in helping the judiciary deliver justice, said Dutta.

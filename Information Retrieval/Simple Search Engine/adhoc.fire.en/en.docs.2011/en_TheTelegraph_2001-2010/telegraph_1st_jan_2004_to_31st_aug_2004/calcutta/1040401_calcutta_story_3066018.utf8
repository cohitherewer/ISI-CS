The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 01, 2004 Women on top in retail race

The contenders: The disorganised retail sector versus the national players. The weapons: Price, style, quality.																								Battlefield fashion is getting bloody, and the only victor possible is the consumer. With a feast for the brand conscious and budget watchers alike, the womens western wear market has split wide open.																								Allen Solly, Blackberrys, Weekender and Bare are just a few of the off-the-rack labels to look out for if Shoppers Stop or Pantaloons is your choice of destination. Made in Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong or China are the tags most likely to catch your eye if the markets are where you choose to take your shopping bag. It has never been so easy to look good.																								Ethnics have lost their stranglehold and western wear is the direct beneficiary. Pantaloons registered a growth of 35 per cent in the ladies western wear segment last year, says Rakesh Biyani, director, Pantaloons. 																								The Shoppers Stop experience in the city has been similar. Calcuttans are moving away from ethnic wear towards the convenience of western wear. So we have been concentrating more on this segment and are coming up with newer in-house brands, says floor manager at the Elgin Road store, Shampa Mukherjee.																								The smaller shop-owner hasnt lost out either. A slash in customs and import duties has also seen a host of importers flooding city shops with trendy, casual garments, mainly from southeast Asia. The cuts are chic, the finishes funky and prices lower. The Star: Raima Sen in a sequinned Mexican skirt and pink corset. The look is bold and I quite like it. Its different from what I have done so far, she says 
The Look: Funky but cool
 The Designer: Gauri Bajoria, diploma-holder from London College of Fashion. Her summer line of sequin-embellished cotton fabrics is in fluorescent shades of hot pink, orange, blue and lemon yellow. Its a simple style in loud and vibrant hues for the young, she says
 The Make-up Artiste: Prabir De has done up Raimas eyes with black and brown shadow to give them a squarish effect. A deliberate stark look to enhance the subdued appeal of the clothes. Picture by Aranya Sen  Youngsters today are extremely fashion conscious and demand the latest they spot on the tube, says Zuali Samtani, proprietor of Five Star, a New Market store. When import duties were relaxed a couple of years ago, it opened up a great opportunity, she adds.																								So for international trends, shoppers turn to the old hangouts. Few Indian brands offer low-slung, stretch jeans that are a rage with the disc-hopping crowd, says Kishore Punjabi of V2, New Market. Sundresses, hipsters, embossed T-shirts, sand-blasted boot-cut jeans, wrap-arounds, belts and bags are flying off the racks at its ongoing sale.																								Many of the smaller retailers are believed to be turning to the grey market for overseas supplies, and their bigger competitors feel this is the reason for their price advantage. If the so called importers paid the customs duties, it wouldnt be possible for them to sell the goods this cheap, says Rakesh.																								Shoppers are enjoying the best of both worlds. When I look for western formals, I head for either Pantaloons or Shoppers Stop as I get ample choice in terms of sizes and brands. But when its casual wear, I raid shops in New Market, Metro Plaza or AC Market for funky and cheap imported clothes, says Pooja Sharma, a college student, spotted at Metro Plaza.																								The range of styles and finishes in imported casual wear is its strength, feels Sunil Daswani, director Nu York. The local brands from Delhi and Bombay that we stock arent doing well as their styles and finishes are way below par compared with whats coming in from the international market, he admits. But local and established brands, he adds, score in terms of sizes.																								But the brands are also cleaning up their act. Allen Solly, Expose, Blackberrys, Colours and Life are experimenting a lot with fabrics and styles. Theyre offering comfortable and maintenance-free clothing in a mix of fabrics, says Shampa of Shoppers Stop.																								But while imports win in terms of latest styles and price, they lose in versatility. Sizes are largely tiny. Only the most avid weight watcher could hope to slide into most of them. Southeast Asian women are small. So, while women on the leaner side find ready picks in our imported selection, the average Indian woman may find it difficult to find an appropriate size, explains Kishore of V2.But much to the joy of the shopaholic  and the retail cash-registers  this tiny deterrent hardly casts a shadow.Pocket Wise

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Talk show boils over
 J. LoRaunchy music videos spiced up with love talk from two leggy girls. Saturday, 10.30 pm, on Tara Bangla is a cant-afford-to-miss date for several viewers in Bengal, Bangladesh and the Middle East. And the reasons are obvious. With Fully Fatafati Fantasy, sexy music videos and below-the-belt talk on the Bengali beam has never been so steamy.For the uninitiated, the show picks the choicest of videos  Dirrty Christina, J. Los jism , Britneys belly button, the thong things from the desi remix circuit plus a few Bengali pop acts, while Miss Bangladesh Shaon and city-based model Devdutta keep viewers glued with couch talk on interesting topics.																								The show is a mix of music videos, mostly requests from viewers, interspersed with interaction between the hosts. And the videos are those that people also get to see on MTV or Channel V, explains Sarbajit Chakraborty, vice-president, programming, Tara Bangla. The talk generally veers around love and related issues, and the topics are chosen from the letters viewers write us.																								But the love chat often gets too bold for comfort for the audience, and even the anchor. Certain topics do put me in a spot. Sometimes, it has been a comment by my co-host that has made me uncomfortable, confesses Devdutta, who along with Shaon, gives a peppy look and feel to the programme in noodle-strap tops, short skirts and Benglish. Designers Anamika Khanna, Komal Sood and Kiran Uttam Ghosh have been roped in to get the glam-gal look right.Miss Bangladesh Shaon
Though we often take up issues that many people cringe to discuss (read: masturbation to making out, vital statistics to virility), they are always relevant and are never portrayed in a titillating way, claims Devdutta.																								The feedback has been encouraging, with a fair share of audience response pouring in, even from Bangladesh and the Middle East. Youths comprise the bulk of our viewers, but some elderly people watch the show as well, says Chakraborty.																								So far, Fully Fatafati Fantasy has skirted trouble. Sometimes, we get letters and phone calls about episodes that viewers have found offensive, and we take the cue. But controversy is not a problem for us, he asserts.																								So, the Fully Fatafati flesh feast  for your eyes and ears only  is here to stay.

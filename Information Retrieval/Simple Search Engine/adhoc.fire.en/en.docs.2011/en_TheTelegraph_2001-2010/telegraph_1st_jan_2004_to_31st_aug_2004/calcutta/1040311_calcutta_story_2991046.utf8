 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Brownie points for bad cop
 															- Sergeant suspended in January for fleecing Sagar buses helps net carjackers A STAFF REPORTER																								It was the turn of a bad cop to do a good turn on Wednesday.																								Calcutta Police traffic sergeant Sumit Ghosh, under suspension for allegations of fleecing outstation bus-drivers returning from the Ganga Sagar pilgrimage not so long ago, helped nab three would-be carjackers on Wednesday.																								Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Harmanpreet Singh confirmed that this could earn Ghosh vital Brownie points. If later reports confirm what the preliminary reports have said (about Ghoshs involvement in netting the three student criminals), then this will obviously help his case, said Singh, referring to the ongoing proceedings against Ghosh.																								On Wednesday afternoon, Mohammad Salim, a dealer of cars from Kidderpore, refilled the cash-card on his mobile phone and drove down to a popular eatery along the Strand. After grabbing a bite, he returned to his air-conditioned Esteem, ready to head home to Karaya.																								Four friends from Bhowanipore, however, had other plans. Just as Salim opened the door, they surrounded him, shoved him aside and tried to get into the car. Salim fought back against the four  with one chopper between them  and even managed to raise an alarm. A snag in the central-locking system also helped foil the students getaway.																								Who would walk by then but suspended Vidyasagar Traffic Guard sergeant Ghosh. Salims screams drew his attention to the carjacking bid. He opened the right rear door and tried to drag the culprits out. But he was outnumbered. It was one of his colleagues (Mohammad Islam), on his beat, who heard Ghoshs shouts and rushed to his aid. He, too, got into the car and, along with Ghosh, managed to overpower the youngsters.																								Islam held on to two of them and Ghosh collared another, but the fourth managed to flee. All of them were residents of Bhowanipore  B.Com graduates Sanjit of Lansdowne Road and Sandip of Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, Class XII student Subhajit of Bakulbagan and Samik (who managed to flee).																								Suspended in January for allegedly stopping Madhya Pradesh-bound buses from Ganga Sagar on Diamond Harbour Road and then extorting money, Wednesday provided Ghosh with a chance to redeem himself He might well have made the most of it.

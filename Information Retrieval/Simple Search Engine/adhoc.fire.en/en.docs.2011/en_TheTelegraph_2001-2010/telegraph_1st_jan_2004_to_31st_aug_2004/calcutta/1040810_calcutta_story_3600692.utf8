The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Indian summer in Hollywood
 Reese Witherspoon, the Vanity Fair star																								The Village, Vanity Fair, Touch of Pink, Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. Four films with one thing in common  the strong India connection.																								Manoj Night Shyamalan, Mira Nair, Kal Penn and Jimi Mistry. Four names that keep popping up in the filmi spotlight (met with varying degrees of excitement, of course). The two directors are clearly a class apart  Shyamalan went straight to the Hollywood A-list with The Sixth Sense and Nair has broken new ground and commercial records with films like Monsoon Wedding.																								The actors, too, have canned creditable films  Mistry in The Guru and The Mystic Masseur, Kal Penn with Van Wilder and American Desi. All said, the India clamour is getting harder to ignore.																								So need we wait for our stars (think Ash, think Ash again, think Ash some more) to make it in their films?																								Lets start with the hottest. The Village opened big, and is still going strong at the US box office and its creator, the 33-year-old Shyamalan, could not be happier.																								After The Sixth Sense in 1999, there has been no stopping the man born in Pondicherry. While he has not really delved into Indian themes (India flashed momentarily in Signs, the Mel Gibson-starrer about crop circles), his position as one of the finest young directors has been cemented. Drawing comparisons with Hitchcock for his superb touch with suspense, Shyamalan looks set for a long reign.																								On to another filmmaker. Mira Nairs Vanity Fair, based on the William Thackeray classic, is set for a September 1 release. Shot in England and India, the film has Reese Witherspoon in the lead, playing the social-climbing Becky Sharp, alongside Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Gabriel Byrne and Bob Hoskins.Nair, who was based in Delhi before heading out, may have avoided the mainstream, but shes had her share of acclaim, winning a best foreign film Oscar nomination for her first feature Salaam Bombay! She has continued to explore Indian and cross-cultural themes, with projects like Mississippi Masala and Monsoon Wedding. Jennifer Lopez and Cher at the premiere of The Cell; (above) a scene from The Village Not to forget producer-director Ismail Merchant, who has a number of high-profile projects lined up including The Goddess, with Tina Turner as the lead. This, after last years rather tedious though big-ticket film Le Divorce (Kate Hudson and Matthew Modine).Tarsem Singh (remember Jennifer Lopez in The Cell?) is also on to his next venture, this time laced with Indian elements. Not only is it being shot in India, the cast includes Bollywoods bad man Gulshan Grover, also featuring choreography by Bosco and Caesar, who first came to the fore with their striking moves in Vidhu Vinod Chopras Mission Kashmir.																								In front of the camera, however, there have been fewer faces, and more stereotyping. Kalpen Modi in Hollywood could only become Kal Penn. The New Jersey-born 28-year-old was in American Desi, the hit comedy Van Wilder and a host of TV shows, including ER, NYPD Blue and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.																								Last months Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle may have bombed at the box office but it was well received critically. This year, he is scheduled to appear in two more films  The Arrangement and Dancing in Twilight.																								From the other side of the Atlantic, Jimi Mistry is also a notable talent. The star from Scarborough starred in The Guru (with Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei) and was noticed in East is East. This year has been busy for him, with the release if Things to Do Before Youre 30, Ella Enchanted and Touch of Pink so far, and Partition, Dead Fish and The Truth About Love lined up.

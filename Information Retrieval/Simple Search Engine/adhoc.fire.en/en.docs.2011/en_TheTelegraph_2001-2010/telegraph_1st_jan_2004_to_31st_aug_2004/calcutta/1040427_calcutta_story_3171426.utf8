The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Return to Rajus alma mater
																								He is 30-plus, going on 20-minus! So, its hardly a problem for Shah Rukh Khan to keep going back to college.																								A proof of the age-no-bar attitude lies in the superstars schoolboy-like obsession with cricket. He got a dish antennae specially installed in a remote Maharashtra village where he was shooting during the India-Pakistan series because he couldnt possibly give the cricket a miss. I watched all the matches, Shah Rukh told The Good Life over the phone.																								The cricket-crazy King Khan is back in the classroom this Friday  sporting old-fashioned bell-bottomed pants and full-sleeved shirts  for choreographer Farah Khans debut directorial venture Main Hoon Na.																								My character returns to college after many years. A lot of things have changed since, but he belongs to another era and sports the fashion of the times he grew up in  the late 70s and early 80s  just as I myself have, said Shah Rukh.																								The setting is Darjeeling, the small hill town where 12 years ago the Bollywood Badshah had shot for his first big break  as a callow engineering graduate in Aziz Mirzas Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman  and now returns as an armyman with a mission in the garb of a college guy.																								I became very nostalgic during a shot at the railway station. It was exactly the same place where a scene in Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman had been canned. St Pauls School, where the college scenes were done, was also a nice experience as Raj Kapoor had shot there for Mera Naam Joker, said the actor.																								Being directed by Farah Khan was nothing novel, felt Shah Rukh, as the two have been working together for the past 10 years. 																								It was only a logical start for Farah. I have grown up on masala films of the 80s and so has Farah. We wanted to make Main Hoon Na a masala film, which is a genre by itself, by packing in drama, romance, comedy, action and even patriotism, said Shah Rukh about his second lady director (after Hema Malini in Dil Aashna Hai) and her debut vehicle.																								The other woman calling the shots is wife Gauri, Main Hoon Nas producer.																								Though his role seems to carry shades of Kal Ho Naa Ho and Mohabbatein  mediator-soothsayer-messiah  Shah Rukh slammed the door on any talk of stereotyping. They are different characterisations. For an actor, understanding the nuances and getting into the journey of knowing the character is quite difficult I know how difficult it is.																								After finishing work on two films under production, the actor promised to take a break for a full four months.																								And if theres cricket on telly, you know where to find him.

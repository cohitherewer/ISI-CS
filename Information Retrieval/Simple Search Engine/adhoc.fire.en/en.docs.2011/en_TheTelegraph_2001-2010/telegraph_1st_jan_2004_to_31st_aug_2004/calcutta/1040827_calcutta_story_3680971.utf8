 															- delhi, mumbai, Bengal art juxtaposed SOUMITRA DAS																								Its impact on the Indian economy is a matter of debates. But the effect of globalisation, even in its more superficial manifestations, is clear from the juxtaposition of artists, mostly young, from Mumbai, Delhi and Bengal at the exhibition Concepts amp; Ideas that opened at CIMA Gallery on Thursday. 																								Mumbai always closer to the West both in geographical and cultural terms, is constantly bombarded by media images, some emanating from its very own concoction named Bollywood. The artistic community of the countrys financial capital being more mobile is exposed to influences that reach its shores long before they do elsewhere in the country. Artists in New Delhi began with a clean slate. But being the power centre, it developed its own dynamics. Artists in Bengal have retained their famous sensitivity, but they refuse to or are unable to cast away the baggage they have inherited.																								Chintan and Hema Upadhyay are a young couple from Mumbai whose works are prominently displayed. Chintan builds up his images entitled Designer Babies based on his ideas of genetic engineering. These monstrous children of indeterminate sex wearing body suits of Indian miniatures are slick and market-oriented images, as the artist himself admits  an inevitable product of Mumbais very business-like ways. Hema draws on personal experiences for her works. She incorporates her own photographs in these to drive home the point. These have that international look that could belong anywhere.																								The works of Anjum Singh of Delhi have the direct impact of road signs. She uses hot pinks and reds that are said to be Indian in their tonality. Where the so-called international look is concerned, the sculptural pieces of Calcuttas Partha Pratim Deb certainly have that distinction. Some of his titles are borrowed from the names of internationally popular TV channels. But the way he employs a traditional craft like terracotta and uses several layers of pigment to create a patina-like surface immediately connects him to his roots without harking back to the past in any obvious way. Here is an artist who has refused to abandon his strong sense of identity to pander to the demands of the market. He has the courage to be idiosyncratic at a time that encourages cloning. The two other Bengal artists, Sumitro Basak and Shreyasi Chatterjee (who uses embroidery), too, have the sense of rootedness, albeit without Debs innovativeness. Deb is global. He is also local.

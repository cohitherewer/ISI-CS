 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Doctor mail, manage divorce
 SAMARPAN DUTTA																								Log into your spouses e-mail account to log out of a marriage.																								Sending lovey-dovey messages or obscene mail, on the sly, from your husband/wifes e-mail account to a fictitious lover and then filing for divorce on grounds of infidelity is a growing concern.																								Asish Banerjee, an engineer working in the US, fell in love with non-resident Indian Sanjukta (names changed) in early 2001. Sanjuktas family moved back to Calcutta that year and in December, the two got married and then returned to the US.																								Within a year, Sanjukta was back home, as Asish allegedly got involved in an extra-marital affair. Later, Asish returned to Calcutta and slapped a divorce case in the high court, alleging that Sanjukta was involved with a youth in Saudi Arabia.																								He produced a series of letters from her e-mail account to the lover as evidence. Sanjukta denied the allegations.																								Filing of divorce cases on grounds of alleged extra-marital affairs is becoming a trend and there are quite a few instances of this. Usually, one has ready access to the e-mail account of ones spouse, said Joymalya Bagchi, a practising high court lawyer.																								Sending spam and obscene mail to an account created by the person from the spouses account is easy On the flip side, people have also filed for defamation to prove their innocence in such cases, he added.																								The case of another wife victim has come to light. The woman, from Park Circus, had similar allegations of infidelity levelled against her by her husband, a businessman in New Alipore. It was an arranged marriage. The youth was tall and handsome and the girl was beautiful. Relations between the two soured within a couple of years, when the youth developed an inferiority complex, said an official of the high court.																								He later filed for divorce, alleging that his wife did not possess a good moral character and as evidence, produced letters allegedly written to an unidentified lover.																								According to Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, a practising lawyer, whether these documents can be placed as evidence before the bench is currently under consideration.																								We expect a decision to be reached on the issue soon, as in recent times, technical props such as video conferencing have been acceptable by the apex court to record evidence, Chatterjee added.																								And with the menace of doctored mail now driving a wedge between marriages and providing a contentious escape route, legal circles are convinced that a firewall must be put in place.

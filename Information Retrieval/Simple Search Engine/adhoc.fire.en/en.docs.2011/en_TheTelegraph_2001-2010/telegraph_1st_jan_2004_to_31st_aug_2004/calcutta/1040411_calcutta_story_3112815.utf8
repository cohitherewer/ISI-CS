 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Forum for consumers cuts red tape 
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Tapan Banerjee, a school teacher of Garia, lost his 25-year- old daughter in 1996. Rajashree died in a private hospital in the city after a kidney transplant. 																								A year after his daughters death, Banerjee filed a medical negligence case in the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC). There was a pile of cases pending with the commission, leading to a huge backlog of appeals. Nearly 2,500 appeals, along with revision petitions and original cases, are now awaiting hearing.																								There is now some good news for Banerjee and others like him. The SCDRC has decided to take some specific steps to speed up the hearing process and dispose of the pending cases at the earliest. A meeting of the commission, chaired by its president Moloy Basu, decided to share duties among its three bench members. Matters relating to service notices and filing of the written version would henceforth be directly accepted by Shilpi Majumdar, a member of the commission, at her chamber. Earlier, these documents would have had to be submitted to the court officials, leading to procedural delays.																								The ready appeals, revisions and original cases are also being taken up for hearing by a bench comprising the SCDRC president and the third member, Debabrata Karforma. A particular hearing will now take less time and enable us to handle more cases, said Majumdar. 																								Complainants and defendants are now being directed to file written arguments in brief in place of lengthy verbal arguments. Commission members, after studying the written statements, would ask some key questions to the contesting parties and arrive at a conclusion.																								According to officials, the decision is inspired by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions move to dispose of pending appeals quickly. The national commission, which is plagued by a huge backlog as well, has set up an extra bench for disposal of cases. The decision was taken a few months back.																								Earlier, the national commission had a five-member single bench but now it has two. One bench comprises M.B. Shah, president of the commission, and another member, while the second one has a retired high court judge, as president and two other members.																								Both consumers and lawyers have hailed the state commissions decision. The measures are bound to have a salutary effect. We hope that the consumers now would not have to wait for years for redressal of their grievances, said Prabir Basu, president of Consumer Lawyers Association.																								Matters relating to medical negligence top the list of the pending cases, officials said. These require considerable time since reports from medical experts and contemporaneous medical documents and literature are considered essential. 																								Cases relating to deficiency in service in providing electricity, matters relating to inflated bills and new power connections as well as disputes regarding telephone, insurance and other service providers comprise another bulk.

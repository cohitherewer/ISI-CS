 Model Reshmi sports a VILAE outfit. Picture by Rashbehari Das When it comes to style, the city doesnt seem to lack young talent. The newest kid on the boutique block is Stuti Modi, who after dabbling with designs for the last couple of years launched her own label and fashion studio called VILAE this week. The Elgin Road boutique offers ethnic as well as westernwear for both men and women.																								I have joined hands with my aunt Lakshmi More who owns a four-year-old garment export firm, Cocoon Exim (P) Limited. We have been exporting our designs to many countries after testing waters in Bangalore. The new label VILAE is our joint venture, exclusively for the Calcutta market, said Stuti. 																								The ethnic collection comprises salwar kameezes, saris and kurtis, which feature funky innovations. One of these is the skirt-sari, which is a ready-to-wear skirt with an attached pallu that can be draped as a sari. 																								Stuti is particularly passionate about her nightclub wear line which comprises trousers and tops in unusual shapes and designs. 																								While the western line is priced from Rs 600 onwards, the ethnic collection comes for a higher price. The salwars range from Rs 800 to Rs 4,000, while the saris cost between Rs 3,500 and Rs 5,000. The menswear line offers regular and partywear shirts and kurta shirts, priced from Rs 300 onwards.																								Fabrics include handwoven silks, cottons and linen apart from georgettes and crepes.

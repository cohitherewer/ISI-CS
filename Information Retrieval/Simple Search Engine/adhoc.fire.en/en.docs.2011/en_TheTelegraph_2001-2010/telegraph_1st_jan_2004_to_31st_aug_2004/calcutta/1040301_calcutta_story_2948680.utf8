																								Abstraction in art is the dictum of the day for contemporary artists; an abstraction that encapsulates both space and colour. The beauty of it lies in the strongly individualistic interpretations of this very abstraction in different artists. And when an exhibition showcases the personalisation of the abstract by eight geniuses, each a stalwart in his own right, it is nothing short of a visual bonanza for connoisseurs of art and novices alike. The eight artists represented at Galerie 88 are SH Raza (whose Sreekundalini features above), Ram Kumar, Ganesh Haloi, Prabhakar Kolte, Sujata Bajaj, Laxman Shreshtha, Akhilesh and Seema Ghurayya. Indias was a late awakening to the milieu of abstaction in art. Even in the works of the great masters, Raza, Kumar and Haloi, can be traced an inward journey from the fringe to the still centre, a journey from the literal to the abstract. It is only with Kolte that Indian art finally makes a foray into an internalised world of unadulterated expression firmly planted in the universal tradition of abstract art.

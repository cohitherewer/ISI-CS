 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 11 clinics slash test rates
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a bid to take some load off the state-run hospitals, 11 private hospitals have stepped in to offer slashed rates on diagnostic tests. 																								The subsidised rates, much lower than the usual, will vary between 40 and 70 per cent. The rates will be the same at all the 11 hospitals, said Sajal Dutta, president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), the umbrella organisation of the 11 hospitals, on Monday.																								The 11 hospitals are Advanced Medicare amp; Research Institute (AMRI), Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Belle Vue Clinic, BM Birla Heart Research Centre, Calcutta Medical Research Institute, Kothari Medical Centre, Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre, Ruby General Hospital, Westbank Hospital, Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute and Woodlands Hospital and Medical Research Centre.																								Those referred by medical officers of state-run hospitals on outdoor-patient tickets will be eligible for the scheme, starting March 1. AHEI officials said there was no bar in the number of patients availing of the facility.																								The AHEI has been in talks with the government for the past six months. We had several rounds of talks before pegging the discount rates, said Rupali Basu, joint chairperson of the organising committee of the three-day health fair, beginning on February 13. 																								To start with, around 100 tests will be conducted at the hospitals. The number will be increased later, Basu added.																								Dutta said all the 11 hospitals had the infrastructure, equipment and manpower to cope with the additional flow of tests. If required, we will instal more equipment, he said, adding that more such amalgamation of hospitals was needed to boost healthcare services in eastern India. 																								This is the first time such a thing has happened in the country, said an AHEI official.

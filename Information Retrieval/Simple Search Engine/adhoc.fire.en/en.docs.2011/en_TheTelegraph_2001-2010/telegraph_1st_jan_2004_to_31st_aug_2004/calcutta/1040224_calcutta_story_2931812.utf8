 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Mayors deposit leash on promoters
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic authorities said on Monday they were planning an amendment to the building rules to make developers more accountable for their constructions.																								We have decided to bring the builder under the scanner, in view of the construction boom in and around Calcutta, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. There is no way we can stop the boom, but we can certainly ensure that only genuine builders are in the market. 																								As a first step, the civic authorities will collect deposits on a pro rata basis from the builders at the time of according sanction to their plans, Mukherjee said. 																								The deposits will stand guarantee against any violation of rules, such as incomplete construction, non-payment of taxes, poor drainage and water facilities.																								The security deposit at the rate of at least Rs 150 per sq ft  will be refunded to the promoter along with the completion certificate by the civic body.																								The same will stand forfeited if a promoter is found to have handed over possession of apartments or built-up spaces without obtaining the all-important completion certificate from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 																								In the event of a forfeiture, the promoter will be blacklisted automatically and not be allowed to carry out construction in the city in future. 																								The CMC will issue a completion certificate after conducting an inspection within two weeks of the application. And if it fails to supply the completion certificate within two weeks without assigning any valid reason, the promoter can claim a refund of the sum deposited by him, elaborated Mukherjee. 																								According to the civic bodys deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh, also officer on special duty to the mayor, the CMC receives complaints daily against promoters regarding quality of construction, deviation from the plan sanctioned by the CMC, roof rights, lack of drainage facilities, mutation problems and so on. 																								By the present building rules, a promoter plays a key role in getting a construction proposal sanctioned from the CMC, carrying out construction and selling the flats. 																								Since a promoters involvement in particular project is temporary, the buyers of the apartments cannot seek him out to resolve any complications that may arise in future.

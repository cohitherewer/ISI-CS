The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Fond thoughts on the waterfront, aboard the Ahalya
Metro matters / Uttam Sengupta																								The invitation to a cruise on the river was too tempting to resist. If one had any misgivings, it was related to the questionable wisdom of boarding the boat at 6 pm with the knowledge that it would not return before 12.30 am. 																								Six hours on the river appeared a little too daunting and several colleagues backed out, certain that they would have been better off if only they had a chance to get off the boat at some point. Some colleagues were warned by better halves against catching a chill and, thus, only around 35 bravehearts finally scrambled up the launch Ahalya.																								It turned out to be a beauty of a double-decker, with a large air-conditioned lounge on the upper deck. It is also, apparently, the only launch in which you are allowed to cook and keep food warm. Its a pity that the launch is currently used only on weekends from Millennium Park. Various groups do hire the vessel for a cruise in winter but at the best of times, it is not booked for more than a week every month.																								The lounge, with sofas along the wood-panelled walls, a bar counter at one end, carpeted floor and a music system thrown in, was just the cue younger colleagues were waiting for. Bottles were uncorked, the supply of hot kebabs appeared inexhaustible and spirits were soon high enough for feet to begin tapping and arms to swing in abandon. Strobe lights were missing but the lights were dimmed to prompt people overcome their inhibitions. Invitees had a rollicking time. 																								A few pegs of whisky outside on the decks broke the ice so fast that bathroom singers soon silenced much better and trained singers. Talks flowed as easily as liquor and the lights on the river banks  far and feeble --- twinkled at a distance. 																								The launch has a maximum speed of 16 kph, though it was cruising that evening at just about 10 kph. At night, the organisers added, the authorities do not allow the boats to go much beyond Bally bridge, just beyond Belur. It took the boat a little more than an hour to reach the bridge and then it turned back and went a little beyond Garden Reach, before stalling the engine.																								A knowledgeable colleague kept up a running commentary for the benefit of first-timers, pointing out in the darkness the outlines of the Botanical Garden, the engineering college, the magnificent bungalow of the South Eastern Railway general manager and the room at Belur, overlooking the river, in which Swami Vivekananda had apparently lived.																								It was not exactly like a cruise on the Rhine or, for that matter, the Thames. The Rhine valley is far more picturesque and the Thames far more colourful. On the Hooghly that evening, our launch appeared to be the only boat moving about, barring stray country boats occasionally passing us. The riverbanks were largely unlit, although there are spectacular landmarks that can be illuminated at night for better viewing. Darkness, however, had an advantage over daylight. The muddy and somewhat polluted water of the river acquired a mystical character, accentuated by the occasional candle or earthen lamp that swirled with the water or floated by. 																								The cost appears reasonable, at about Rs 100 per head per hour. The launch could accommodate a hundred guests and at Rs 50,000 for a six-hour cruise, with food thrown in, it should turn out to be a major tourist attraction, agreed tour operator Basab Bhattacharya, a former journalist who now enjoys his vocation of taking mostly foreign tourists around. The launch can, in fact, be hired for less than Rs 25,000 for six hours and without food.																								While most people hire the launch to travel to the Sunderbans or for a quick, one-hour cruise down the river, a more leisurely and structured cruise for half a day or in the evening could well attract more people and make it viable. On-board music and bands could add to the ambience. Indeed, the more adventurous can think of planning their weddings on board. The guests would enjoy the novelty and it would certainly be cheaper than hiring a hall in the city. The newly-wedded couple could get off at Raichak and move into Radisson Ffort, while the guests could cruise back to the city. It just requires the enterprise of a Harsh Neotia, perhaps, to implement the idea.																								There is a caveat, though. While Millennium Park has a parking lot with attendants, Babughat still doesnt have one. Even the lot at Millennium Park is closed by 8.30 pm. If late-night cruises are to be encouraged, Babughat must be given a facelift and a parking lot, with attendants, arranged. At present, the ghat presents a rather shabby look, is indifferently lit and appears distinctly unsafe. With so much changing in the city, can we hope for a sea-change in the way we look at and use the river, too?

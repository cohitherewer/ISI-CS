 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Pre-poll windfall for closed mill staff
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								For the past six months, the cash-strapped state government had failed to pay workers of closed factories Rs 500 per month. But ahead of the elections, it found enough in its coffers to clear the dues.																								For the 3,119 workers of the 41 factories closed down over the past 10 years in Howrah, the elections thus proved to be a boon, fetching them Rs 1.40 crore, under the financial assistance for workers of locked-out industries scheme, 1998.																								Last December, we wiped out the dues till September. Now, we have paid the workers till March and hope to keep the payments up-to-date, said a labour department official. 																								Sources in the district administration said the government had absorbed six more factories in the scheme in March, taking the number to 41. The CPMs rivals tagged the windfall for the workers as a pre-election bonus. We have heard of bonus before the Pujas, or after declaration of dearness allowance, but this is a vote bonus, said district Trinamul Congress president Arup Roy. 																								The local CPM members are pleased at the government decision. We have sent another list to the state government. Once that is taken up, another 2,000 workers will be benefited, said Nemai Samanta, district secretary of the ruling partys labour arm, Citu.

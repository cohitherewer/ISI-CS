The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Battle a killer, bag a big tally 
 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Priyanka: Scribe aspirant. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Spotted in the crowd of happy faces poring over the notice board at Calcutta Girls High School on Tuesday afternoon was a pair of hazel eyes, calm but glinting with conviction. The eyes of a girl fighting leukaemia for the past seven years, who had just won another battle  a 76 per cent score in ISC 2004.																								Despite being surrounded by a bevy of high-scorers, Priyanka Ghosal was the cynosure of most eyes, none more so than school principal Montoo Rakhit (whom Priyanka considers her inspiration and godmother).																								I have scored 94 per cent in English and thats the most important thing for me right now. I want to study English (hons) in St Xaviers or Jadavpur University and then become a journalist, chirped the bubbly girl in blue salwar suit, the printed black scarf hugging her head the only indication of the killer disease she was detected with in 1998. Priyanka was in Class VIII then.																								A bone-marrow transplant, a two-year academic loss, immunity problems and concentration lapses  the only daughter of businessman S. Ghosal has taken everything in her stride.																								The transplant was such a painful process. The doctors pricked my veins a zillion times, but I never cried, announced the one-time swimming champ and The Telegraph in Schools bravery award-winner in 2002.																								After a two-year treatment schedule at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Priyanka was re-admitted in Class VIII. Her condition forced her to stay at home, but the gutsy girl still managed an 80 per cent in her ICSE. She resumed regular classes from Class XI and went on to become the class prefect.																								We used to be a bit protective about her, thinking that she wouldnt be able to cope, but she resented that, recounted principal Rakhit, overwhelmed by Priyankas achievement.																								Theres no stopping the Bryan Adams, Feluda and Eric Segal fan, who turned 20 a week ago. I dont know how long I will live, but God is there, she asserted.

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Immortal expressions of life
																								Portraying life in its natural form and in a style that fuses creativity with realism, for Uma Roy Chowdhury, sculptures are a way of life. In her on-going exhibition, Shades of Life, she immortalises lifes myriad shades of joy and sorrow, bondage and freedom, empathy and spirituality. Influenced by European forms, her work bears impressions of Greek and Celtic art on the one hand and is inspired by Mesopotamian and Aztec artwork on the other. Blending her natural skills with a rare artistic vision, Roy Chowdhurys sculptures are deeply symbolic, using classical Vedic symbols, Greek motifs and Celtic signs to great philosophical effect. Though she has worked with several media, including clay, ceramic, terracotta, acrylic and sawdust, bronze remains her favourite medium of expression, giving depth to her thoughts and ideas. Most of the sculptors relief works are inspired by Goddess Durga, who is seen as an embodiment of the creator, the protector and the daughter.																								Event: An exhibition of sculptures by Uma Roy Chowdhury																								When: Till March 16; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

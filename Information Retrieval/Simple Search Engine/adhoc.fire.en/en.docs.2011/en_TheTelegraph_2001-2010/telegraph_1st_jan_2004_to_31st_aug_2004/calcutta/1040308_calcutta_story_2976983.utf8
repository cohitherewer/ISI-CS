The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Sorrow binds shattered kin 
 SANJAY MANDAL 																								Behala and Dum Dum are on opposite flanks of the city and the Sens of Behalas government quarters and the Pals of Dum Dums Shahid Sunil Sen Sarani have little in common. 																								But two days of festivities ending in tragedies have left the two homes sharing a similar fate scripted in the blood of two bravehearts.																								Hearing of how Shankar Pal was killed on Holi for protesting against eve-teasing, the family of sergeant Bapi Sen  who had been fatally wounded on the last night of 2002 while trying to stop some rogue cops from harassing a woman  expressed solidarity with the Pals.																								We understand their grief, said Anup Sen, elder brother of Bapi, after he was informed of the manner of Shankars death.																								I will write a letter to the bereaved family, expressing our sorrow. We would also like to provide any kind of assistance within our means, he added, asking for the address of Shankars widow and 10-year-old son.																								I hope his killers are apprehended and punished soon, said Anup, before adding bitingly: My brothers killers have not yet been sentenced. If this is the trend, then people will think twice before protesting against eve-teasing and risking their lives.																								Family members of Bapi Sen seeking justice feel the wait is too long and painful for them. We hope Shankar Pals family members do not have to undergo the trauma we are going through, one of Bapis close relatives said on Sunday. 																								Shankar, the driver of South Dum Dum Municipalitys chairman-in-council member (conservancy and health), protested when he spotted a group teasing some women bathing in a pond near his house on Saturday. 																								The eve-teasers left after Shankar intervened, but returned later to kill him. He leaves behind his wife and a son studying in Class V.																								Bapi, a Tollygunge Traffic Guard sergeant, slipped into a coma after being beaten up on New Years eve by a gang of constables. Bapi succumbed to his injuries six days later, leaving behind wife Soma and sons Somsubhra and Shankhasubhra.																								Again, the similarities could end there. Earlier this year, Bapi was given a posthumous gallantry award by the police and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee personally pledged support for his family.																								But in Shankars case, police say it was accident, not murder, blotting out a brave act that has ended a life and ruined a family.

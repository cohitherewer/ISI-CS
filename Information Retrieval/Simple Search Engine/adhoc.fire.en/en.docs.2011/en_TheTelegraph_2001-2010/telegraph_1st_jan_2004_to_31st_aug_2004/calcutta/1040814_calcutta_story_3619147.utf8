	The delivery boys employed by LPG distributors in my locality ask for extra money in case they are returned on the delivery date. This indeed is a bad practice. If rules do not permit them to reach the cylinders on a deferred date without a request for the same being processed through the distributor, then they should refuse the customer outright. Why doesnt the distributor formulate a fool-proof system by which consumers can get the delivery on a future date after paying a penalty amount? The authorities are requested to address this issue at the earliest.

	Many common species of birds are disappearing from the city, thanks to incessant felling of trees. Planting saplings all along the footpaths might lure them back. Also, the Corporation staff should not spray excessive amount of pesticides on the saplings. Instead, a little fertilizer should be added to the soil.

	The CMC had installed a number of movable garbage bins along busy streets and road intersections across the city for the convenience of the general public. But of late it has been noticed that roadside shop-keepers and hawkers conveniently dispose of garbage in these bins instead of throwing it in the vat. Since the bins do not have the capacity to hold such a lot of garbage, they overflow well before the time the CMC staffers turn up to empty them. The CMC should increase the frequency of clearing garbage from these bins or else the investment would go waste.

	There is a lack of coordination between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the law enforcers in those areas of the city that are under the jurisdiction of the state police. It would be better if the total area under the CMC be brought under Calcutta Police. This will help keeping track of criminal activities in far-flung areas like Behala, Thakurpukur and Ranikuthi in south Calcutta which are under the control of South 24-Parganas police.

	The civic authorities and local residents try their level best to dissuade pedestrians from turning roadside walls into urinals. But even embossed pictures of gods and goddesses on the walled tiles have failed to curb the nuisance. Now the only way to bring the culprits to book is by charging a penalty.

 																											- Change convention of travel at complainant cost, says court OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Who should foot the bill for out-of-town expenses when it comes to following a crime trail beyond city limits? Convention says the complainant. However, Calcutta High Court would beg to differ.																								The court observed on Wednesday that the system could hamper fair investigation and directed the state government to enlighten it on the relevant police rules and help find an alternative solution. February 3 was fixed for the next hearing.																								The order was passed by Justice Barin Ghosh, while hearing a case from North 24-Parganas, in which the petitioner accused two sub-inspectors of Baranagar police station of travelling to Mumbai, with railway tickets bought for them by one of the complainants, to investigate a case of theft.																								They went to Mumbai by air-conditioned Ist Class on Geetanjali Express, stated the petitioner, adding that the complainant had even paid for the food and stay of the policemen.																								After hearing the petition, Justice Ghosh asked the officer-in-charge of the local police station to explain why he had allowed his subordinates to travel with financial help from the complainant.																								Appearing on behalf of the officer-in-charge, senior government lawyer and former advocate-general of Tripura Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya told the court that for the police, it was par for the course to take the complainants help.																								The force does not have the infrastructure to pursue thousands of cases without taking the help of complainants, said Bhattacharya, adding that the practice was prevalent in other states as well. We know this is unfortunate, but the police have no option but to carry on with this practice. The government, too, has come to accept this, observed Bhattacharya.																								Justice Ghosh asked him whether there was any rule allowing the police authorities to take such financial assistance from complainants.																								It is a convention, not a rule, clarified Bhattacharya, to which Justice Ghosh retorted: Dont you think this convention should be changed in the interest of fair justice?																								Bhattacharya conceded that the system should be changed, but added that it be kept in mind that police investigators must visit far-off spots under severe infrastructure constraints to reach a fair conclusion.																								Outside the courtroom, Bhattacharya affirmed that the two sub-inspectors of the Baranagar police station had already been suspended.

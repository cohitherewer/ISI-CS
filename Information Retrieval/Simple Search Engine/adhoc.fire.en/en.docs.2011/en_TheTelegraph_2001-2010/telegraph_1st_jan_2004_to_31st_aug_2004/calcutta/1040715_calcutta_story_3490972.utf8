 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Cops ID drill for domestics
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Uttam Kejriwal of Queens Park was not to know that his new domestic help would flee with all the jewellery. 																								So, on May 30, when Babul Mahato slipped out with diamond-studded ornaments worth around Rs 11 lakh, he called in the Ballygunge police. Kejriwal said all he knew about Babul was that he hailed from Koderma, in Jharkhand.																								It took sleuths months to track down Baban Yadav  and not Babul  and recover the booty. But the experience has jolted the police out of slumber.																								For the first time in recent history, police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty has slapped an order on the officers-in-charge of 47 police stations, making it mandatory for all residents of areas under their jurisdiction to submit a report on domestics engaged by them. 																								At the last crime conference at Lalbazar, commissioner Chakraborty asked his officers to take serious note of crimes committed by domestics, particularly in highrises in upmarket pockets of the city.																								The move that, till a few months ago, was confined to a few apartments in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area, will now cover all domestic help  irrespective of where the employer lives and the size of his family. 																								Even part-timers have to be identified. The officers-in-charge will submit a compliance report by July 31. 																								Accordingly, all police stations have been provided with a identity (ID) card that will be filled by the respective beat officers of the police stations with all details and a photograph of the domestic help. 																								Apart from the name and address, the card will have the address of local friends/relatives/references and the previous employer.																								The idea is to ensure that in case of a theft or any other crime, when the needle of suspicion points to the domestic help, the investigating officer will have a ready reckoner, explained a senior officer of the crime records section (CRS) of Lalbazar.																								Once filled and submitted, these cards will be sent to the CRS, where the information will be fed into computers for a databank. As of now, Lalbazar lacks a separate section on crime by domestics, something that police admit is on the rise.

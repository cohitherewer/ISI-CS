 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Morality vs Materialism
																								We live in an age of materialism and consumerism, and are driven only by our selfish goals, oblivious to the needs and sensitivities of those around us. Directed by Bilwadal Chatterjee, Kalindi Natyasrijans new play Panya Bitangsha seeks to highlight this loss of human values in our rapidly changing society. Dr Kanad Bhadra is a true representative of the modern breed of young men who measure success in terms of fortune. His wife, Monidipa, is torn between temptations of wealth and her own understanding of of what she knows is right and wrong. A play with great social relevance, Panya Bitangsha shows how they all become innocent victims of changing social trends. It raises pertinent questions and helps us seek answers to some of the most pressing social problems of the day.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

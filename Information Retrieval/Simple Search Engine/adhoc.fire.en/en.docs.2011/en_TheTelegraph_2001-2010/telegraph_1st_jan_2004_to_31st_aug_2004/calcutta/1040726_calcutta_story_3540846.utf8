Laha: The Sunderbans have a vast tract of waterbodies that can be utilised for communication. 																																																													Its better said that except for a few fringe areas, most parts of the island are connected by waterways. As we plan to boost agriculture and other cottage industries in the area, we also have to develop the embarking points, so that agro products can be despatched smoothly to the mainland markets. Jetties have a key role to play in the islands development. We are constructing 46 of them. Apart from government assistance, we are getting funds from Asian Development Bank (ADB) and New Zealand for the project. The ADB is providing a couple of hundred crores.

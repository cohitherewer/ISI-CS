The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 07, 2004  Debut at midnightHimika Chaudhuri and Soma Banerjee Model Pinky walks the bar-top at Tantra in designer Pritam Pandas creation. Picture by Rashbehari Das															 So what if the fashion show that was scheduled to start at 9 pm on Wednesday at Tantra got transformed into a midnight affair? Quite literally. After all, Calcuttas party people, if anything, dont vie for the early-bird prizes when it comes to turning up at a nightclub.																					But Pritam Pandas debut prt show in the city was worth the wait. Well, if not the full three hours, a large part of it. If Wednesday night was anything to go by, the young designer, who has till now showcased his creations only in Dubai and the UK, holds out more than a little promise.																					Pritam works mostly in bright hues of pink, blue, yellow and orange, comfortably mixed western cuts and the essentially Indian textures, prime among them being the classy zardozi.																					The 30-odd displays on Tantras bar top-turned-ramp ranged from the ageless Indian sari and lehngas to the more experimental fusion of hot pants and bustiers.																					The highly wearable range of ethnic wear has mostly been tailored in chiffon with chic embroidery and sequin work. Something just right for the new-age woman who could choose to drape a sari to the nightclub just to make a point.																					The lehngas, also in chiffon and heavy embroidery work, could just be the right thing to pick up for the brides best friend. Or for a no-frills bride, for these went easy on the embellishments.																					The bustier bit was, of course, not meant for life beyond the ramp, but it did the trick for some. It worked for the we-are-bored-of-the-same-models bandwagon, who were quick to get into the swing of things. 																					So what if they wouldnt be able to remember the name of the designer on Thursday morning?																					But what made everyone do a double take was the couple of male models thrown in to spice things up. The poor things did their turn on the ramp wearing bikini style-cholis and flowing lehngas, right down to aalta on their feet. That was the designers attempt at saying that his designs vault the great gender divide, we were told.																					Wonder if Bhaichung, Rennedy, Douglas  on the ball in Salt Lake and on Park Street  would agree to walk Pritams talk.Model Joy checks out the silverware at Princess. Picture by Rashbehari Das.

Wednesday evening was celebration time at the outlet that stocks both innovative and traditional pieces in sterling silver. Customer service has also helped see the store through the years.																					We undertake orders for all kinds of silverware. Our in-house designers sit with our clientele and sketch out designs and sizes according to the customers preferences and prepare samples either in clay or silver. Customers can even place orders from foreign catalogues, said Princess proprietor Sanjiv Kejriwal.																					The sand-blasted finishes on photo frames, vases and deities are suave enough to meet contemporary silver trends worldwide. Which explains why a huge chunk of Princess products, especially Santas lanterns and serving bowl sets are exported. Even reproductions of British antiques do well abroad, explained Kejriwal.																					The offering differs from the standard fare at most chandi stores. Crystal, wood, onyx, alabaster and lapis lazuli add a designer touch to silver fruit bowls, candle stands and cookware. The silver caskets and buckets are moulded meticulously, some dressed up with enamelling on the inside. While the tea sets priced between Rs 7,000 and Rs 12,000 make for great corporate gift items, the thali sets and baking dishes are ideal for weddings. 																					The hand-crafted chiselled chaukis are also in great demand during the wedding season, says Sanjiv. 																					ain and engraved photo frames and mementos shaped in off-beat shapes  like cricket balls and footballs  and square and round caskets also catch the eye. 																					imited range of matte-finish and oxidised silver jewellery is available. Prices range from Rs 250 for small pill and kumkum boxes to Rs 50,000 for a large punch bowl.																																														Summer sizzler																					Peerless Inn is concentrating on heat-beating recipes for this months food promotions. Three themes will be the focus at its eateries till May 31.																					Bhinno Shader Bora at Aaheli offers a taste of traditional Bangla boras  fried delicacies  like Chingri Bora, Mochar Bora, Bekti Machher Bora and Basmati Mangsher Bora.																					In keeping with the sizzling weather outdoors, from May 15 Bichitra is lining up non-vegetarian sizzlers like White Salmon Steak glazed with Caf de Paris Butter, Chicken Drumstick Indiana and Chicken Steak Hawaiian topped with mushroom or pepper sauce. Vegetarians can choose from Cottage Cheese Skewer or Vegetable Cordon Blue.																					Making the most of the fruit of the season, Nishidin is celebrating Mango Mania with desserts like Mango Swiss Roll and Mango with Rabri. The Mango Chhena Payesh and Mango Mousse on Ginger Honey Pancake are especially tempting.																					At Lahari, the bar, for every bottle of whisky, gin, vodka and rum ordered, two non-vegetarian and one vegetarian snack come free. Choices include Chicken Nachos, Bharwan Moti Tikia, Fish Nachos and Cottage Cheese Skewer.

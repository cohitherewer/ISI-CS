 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Tutor tells a false tale of snatching
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It was a tale of snatching that was not.																								A private tutor and two teenaged students cooked up a story of daylight snatching. One of the students, under instruction from their masterji, even slashed his left hand to add to the drama.																								The injured (name withheld on request) then lodged a complaint with Taltala police.																								But all plans came unstuck during interrogation. The victim broke down, confessed and told investigators what had led him to stage the snatching.																								Police, however, let all three partners in crime go with just a written undertaking, realising that the three did not mean to cause any harm.																								The complaint was false and fabricated. They did not have any plan to cheat anyone, clarified A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge (OC) of Taltala police station.																								The tutors tale did not come even close to convincing the cops. It was around 9 am when I, with a foam-bag containing Rs 89,000, was walking down a narrow lane in Taltala. Three youths, brandishing sharp weapons, surrounded me and took Rs 85,000 out of the bag.																								When I tried to resist, one of the attackers threw chilli powder into my eyes, while the others slashed my left hand. They then disappeared with the money. Before going to the police station, I went straight to a nearby hospital for treatment, the tutor told investigating officers.																								The officers, including OC Majumdar, were suspicious from the start. 																								Had the snatchers actually thrown chilli powder at him, he would not have been able to see properly for six hours. But he claimed to have come to us only an hour after the incident and there was no trace of any chilli powder having gone into his eyes, said an officer.																								When police asked the tutor to remove the bandage on his left arm, there were hardly any scratch marks visible. 																								Besides, it was impossible to believe that the goons had snatched Rs 85,000 but left Rs 4,000, added an officer.																								It finally came to the fore that the tutor had cooked up this snatching scheme to buy some time with a mahajan, whom he owed Rs 4 lakh.																								I had only 4,000 in my bag but I wanted to convince my mahajan that I was on my way to his office to pay Rs 85,000, the tutor confessed.																								Our masterji was in trouble, so we agreed to act according to his plan, said the two students of Class X.

Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya This month has been a hectic and memorable one for IIM-Calcutta. Here is a round-up of some of the on-campus events that had students and teachers abuzz: 				 				 																															Can the Left go with the Right? was the hot topic of discussion at the Colloquia Annual Economics Debate. Scope for disagreement between the Left and the Right is getting limited in this era of coalition We are learning to live with each other, said Ashoke Lahiri, chief economic advisor, ministry of finance, government of India.				 				 																															Organised by the students body Colloquia, the debate is based on facts, figures, ideas, perceptions and arguments by experts on relevant topics.				 				 																															Lahiri said the government must not overstretch itself in addressing the issue of empowerment of the poor, but become target-oriented, focusing more on delivery mechanism. He argued that there would be opposition, but the current state of affairs does not leave much room for political manoeuvring if the goal of poverty alleviation by 2015 is to be achieved.				 				 																															Expressing concern over some state governments spending through borrowing, leading to empty coffers, he stressed that for a sustainable growth rate in the agricultural sector, it should be diversified into horticulture, floriculture, etc. Other participants argued that the consensus is born of compulsion. Prof Sushil Khanna felt that the differences are now limited to the political and social spheres. The debate was moderated by Prof Anup Sinha, dean, programme initiatives, IIMC, who felt that agreement on broad economic policies but acknowledgement of poor delivery mechanism is a global phenomenon. 				 				 																															A career in consultancy was the other subject of debate at IIMC. A consulting job is much more about having the will rather than skill. It involves working in teams and hence, one needs to be a good team player. These were some salient points of working in the consultancy sector, shared by IIMC alumnus Jyoti Kumar Agarwal.				 				 																															The Consulting Club of the management institute had organised an informal interactive session on consultancy as a career, where the former club member and current employee of Boston Consultancy Group elaborated on the requirements of the sector.				 				 																															Agarwal emphasised that a consulting firm requires good analytical and excellent interpersonal skills, as well as putting in long hours. Work experience also helps. Consultancy may involve travelling. An employee has to maintain a delicate balance between job and personal life. Clients needs have to be addressed to get a good solution within the time frame. It requires keeping sensitive information confidential. Consultancy firms developing strategy are the most sought after, followed by domain-specific ones.				 				 																															The session ended with distribution of certificates to the winning teams of the clubs recently-concluded Hutch-Kautilya 04 competition. 				 				 																															And finally, IIMC made a hat-trick by bagging the Best Young Teacher Award by Association of Institutes of Management for the third consecutive year. Prof Uttam Kumar Sarkar of the MIS group got this award for the year 2004. The last two years Young Teacher Award were bagged by Prof Sougata Ray and Prof U. Dinesh Kumar.

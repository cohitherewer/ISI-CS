				 	VIDHI SETHIA																									Vidhi Sethia																									At all times. Thats the best way to describe this 20-year-old who is famous for her constant chatter.																									Is also what this second-year bachelor of business administration student of J.D. Birla Institute has capitalised on. She has sunk her teeth into a career in telemarketing since she left school. After six months at a small private concern, she joined the epicure department at The Taj Bengal, where she finds innovative ways to sweet talk strangers into buying a privilege card for the hotel group.																									She heads for college, where the course keeps her busy enough. She was selected to co-emcee the inaugural ceremony of the new campus above Birla High School recently, before an audience including S.K. Birla and A.N. Basu, vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University. Till recently, she was also a member of the student exchange organisation AIESEC, where she learnt a lot though a hectic schedule prevented her from being very involved. She fit in one major project  organising an alumni night.																									Must have stood this ardent foodaholic in good stead on the tennis court. In 1997, she won the under 18 girls singles at Saturday Club, and the next two years, she came in runner-up.																									And Vidhi has kept herself busy since school at La Martiniere for Girls. In 2002, she won the Adcom Award for raising the most money for Karma Yatra. Between Class IX and XII, she was actively involved with social projects at Manovikas Kendra and Little Sisters of the Poor, which she still visits whenever she gets the chance. She also assisted the doctors at health clinics at Garcha and Park Circus. Her Nature Club days saw her painting murals, planting saplings, cleaning up the riverside and working on the wetlands, anti-plastic and no-horn campaigns.																									Mean more to Vidhi than the initials of her college. Just dont be indifferent is her motto, and her message for the world, too.

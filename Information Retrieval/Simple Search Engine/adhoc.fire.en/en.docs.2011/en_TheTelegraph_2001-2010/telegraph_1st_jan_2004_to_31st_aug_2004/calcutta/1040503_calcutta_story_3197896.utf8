The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Sell flowers for a livelihood
Subrata Basu				 	 Subrata Basu, deputy manager, West Bengal Horticulture Development Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Friday. Participants included Bidhan Sarkar, Prabhat Biswas, Basudeb Chowdhury, Joyeeta Mukherjee and Ziat Ali Mondal				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Bidhan Sarkar: Horticulture has evolved into a popular business. But it suffers from improper marketing strategies.																																																			I look after the marketing of horticultural products grown by our enlisted panel. So, I am directly involved in the process. Before we took over the Mullickghat flower market at Howrah, the scenario was different. But now, many producers, even some graduates in agriculture from various universities, are earning handsome amounts by exporting flowers to Europe and West Asian countries. The loss they may incur is the result of a lack of knowledge to tap the demand. Some of them also grow non-export quality flowers.																																																									

Joyeeta Mukherjee: Is this specifically a rural trade?																																																			Yes, this is a trade basically for the rural people. But it does not mean that urban youth cannot make a living by it. A tract of agricultural land is all that is required for starting this business. As for the scope, the possibilities are yet untapped. For example, we started supplying flowers to Holland, the US and Dubai from December 2002. To date, we have received many more orders but are failing to supply them because production is insufficient. At present, we command only 0.3 per cent of the worlds flower market.																																																									

Joyeeta Mukherjee: What are the flowers in demand for export?																																																			The rajanigandha (tuberose) of Rajarhat is very popular in Holland and England. We send an average of two consignments a day to those two countries. Each consignment comprises 25,000 sticks. In West Asia, the zarbera and gladiolus fetch regular orders. Growers are exporting about 30,000 to 40,000 flowers a week to these two countries.																																																									

Ziat Ali Mondal: Do the flowers for export have to conform to any particular specification?																																																			Definitely. Holland, for example, wants that the tuberose stem should not be less than 100 mm to 120 mm. But Dubai accepts flowers with a stem length of 80 mm to 90 mm, too. The only criterion in this business is quality. For people interested in setting up a flower export business, I suggest they enlist themselves with us for advice and aid.																																																									

Prabhat Biswas: How does enlistment with you help?																																																			When growers face any problem, they inform us and we contact the authorities of agricultural universities and colleges. But there is scope for more interaction between the person in the field and in academics. We are trying to organise more interactive sessions between these two groups for mutual benefit. 																																																											Actually, we are developing an international-standard flower market at Mullickghat. Once this project is ready, flower traders can interact even with international consultants to get their problems addressed. We have a website with all the information, too. It will be upgraded to be of more use to new entrants to the trade.																																																									

Basudeb Chowdhury: What is the time gap between supply and payment?																																																			Once the flowers are handed over to us for export, we pay off the growers. They are in no risk of waiting to get repaid as we take the responsibility of delivering their goods. When the Mullickghat flower market was not taken over by us, it used to be controlled by goons. But now we have set the prices. The flowers for export fetch a better price for the growers than those to be sold in local markets. 																																																									

Joyeeta Mukherjee: Does the government provide any aid or incentives to people in the trade?																																																			Yes there are several schemes. The Agricultural Products Export Development Agency of the central government provides assistance for setting up a flower business, as does the state government. But there are few takers for the schemes.

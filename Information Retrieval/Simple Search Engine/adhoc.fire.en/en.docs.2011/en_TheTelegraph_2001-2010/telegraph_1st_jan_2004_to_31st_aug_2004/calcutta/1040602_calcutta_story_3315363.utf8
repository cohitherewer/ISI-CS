Picture by Pradip Sanyal 												Here is good reason to romance some exquisite gold jewellery once again: an annual exhibition is being held at P.C. Chandra from June 2 to June 5. Being held across five of the companys showrooms across the city (Bowbazar, Gariahat, Chowringhee, Ultadanga, Golpark as well as one in Siliguri), the four-day event is out to celebrate the essence of Indian gold jewellery. 																					ed Swarna Mrigaya, the display will showcase the finest craftsmanship and will also be the one-stop destination from which clients can take their pick of a tiny pendant or the most elaborate bridal collection.																					The Goldlites line, a special range of light-weight pieces in 22 karat gold, promises to be an eye-catcher for those looking for something small and chic for work or on a get-together. Smart bracelets, earrings in both ethnic and western designs, rings and pendants form part of this collection.																					And its not just the designs and look of the jewellery that will keep the shopper hooked to the shop-floor. Hourly lucky-draws and exciting games will throw up gifts in the form of discounts and if you are lucky, even some gold goodies, too.																					Bridal best																					 The yellow metal fest continues at another destination.																					Bored of the frumpy old mangalsutra? Brides-to-be have something to look out for. At Sencos Gold Mega Shop at Moulali there are 200 to 250 designs to be had at the Mangalsutra Festival.																					Having kicked off last month, the festival, on till June 7, has seen satisfactory sales for the store, with young girls and housewives the main target, explains a company spokesperson. The traditional and contemporary designs are set mainly in gold, and are diamond studded on request.																					Both varieties  traditional heavy designs and contemporary ones for those looking for a new look  have both been doing well, with prices ranging from Rs 6,000 to Rs 30,000.																					The discount and schemes on offer also have buyers excited, with 10 per cent off on making charges plus a lucky draw promising a mens gold ring for the winner.The Ekru summer look and (below) one of the creations at Intrigue 												Design duo																					 They are in love with the textiles of Bengal. They also dislike designing fusion outfits.																					Aveek Bhattacharya and Meenaxi Dadoo may be the new kids on the design block, but industry vibes indicate that the duo may be worth keeping an eye on.																					Ritu Kumar, apparently, spotted them at an exhibition earlier this year in Delhi, and had great things to say about their mature work. The NIFT graduates were out working on their own till they decided to team up and launch their label Orange OM.																					We are already retailing from Ogaan in Delhi and Origin and Marichika in Hyderabad, explained Meenaxi. Their line, now being stocked at Intrigue on Park Street, is also being considered by Tarun Tahiliani for showcasing at his outlet, Ensemble. It is in the sampling stage right now, shared Meenaxi.																					Busy making their mark outside the state, the Calcutta kids didnt find time to test home waters. This is the first time we are retailing here and the response has been good for starters, said Aveek. Their clothes, in natural fabrics like cotton, silk, linen and chiffon are embellished with gota work and Rajasthani block prints. The soft white kurtas in muted shades paired with pathani salwars are jazzed up with bright dupattas.																					lection of patterns and improvisation on traditional stitches like kantha make their outfits very interesting and contemporary.																					Targetting women between 22 and 60 years, OM deals in both ethnic and western wear. Ranging between Rs 2,500 to Rs 18,000 the salwar kurtas are casual yet elegant. The saris are priced between Rs 8,000 and Rs 13,000.Femme floral																					 Ekru, a joint venture by designers Ekta Jaipuria and Ruchira Kandahari, recently unveiled its summer collection at their boutique on Rowland Row. The duo has drawn inspiration for the line from the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh.																					Many of the outfits in our summer range are hand-painted and for this we have drawn inspiration from the paintings of Van Gogh. For the rest, we have been influenced by rural India, particularly Rajasthan, says Ekta. 																					The collection is a profusion of citrus shades, which promises to enliven the sultry afternoons and dull evenings. Its a trendy fusion range with mix and match being the predominant idea. This is a collection which we can even aim to sell abroad. So, there are skirts, kurtas with scarves, crushed pants, churi pants and other outfits which can be worn anywhere in the world, adds Ekta.																					The designers have played around with soft cottons, muls, linens, voils, chiffons and georgettes to create the fusion look. Surface embellishments like gota, embroidery and mirror work are used extensively, as are hand-painted motifs, block and khari prints.																					The silhouettes are clean yet flowing and have a feminine appeal. Floral motifs add to the feminine feel. There are a few ethnic pieces in vibrant hues, besides the usual off-whites and beiges. The collection is affordably priced between Rs 1,000 and Rs 6,000.																																													Off the rack																					 Those in search of trendy options in town now have one more destination to keep in mind. Style Smiths, a mens wear store at Metro Plaza, has opened another outlet by the same name for women on the third floor of the mall.																					The new store offers a variety of western outfits imported from Bangkok and Hong Kong. There are clothes from international brands like Vibe, Deal, Body-Look, Got-it and others. There are some trendy lowers like jeans, trousers, capris and skirts in various shapes from Vibe and Deal. 																					Funky T-shirts from Got-It and a few other brands have been sourced from the Far East. Party-wear tops, minis and micro-minis are also on offer, as are accessories like cowboy caps, bandanas, golf caps, sleepers and belts.																					The kurtis and short skirts are designed locally, said Vikash Mahipal, owner of Style Smiths. We have our own manufacturing unit where we are designing kurtis. Right now, we have come up with a very limited collection, but we will soon come out with a proper line of exclusive, hand-painted ethnic kurtis as well, added Vikash.

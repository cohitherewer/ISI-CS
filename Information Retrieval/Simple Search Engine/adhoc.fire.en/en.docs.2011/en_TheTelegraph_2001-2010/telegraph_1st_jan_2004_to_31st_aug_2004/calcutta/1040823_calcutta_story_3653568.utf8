The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Viewer trapped in cable quandary
 A STAFF REPORTER																								I am paying Rs 240 every month but I still dont get the channels I want. I love to watch the sports channels but never get all four  ESPN, STAR Sports, Ten Sports and DD Sports  together. Thus began the complaint letter of a cable-viewer living in Bangur. And he is no exception.																								The cable television viewer continues to be at the wrong end of the beam  taken for granted by the operator cartels (no changing operators even if one wants to), dumped by the government (no conditional access system  CAS), and, most recently, stumped by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (no ceiling on cable subscription, says TRAI).																								Last week saw the telecom watchdog withdrawing the ceiling it had imposed on cable subscription rates earlier this year. A hike in service tax and the introduction of education cess have been cited as reasons for the revision. This, effectively, allows operators to charge whatever amount they want from customers.																								Operators have already announced that from September, the tariff is set to go up by Rs 50 to Rs 75. Their argument: over the past two years, operational costs have risen and broadcasters have effected rate hikes.																								With rates ready to go up yet again, where does the consumer find himself? At the bottom of the pile and at the mercy of a multi-tiered structure, with neither any service assurance nor the right to demand channels of his choice.																								I bought a new TV set so that I could get more channels, but it seems pointless, since my operator doesnt provide the channels I want, complains another hapless viewer in Tollygunge. And when given a raw deal, there is no redress system he can turn to, with consumer rights organisations clearly displaying their inability to address this issue during the CAS fiasco.																								It is true that the service quality varies across the city, admits an operator of Behala. Viewers can complain to consumer organisations, but the real solution is through government-imposed regulation, he feels. Failing which, matters can only get worse, he cautions.																								Multi-system operators (MSOs) claim their hands are tied, but accept that steps must be taken to rein in operators who offer poor service. Every time we try to take streamlining steps, theres a cry of operator oppression, offers the representative of a city MSO.																								Operators dont even bother to provide the break-up of charges on the bill. In fact, in a number of places across the city and adjoining areas, a proper receipt is yet to replace the card system.																								Subscription rates vary wildly across the city, and between the city and suburbs. If some viewers in Tollygunge and Baguiati pay Rs 200, those in Khardah and Santoshpur cough up Rs 150. Attempts at any kind of uniformity have flopped.

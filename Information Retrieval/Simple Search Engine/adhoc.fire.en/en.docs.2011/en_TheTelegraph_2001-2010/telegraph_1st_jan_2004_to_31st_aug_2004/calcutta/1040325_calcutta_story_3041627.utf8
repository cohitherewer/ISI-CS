 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Court strikes down varsity post recruit
 							 - Fair play doubts in selection SUNANDO SARKAR																								This is about educating Jadavpur University (JU) on what makes an outstanding scholar and what constitutes the principles of fair play.																								Calcutta High Court and the University Grants Commission (UGC) have done just that. 																								Faced with a plea to overturn an allegedly irregular appointment in the universitys economics department, the judiciary  after clarifying things from the UGC  has told the university that the person it tagged an outstanding scholar could not be reasonably branded as such.																								Consequently, JU would have to reverse the order of the panel it selected. Number II on the panel, Basabi Bhattacharya, would have to be given preference over Calcutta University reader Anjan Chakraborty, Justice Pradipta Ray told JU.																								The court found that Bhattacharya had 21 years of experience of teaching in a university. 																								Chakraborty, who preceded her on the panel, had only seven (the stipulated minimum requirement was 10). 																								The materials on record do not even suggest that Chakraborty could be regarded so outstanding as to deserve extra-ordinary special consideration, the verdict read.																								The slap on JUs face  the court admitted that it was being forced to deviate from its usual practice of not interfering in the internal matters of a university if the principles of fair play had been adhered to  caps allegations of several irregular appointments against the states premier campus.																								Chakraborty and Bhattacharya (in that order) found themselves on the panel for the professors post, leaving the latter with a chance only if Chakraborty refused to join the post, after a meeting of the selection committee on April 8 last year. 																								The committee included the universitys vice-chancellor Ashok Nath Basu.																								After the selection, Bhattacharya wrote to the vice-chancellor, drawing his attention to the fact that Chakraborty did not have the requisite university-teaching experience of 10 years. Chakraborty, in fact, admitted that he had only seven years experience, she added.																								The vice-chancellor then referred the protest to the executive council, the universitys highest decision-making body. 																								It met on April 16 and, armed with a written reply from the arts faculty dean (that said Chakraborty was an outstanding scholar with an established reputation), ratified the selection committee decision.																								So Bhattacharya moved the high court. University lawyer Chameli Majumdar contended that the court should not interfere with a decision made by an expert selection committee.																								Justice Ray accepted that the judiciary should not normally interfere with a campus selection committees decision if the principles of fair play had been adhered to. 																								Justice Rays verdict admitted: The experts opinion should be respected and the court should not ordinarily foist its own opinion.																								But Bhattacharya had raised a substantial and an important question, and the university could not deviate from its own eligibility criteria, the judge explained, going into the comparative merits of Bhattacharya and Chakraborty as contenders to the post.																								Senior university officials would not comment on the verdict but said the matter could come up for discussion at the next executive council meeting.

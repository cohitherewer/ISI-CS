				 Fog havoc on rail, air schedules 

 OUR BUREAU
																								Dense fog over the city and its adjoining areas on Friday led to disruption of flights and long-distance train services.
																								A British Airways flight could not land, while a domestic flight was cancelled and another delayed. At least seven long-distance trains arrived behind schedule at Howrah and Sealdah stations because of fog on the tracks in northern India and various parts of Bengal.
																								Weather officials said there would be thick fog early in the morning for the next few days over Calcutta and its adjoining areas because of a trough of low pressure  stretching from central Maharashtra to Gangetic West Bengal and Assam.
																								The low-pressure trough had caused a change in the wind pattern that is bringing in warm, moisture-laden air from the Bay of Bengal.
																								The minimum temperature has shot up to six degrees above normal. This is because of the warm air flowing in from the sea, said an official at the regional meteorological centre at Alipore. Fridays minimum temperature was 20 degrees Celsius.
																								A British Airways flight, due to arrive at Calcutta airport on Friday at 2.35 am, could not land because of the heavy fog and had to be diverted to Dhaka. It was expected back from Dhaka late on Friday. 
																								Indian Airlines officials said the Calcutta-Delhi flight 263, due to leave at 7 am, was delayed by an hour because of the fog. Bad weather at Bagdogra led to cancellation of the flight from Calcutta.

 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Unit-area assessment plan for property tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government and Calcuttas civic authorities feel the present system of pegging house tax on the basis of rent the property can fetch in a year, needs to be scrapped.																								On Monday, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the system was creating a pile-up of disputes in place of a broad-based rational tax system.																								More than 27,000 assessment disputes in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area are pending with the municipal assessment tribunal, the high court and the Supreme Court.																								Minister Bhattacharya had asked the mayor to submit a proposal for a tax regime based on geographical division of property for amendment to the CMC Act of 1980. The CMC has submitted a draft proposal for unit-area assessment of property tax.																								The central theme of the draft is the CMCs economic self-reliance and to achieve this goal, the unit-area method has to be pursued, mayor Mukherjee asserted on Monday. The tax reform will be a combined initiative of the state government, the CMC and their approved consultants.																								According to the proposal, landed property will be grouped into categories, taking into consideration factors like physical infrastructure, income bracket of the occupants and capital value of the land, combined with construction cost.																								The parameter for the cost of construction will be the central public works department rate that prevailed in 1998.																								The other key determinants include age of a building (specified lower rate for older structures), occupancy status (less for self-occupied buildings), type of structure (kutcha, semi-pucca, etc) and character of usage (less tax for residential building and more for commercial ones).

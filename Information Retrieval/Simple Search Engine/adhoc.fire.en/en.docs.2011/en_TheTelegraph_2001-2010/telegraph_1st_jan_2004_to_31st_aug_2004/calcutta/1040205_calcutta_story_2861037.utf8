  House of history: The Town Hall in  Howrah. (Below) After the cave-in. The report Weight in doubt, check it out (Jan. 2) brought some relief to consumers like us who are often duped by unscrupulous shop-keepers.  Many fishmongers take advantage of the hurry the morning shoppers are in and cheat on the weight. No wonder observant housewives have long been complaining that a given quantity of sugar or rice bought from local grocers occupy relatively less space in their containers of a specified volume.  Unfortunately, most consumers have no fool-proof method to verify the weight of commodities at home. The governments crackdown, a response to numerous complaints pouring in from people, in city markets against the use of faulty scales and weights is a welcome move. Officials of the legal metrology department have seized several defective scales that were used to weigh commodities.  The government should continue carrying out surprise checks at various markets by vigilant inspectors. Perhaps, if these raids are frequent enough, the errant sellers would be too scared to cheat buyers. The inspectors should also blacklist the offenders. That will serve as examples for other sellers who resort to such unfair means to earn more profit.  Sunil Banerjee, 
 VIP Road.  The Howrah Municipal Corporation authorities must have heaved a sigh of relief when no casualties were reported after the Town Hall came crashing down (Neglect slight on heritage site, Jan 5). It only shows the utter neglect this historic building was in. The routine blame game may well start, but what is important is to ensure that yet another piece of history does not collapse.  Piyal Mukherjee,
 Lake Town.  The Howrah Town Hall cave-in is  a pointer to the fact that heritage spots across the state  are not preserved. If the government or the civic authorities  cannot do the job on their own, private agencies can be  hired. Funds for the upkeep of the buildings can be raised  by organising cultural programmes. The Centre may also be  approached to pitch in. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
 Behala.  Three cheers to National Library administrators for asking readers for suggestions to improve services (Library feelers to readers on revival, Jan. 5). Such a move would not only improve work culture but motivate the readers as well. Will the other government departments go for such face-saving measures to stop private entrepreneurs from entering every field?  T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge.  Though other diseases like heart ailments find publicity, there are hardly any awareness campaigns on asthma (Helping hands to breathe easy, Jan. 2). Medication is expensive and many cant afford the metered-dose inhalers. Such patients usually succumb to the disease after years of suffering.  Diptimoy Ghosh, 
 Salt Lake.  Apropos the photograph of Union shipping minister Shatrughan Sinha and mayor Subrata Mukherjee at the waterfront festival in The City Diary on December 31, the effort to beautify the city is welcome. But shouldnt improving the health services infrastructure top our priority list?  Anil Kumar Sen, 
 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.  The murder of a 12-year-old girl (Hit on head, strangled and dumped, Jan. 8) was horrifying. It is a matter of concern that crime is on the rise with the police failing to crack most cases.  S. Banerjee,
 Dum Dum. The incident rings alarm bells  regarding the security of women. Kunal Roy,
 Santragachhi.  We welcome foreigners when they want to fulfil their whims. Are we ever allowed this liberty on foreign soil? (From Lhasa with love, Jan. 7).  Chandan Roy, 
 Sarsuna.  Nawal Joshi, president of city-based NGO Adakaar, was inadvertently referred to as Nawal Jahar, secretary of the organisation, in the report Patriots feted (The City Diary, Jan. 24).

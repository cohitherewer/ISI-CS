 Sunday, June 27, 2004 Bon Appetease Victor Banerjee01001 100110111010101001110101 10000011110 1010 00111111001 0 00111. My PC was acting up. Every time I started it up or rebooted, it always came up with the same thing. Not being tech savvy, I got in touch with an old friend who had done everything from computerising the Middle East to configuring the banking institutions of East Africa. Naturally, he was now living close to Silicon Valley solving problems that their innovational programmes spat out from time to time. He jumped out of his rocking chair that overlooked the bay and guffawed, What is this shit. I told him I was dead serious. So am I, he replied. What do you mean? I asked. Precisely, came his pat reply, thats exactly it, and he wouldnt stop laughing. I was stumped. I had read Arthur C. Clarke but never believed anything so crazy was possible. I hung up and didnt pick up the phone when he tried calling back. I was afraid the handset I used would blow up and barbecue my ear (roast an animal, either whole or cut in pieces, over coals, or on a spit, basting with a special highly-seasoned sauce during the process). Worse, it might have begun whispering codes with a recipe for mankind that I was not enlightened enough to decipher. It all started a few weeks ago. An international paper called me and asked if I would like to write a political column for them, from India. I was flabbergasted. I told them I was totally unqualified and, whats more, totally disinterested in, and put off by, politics. They insisted and made me an offer in Euros that drained the blood from my frontal lobes and effected my pulse like caffeine does. My stunned silence was taken for consent. Later, I had stared blankly at my monitor. Where and how would I begin? My PC or CPU was attached to a pulsating UPS. The dysrhythmic electricity erratically danced between 80 volts and 100. A 220V strength was impossible in this house. Tagore was a man of letters. Observe the ridiculous end of that spectrum. The INC had banished the BJP and the NDA was replaced by the UPA  a mixture of the RJD, NCP, RSP, FB, CPI, JD, JD-U, LJP, PDP, CPM, MDMK, JMM, and the Bachchao Sahara Parivar SP had been swept aside while the DMK had its demands met and the AIDMK and TMC sulked behind pallus and TUs like CITU, HMS, TUCC, UTUC, UTUC-LS, AICCTU wet-nursed PSUs while cajoling the CLP for a CMP.01001 100110111010101001110101 10000011110 1010 00111111001 0 00111. Damn. But suddenly it seems to add up. Doesnt it ? In a democracy, the square on the hypotenuse drags you down if its at the base and topples you over if its on your side.So the political slot is up for grabs for anyone who can decode symbols and abbreviations and initials and calculate exit polls and percentages and memorise the names of an entire cabinet who will wait for the next celebrity wedding that rocks our GDP and gives them the opportunity to serve Bharat Mata and pay homage to a laundryman. You call for a recipe that might cure all ills ?

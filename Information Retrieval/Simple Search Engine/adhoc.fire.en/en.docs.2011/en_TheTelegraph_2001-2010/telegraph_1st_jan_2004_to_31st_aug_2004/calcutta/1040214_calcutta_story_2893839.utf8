The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Traffic top cop stoic
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sixty-one people left dead in road mishaps since January 1, 2004. Alarming? Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Peeyush Pandey thinks not. 																								Its just an average figure, he says. The count is up by two from the corresponding period last year.																								The deputy commissioner has also advised Calcuttans not to panic, even if the casualty count due to reckless driving and careless policing keeps rising. This is just an average figure, so no need to panic, Pandey asserted on Friday.																								He had no answer to why the number of deaths was shooting up. There was also no reasoning behind why no one should panic. Instead, he chose to blame the newspapers for painting an alarming state of affairs.																								Pandey went on to announce some measures that have proved ineffective in the past. Sample this: Thirty drivers involved in fatal accidents will be given a three-day training in how to drive better and more carefully. A similar exercise, undertaken last year, had only resulted in the number of mishap casualties going up.																								There was no mention of action not being taken against buses stopping in the middle of the road, of cars being parked on either side of a road where parking is allowed only on one side (a regular feature on Middleton Street); of police looking the other way when taxi drivers stop in the middle of the road to pick up passengers.																								But Pandey did offer his condolences to every mishap victim in the city. He pointed out that compared with last year, the number of cases against rash drivers had gone up: 3,300, up from 2100.																								As consolation, Pandey said: Dont worry, we (the traffic police wing) are here to take care of things. Just trust us and leave it to us. 																								This comment comes precisely 24 hours after three persons were mowed down and killed in road accidents across the city.

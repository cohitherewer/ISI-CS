	Mother Dairy has always supplied quality milk and milk products, maintaining impeccable product standards. However, recently the quality of toned and double-toned milk has deteriorated considerably. Regular consumers like me could easily detect the difference. I understand it must be difficult to maintain the high quality of the products over the years given the rising production costs, but I hope the organisation would be able to overcome the hiccups and retain its standards. Stringent processing and quality control measures by means of random sampling can prove to be effective in realising the goal. The quality of the ingredients that go into the making of the finished products should also be tested and improved. Laboratory checks must be conducted to determine the purity of the raw materials. I am sure if these steps are taken, the consumers will have no reason to complain about the products. Sunil Banerjee, VIP Road. 
	Some private buses are issuing outdated tickets to passengers. Recently, I was handed two Rs 2.25 tickets in a minibus whereas it is well-known that the minimum fare now is Rs 3.50. Sometimes, the conductor also gives a ticket of a value greater than what we pay for. The transport authorities should ensure that buses issue proper tickets to passengers. Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 
	On the morning of July 17, I had a bitter experience along with my co-passengers in a Garia-bound CTC bus (WB 04B-5664). The driver stepped on the accelerator and raced the bus with others on the same route. He narrowly averted ramming into a few private cars. We were literally praying for our lives throughout the journey. If by any chance the driver had lost control of the vehicle even for a second, the bus would have veered off the road and turned turtle. Our repeated requests to the conductor to slow down went in vain as he said it was not in his place to make such a request. Frequent accidents fail to dissuade such drivers from mending their ways. Jaydip Paul, Salt Lake. 
	In some of the long distance trains of Eastern and South Eastern Railway, the window latches are broken. Passengers are forced to bear the chill and the shower for no fault of theirs. Add to that the fact that the fans and taps inside the toilets are often in disrepair. The window inside the toilet is often missing. Railway authorities should make sure that all the sleeper compartments are in good condition. Though rail fare is being hiked every now and then, there has been no improvement in the amenities available to passengers. B.N. Bose, Dum Dum Park.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 65 deaths in 64 days
 OUR BUREAUCalcutta Police flagged off its training course for drivers charged with dangerous driving, even as the death count for the year crossed the number of days.																								The chilling statistics on Thursday read 65 deaths in 64 days, with a 50-year-old resident of Salt Lakes Duttabad area steering a cycle van getting run over by a lorry on the EM Bypass.																								Another person on the van was seriously injured in the mishap near the Bagmari Road crossing, under Maniktala police station, early on Thursday.																								Ramesh Das was taking a van loaded with vegetables towards Ultadanga at 4.30 am when a lorry rammed into the three-wheeler. Ramesh was rushed to Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.																								Madhab Bhar, 60, who was on the same cycle van, was admitted to ESI Hospital in Maniktala and later shifted to a private hospital on the Bypass. Doctors said the condition of Bhar, a member of CPMs Salt Lake 1 local committee, was critical. Police said the lorry could not be traced.																								In another accident early on Thursday, 65 passengers and the driver were injured after a bus fell into a ditch in Howrah. The driver of the bus, carrying a group from a wedding in Narkeldanga, lost control on Howrah-Amta Road, said Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police, Howrah.																								Around 1 am, the bus hit three light posts and rammed into a tree before toppling over into a ditch. The passengers managed to scramble out and rescue the unconscious driver.																								Amidst the spate of mishaps, police hit the streets with another move to curb the accident count. A three-day training programme for drivers, whose licences have been suspended on charges of rash driving, was started on Thursday, said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic).																								After the three-day theoretical training on the dos and donts of driving, these rogue drivers will be taken to important intersections and told what they had been doing wrong.																								Later, a test will be conducted and those who pass it will be given back their licences, said joint commissioner Basu.

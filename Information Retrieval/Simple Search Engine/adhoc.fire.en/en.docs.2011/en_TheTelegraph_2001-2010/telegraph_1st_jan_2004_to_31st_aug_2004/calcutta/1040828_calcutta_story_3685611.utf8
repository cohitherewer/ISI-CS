 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Subhas breaks silence to cry foul
 A STAFF REPORTERAvtar Singh (top) and Subhas Chakraborty: In defence 																								After keeping a safe distance from Avtar Singh since his arrest on August 15, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty finally rushed to the defence of athlete Jyotirmoyee Sikdars husband on Friday.																								Hinting that the arrest may have been unfair, he reacted sharply to reports that police had gone to Singhs Salt Lake hotel looking for criminal Hath Kata Dilip, involved in a recent murder.																								Listen, if police have information that a murderer is hiding in someones house, but they find nothing when they raid the place, can they arrest all family members? Are they authorised to take everyone else into custody? demanded the minister, alleged to have showered Singh with favours after his wife had done the state proud in the Asian Games.																								Singh was transferred to Dum Dum Central jail from Barrackpore sub-jail on Friday. After spending 10 days at SSKM Hospital complaining of various aches and pains, he had been escorted to a Barrackpore cell late on Thursday.																								Caught in the CPMs factional fights within the North 24-Parganas unit, minister Chakraborty had initially denied any role in the rise of Singh as a businessman. Distancing himself from Singhs alleged vice den in Salt Lake, he said he had nothing to do with the allotment of the plot or issuing of the bar licence.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refused to comment on Chakrabortys outburst against his police force on Friday.																								Takei jigyesh karun (Ask the person himself), was the chief ministers terse reply when Chakrabortys accusation of unfair police action was brought to his notice on Friday evening.																								Party sources, meanwhile, maintained that the chief minister had given the personal go-ahead for the raid on Singhs hotel. 																								Sikdar being a CPM parliamentarian, the instructions could not have but come from the top, they argued.																								Bidhannagar Municipality chairman Dilip Gupta made it clear that the police were only doing their job.																								Its time we started calling a spade a spade, said Gupta. Please remember that police will cut a sorry figure later if they do commit excesses in such a case, he argued.

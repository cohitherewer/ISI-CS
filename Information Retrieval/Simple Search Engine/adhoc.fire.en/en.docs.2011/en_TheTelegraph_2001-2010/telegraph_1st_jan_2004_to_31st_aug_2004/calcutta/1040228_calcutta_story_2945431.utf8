					PICTURE BY RASHBEHARI DAS Mainul and Sulagna show off some of the clothes from the new Raymond store 															Raymond, one of the leading menswear brands in the country recently opened their newest store in the city on Park Street. The speciality of the new shop is its vast collection of fine suitings and all the other Raymond apparel brands are available here as well in an effort to provide fashion-conscious males with the complete shopping experience.																					The new Raymond store especially targets those who are about to tie the knot. Says S.K. Gupta, vice-president, textiles, Raymond Limited, The only thing that Park Street lacked in terms of becoming a haven for wedding shopping was a Raymond outlet and thats what inspired us to open our new store.																					e at The Raymond Shop, check out the exclusive Manzoni collection, which is primarily aimed at the boardroom boys. The styling of this collection is urbane and inspired by Italy. Opulent and lavishly embellished, Manzoni shirts (Rs 1,695 onwards) are available in a variety of styles including regular collar, button-down collar and cut-away collar styles, French cuffs, solids in twills and checks in plain and mixed weaves. 																					The Manzoni suits are made from premium poly-wools and other fabrics and great attention has been paid to the feel and fall of the fabric. Of course, be prepared to shrug out at least Rs 15,000 for one of these suits while a pure silk Italian tie from Manzoni would set you back by Rs 995 or more.																					Those who prefer to stick to the tried and tested can choose from the wide range of Park Avenue shirts, trousers, suits, jackets and accessories available at The Raymond Shop. For the young at heart, there are reasonably-priced Parx shirts and trousers in cotton and other blends as well as denims and polo-necks. For details, contact 2227 2155.

 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Battlecry over billboards
 																											- Street beautification review activates demolition squad DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee held two meetings on Tuesday to decide on corrective measures for the beautification project in progress on Camac Streets pavements. 																								The first meeting  attended by, among others, municipal commissioner Debashis Som, municipal secretary Sajal Bhowmik and director-general (civil) Uday Shankar Sengupta  reviewed the state of the billboard jungle on Camac Street.																								It was learnt that the street has more billboards than registered in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) records. The unauthorised ones will be dismantled, it was decided. 																								Those willing to put up billboards on the stretch will have to abide by the CMC-stipulated size, display position and angles. The steps are being taken in keeping with the civic bodys policy to curb visual pollution.																								The authorities have already pulled down seven billboards. Officials will now serve notices on outdoor publicity agencies, issuing them a 24-hour deadline to remove billboards that are not parallel to the carriageway or are belying the aim of the beautification scheme. The authorities have identified more than 22 such billboards along the Camac Street pavements. 																								We started sending out notices from Tuesday afternoon, asking the publicity firms to pull down their billboards, said a civic official. 																								Mayor Mukherjees second meeting was with his council member Rajib Deb and chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar. 																								Municipal commissioner Som asked Sarkar to swoop down on Camac Street with pay-loaders and a demolition squad, razing all permanent and temporary blockades. I want action from Tuesday night, the commissioner reportedly said. 																								An 80-member team was formed to carry out the operation. Two pay-loaders have been allotted for the purpose. 																								Assistant director (conservancy) Swapan Mahapatra visited the street to assess the logistical support the team will need to complete its work in two-and-a-half hours. It was found that the western pavement between AJC Bose Road and Shakespeare Sarani was heavily encroached upon.

 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Training school for Montessori teachers
 SANJAY MANDAL																								A dearth of trained teachers is taking a toll on the quality of Montessori and kindergarten schools, feel those associated with child education. To fill up the void, Jadavpur University (JU) opens a training institute for teachers in the field on Monday.																								The university has tied up with the city-based Nopani group of educational institutes to set up the training school, said JU officials on Sunday. Classes for the one-year course start on Monday with 20 candidates.																								The Nopani group had placed the proposal for a training institute before the university, which also featured the syllabus and curriculum. The university will supervise the examinations and award certificates, said Tandra Mitra, head of the department of JUs adult continuing education and extension, under the engineering faculty.																								Samuel Raj, director and rector, Nopani group of educational institutes, said classes will be held at the schools Pretoria Street address. We will provide the infrastructure, including the teaching faculty, he said, adding that training would be given to teachers from schools owned by the group and from others as well.																								This is the first time we are collaborating with a private school to open a training institute. If the experiment clicks, we will upgrade the training module, said Mitra. The number of candidates can also be increased from the existing 20 after further screening of the applications.																								The authorities of various Montessori and kindergarten schools across the city welcomed the move for a training institute. 																								Quality teachers in Montessori schools are difficult to come by. This institute can play a very important role. The trainees must keep in mind that they need to be patient and attentive to the individual needs of children. These are the primary requisites in handling toddlers, said Neelakshi Shukla, principal of Beginners Montessori House in Lake Town. 																								The Nopani group will also introduce a six-month training course for mothers of the students on its Rabindra Sarani campus, Raj said. During parent-teacher meetings, several mothers have expressed their inability to guide their children at home. We have informed the parents of our plans. A number of applications have already poured in, he added. The course for mothers will comprise psychology, childcare, personality development and computers.

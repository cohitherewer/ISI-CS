 Friday, August 13, 2004 Raise the weekend bar: juggle, jam 'n' jive in midweek mixZeeshan Jawed, Himika Chaudhuri Bartender Raj Nagra lights some fire at TantraIf its not beats its bartending to enliven things on a drab Wednesday evening. Midweek crisis hung in mid-air in Tantra as flair bartender Raj Nagra from Australia flipped up some fervent fun. Flying bottles and clinking glasses were reason enough for the disc to fill to the brim with partygoers raising a toast to the juggling act. They had more reason to cheer as the bartender concocted some quirky cocktails. Mixes like Daiquiri, Mojito and Cosmopolitan kept up spirits till pretty late in the day even though the cocktails were essentially fruity flavoured. Ones who missed out on the fun can toy with the following trivia: Flair bartending is a 150-year-old style involving some fast and furious action. Also one of the most efficient techniques of mixing, it involves multi-bottle pours, inverted catches and grabs, elegant body movements resembling martial arts, behind the back throws and the like.  Orient Express jam at Malgudi Junction at their birthday bash; BandwagonMalgudi Junction, the cosy South Indian speciality coffee shop on Camac Street got converted into something like a Spanish countryside Inn on Wednesday evening as contemporary Latin band Orient Express celebrated their seventh birthday with trademark Latino music and some spirited dancing. Cooling things off once in a while were rounds of lemony iced tea. The food joint shut for the general public from early Wednesday evening was transformed into a performance platform with full acoustics, a hoard of eager listeners and of course, some of the best musicians about town. The traditional cake-slicing over with, it was time for music and masti as the entire Orient Express gang took to their instruments and kicked off with the popular Mambo No 5 before launching into some sizzling salsa. The evening will be incomplete without us playing salsa, which is an important part of Latino music, said Monojit Dutta, the band leader, before inviting musicians from among the audience to jam with them. Thus everyone, from ex-Orient Express members to young singer Tanya right on to Skinny Alley veterans Jayashree and Gyan, shared either an instrument or their voices with the birthday boys. The short but sweet birthday bash proved that live music can thrive beyond the borders of Park Street. Its another matter that this venue was just round the corner. Model Jessica sports jadau jewellery at Diagold.Stud stunThe forthcoming festive spirit is catching on with some new launch or the other every day. A new jewellery line was unveiled at Diagold in Metro Plaza on Thursday in keeping with the mood. Jadau is the flavour of the moment at the store, a craft that originated in the north-western parts of India. A colourful array of precious stones set in gold defines the look of the jewellery. The idea is culled from ancient times when Awadhi artisans would combine the techniques of kundan-jadtar that involved setting stones like emeralds, sapphires, rubies, pearls and diamonds in a 24k gold casing. The current line of jewellery at Diagold has been inspired by these designs but with a contemporary touch said Varda Goenka, owner of Diagold.In fact, the line is clearly Indo-western in nature to complement the urban Indian woman sold to western clothing. Very traditional, yet very unconventional is how Varda likes to define the collection.ine comprises neckpieces with long cascading pendants, chandelier earrings, chokers, cocktail rings and chunky bracelets.I believe in doing fusion designs for the modern Indian woman willing to experiment with her clothes as well as her accessories, said Varda.The range is priced between Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000.Craft corner The exhibition of handicrafts and handloom from Andhra Pradesh being held in LePakshi, the outlet of Andhra Pradesh Handicrafts Development Corporation in Dakshinapan, is a must check-out. With everything from colourful wooden toys to kalamkari saris selling under one roof, this is indeed a slice of Andhra being made available closer home. The exhibition is especially a great place for homemakers, who can pick up things like wooden wall panels carved out of one piece of wood with an antique look, or go for leather lamp shades or dress up the walls with kalamkari paintings or simply pick up a Nirmal painting on wood. The prices begin at Rs 330 for a leather lampshade, Rs 108 for a wooden panel, Rs 250 for a cotton wall-hanging and Rs 250 for a Nirmal painting.

 															- Neighbours stay indoors while gang of youths beats up brother and two sisters A STAFF REPORTER																								Howrah is a horror for women, complain residents, with eve-teasers ruling the roads after dusk. And on Thursday evening, a 22-year-old Howrah resident and his two sisters were brutally told how bad things really are.																								Julius Gomes was assaulted on Thursday evening for protesting the teasing of his two sisters by a group of youths close to their Shibtala Lane home. His two sisters were harassed, dragged by the hair and beaten up.																								Julius was returning home, under Shibpur police station, when a group of nine local youths started passing lewd remarks at his sisters. When I asked them to stop making such vulgar remarks, they started abusing me and then proceeded to beat me up, complained Julius, who filed an FIR with Shibpur police station.																								The youths rained blows on Julius, kicked him in the abdomen, snatched his spectacles and smashed it to bits. When Juliuss elder sister tried to save him, she was dragged by the hair and shoved to the ground. 																								They started kicking her in the stomach They repeatedly said they would teach her a lesson for trying to act smart, Julius said.																								As four youths held both Julius and his elder sister to the ground and beat them up, a few other youths surrounded his younger sister. One of them pulled at her dupatta. Lying on the ground, I could make out that the youths were pulling my younger sister into a corner. She was crying, but the youths kept slapping her, Julius added.																								The assault continued for around 15-20 minutes, till some local residents intervened and asked the youths to stop. All this while, I was crying for help, but no one dared to come to our rescue, complained Julius, who suffered injuries on his ribs, elbows and chest.																								He escorted his two sisters back to their house in Shibtala Lane. The entire area was plunged in darkness and I couldnt venture out of my house The youths had threatened to beat up me and my sisters if they spotted us again. I then called the police station, requesting help, added Julius.																								Senior police officers, including Deben Biswas, inspector-general of police (South Bengal), DIG (headquarters) Raj Kanojia and others, directed the local police in Shibpur to tackle the situation immediately.																								S. Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Shibpur police station, sent a police team to Shibtala Lane. They (Julius and his sisters) seemed terrified when we found them locked inside their house. They have all been brought to the police station, said an officer. Later, the three were taken to the Howrah district hospital, where a medical team examined them and treated their wounds.																								Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police (Howrah), said late on Thursday that the culprits will be tracked down and arrested as soon as possible.

																								Stunting a childs growth is a delinquency in its own right. Be it an act of over-protectiveness on the part of the parents or an introduction of the child into a debilitating environment. Bijoy Bhattacharyas Atmaja is a play that addresses the issue of such a crisis that invades the lives of the children in our society and threatens to obliterate their dreams and aspirations. It is about the ruthless murder that parents commit; a murder of the hopes and ambitions of their children because they want their sons and daughters to live their lives according to a dictum conceptualized and put to effect by themselves. In the process, the child is stripped of a self that he can call his own; he grows in years but under the shadow of his parents and the burden of their expectations. The protagonist in Atmaja is a little girl whose parents have decided her future well in advance. On the one hand is the girls mother who wants her daughter to be a chartered accountant while the father aspires to make a doctor of his child. Atmaja is an experimental play that aims at shaking society out of its stupor and awakening its citizens to the plight of the helpless child.

 															- Plan to name adjacent gardens after Rammohun Roy, Dwarkanath Tagore OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 Governor Viren J. Shah meets morning-walkers at Victoria Memorial. A Telegraph picture																								The state government is not ready to accept the recommendation of the committee set up to introduce entry fees for the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds.																								Appearing on behalf of the state before a division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday, advocate-general Balai Roy sought a few days time for his client to consider the matter.																								The division bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Tapan Dutt, granted the states prayer and fixed the matter for hearing on August 10.																								The judges said the two proposed gardens, coming up on the fairgrounds adjacent to the Hall, should be named after Raja Rammohun Roy and Prince Dwarkanath Tagore. There isnt any garden named after these two personalities anywhere in the city. Therefore, it will only be apt if the twin gardens are named after them, said Justice Ganguly. The hearing continued for over 45 minutes in courtroom 12 on Wednesday morning. 																								 It has been proposed that one of the twin parks will be laid out jointly by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the city police, while the other will be the exclusive job of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners. This apart, the Bengal Rose Society has sent a proposal to the Hall authorities to create a special rose garden.																								Appearing on behalf of the city police, commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty said special measures will be taken to ensure that the beautified Hall grounds are kept free of trouble-makers. 																								Governor Viren J. Shah and myself visited the area and he expressed his desire for undertaking beautification and landscaping of the plot on the eastern side, as well as the southern side, of the Hall, commissioner Chakraborty told the court.																								The CMC has already started the beatification, in accordance with the Calcutta High Courts plan, and as recommended by the expert committee appointed by the court, police told the court. 																								Calcutta Police is also considering ways to reduce vehicular pollution in and around the Victoria Memorial Hall complex. We are considering the idea of diverting vehicular traffic from the area so that pollution can be reduced to a great extent, a senior officer of the traffic department said on Wednesday.																								Petitioner Subhas Dutta told the court that the drainage system on the southern side of the Hall will have to be repaired.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Clean city, not at our cost
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should candidates be penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days? More letters will be published next week OPERATION WIPEOUT: Police supervise the erasing of election graffiti on a public building. A Telegraph pictureMd Ayub, 
																		Bright Street.																																																														Yes. The election commissioner should issue a notice to all parties, warning them of strict punishment if they do not remove the graffiti after the polls. Post election, the winning party is usually busy celebrating and forming the government. And the losing side pleads that it doesnt have the money to remove the graffiti, as it has lost the election. Decades of independence has not been conducive to framing of rules that could restrain politicians from defacing public and private property with graffiti. Now, the general public has almost become indifferent to the visual pollution because it is convinced that the administration is helpless against the menace. 									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge. 																																																														The present democratic system, ruled by brute politicians, is responsible for marring the aesthetic appeal of any place, whether in an urban area or rural, by means of poll graffiti. Candidates should be penalised if poll graffiti is not removed within a stipulated time. But there are reservations as to how far such a punitive law will be respected by party workers, when unruly leaders are known to openly defy court directives.									

Prantik Sanyal,
																		SP Mukherjee Road.																																																														Sir Issac Newtons third law says that every action has a reaction. Hence, those who pollute the city must also face the music. The question, however, is that who will bell the cat. Most party leaders work only for vested interests. They are of the opinion that they are the sultans of their constituencies. Laws and rules are fine, but their execution against politicians is the difficult part. Even the high court order against excessive use of microphones in residential areas was not implemented. 									

Anil Kumar Sen, 
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 																																																														The parties should realise that outsiders judge them by the cleanliness of the place they govern. Moreover, defacing public property is a punishable offence under the penal code. Despite that, it is noticed that political parties do not bother to erase poll graffiti after the election. Therefore, it is necessary that the candidate should be penalised if poll graffiti is not removed within seven days. 									

Anirban Mandal, 
																		Chinsurah, Hooghly.																																																														Of course, the candidate should be penalised if the partys poll graffiti is not removed within seven days because if it is allowed to be displayed for a longer period, it is as good as advertising in favour of the party free of cost. 									

Sunil Banerjee, 
																		VIP Road.																																																														Poll graffiti amounts to serious visual pollution and deserves to be removed as soon as the election is over. But, unfortunately, most candidates have a lackadaisical attitude towards their duty of removing the graffiti. Instead, they are adamant and unreasonable when questioned about their reluctance to do so. Such candidates should definitely be penalised. 									

Sandhya Banerjee, 
																		Salt Lake. 																																																														In my opinion, poll graffiti should be removed as early as possible. Just like polling is an integral part of the democratic process, so are the party banners and posters. But removing them post-elections is also an integral part of keeping the city clean. Many a time we try to follow the initiative taken by foreigners in maintaining the cleanliness of their cities. But only small yet important steps, like removing poll graffiti after the election is over, can really make a difference. 									

Anuva Chowdhury, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														Campaigning is very much a part of the election process. And the parties have the liberty to choose their medium for campaigning  via television, radio, newspapers and by arranging public gatherings. But these are comparatively less polluting. Posters, festoons, leaflets, etc, used for election purpose, are left to add to the untidy look of the city. Candidates should take the help of party activists to remove all these publicity materials. Unfortunately, no political party really cares about environmental issues. Therefore, dirtying the city on the pretext of poll campaigning should be made a punishable offence. 									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park. 																																																														That the proposition is most reasonable and welcome goes without saying. It would have been best to ban the practice of putting up graffiti. But as matters stand, it should be at least made mandatory that the parties erase their graffiti within a fortnight. The candidates will be forced to adhere to the rules when they are squarely penalised. Simple civic sense should motivate them to comply. But the tragedy of our land is that it is easier to enact than to enforce rules. 									

Pradip Kumar Saha, 
																		Bhadreswar, Hooghly. 																																																														People expect that the contesting candidates, both at the state and central level, would take care to remove poll graffiti as soon as the election is over. After all, the politicians are the law-makers of the society. Obviously, if found neglecting their duties, they should be penalised. 									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Rakhal Ghosh Lane. 																																																														Seven days is too little time for removing the poll graffiti from the entire city. A longer time span  say 15 days  should be allowed. If the political activists cannot carry out this mandate, the candidate should be squarely penalised. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore. 																																																														Surprisingly, no one has ever given a thought to the fact that if the parties lack the minimum courtesy to clear the graffiti after election, how can they be entrusted with the mammoth task of ruling a state or a country? However, the civic bodies are better suited for taking up the work of removing graffiti. If the party concerned fails to clear the graffiti within a week, it should be penalised. And, if any party refuses to pay the fine, the matter should be referred to the election commission, which is empowered to take drastic measures against the party.

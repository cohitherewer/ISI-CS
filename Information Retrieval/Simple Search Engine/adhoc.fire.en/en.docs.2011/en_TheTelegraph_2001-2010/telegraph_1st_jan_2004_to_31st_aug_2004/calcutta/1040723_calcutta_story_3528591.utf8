 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 A tryst with lady luck 
 June felicitates Pampa Chatterjee at the Kenilworth on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Adding a whole new chapter to the rags-to-riches saga is Pampa Chatterjee, lucky winner of a two-crore jackpot from Playwin.																								Chatterjee was presented a UTI Bank cheque of Rs 1,80,00,912.00  after tax deductions  by Harish Jotwani, marketing manager, Playwin, and actress June on Wednesday.																								Now, my family can finally afford a decent lifestyle, smiled Chatterjee.																								Her immediate concerns: how to expand the small and struggling grocery store her husband owns (maybe into more of a departmental store), get proper medical attention for her father-in-law, build a house, buy a car																								But first, she must send her 10-year-old daughter to a better school. She is brilliant I am thinking of admitting her to one of the leading schools in the city like La Martiniere or South Point, said Chatterjee, the day after her date with bounty.																								Taking care of a family of six comprising herself, her husband, their daughter, her father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law was proving to be a real strain.																								Wednesday should change all that. Now, its expansion not subsistence, making the right investments and not making ends meet that is the prime concern of the crorepati Chatterjees.																								For Pampa Chatterjee, the first woman from West Bengal to win a jackpot Playwin prize, practice has truly made perfect.																								I often used to buy lottery tickets and won small prizes like Rs 50 to 100, which kept my hopes alive, said Chatterjee.																								After the introduction of online gaming, Chatterjee logged firmly on to the Internet in a bid to net bigger fish. It all paid off in February 2004 when she suddenly hit bulls eye  the Playwin Super Lotto Jackpot.																								Not a bad deal at all for an investment of around Rs 1,000 which she spent over the past two years hoping for handsome returns.																								I burst into tears when I heard the news. I just couldnt believe that an ordinary person like me could suddenly turn so lucky, Chatterjee recounted her first reaction.																								The shy housewife must grapple with tax hurdles that will knock off a good amount from her prize money. 																								The money Chatterjee has got now is after a 10 per cent deduction from the Sikkim government, one of the two states we represent. The total deductions amount to 31.5 per cent, which shell have to pay when she files her income-tax returns, clarified Jotwani.																								The cuts still leave Chatterjee well over a crore richer. She, however, is unlikely to go on a splurge spree just yet. My first priority is to get my father-in-law treated properly. He has been ailing for quite some time, said Chatterjee.																								Playwin, the first company to introduce online gaming in the country two years ago, has produced 45 crorepatis and over 2,000 lakhpatis.																								For the moment, Pampa Chatterjee is the envy of most. I wish I had won the prize, sighed prize-giver June. I would have been able to make two movies with it. Maybe Ill brainwash Pampa to produce one of my films.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

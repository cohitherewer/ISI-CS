 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A group of 12 members of a European delegation was in Howrah on Wednesday to discuss improvement of the towns sewerage and water sanitation. The delegation is here on an invitation by the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC). 																								A seminar was organised at Sarat Sadan to discuss a revamp of the sewerage and solid-waste management system. The HMC has asked the team to prepare a project report on these aspects, before its sanctions funds for their implementation.																								Once we prepare the project report, we will be able to chalk out the final plan to revamp these services and funds will not be a problem, said Elina Magnie, project coordinator. The team will allot the entire funds for the renovation projects, apart from technical expertise. 																								The 12-member team visited a few pockets of Howrah town to inquire about the civic problems related to the sewerage system and drinking water supply. They are keen to develop those services, too, though no formal proposal has yet been conveyed. 																								According to the HMC officials, the visit is a positive signal for the development of the municipal areas. They are pleased with the outcome of Wednesdays discussions and hope the it breaks the HMC jinx on reviving the towns civic services. 																								After the visit, the European team will prepare a project report on how to develop the particular areas, applying their skills and techniques, which will be a boon for the cash-strapped municipality, said deputy mayor, Monika Biswas.																								Biswas said the HMC, since its inception, had lacked the funds to renovate the drainage and other systems of the corporation areas. 																								Members of the delegation said after the project report is ready, an intimation will be sent to the central government for a final certificate of approval and a go-ahead on the projects.																								As it is an Indo-European cooperation project for sewerage and water sanitation improvement in the state, the West Bengal will also have to furnish a no-approval certificate,said project coordinator Magnie. 																								Four municipalities have been selected in West Bengal for a revamp of civic services  Howrah, Asansol, Durgapur and Siliguri. The team has already toured Durgapur and Asansol.																								Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee, when asked about the delegations help, said: Were happy that Howrah is on their list and hope they bail us out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Zee ABCs for rural classrooms
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 The Calcutta auditions for the Zee talent hunt: Village-bound																								The last letter in the alphabet was the first off the block when it came to launching the recent spate of nationwide screen talent hunts with Indias Best Cinestars ki Khoj Mein. Now Zee Network plans to spread its wings to further the cause of education. We are planning to improve the quality of education in the rural ekal vidyalayas (one-teacher schools), chairman of Zee network Subhas Chandra said, while traveling from Kala Mandir back to his hotel. 																								A few minutes earlier, the Zee chief had thundered on stage against the bade bade baatein of leaders of the BJP-RSS combine, who were too happy to restrict the definition of literacy to the ability to sign ones name. Literacy should mean education till at least Class IV. I had raised the matter with human resources development minister Murli Manohar Joshi. But politicians are afraid that if the bar is raised, the literacy figure will drop to below 50 per cent. 																								Chandra was addressing members of the Friends of Tribals Society, dedicated to the uplift of the backward in the forests, on the occasion of the annual function of its Calcutta chapter. 																								Chandra plans to instal television sets in schools that require help and provide uplinking facilities. Educational programmes based on board syllabi will be beamed into classrooms in the remotest corners. 																								We do not want to disturb the present infrastructure. All we want is to supplement it, Chandra said. Talim Research Foundation, a literary, scientific and charitable trust run by Zees sister concern Essel Group of Industries in Ahmedabad, is currently engaged in developing the content. 																								Explaining the need for external help, Chandra said: The regular teacher on the government rolls does not bother to attend school. He gets hold of some other boy and tells him, Bhai tum jake hamare jagah parhao. At the end of the month, he charges the government his full salary of Rs 7,000-8,000. The other person gets a share of Rs 2,000-3,000. The teaching quality suffers this way. The project, entitled Basic Education Support Television (BEST), therefore, also incorporates training of teachers. 																								Chandra is looking at an April 2005 deadline to put in place 10,000 sets. 																								We will start with the next years session. It took us time to take permission from the state governments. The Hindi-speaking areas  Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana  will be taken up first. This feed will not be available in cable homes though. It is meant just for the schools, Chandra clarified. 																								Speaking on a different note, the Zee chairman expressed confidence that the conditional access system will happen because people will want it. 																								Consumers have been misled by vested interests. Other than the cable operators, quite a lot of broadcasters are also opposing it, I dont know why, Chandra said, refusing to name the big players.

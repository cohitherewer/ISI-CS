The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Artists with a distinct style
																								Art is at its best when left to speak for itself . The artist lends it a form, but it is the onlookers sole discretion as to how he wishes to interpret it. The on-going exhibition showcases the works (in charcoal and oil) of two promising artists, Kanchanmala Ghosh and Dipak Roy. Ghosh (whose painting The Boy appears above) is currently working on charcoal and acrylic white, which expresses different moods of desolation, resignation, vacancy, alienation and the exhaustion of being. Though she prefers to work on facial expressions and postures that reveal the internal life, her paintings are also engaged with the surrounding realm of the natural. Roy, on the other hand, works particularly on oil with multi coloured shades. His paintings are about the distribution of colour and line on the canvas space, adding an element of speed into the composition. 																								Event: Paintings by Kanchanmala Ghosh and Dipak Roy																								When: Till August 27; 2 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery

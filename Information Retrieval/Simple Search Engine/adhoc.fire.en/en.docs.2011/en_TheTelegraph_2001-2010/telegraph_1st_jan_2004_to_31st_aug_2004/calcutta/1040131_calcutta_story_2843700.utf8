 															- Traffic sergeants rescue lawyer from abductors A STAFF REPORTER																								It was drama at high noon. A gang of six men tried to abduct a lawyer in Salt Lake on Friday afternoon. However, the attempt was foiled by three sergeants of the Shyambazar Traffic Guard, who intercepted the vehicle in which the hostage was being carried away. 																								The lawyer was crying for help with half his body outside the window. Police said two persons have been arrested and the lawyer, V.S. Bengani, is unhurt.																								Bengani, 49, a resident of Phoolbagan, was on his way to the Debt Recovery Tribunal I, on the first floor of Salt Lakes IA market, in the Bidhannagar South police station area, in connection with the bid for a company that is to be sold. Bengani wanted to find out the status of his clients bid from the recovery officer. 																								I was about to climb the stairs of the market when four men intercepted me, Bengani recollected. They said they were local residents and that I could not proceed for the bidding before speaking to them.																								After a few minutes argument, two members of the gang grasped Benganis arms, while two others pushed him into a Maruti van, waiting on the road. Two of the goons got in, while four others hopped into an Ambassador. The Ambassador was ahead of the Maruti and both vehicles went speeding down the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. 																								Three men, including the driver, were in the Maruti and the others were in the Ambassador. I kept quiet, as there was no use shouting. The vehicles were moving at high speed, Bengani recounted. Though rattled by the turn of events, Bengani kept his cool.																								At the Ultadanga-Hudco crossing, the traffic signals changed and both vehicles came to a halt. Bengani grasped his last opportunity. I forced the window open, pushed out half of my body and cried myself hoarse for help, he said. 																								Three sergeants, on duty at the busy crossing, heard his cries and intercepted the Maruti van. While the driver and one of the gang members were arrested, the other one fled. The Ambassador, too, sped away. Lawyer Bengani alleged that the abduction was a plot by other bidders to block his client out of the deal.																								Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said the three sergeants, I.N. Mukherjee, Subhro Das Sharma and Tanmoy Biswas, intercepted the vehicle at around 3 pm. The sergeants placed a motorcycle in front of the Maruti van and detained two persons, Basu said, adding that the Ambassador managed to drive away. Both vehicles were headed towards VIP Road, he said. 																								A team from Maniktala police station then impounded the vehicle and arrested the abductors. They were handed over to Bidhannagar South police station, where a case has been lodged.

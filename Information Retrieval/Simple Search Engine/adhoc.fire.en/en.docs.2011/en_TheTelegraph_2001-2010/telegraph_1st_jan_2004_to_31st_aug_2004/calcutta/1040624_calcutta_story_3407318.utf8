The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Pay traffic offence fines on-line
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Things are looking up for traffic-rule violators. No more queuing up at bank counters, filling up a chalaan, returning to the traffic guard office with the counterpart of the pay-in slip. Just a mouse click will be enough to pay the fine and get back documents seized by the cops.																								For the first time in the country, Calcutta Police is set to introduce an on-line fine-payment system. What is needed is an SBI card or any credit card. Once the payment is recorded, well send back the seized documents, said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic).																								After receiving a ticket from a traffic sergeant, the offender will have to log on to our website (www.kolkatatrafficpolice.org), where he will see the specific directions for paying a fine. There will be a provision box, in which the violator will write the specific form-number written on the right top corner of his ticket. This number will reflect the details of the offender, explained joint commissioner Basu.																								There will be two options for paying fines. We will accept any credit card or the SBIs ATM card. The tie-up process with the card companies is underway, said Basu. At the end of the day, the data on our website will be examined. Once we find the payment has been recorded, the seized documents will be sent back. For this, we will engage courier companies. In the city, the documents should be returned within 24 hours, Basu added.																								However, the system will bar habitual offenders. We will transfer all data from our traffic departments record book to the website data-book. If the websites search engine finds the offender has a record, the on-line system will not allow him to pay the fine, Basu said.

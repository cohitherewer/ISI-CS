The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 Farewell, for a fresh, new look 
 															- Park Street confectionery closes doors till Christmas for rejuvenation A STAFF REPORTER				 	 LAST SIP: Inside Flurys on Sunday evening. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								The writing was on the Flurys wall on Independence Day: After 78 years of non-stop service, we are taking a break to come back with a fresh new look																								The morning after, the food counters started shifting from 18, Park Street to 57, Park Street and the doors swung shut on the citys only tea room.																								From August 17 till some time before Christmas, Flurys faithfuls must plan their mornings  or evenings, as the case may be without their leisurely cup of tea on the sink-in brown sofas.																								But all is not lost  the patties and the Baba cakes can be picked up from the Park Mansions outlet diagonally opposite the distinctive faade of Flurys.																								Talk of Flurys shutting down for a makeover had been doing the rounds for several summers now. Yes, we are finally shutting down for renovation, Priya Paul told Metro from Delhi on Sunday.																								The chairperson of The Park Hotels laughed off Park Street talk about Flurys being turned into a lounge bar (maybe with a dance floor thrown in).																								Let me set the record straight  the essential character of Flurys will be retained. It is, after all, an institution. There will be modern furniture and all that, but there is absolutely no question of turning it into a disco, said Priya Paul.																								The destination  for corn on toast and peach Monte Carlo  set up by J. Flurys and his wife in 1976, was bought over by Jit Paul in 1964.																								Even as the rest of the citys food street revved up  in phases  to keep pace with the times and it became hemmed in by Barista and One-Step-Up on one side and Caf Coffee Day on another, Flurys refused to shift gears.																								But growing grumbles about mouldy furniture and musty interiors, an ageing workforce and age-old platter made the makeover a matter of when rather than whether.																								The Pauls are aware that Flurys continues to evoke strong emotions among generations, for this has been a place for students and for senior citizens, for the lovestruck and the lovelorn.																								There are sun-streaked corners for college romances and for only the lonely. Memories mingle with meals as members of the Flurys family keep dropping in here for decades. Those settled in other cities and on other continents come back for a taste of Flurys whenever they are passing through.																								The idea, says Karan Paul, is to keep all the old-world tradition in mind while turning Flurys into a tea room for the future, brighter and better.																								Flurys is such a powerful magnet on Park Street and with its renovation, the entire area will become even more attractive, feels the chairman of the Apeejay Surrendra Group.																								The new-look Flurys will be unveiled in December, in time for the traditional Christmas and New Year rush.																								Till then, the Flurys fan club can stick to the opposite footpath, and keep its fingers crossed.

 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 A reel dream chased to Toronto
 Rimi Sen and Prosenjit (in the background)																								Its a dream come true for film-maker Buddhadeb Dasgupta and its one that has turned real without much of a chase.																								Dasguptas forthcoming film Swapner Din (Chased by Dreams)  starring Prosenjit, Raima Sen and the Mumbai-based Rimi Sen  will enjoy a world premiere at the 10-daylong 29th Toronto International Film Festival, starting September 9.																								With this, Dasgupta will become the first Indian film-maker to screen at the Toronto festival thrice in a row (following Uttara in 2000 and Mondo Meyer Upakhyan in 2002). 																								And Swapner Din becomes the first Bengali film to roll out of Bollywood producer Jhamu Lagaan Sugandhs stable.																								Reacting to the news, Dasgupta said: This is a rare honour. I am very glad because I like the Toronto Festival very much, which is probably only next to Cannes. It is also important for financial reasons, as Mondo Meyer Upakhyan had fetched a business of US $ 2.5 million last year.																								Tracing the journey of three people chasing different dreams and ambitions, Swapner Din has Prosenjit (Paresh) as the pivot, scouring the countryside in a jeep with a 16-mm film projector.																								Touching his life at several points are a driver (Rajesh Sharma) who dreams of making it big in Dubai and Amina (Rimi Sen), a pregnant Muslim girl migrating into India from Bangladesh. With no dialogues and appearing in more than one role, Raima flits in and out of Pareshs dreams. Raima Sen in Swapner Din 																								Dasgupta shot the film in 30 days flat last year, after extensively touring the rough landscape of Bankura and Birbhum for locations. When we shot at Santiniketan, a huge number of people would turn up to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars. One day, we even had to call off the shoot, said the director who expects to touch a chord across the world with this universal story of a man who is a wanderer at heart.																								It was a surprise to see what a tremendous urge Prosenjit had within to perform well. He would sit on the sets for hours and inquire about every detail, added Dasgupta.																								The challenge I faced was to turn Rimi into a rural woman. I had a workshop specially held for her with Sohag Sen and she turned out to be very sensitive. I am also satisfied with Raima and Rajeshs performance.																								Though the day of screening is yet to be finalised, Swapner Din has been chosen for the prestigious Masters section that exhibits new works of established directors.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

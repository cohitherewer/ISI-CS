The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Play down peppy tag
 ShaanHe wants Chingrir Paturi, but the hotel he has put up in has Chingrir Malaikari. That will do with some steamed rice please, smiles Shaan, his chocolate-boy charm working wonders. Catching a morning flight to Calcutta and taking the Science City stage for a soiree, Independence Day-eve found the Indipop singer busy as can be.																								Riding high on his chart-busting soundtracks in Hum Tum, Lakshya, Dhoom the boy from Baranagar (and Bandra) is up there, in every blockbuster releasing in Bollywood.																								I get to work in most major film projects but a few tracks in each only. Fortunately, those turn out to be hits and are used in the film promos as well, says the singer who shot to fame with the soulful Musu musu hasi in Raj Kaushals Pyar Mein Kabhie Kabhie. Yet, it was Woh ladki hai kahan in Dil Chahta Hai that almost rediscovered him as the voice of GenY.																								Some people feel my voice works for Saif, and also Abhishek and Arjun Ramphal, smiles Shaan. His urban finish and style of singing gel well with the on-screen yuppie brigade and hence the glut of peppy tracks in his kitty.																								But Shantanu Mukh-erjee (known to us as Shaan), the youthful singer, likes to think otherwise. I dont think I have become typecast, but some composers associate me more with peppy numbers. Those like Anu Malik and Himesh Reshammiya though have tried all kinds of styles from Chura liya to Mohabbat hai mirchi.																								Yet, the rules of the playback game have changed since the times of Kishore and Lata, he feels. Gone are the days when film-makers would wait for singers to give them dates. Now, it all depends on whoever is available at the moment. The composer and producers personal preferences are key factors as well.																								Though playback singing has earned him more fame than his private albums, Shaans heart lies off the big screen. Private albums are my own statement, he explains, having tasted success with Tanha dil and Bhool ja.																								Shaans third album Aksar has failed to set the cash registers ringing, but that hasnt slowed him down a bit. With sister Sagarika  with whom he had launched his career  Shaan is working hard on their first Bengali album. Most of the songs were composed by my father in the 1970s and 80s, and some are by Gouri-prasanna Majumder. So, the tracks will have a very different feel, he says, promising to be back for the Puja release.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

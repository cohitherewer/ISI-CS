The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 01, 2004 Next weekend you can be at...
DaringbariThe four-hour bus ride was the sort that only Dr Dolittle could have loved. If he had a nose clip, of course. And as if being sandwiched between smelly cud-chewing sheep, with a tattooed tribal as their guardian, was not enough, there was a caged hen trying to strike up a conversation with my shoelaces.There were also a few goats in the aisle and some people acting like goats up front. We were the only tourists on the bus and, being in a place which has seen very little of them, were the centre of attention. Rucksacks were a novelty and the camera, a box that could imprison their souls.But dont let all this put you off. There are trekkers, Ambassadors and jeeps that can be hired from outside Berhampur station for the journey to Daringbari, around 4,000 feet above sea level in Orissas Phulbani district. Its cold at that altitude and without fancy heaters and fireplaces, its the warmth of the residents that keeps the chills at bay.Daringbari is a tourist destination that never took off, even with its Kashmir of Orissa tag. Why, of plausible comparisons, it was called Kashmir, is open to question. Some say it has to do with the stray snowfall this hilltop received about 50 years ago, but expecting visitors half-a-century after a freak incident hardly seems a successful tourism campaign.Survival Kit  Light woollens are a must
 So is a torch for 
people interested in night jaunts through the woods (an 
enchanting experience)
 Carry toffees for tribal children to break the ice in the hamletsHow to get there Take Coromandal Express, Falaknama Express, Chennai Mail or East Coast Express from Howrah. Trekkers and private vehicles to Daringbari charge around Rs 2,000 for 250 km. To return to Berhampur, book a trekker in advance at Daringbari bazaar 
	Where to stay
There is a PWD Bungalow with two double-bed rooms, at Rs 100 per bed. A new Panthashala accommodation has recently been built with four double-bed rooms, at Rs 100 per bed.
For bookings, contact Utkal Bhavan (Orissa Tourism), 55 Lenin Sarani, 22443653, 22441195. Or just land up at the ashram at Daringbari bus stopSo Daringbari, a hilltop, has remained the way it always has been. Misty in the morning, pleasant in the afternoon and cold at night, and where everyone knows everyone else and the woods wear the colour of the season. There arent many houses, rolling hills stretch out as far as the eye can travel and wild flowers still adorn the hillsides and the hair of ornate tribal women.There are trails through the vast coffee and sandalwood plantations that lead to hamlets hidden by sprawling woods. The tribals are at once shy and curious and having never been threatened by the evils of a tourist explosion, very friendly. For those who feel walking the trails is not up their street, the sprinkling of churches in the vicinity, spires mimicking the tallest trees around them, provides the ideal excuse to stretch those limbs.Some tea-stalls and restaurants offer sustenance, while a PWD inspection bungalow and a missionary ashram at the Daringbari bus stop provide accommodation.The symphony of bird songs and church chimes welcomes the mornings at Daringbari and the tea stalls, with piping hot pakoras and tea, wait for the morning walkers to arrive. Its dj vu in the evenings, only with crickets and cicadas taking over from the birds for the night shift. Picture by Sajal Kumar Mondal

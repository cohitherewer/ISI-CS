The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 River, not flyover, cure for traffic mess
 SUBHRO SAHAUrban planning should always be people-centric and mimic natures cyclical processes, according to Ronald Shiffman, a New York-based city planner with 40 years experience in providing programme and organisational development assistance to community-based groups in low and moderate-income neighbourhoods.																								Calcutta should clean up its river on a priority basis and try and create social housing for the middle rung along the waterfront, not just elite condominiums, said Shiffman, who co-founded the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development in 1964. He was in the city for a lecture on urban planning at the American Center on Wednesday, co-sponsored by the Indian Institute of Architects, West Bengal Chapter.																								It is important to recognise your genetic footprints while developing your cityscape, as great cities like Paris and London have done. Look at your assets while planning, and Calcuttas assets are its river, its people and its unique colonial heritage, which need to be leveraged for the masses, not just the crme de la crme, he told Metro. Urban development cant be dictated by highway engineers and other technocrats, he stressed.																								Investing in a mass rapid transit system would work much better than building flyovers in a congested and chaotic city like Calcutta, felt the professor who has taught and developed courses on urban and community planning, participatory planning, sustainable development and the history and philosophy of community development.																								Only car owners benefit from flyovers, and every new road you build would just add to the demand. Calcutta can look at upgrading its clean, non-polluting trams, and use the river as an avenue of transport, emphasised Shiffman, who has served on a number of gubernatorial and mayoral task forces in New York and is actively involved in the post-9/11 rebuilding exercise.																								The Shiffmans  wife Yvette is a housing and planning consultant  have been fascinated by the character and splendour of Calcuttas central business district. I was involved in two very special housing projects in South Bronx and Harlem, where nearly 1,600 derelict apartments were renovated. We repopulated the neighbourhoods, trying to keep the streetscape almost same, Yvette recalled.																								She agreed with husband Ronald that the colonial structures of Dalhousie Square can be put to adaptive reuse through conservative intervention and restoration, while keeping the essential spirit of the district intact.																								Perhaps some of the universities could move a few departments to some of the structures idling at the moment and also house part of their staff there. Two New York Universities have shifted certain structures to Lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center attack to brighten up the gloomy quarters, said the professor.																								Physical renewal of the community can act as an engine for economic growth, and pressure groups working towards that goal in Calcutta should look to involving educational institutions in their effort. Bengal has such a strong education system, and centres like IIT, Kharagpur, IIM, Joka, Calcutta and Jadavpur universities can contribute significant inputs to the citys planning process, he felt.																								You have the raw bones. All you need is political will and sensitive planning, keeping the solid middle class and the economically weaker sections in mind. Although we have made many critical errors, a leaf can still be taken out of the US model, said Shiffman, who was an executive committee member of the International Research and Exchange for Development (IRED) and is immediate past president of the Salzburg Congress on Urban Planning and Development.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 A slice of home life goes abroad
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 				 	 Two of the 12 boys who shot a film that is now going places 																								From wandering the mean streets of Calcutta to travelling to Athens and directing a film in between, life has been one big roller-coaster ride for 12-year-old Ashikul.																								He and 11 others, all inmates of a home for destitute children, have ganged up to conceptualise and direct a unique film, a showcase of their dreams, that is ready to head for Greece this summer.																								Ami, the 20-minute Bengali documentary capturing life as seen by the 12 kids from Calcutta, is the solitary Indian entry in the Kids for Kids International Film Festival, to be held between June 4 and 13 in Athens.																								Initially, we were all asked to come up with our ideas and jot them down on paper. Later, we enacted these ideas in front of camera, says Ashikul, an inmate of Muktoneer, the home run by Free the Children-India on the citys northern fringes. So, the film finds the children laughing and living just the way they do during a day at home.																								Organised by the International Center of Film for Children and Young People and the European Children Film Association, the festival saw 120 entries from various parts of the globe vying for 20 spots. Ami made it to the coveted short list as the only entry in the 6-12 age-group category.																								I am absolutely thrilled to bits. Ami is an insight into the world of wonder and fantasy of young minds. The making of the film was simple, but the spontaneity of the kids and their commitment to the project was quite remarkable, says Manav Jalan, creative coordinator, Gaurang Films, that has given Indian cinema many a Tapan Sinha masterpiece.																								Jalan, however, attributes the success saga to a Palestine film-maker, Hicham Kayed, who had arrived in Calcutta in November 2003 for the Calcutta film festival and expressed his desire to conduct a photography workshop with destitute children.																								After scanning for a suitable place, Kayed, along with Jalan, travelled to Muktoneer, the Free the Children-India destitute home. Kayed, representing the Arab Resource Centre for Popular Arts, held a three-day workshop at the destitute home, where vibrant images of the boys were captured on camera.																								It was during this workshop that Jalan thought of making a film on the children and in April this year, the cameras started to roll. I readily agreed to the proposal because this was not an ordinary film at all, said Swapan Mukherjee, secretary of Free the Children-India. 																								The film has been scripted, directed and filmed by the children themselves, obviously under Jalans guidance, he adds.																								Once the film was completed, Gaurang Films sent it to the Athens festival. Two days ago, Jalan and Mukherjee received information from organisers that the film had been accepted as the official entry from India.																								Organisers of the international film festival have invited one of the boys to travel free to Athens for the occasion. Since Ashikul played an important part in the film, we have decided to send him to the festival, said Mukherjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004 SARS or wars, tourist will go
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The travel industry is looking up, at least in the outbound sector, and with Calcutta perfectly poised as the gateway to Southeast Asia, its becoming a hub of holiday travel.																								To prove that point, the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) is bringing its annual conference to Calcutta this September, after nine long years.																								We had stiff competition from Hyderabad, but we won in the end, says Sanjoy Sett of Globe Forex and Travels, and eastern region chairman of TAAI. Despite SARS and the wars, travel here is at an all-time high. In March 2003, the outbound travel in eastern India amounted to Rs 380 crore. In March this year, there was an increase of about 20 per cent.																								The industry has also been doing its bit to improve cross-border relations. In April this year, 25 members of TAAI were invited by the Travel Agents Association of Pakistan (TAAP) for a three-day trip to Lahore. It was a first, for both sides. And it was a wonderful experience. We got star treatment, from being met on the flight and no customs check, to the friendliness of locals, recalls Sett.																								The reciprocal gesture is an invitation from TAAI for the conference in September, where around 1,800 delegates from India and the SAARC countries are expected to participate, along with their spouses. The highlight will be trips to tourist destinations in the region, to showcase its delights.																								In fact, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Indian Chamber of Commerce have been very keen to tie up with TAAI, to highlight the east and Northeast. The CII has promised us all the support we need, and they have planned a three-day convention at the same venue, on the same days, to coincide with our event. Its a joint promotion, since we too will have an east and Northeast conclave, adds the honorary treasurer of the Calcutta chapter of Skal International, a worldwide body of the travel and hospitality industries, headquartered in Spain.																								There are, however, perception problems that interfere in the international travel of Indians. Getting visas is often a problem. Recently, the Malaysian government stated that there would have to be bank draft guarantee when our clients apply for an e-visa, because if they stay back, then the money is forfeited. We want the e-visa facility, but not at that cost.																								So, president of TAAI Balbir Mayal, made a hasty trip to Kuala Lumpur to meet the external affairs minister, to clear the air. The response from the minister was positive, and we hope to get that cleared soon, adds Sett.

 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Walkers reject Memorial entry fee
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Morning-walkers are not ready to accept the proposal of the Victoria Memorial Hall authorities to introduce a fee of Rs 15 per head for admission into the grounds.																								A petition was filed in Calcutta High Court on Monday on behalf of some morning-walkers, seeking permission from the court to allow themselves to be party to the case relating to the environment of the mausoleum. 																								The division bench presided over by Justice A.K. Ganguly allowed morning-walkers to be party to the case and granted them time to submit their petition before the court.																								Last week, the Memorial authorities filed an affidavit before the court, seeking its permission to allow it to introduce an entry fee of Rs 15 to restrict the movement of people in the grounds and protect the structure from pollution. 																								The proposal followed an order of the court, after a 15-member experts committee recommended that the movement of visitors would have to be restricted to protect the heritage structure from pollution.																								Apart from the morning-walkers, petitioner Subhas Dutta pointed out that the entry fee to the complex should not be more than Rs 2. Dutta suggested that walkers be given a special concession in the morning.																								In another development, the court asked city police chief Sujoy Chakraborty to ensure the smooth plying of vehicles on the roads surrounding the monument. 																								In an interim order during the day, the court directed the police chief to send a team of policemen to visit the Memorial and file a report before the court.																								The court asked police not to allow any vehicle to be parked outside the complex. It has directed that the use of plastic bags should strictly be banned inside the complex.																								When I was passing through the area, I found that a section of land on the western side of the complex had not yet been levelled by the HRBC. I would like to ask the company to take immediate action to level the ground, the judge said. The HRBC has constructed the flyover up to the SSKM Hospital.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has agreed to take part in the case. The CMC lawyer has assured the court that the civic body will file an affidavit stating its stand with regard to supply of water in the Memorial complex. The court fixed the matter for hearing after the summer vacation.

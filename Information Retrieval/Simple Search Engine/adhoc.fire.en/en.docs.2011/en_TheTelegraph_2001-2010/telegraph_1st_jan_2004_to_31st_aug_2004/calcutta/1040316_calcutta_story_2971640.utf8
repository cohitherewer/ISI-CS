 																											- Even today, girl child loses out in run-up to adoption SANJAY MANDAL																								Life is beautiful for Sundari Buri. She was brought to BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in 1972 as a girl child abandoned on a city street. Sundari  the name given by staff members  was in the hospital for two years before she was adopted and taken to Switzerland in 1977.																								Married to a Swiss national, the girl, now Sundari Wuergler, lives in Zurich and is the mother of two. She recently wrote to the BC Roy hospital authorities, requesting them to provide information about her first home. 																								Last month, Sundari returned briefly to BC Roy Memorial, from where it had all begun.																								Another Sundari was not so lucky, although she, too, was left unclaimed by the road. The newborn was spotted by residents of the Bowbazar area and taken to Medical College and Hospital. 																								The authorities persuaded a member of the group-D staff to adopt her and she applied for the childs custody. But the family court recently directed the hospital to send the five-month-old girl to a rehabilitation home.																								There are a number of such Sundaris  unwanted by their parents and abandoned on city streets. Officials at the state-run teaching hospitals confirm that the number of abandoned female children is far more in number than male babies. 																								The rough ratio of abandoned female and male children in some hospitals is pegged as high as 70:30.																								There are long queues for adopting abandoned male children. For these unfortunate girls, we either have to send them to rehabilitation homes or persuade our staff to adopt them, said Pranab Mukherjee, social welfare officer of the hospital.																								Kalicharan was abandoned near Raja Subodh Mullick Square and was brought to the hospital on October 28 last year. Although he had hardly any survival chance, there were six applicants wanting to adopt him, recalled Mukherjee.																								Or take Rajputra (name given by the hospital staff). He had four holes in his heart but had several applications for adoption and was finally taken in by a member of the hospital staff. She spent a lot of money on his treatment but could not save the child.																								At Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, social welfare department officials said six female and two male abandoned babies were brought in over the past few years.																								This is an unfortunate trend. Even today, a male child is considered to be an asset, said M.K. Chatterjee, medical superintendent of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children.																								In the family court, an official admitted that the ratio of adopting male babies is higher than female ones.

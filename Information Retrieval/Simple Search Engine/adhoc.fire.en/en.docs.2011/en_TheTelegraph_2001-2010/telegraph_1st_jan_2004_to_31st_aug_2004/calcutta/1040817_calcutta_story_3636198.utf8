The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Tune in to total music mayhem
				 	 Tuneful trinity: The Kal Ho Naa Ho team; (Top) A still from Dil Chahta Hai																								Threes company for Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy. Their Kyun! Ho Gaya Na score is still a force to reckon with in the top 10 charts at the citys music stores. The Calcutta discos still cannot get through a Saturday night without playing their Its the time to disco. And now their mint fresh score in Phir Milenge is ready to take the city by storm. Just a couple of days after winning the National Award for Kal Ho Naa Ho, Shankar Mahadevan speaks on the phenomenon named Shankar Ehsaan Loy. 																								Getting started:																								All three of us were friends working individually. Both Ehsaan and Loy were reputed names in the world of ad jingles and I was the busiest jingle singer. Naturally, I used to sing a lot for them. We used to have a lot of fun together. Thanks to my knowledge of Indian classical music, I would come up with inputs, which they valued a lot. The three of us came together again for a Pepsi commercial directed by the late Mukul Anand. He casually asked us to co-produce two songs for his big project Dus. While his death meant that the film was never released, one of the songs Hindustani rocked the nation and was performed at every patriotic show around. After that we got more offers and we decided to stick together and produce music.Making magic:																								Working together is an absolute honour. It provides us great musicmanship. We do not have segregated roles as such. I sing, play the keyboards and also a whole lot of percussion. Loy plays the piano and guitar. Ehsaan plays the guitar too. Everyone contributes to every number using the varied influences to colour the songs. You can call it total music mayhem. We also get to keep our individual music careers intact. Never in our short stint together, have we had a major leap. It has been more of a gradual growth, which is much better in the long run. We started with nothing, did two songs for Dus, three songs for Dillagi, one hit item number for Shool, which became the song of the moment. Next we got a plum project in the form of Vidhu Vinod Chopras Mission Kashmir. And then Dil Chahta Hai happened.Directors cut:																								Luckily, most of the directors we have worked with have been deeply involved with their films and known their scripts inside out. More importantly, all the films, including unsuccessful ones like Kuch Naa Kaho and Armaan, have had a genre of their own. But Farhan will always remain special. That we could produce something as magical as Dil Chahta Hai was because of the kind of free hand he gave us. His approach was so very fresh that it became an eye-opener for an entire generation of aspiring film-makers. Even today, there are directors who want to sign us up saying give us Dil Chahta Hai music. And we have had to refuse many such offers because we refuse to carry the baggage of that film. We also believe while one can make another Its the time to disco, it is impossible to make another Koi kahe Way we work:																								We have a completely different way of composing our music. The director, the lyricist (which is mostly Javed Akhtar) and the three of us would go out of Mumbai, book a room in a hotel and set up all our equipment. After the director has given us a complete narration, we would start jamming. Sometimes Javedsaab would come up with two lines, one of us would think of a hook line and thanks to digital technology all that happens in that room can later be actually used in our songs. Everyone in that room is creatively involved in the song and we decide on the final composition only after all five of us are completely satisfied.Growing together:																								It is very difficult to come up with a song. And we genuinely feel that the only way we can grow musically is by having an open mind rather than bringing others down all the time. We have never denied the presence of other musical talent in our country. We have high regard for A.R. Rahman  he knows exactly what he wants. Then theres Anu Malik who knows the pulse of the nation more than any of us. We also like Ismail Darbar and the team of Vishal-Shekhar. Really, a lot of good work is happening around.Looking ahead:																								Our music in Kyun! Ho Gaya Na has been received well. We have tried something new in the song Pyar mein sau uljhan, where we have given the song a Broadway feel. Up next is Revathys Phir Milenge, whose promos are already on air. Then we are working on Shaad Alis new film Bunty Aur Babli. We are also very excited about a small piece of music we did for Mira Nairs new film Vanity Fair. She gave us a Western melody and we have been able to fuse Rajasthani folk strains with it. She liked our work and we hope to work together again in the future. 						PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 12 years on, killer cop gets life term
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A dozen years after the image of the bad cop was given a diabolical dimension, the killer constable has been slapped with severe punishment.																								It was 1.30 am on February 20, 1992. A plainclothes constable from Bally police station, Sirajul Sardar, and three associates were stalking Grand Trunk Road.																								Spotting a lorry that had managed to give them the slip, the trio gave chase and flagged it down near Singh weighbridge.																								What followed was straight out of a Bollywood bad-cop sequence. Sardar demanded money from the driver, Ramdhari Yadav, who refused to pay up, as he was doing nothing illegal  as public prosecutor Tapan Kumar Singha Roy explained it in court.																								The constable then climbed on to the trucks footboard and shot Yadav dead with his service revolver, from point-blank range.																								A court in Howrah on Tuesday sentenced Sardar to life imprisonment for killing the lorry driver.																								District sessions judge Haraprasad Chatterjee, in his judgment, convicted the constable and ordered him to pay a fine of Rs 2,000, failing which he would serve a month in prison in addition to the life term.																								After the death of the lorry driver, a case (no. 44/92, date 20/02/92) was started with Bally police station by the government. Reports from T.L. Jaiswal Hospital and then the post-mortem confirmed that driver Yadav was killed by the bullet from constable Sardars service revolver, Roy added.																								On the basis of these reports, Sardar was arrested by the Bally police and suspended from duty. While Sardar did manage to get bail, he was denied a return to police service.																								Later in court, Sardar alleged that Yadav had tried to run him down, forcing him to open fire in self-defence. So, he said it was not his fault, said Singha Roy.																								Another argument that Sardar offered was that Yadav had tried to snatch his service revolver, and in the ensuing tussle, the fatal bullet was fired.																								When asked why it had taken so many years for the case to be resolved and the verdict to be passed, Roy cites the number of times that Sardar had approached Calcutta High Court to establish his innocence, only to be refused every time.																								What complicated matters more was the refusal of the drivers khalasis (helps)  key witnesses to the murder  to testify against Sardar in court. 																								According to lawyers involved in the case, Sardar had managed to influence the witnesses and ensure that they did not depose against him.																								Now, he can challenge this judgment in a higher court, concluded the public prosecutor.

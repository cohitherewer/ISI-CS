The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Trapped in trauma tunnel
 																											- Metro snag leaves passengers stranded for 17 minutes A STAFF REPORTER																								The stretch between Central and Chandni Chowk Metro Railway stations turned into trauma tunnel on Monday morning when nearly 2,000 passengers on a Tollygunge-bound train were left stranded for 17 minutes following a mechanical fault.																								It was 10.32 am by the Chandni Chowk station clock when the train shuddered to a halt in the dark tunnel, seconds after a sound was heard from underneath the motormans cabin.																								The driver suddenly heard a loud report. He cut down on the speed and tried to identify the problem. Then, he gradually brought the train to a halt inside the tunnel, said Metro Rail general manager Vinod Kumar. 																								But on the train, in the claustrophobic tunnel, many passengers feared for their safety. Some complained of nausea and dizziness. Luckily, the lights in the train stayed on throughout the anxious wait, though the air circulation was very poor, passengers pointed out.																								The driver of the train tried to pacify the nervous passengers  mostly office-goers  over the public address system, assuring them that it was just a mechanical snag and all necessary steps were being taken to haul the train to the nearest station.																								After 17 minutes of near-panic, the train moved. The second engine pulled the coaches to Chandni Chowk station at 10.52 am, in reverse gear. 																								Passengers poured out of all the coaches before the empty train was taken to Tollygunge for repairs. Many commuters then chose to abandon the underground and carry on to their destinations by bus or taxi.																								The rush-hour fault spread confusion among passengers waiting at various stations. Several of them later alleged that officials had announced a disruption in services due to a derailment. The Metro authorities, however, denied this. There was no such announcement by us. We only informed waiting passengers about the disruption in services due to a mechanical snag in the front engine of a train, said Surya Kanta Basu, a senior official. 																								As a result of the hold-up, two trains  one Up and one Down  were cancelled and 13 trains  six Up and seven Down  had to be rescheduled. This led to delayed services till about noon.																								Later in the day, technical trouble tripped a Dum Dum-bound train. It was first held up at Girish Park for four minutes, from 7.52 pm. On reaching Sovabazar, the train was detained for two minutes. It reached Shyambazar at 8.01 pm, where it was declared unfit. All passengers were evacuated and the train was taken to the Noapara car shed. Three trains were rescheduled due to the disruption.

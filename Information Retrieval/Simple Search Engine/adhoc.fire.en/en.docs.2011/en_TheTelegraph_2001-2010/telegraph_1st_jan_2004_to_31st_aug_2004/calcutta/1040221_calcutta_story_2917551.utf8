 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Artistic projection of elements
																								C reativity in clay finds its most amazing expression in the works of Aditi Saraogi and Shreyashi Swaika, two artistic geniuses who are extremely passionate about their craft. Combining art and sculpture, the two ladies create decorative objects such as lamp bases, lights, uplighters, bowls, platters and so on, all the time preserving a delicate balance between functionality and aestheticism. Pottery as an art form reaches its zenith in Saraogis specialisation in forms and smoke-firing, while Swaikas expertise lies in figurines and glazes. Their present show, based on a theme revolving around the five elements (air, wind, earth, fire and water), is their way of paying tribute to these elements, whose presence and contribution we take for granted.																								Event: Ceramic exhibition by Aditi Saraogi and Shreyashi Swaika																								When: February 21; 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: Grain of Salt, 22 Camac Street, 5th floor

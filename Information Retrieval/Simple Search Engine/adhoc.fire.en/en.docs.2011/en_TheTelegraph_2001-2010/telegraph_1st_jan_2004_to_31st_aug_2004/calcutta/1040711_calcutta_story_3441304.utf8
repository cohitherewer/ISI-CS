Victor BanerjeeRemember all the gobbledygook data I fed you last fortnight? Let me begin at the beginning. I first met Roy Walford when he was swimming naked in the Ganga, with some other friends from California, in a stretch that is now infested with white-water rafters. His companion was an artist called Elwyn Chamberlain. Wyn used to be an associate of Andy Warhol in New York and while painting the portrait of a billionaires wife, fell in love and ran away with her to the jungles of India. For 15 years they (him in just a loin cloth and his wife in a sari) followed a powerful tantric sadhu through the forests of the Himalayan foothills, with the sky as their only canopy. They had two children whom they educated holistically under peepal, banyan and jackfruit trees. The boy and girl ended up getting scholarships to Princeton and Oxford.Back to Roy. He too had spent a fair bit of time, in a loincloth, following the abstruse sanyasi. Roy had a shaved head and lived with a bald parrot, on Venice beach, outside Los Angeles. Simply entering his exquisitely wild cottage-by-the-sea was an unimaginable high. His friends were Timothy Leary (of ex-Harvard and LSD fame), Allen Ginsberg the great poet who, with Purna Das Baul and Bob Dylan, dreamed on a diet of magic mushrooms and love potions conjured by druids. Roy, or rather, Dr Roy . Walford, MD, has been professor of pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine and is one of Americas leading research scientists and gerontologists. He has received innumerable awards in recognition of his research and has written half a dozen books including Maximum Life Span, where he unequivocally claims that man was destined to live for at least 120 years and gives you the diet for it, that I quoted.Now, just in case your karma too (like Wynns and Roys) makes you tread the jungles of India in search of truth one day, I shall give you an interesting recipe for a fern, the Lingra, that grows abundantly during the monsoons, throughout the foothills of our Himalayas. You will recognise it from the way it curls into concentric circles at the top. Many, many years ago, a Welshwoman, Irene Gomez (perhaps married to a Portuguese Bengali from Chittagong, renowned for their culinary skills) won the Honolulu Advertisers Annual Prize at a Cooking Contest in Hawaii, for the Lingra recipe she submitted. Now, if you think understanding Indian philosophy can be a mind bender, let me give you the only available record of Irene Gomezs secret, camouflaged in codes that only enlightened foreign sadhus, in Hrishikesh, would eventually unravel. See if you can make sense of it.Take a loose number of fendered smolg and gwielg them, being careful not to spoil the batterns. Them wampf slowly in a covered blogging bunk for time and a half. Twengle twice, garnish with bloats and fresh green blingers (if obtainable), otherwise twetchets, and serve indiscriminately.Hey, put that in your hallucinogenic pipes and smoke it till your pituitary clouds over.Preamble:Back from the forests, after you have peeled off leeches from your legs and you still bleed, gently rub off the fluffy fir along the body of the fern and its top curls. Dice the long stems into  inch horizontal pieces and save the top curls for pakoras: small curls and little leaves are suitable for the simple sabji preparation. Wash it all, thoroughly, and dry it.Lingra Pakoras:Make a batter of besan and water and add some cumin powder, ajwain (aka Trachyspermum omni or Bishops weed to saatviks), ground red chillies and salt to taste. Dip the curls in the batter and deep-fry them in the ghee/oil of your choice.Lingre Ki Sabji: (200 gm serves 4)Heat mustard oil (a sinful quantity) in a kadhai and put in 1 tsp of mustard seeds, one medium-sized sliced onion and four dry red chillies to fry for 30 seconds. Now add the Lingra. Toss it a few times, add  tsp of haldi,  tsp ground red chillies and salt to taste. Mix it all in and then tuck half a chopped tomato under the vegetable. Cover the kadhai over a low flame. Let it cook for 10 minutes.Alas, to de-glamourise the Himalayan mystique, let me tell you that it was one J. Hardy who, in 1882, discovered a young fern frond, in the uncivilised West, that terminated in concentric curled leaves, like the top of a violin, and called it, fiddle-head. It grows wild all over and is cooked in New Hampshire and Maine in the United States, Ireland, Wales and, of course, Hawaii.Finally if, like me, youre really a backburner cook, simply chop the Lingra into little pieces, add sliced garlic, sprinkle salt and then saut it in butter to discover a poor mans asparagus that rivals everything exported from China.

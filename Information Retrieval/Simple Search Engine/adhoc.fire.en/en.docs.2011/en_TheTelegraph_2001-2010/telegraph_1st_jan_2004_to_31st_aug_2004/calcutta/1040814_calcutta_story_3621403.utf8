																								Samskritiki Shreyaskar presents its premier show of Tagores Tasher Desh, a symbolic drama. Life becomes dull and aimless when we have to do things mechanically. Day after day one has to follow certain rules and work accordingly. This is how the cards were leading their lives in Tasher Desh until a young prince came and shook them up. The prince, who was on an adventurous journey, was accidentally led into the unknown land of cards. He made them realise the actual meaning of life as a beautiful flower with different shades like joy, romance and freedom of speech. The listless lives of the cards baffled him while his restlessness and charming personality won them over. After a series of debates and encounters, the princes idea of happiness and search for new life made the lifeless cards break into a dance and hear unearthly music from the heart of nature.

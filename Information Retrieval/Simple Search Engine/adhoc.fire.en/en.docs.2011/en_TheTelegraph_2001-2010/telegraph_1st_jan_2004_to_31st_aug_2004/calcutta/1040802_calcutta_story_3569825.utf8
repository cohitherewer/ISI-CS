The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Permits must by September
 A STAFF REPORTER																								SCHOOL BUS Rulebook																								To obtain a school bus permit, the operator will have to collect an approval or no-objection from the school concerned																								The bus should be well-maintained, with 2x2 seating arrangements, shelves for keeping satchels. There should be a first-aid box in the bus																								The colour of the bus will be bright yellow with a blue border in the middle.																								The name, address and telephone number of the school will be painted prominently on both sides of the bus																								The driver and helper must be well-experienced and recognised by the school authorities																								After having failed to convince chartered bus operators to obtain permits for carrying students to and from schools, the government has fixed September 30 as the deadline for owners of illegal school buses to stop plying their vehicles.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty held a meeting with senior officials of his department on Sunday, a day after 21 students were injured when their bus met with an accident in Salt Lake. 																								The minister asked the officials to convey the message to transport operators once again, that the government would be tough in its dealing with illegal operators. Come September 30, not a single bus without a school bus-permit will be allowed to carry students. The government will no more allow anyone to play with schoolchildrens lives, Chakraborty told Metro.																								The transport department, he said, has framed specific rules for plying school buses, and these have been circulated to bus operators. We have held meetings with operators and asked them to abide by the rules. But most of them are yet to fall in line. Enough is enough, we have to draw a line somewhere. Our stand is clear  ply a school bus only after getting the permit, or use your vehicle for other purposes, such as marriages and picnics, Chakraborty said.																								According to transport department officials, around 1,000 vehicles ply in the city as school buses. Of them, 70 are owned by schools and have proper permits. The rest ply illegally. 																								Public vehicles department (PVD) director H. Mohan argued that his department could do little in verifying details of the vehicles and the drivers, since most operators do not obtain permits. 																								For any accident, the school authorities or guardians do not take any responsibility. The blame finally comes on the government. So, weve framed specific rules for plying school buses. Errant operators will face harsh measures, Mohan said.																								PVD officials said operators are reluctant to obtain permits because they want to ply their vehicles for a variety of purposes. As per the new rules, a school bus cannot be plied for any other purpose. Usually, most operators use their vehicles for carrying both students and other passengers. Beyond school hours, school buses are run as chartered buses to various destinations such as Esplanade/BBD Bag, Airport, Behala, Salt Lake and Barasat. Its a gross violation of rules, an official said.																								Chakraborty said he would soon convene a meeting of chartered bus operators, school authorities and traffic police. I call upon guardians not to send their children to schools in any unregistered bus. Before contracting a bus, check out whether it has a valid permit, he said.																								Chartered Bus Owners and Operators Association president Himadri Ganguly claimed all members had obtained permits and the government should not force them to seek any other permit. Besides, he said, the owner or the operator will run up losses if he is forced to use his vehicle only for ferrying students.

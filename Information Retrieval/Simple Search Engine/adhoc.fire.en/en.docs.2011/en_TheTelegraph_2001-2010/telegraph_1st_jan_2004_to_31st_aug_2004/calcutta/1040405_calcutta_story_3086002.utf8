 Monday, April 05, 2004 Freedom crusade for caged 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 OF HUMAN BONDAGE: Suchetana Bhattacharjee at the Galiff Street market for pets. Picture by Pabitra Das																								The weekly market for pet birds and animals, on Galiff Street, had an unusual visitor this Sunday morning  a young crusader with a famous father.																								The market was abuzz with activity as parents, accompanied by chirpy children, tried to win the best bargain. But at the stroke of 10, the focus of attention suddenly shifted from the feather and the fur, the buy and the sell, to a girl in jeans and white T-shirt.																								Enter, Suchetana, daughter of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, on the wings of Flight to Freedom.																								The forest department programme to spread awareness about bird conservation and check trade in live birds had clearly found its hawks eye.																								Dada, you need not keep those beautiful winged creatures in cages to be known as bird-lovers. All you have to do is take a trip to a bird sanctuary to try and get to know them better, Suchetana explained to an elderly gentleman on the lookout for the caged kind.																								While members of several NGOs and forest department officials sang songs and spread mass messages to make their presence felt, Suchetana took the personal path.																								She approached customers and sellers individually, coaxing some and gently reprimanding others, exchanged telephone numbers and distributed pamphlets.																								That she had managed to win over some of her target audience was apparent from the submissions and the suggestions.																								A young animal-lover picked his moment to approach the chief ministers daughter. 																								I know places where turtles are being sold. Please give me your telephone number, I will inform you about the time and place of the transaction, he told Suchetana, who lent a keen ear.																								But there was little scope for a crackdown on Sunday. The unlicensed Galiff Street peddlers had all stayed away, having been tipped off earlier about the high-profile visitor.																								There were 20 licensed pet shops on Sunday morning, but usually, there are 50 others, without licences, who set up shop here, said one of the sellers.																								There was, however, no stopping Suchetana from speaking out against cruelty to birds. Instead of keeping birds inside cages, watching them in natural habitats is a much more pleasant experience for me, she told the gathering.																								She was flanked by members from three NGOs, scouts from the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and forest department officials. According to them, Flight to Freedom will be effective in curbing live-bird trading.																								We will organise a rally later this month from Calcutta to North Bengal, stopping at various places for awareness campaigns, said Vinod Kumar Yadav, conservator of forests, wildlife (headquarters).																								Schoolchildren and NCC cadets will be involved in a bigger way in order to gather more information about illegal trading in live birds, he added.																								The forest department is in talks with Swabhumi to stage awareness programmes and take the message to the people through an organised campaign.

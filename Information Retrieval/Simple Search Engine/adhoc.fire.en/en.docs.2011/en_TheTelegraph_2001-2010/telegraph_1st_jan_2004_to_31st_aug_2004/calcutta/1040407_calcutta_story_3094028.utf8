	The water purifier at the state central library has been defunct for a considerable period of time. Repeated requests to the authorities to repair it have gone unheeded. Visiting students and research scholars will have to brace for parched summer months. 
	 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane 
	The residents of the slum along the railway tracks near New Bridge 4 in Tiljala burn electric wires to retrieve copper and tyres to get scrap steel. They have also installed a permanent public address system that blares music and speeches day and night. Residents of the multi-storeyed building nearby are distressed by the assault on their senses. My children have started suffering from aesthma attacks and are unable to concentrate on their studies. The pollutants in the air are even corroding the fan blades. Residents are reluctant to raise their voices in protest as the slum-dwellers enjoy the support of a political party. 
	Rajan, Tiljala.

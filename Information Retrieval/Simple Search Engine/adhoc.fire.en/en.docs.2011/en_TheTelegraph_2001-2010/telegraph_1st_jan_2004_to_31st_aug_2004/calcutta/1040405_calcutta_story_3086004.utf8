 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 The physician fades out
 SUVRO ROY 																								Where have all the general practitioners (GPs) gone? With specialisation as todays mantra, the first health stop  a friendly neighbourhood GP  has become the common casualty.																								Alarmed at the missing medical link, the government has approached the Medical Council of India (MCI) for measures to address the problem.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity has written to the MCI, demanding a years compulsory house-staffship for medical graduates in teaching hospitals to train them better in the treatment of common ailments, before they move on for their post-graduation.																								At present, only those joining the health service have to do a years house-staffship at the teaching hospitals. But this is required for all pass-outs, as the year-long regimen will help them hone their clinical examination skills and enable them to diagnose various types of diseases better. We have already written to the MCI on this score, said Maity.																								Health officials said GPs and specialists should be available in equal proportions. But the numbers have now become horribly lopsided, they added.																								Why do you think the number of GPs has dwindled over the past decade? Most of the 1,000-odd doctors passing out every year think that holding just an MBBS degree will not get them anywhere. So, they go in for a post-graduate degree and specialise, said Maity.																								President of West Bengal Medical Council Ashoke Chowdhury echoed Maity and said the authorities must devise a method to steer some doctors towards general practice after graduation. There is a big rush to become specialists after graduation. The MCI can definitely formulate rules that will get doctors to serve as GPs, he said.																								The doctor-patient relationship and the familiar concept of the family physician have definitely taken a beating, said some remaining GPs.																								Officials at the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bengal branch, also blamed the fadeout of the GP on the growing trend of self-medication, the rampant sale of non-prescribed drugs across the counter at the chemists and the propensity to turn to specialists for the slightest flutter.																								Why should a person with hypertension visit a cardiologist first, instead of a GP? We know of specialists in cities like Chennai who do not see a patient unless he has been referred by a GP, said state IMA secretary Moloy Patra.

Galerie 88 hosts an exhibition of the works of Akbar Padamsee, depicting the artist in a contemplative mood. At the forefront of the contemporary art movement in India for the last 50 years, his works are distinguished by a combination of aesthetic skill and creative force that reveals the psyche of a modernist painter trying to come to terms with the conflicts and dilemmas of his immediate environment. The works on show, characterised by unidentifiable visages, jagged lines, measured grids and undulating strokes, while reflecting the solitary confines of an artist, also stand testimony to his artistic brilliance.To be inaugurated today at 5.30 pm, the occasion also marks the release of the book, Akbar Padamsee: Works on Paper Critical Boundaries.																								Event: An exhibition of works on paper by Akbar Padamsee.																								When: Till April 30 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88, Shakespeare Sarani

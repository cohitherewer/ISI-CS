 															- Lack of funds scripts ruin for stadium  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Yuba Bharati Krirangan (Salt Lake stadium) awaits contributions for a much-delayed revamp. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								A.R. Rahman performed here. So did some of the big names in football. 																								But Yuba Bharati Krirangan (Salt Lake stadium), one of the biggest in Asia, is in dire need of funds for renovation. The ground has been over-run by weeds and tall grass; its galleries are broken and the lights are inoperative.																								The state sports department has drawn up an ambitious Rs 5-crore plan to refurbish the sprawling 77-acre stadium, but does not have the funds to execute the project. 																								The department is worried, more so because the stadium is to host a pre-World Cup football qualifier between India and Japan on September 8. 																								Determined to raise the money, sports minister Subhash Chakraborty has asked Left Front parliamentarians to contribute from their local area development funds. 																								Maintaining the stadium is proving very difficult, with the state government facing a funds crunch. I have written to all Left Front MPs, asking them to do their bit by contributing from their individual funds. We badly need the money to do up the stadium, Chakraborty said on Tuesday. 																								The minister has spoken to Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, seeking his support for the stadiums revamp.																								Unless the Speakers committee gives its consent, Lok Sabha members cannot allot money from their local area development funds to projects outside their constituencies. 																								Minister Chakraborty expects the Speaker to find a way out soon and the state sports department can raise Rs 23 lakh from the MPs. I will soon write to the Speaker, seeking his consent, he said.																								In the early 1980s, Chakraborty and Kamal Basu, then chairman of the Sports Council, felt the need for a stadium dedicated to football, since the game was not considered suitable to be played at Eden Gardens. Many in the citys sports circles had complained that soccer matches were destroying the turf at Eden Gardens and making the ground unsuitable for cricket.																								Built in the mid-1980s, at a cost of Rs 200 crore, the Salt Lake stadium has since been hosting major soccer events of the country. The galleries can accommodate around 1.2 lakh spectators. 																								In the absence of a budgetary allocation from the state government, the stadium runs on loans from commercial banks and by hosting various sports and cultural events. Some corporate houses, too, chip in with sponsorships. 																								The state government extends a grant of Rs 1.2 crore a year towards payment of electricity charges and minor repairs, officials said. 																								No major repair has been carried out in the past four years, an official said. The ground and galleries need to be overhauled. The elevators are to be serviced and the complex needs a coat of paint. With an enormous amount being spent on electricity charges and overheads, virtually nothing is left to clear the ground.																								Another official said: The stadium becomes a criminals den after sundown. Hotels such as Hyatt Regency and The Stadel are in the vicinity, and that lends urgency to the renovation project.

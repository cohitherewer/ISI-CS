The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 18, 2004 Bon Appetease
Victor BanerjeeNot content with his fame and fortune, Ruskin Bonds chins quivered with poorly suppressed jealousy when I told him I was writing a food column for a newspaper in Calcutta. The fact is Ruskin, unlike the celebrated groundhog that pokes its head out of its burrow to proclaim spring is here, is just a pure and simple hog. Like Labradors that hang around fridges and poodles nurtured on chocolates, this humungous lapdog (for he is arguably cuddly at times) is forever hungry and forever ready to eat whatever is set before him.He wrapped a red revolutionary scarf around his palsied chins and stomped off to speak to his publishers about a recipe book. A week passed and not even the irresistible odour of frying bacon was able to attract our porculant (an anagram for FAT) back to our house. Then, last Sunday, just as the mists were creeping up from the valley below us, a shadow of the Saint Bernard of childrens stories was seen stealthily waddling around conifers until I could see two blue eyes poke out through the passion flower creeper and stare silently, dolefully, at me. Ruskin! I called amorously, to my globular scribe. He emerged from the bushes untangling the creeper that had caught around his chubby ankles and plonked himself into a rocking chair he had gifted to me years ago, that he had written about as being haunted.  Ruskin Bond: hungry tide I knew he was terrified of ghosts. He had gotten rid of the chair and only pretended it was gift. Now he sat rocking back and forth unaware of the dangers of demonic possession that he had had nightmares about. The damn fools asked me what I could cook, he barked. So, what did you tell them? I asked, as casually as I could, without letting on that we had actually been missing this cadger. Eggs. I told them I could boil an egg like no one else could. Even the raucous cicadas in the pine trees shut up to listen to what came next. Nothing did. In the silence, I pulled out a packet of sausages from the freezer because I knew pork was the only recipe for a broken heart that would work on the disturbed orb. As the sausages crackled in the pan and the aroma of burnt hog flesh drifted through the mountain air and crept into his nostrils, Ruskins moist eyes began to sparkle again. With the swiftness of a baby elephant he jumped out of the rocking chair and stood staring at it as it rocked on its own with a spectral creek, right out of the pages of his fictional accounts of its powers to turn people into zombies. I couldnt help but laugh. He turned his frightened stare towards me and then in a flash began laughing too. Lets do it, I said.Thus, between the two of us, we began to retrace our lives through dakbungalows and forest resthouses, from tea plantations to princely states and finally sat roaring over some of the quaintest ways of cooking an egg that we had known. In celebration of a backroom joy that beats counting money, balancing chequebooks and salivating over tax dodge schemes, think instead of crisp slices of bread fried in bacon drippings, as the final resting place of creamy scrambled eggs, garnished with the snippets of fried bread.Here then is a lustful recipe for a dying breed of people who simply live to enjoy living and life. In other words, with not a care in the world for the acquisition of property, new cars or mobile telephones with WAP Browsers and a camera.Mumble Tumble in B cups Ingredients (to serve six):Vegetable oil for deep frying,  teaspoon ground cardamom, 4 oz. bacon drippings, 2 tablespoons/1 oz unsalted butter, 6 slices day-old white bread, crusts removed, 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives and 4 seeded greenchillies, 4 oz. smoked salmon, cut into 1 inch squares, 12 eggs, 2 fl. oz. cream, 2 oz. salmon roe,  teaspoon salt, parsley for garnishMethod: Heat the oil and bacon drippings in a large saucepan. Place a slice of bread in a mesh strainer and press it down into a cup shape.Holding it in place with a ladle, immerse it in oil, keeping it pressed down in the shape of a cup until the bread turns golden and crisp, about two minutes. Lift it out and place it upside down . While the bread is still warm and pliable, press a dimple in the curvature of its base so that the cup will sit upright when turned over and filled.Repeat the process with all 6 slices and keep them warm in a low oven. Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add the cream, salt and cardamom. Whisk them to a frothy blend.Over medium-low heat, melt the butter in a non-stick saucepan and pour in the eggs. Stir the mixture patiently with a wooden spoon, until it thickens into a creamy, custard-like consistency. Continue to stir, lifting the pan off the heat from time to time and scraping the sides and bottom until it all coagulates into a soft creamy dahi-like texture. Lift it off the fire, throw in the chives, and stir just once. Now place a few pieces of smoked salmon into the bottom of each bread cup and ladle the eggs in to fill each cup. Drop 1 coffee-spoon of salmon roe (or, better still, asparagus tips) on top of each cup, garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

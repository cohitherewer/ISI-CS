 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Ethics rein on slap-happy doctors
 															- GOVERNMENT WARNS MEDICINE MEN TO MEND THEIR WAYS BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Wiser after two back-to-back incidents of doctors slapping patients to make them cooperate at NRS Medical College and Hospital and similar reports about ill-behaved doctors pouring in from other state-run hospitals, the government has asked its medical officers to change their attitude or face action.																								Last week, a plastic surgeon at NRS had slapped a 14-year-old girl after she refused to take an injection before surgery. The doctor had to apologise finally to calm the peeved relatives of the patient.																								On Sunday, the girls parents were still seething with anger. If such things happen regularly, the doctors will face the music, said a relative. 																								The incident comes a few weeks after a post-graduate trainee of the same hospital had slapped a woman inside the labour room to induce labour.																								Complaints against ill-mannered doctors have been coming in regularly from other city hospitals as well, prompting the health department to sit up and take a fresh look at the doctor-patient relationship. 																								There is a clear code of ethics for doctors. Its unfortunate that some of them dont follow the rules. But such incidents will not be tolerated any more, said C.R. Maiti, director of medical education. 																								All state-run hospitals have been asked to step up vigil to ensure that incidents such as doctors slapping patients do not recur. The authorities at NRS have called a meeting of all doctors to convey a strong message: However bad the situation is, doctors cannot behave rudely with patients. Deputy medical superintendent D.K. Jha said: Were just waiting for medical superintendent Basanta Khan to return before we frame our own guidelines. 																								Prevention of such incidents seems to top the priority list for the authorities at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and Medical College and Hospital (MCH). Pradip Mitra, medical superintendent of RG Kar, has asked all doctors to spend more time with patients. Ive even kept stools beside patients beds, so a doctor can sit and talk to them. My task now is to improve the relationship between patients and doctors, Mitra said.																								At MCH, superintendent R. Chatterjee has been spending more time listening to patients complaints, before referring them to doctors concerned for action. Chatterjee, during his just-concluded college council meeting, had asked all heads of departments to be extremely careful while treating patients. We do get complaints from patients, but we immediately try to clear all doubts so that the relationship doesnt get strained, he said.																								Even the pro-left Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD) has decided to discuss the issue. We have criticised the NRS incidents and will tell the government that the association doesnt support such callous acts. If needed, we will launch awareness campaigns, added AHSD secretary Gautam Mukherjee.

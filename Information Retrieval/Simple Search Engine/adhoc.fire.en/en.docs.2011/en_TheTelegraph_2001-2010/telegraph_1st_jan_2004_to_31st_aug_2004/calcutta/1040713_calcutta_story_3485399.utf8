The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 And the rain came pouring ...
When a girl has been used to enduring suffering and neglect all her life, there is little she can do to protest. This is because those around her go on burdening her with the weight of their own responsibilities, oblivious to how she wants to lead her life, blind to her own wishes, dreams or desires. Gradually the girl also becomes accustomed to her painful, mechanical existence, accepting her sad fate meekly. Gandhars play, Jaaraa Brishtite Bhijechhilo, tells us such a story; a story that is common to many women in our society. In the play, however, the repressed, pent up emotions of the girl are finally released in a violent storm of protest that culminates in the peaceful and calming effect of rain. Scripted by Joy Goswami, directed by Gautam Haldar, and with Bijoylakshmi Barman in the lead role, the play is being staged to raise funds that will enable Prashanta Karmakar, a physically challenged swimmer, to participate in the World Swimming Meet for the Disabled to be held in Malaysia next year.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Jaaraa Brishtite Bhijechhilo, produced by Gandhar																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

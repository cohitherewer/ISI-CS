 [+uc('feng shui pinky kapoor')+]																								Q: I would like your advice on the perfect arrangement achieved by blending the five elements of nature (earthen pot, water, coins, flowers and candles). Please give a detailed account of what to place where. Can a lighted bulb be a substitute for candles? Also, please mention any specific area of the house in which this arrangement would be most effective. Is it advisable to place it in ones bedroom? 																								Emily Sarangi, via e-mail																								A: An equal blend of all the five elements can be comfortably kept in any direction. A smaller version of a similar arrangement can also be kept in the bedroom if you like. The best substitutes for a candle, which symbolises fire in the arrangement, would be red flowers, red-leaved plants or even a symbol of the Sun.																								Q: My 16-year-old son loves to display photographs of his friends in his room. Of late he has been spending more time with his friends than with family. I understand his need to form bonds outside the family but I wish he could maintain a balance. I also find that he is spending time with friends at the cost of his studies, which is what worries me most. Please advise how to check this. 																								Kajori Dutt, address withheld																								A: A simple solution is to replace the pictures of your sons friends in the north-west of the room with those of family members. It is especially important to energise the family area of the room, which is in the east, with loving family photographs. As for his studies, you should take care to keep the north-east area free of all picture clutter, which is the ideal direction to place his study table in. 																								Q: I (born on 15.09.80) would like to know how to energise my environment that will bring about greater success in my life. At this point of time I am confused about various career options available to me and cant seem to be able to make up my mind. At present I am employed in the IT sector (hardware and networking). 																								I cant decide whether I should stick to it or start my own business. I would also like to know what is my lucky number, lucky element, lucky colour, animal sign and also, which direction should my head point while sleeping? 																								Name and address withheld																								A: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong metal person, whereas the element of water supports your intelligence. Which means you will be successful in professions connected with banking, finance, computers, networking, media, marketing, sales, travel agencies, etc. 																								Blue colour schemes in your office and bedroom will help generate the right chi for you. Shades of green would also prove beneficial as they represent wealth in your case. 																								Your lucky number is 2 and elements favourable for you are water and wood. While directions appropriate for you in order of preference are northeast, west, north-west and southwest. It will be productive to sleep or sit in the south-west, facing north-east.																								Q: We are planning to paint our apartment. I would like your suggestion regarding the colour scheme of our rooms. The living room is in the north-east, the bedroom adjacent to it is in the southeast, beside which is the master bedroom in the south facing north. Next to it is the childrens bedroom in the south-west, which faces the kitchen. There are two toilets that are whitewashed and the corridor is painted yellow. We are planning to switch our bedroom with that of our daughters. My daughters were born on 11.12.83 and 12.09.89 respectively. My husbands date of birth is 17.09.48 and mine is 05.11.52. 																								Indrani, via e-mail																								A: The living room can be painted in shades of beige, cream or yellow. The bedroom should ideally be painted in shades of green that signify wealth. Green would also suit the one in the south, or alternatively you can choose between fire colours like maroon, purple, mauve, peach or pink. And switching your bedrooms is a good idea indeed.

 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Nite of the remix rage
 Kamna at Tantra on Saturday night. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Saturday night fever spilled into Sunday morning as scores of party animals tried to keep pace with some frenzied bar-top action at Tantra.																								The sensuous Kamna Jethmalani, who featured in the video of the smash hit Chhod Do Aanchal remix by Bombay Vikings was in town to turn up the heat at the disco, as she performed scintillating dance numbers to one remix after the other.																								The mood was retro with a twist of chic, as pulsating passion generated by the golden oldies was laced with the latest in electronica. Add to that potent mix the glamour of a starlet like Kamna, and the party is bound to wind on.																								Ravishing in a red sari, Kamna got the crowd grooving in no time at all as she performed to Chhod Do Aanchal along with her troupe, with the party-goers on the packed dance floor craning to get a better look at her. Others peered down from their pedestal at the Bodhi Bar while those chilling in the Santra Room decided to let loose and give in to the foot-tapping music, minor impediments like huge bean bags scattering the place notwithstanding!																								The only relief in the fever pitch came from the interminable breaks Kamna took to change outfits after every brief performance. Songs like Dekh Le, Pardesia, Bin Tere Sanam and Aisa Jadoo saw her turn heads in low-slung jeans, short sequinned skirts and halters.																								Resident DJs Sethi, Lloyd and Sammy tried to keep up the tempo in between with chart-toppers like Yeah by Usher, Milkshake by Kelis, Amazing by George Michael and remixes like Jamelia and Sajna Ve.																								But the star of the evening was clearly the 19-year-old ramp model, for whom life has changed drastically after her brief appearance in the Bombay Vikings video. During one of her Saturday night breaks, she said that she has been been flooded with acting offers, especially from the South after the small-screen appearance.																								So, does she plan to take the the big plunge on the big screen? Lets see... Im extremely choosy about what I do and I dont like exposing on screen, shrugged Kamna, in an itsy-bitsy outfit. Besides, I am a better dancer than an actor, she confesses. 																								The crowd at Tantra sure wasnt complaining. These were the high  and low  points... 																								Hottest dance number  Chhod Do AanchalHottest outfit  Tiny red skirt and silver top (seen top)																								Corniest quote  I dont like exposing on screen																								Most wanted number  The chartbuster the night was dedicated to, obviously																								The only irritant  Old (and young) men ogling the pretty young girl, some spotted with cellphone cameras strategically aimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Abduction trial from March 29
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The Khadims abduction case trial will begin at Alipore Central Correctional Home (Alipore Central jail) from March 29. Elaborate security arrangements will be made in and around the jail during the trial, a high court source said. A total of 24 accused, including Aftab Ansari, will face the proceedings. 																								This will be the second trial to be held in a jail for security reasons. Earlier, the trial for the attack on the American Center in Calcutta was shifted from the city civil court to Presidency jail.																								Court officers said there are 27 accused in the Khadims case. Of them, three are still absconding. Twelve have been granted conditional bail. The bailed accused will be given special badges to attend the trial in jail.																								The trial will be conducted by additional district judge Amitava Das in a special chamber. Four of the accused, who are in Tihar jail for their involvement in other cases, will be brought to Calcutta for the trial.																								Khadims vice-chairman Parthapratim Roy Burman was abducted in July 2001 from Tiljala. The abduction was masterminded by a gang of international criminals, who had allegedly engaged Aftab Ansari for the job. 																								The government has information that a group of people is in city with plans to snatch Ansari and his associates during the trial. That has spurred the need for extreme security in the jail.

 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Winter retreat with ragas
 															- UK Melody-makers  meet Indian Masters				 	 Girija Devi with participants at the classical music workshop. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Guruji arrives, she is duly received, aarti and all. Then begins an interactive session on Girija Devis life and a discourse on her vocal talents and her riyaaz. The participants: a motley group of musicians from the UK, with one thing in common  a passion for Indian classical music.																								The two-week, first-of-its-kind workshop in the city involved 20 students of all ages, on a trip to Calcutta to train in their respective disciplines from the masters themselves, in vocals, sitar, santoor, sarod and tabla. Organised by South Asian Arts (SAA), based in Leeds, UK, Sangeet Sabha handled the groundwork in Calcutta.																								On board are families of two generations, and Europeans with a penchant for Indian classical strains. Eleven-year-old Anup Jheeta is here with his parents and brother. He plays the tabla, and had an amazing time learning from the likes of Bikram Ghosh and Kaushik Sen. Id never even seen such big performers before, so it was really great learning from them, he smiles. Another first for him was a trip to India. I thought it would be really hot even in winter, but its only a little... And the people are nice and polite, he adds.																								Having arrived in the city on December 19, their lessons began the next day. The practice session was from 10 am to 1 pm. In the afternoon, it was time for the masters to step in, like Swapan Chowdhury, Kumar Bose, Jayanta Bose, Monilal Nag, Ajoy Chakraborty, Shahid Parvez and Purnima Chowdhury. There were themes, too, in both halves, like jhala, thumri, time-speed and application of ones repertoire. The venue was Patha Bhavan, on Palm Avenue, and the group was divided depending on discipline, as well as skill level (juniors and seniors). The evenings were for attending performances and programmes. But December 21 was special, as most of them took centrestage for the finale of the Calcutta carnival.																								The winter retreat programme was based on the gurukul system, says Rajeeb Chakraborty, founder-member of Sangeet Sabha. It was on a working trip to Leeds with the SAA some summers ago that the sarod-player decided it was time to bring their members down to the city that has so many stalwart musicians.																								Giuliano Modarelli is an Italian who plays the electric guitar. The jazz musician now plays the ragas on his guitar, and creates a fusion sound on the British stage. At Patha Bhavan, he joined in with the others. It was really hard work, but Im glad I came, he says.																								A success that should be repeated, is the verdict from Dharamvir Singh, SAA artistic director and a sitar-player. Its been wonderful. Thats what older son Surmeet, too, had to say, following in his fathers sitar strings. The 19-year-old might have been to India only thrice in his life, but the sitar has been a part of it for 12 years. We dont have so much time back home, so this was really intense, but good.																								David Beadle, a schoolteacher from Leeds, was gifted a sitar by his wife on his last birthday. Im an amateur compared to most of the participants at the workshop. But what better way to learn than from the best? says the multi-faceted musician.																								After a two-day Christmas holiday to the Sunderbans  with lots of music  it was back to training, and a final performance at GD Birla Sabhagar on Friday.						 NISHA LAHIRI

 Sunday, May 30, 2004  PC made easy: The inside story
techtalkBuyer beware 

	Talk to at least a couple of vendors to get the best deal. Take a tech guru along, if possible
	Preferably choose a vendor who can be easily reached in times of trouble (there will be many) and who is recommended by a few people
	When buying an assembled PC, ensure device drivers and warranty cards for individual parts are provided
	Go for a configuration that suits your needs, and not one with the best of everything. For instance, if all you will do is type documents and surf the Net, no point in buying an expensive, heavy-duty graphics card
	Brace yourself for the fact that you could lose peace of mind and sleep  over your pride-of-place PC. No teething trouble is a miracle Now that most of us have a PC (personal computer) at home, how often have you tried to know what lies inside the power performer, and got tangled in a web of byte babble and computer jargon? TechTalk tries to walk you through some of that and help forge a special bond with the PC.
	1. CD ROM Drive: Or Compact Disc Read Only Memory drive, plays CDs containing music or data. ROM means the medium (the CD) can only be read from. A CD holds about 700 MB of data.
	 CD Writer: Writes or records on an empty or blank CD, much like recording on a cassette. If the CD is re-writable (CDRW), then it can be written and erased a number of times, but if its CDR (recordable), it can be written on only once.
	The process of recording on a CD is also commonly called burning.
	 DVD ROM drive: Like the CD ROM, can only read from a Digital Video Disc (DVD) which holds around 4.7 GB of data. For comparison, generally two CDs are required to fit in a movie, but most movies fit into a single DVD.
	 DVD Writer: Writes on a recordable DVD. The re-writable bit is applicable here too.
	2. Floppy disc drive: Reads and writes on 3 frac12; inch plastic disc (floppy) that was the preferred medium for storing and transporting small amounts of data, till the CD took over. On its way to oblivion, a floppy disc can store only 1.44 MB and becomes unreliable after a few uses.
	3. Hard disc drive: Residing inside the cabinet, its your primary data storage device. The programs you use, the music, movies and data you save on your PC in the form of files, are all stored here. With the constant need for more space, hard discs are increasing in capacity, while remaining the same in size. From a mere few hundred MB some years back, they now hold over 160 GB.
	4. Mother board: Several essential PC components like the microprocessor, sound card, graphics card and RAM sit on this board, which forms the hub of the PC hence the term motherboard. It also contains complex circuitry and ensures smooth 
functioning of the attached components. If you want to splurge, spend on this.
	5. Microprocessor: The misconception is that the speed of your PC depends entirely on how fast your processor is. And the blame for that lies with Intel, which still rules the processor market, with rival AMD a very distant second. Intels Pentium brand of processors lies in the heart of most PCs used at home. 
	However, despite factors like updated drivers, RAM capacity and others playing a role in how smooth and fast the PC runs, the processor is an integral part of your PC. It processes the data required for running applications and almost everything else.
	Due to the enormous heat generated by it, the processor is placed in a heat sink and the fan helps to cool further.
	6. RAM: Or Random Access Memory is where data is stored on a temporary basis for quick access when youre using the system. This, instead of storing on the hard disc, speeds up the process. More RAM most often makes your PC smoother and faster. RAM strips or modules are available in capacities of 64 MB and its multiples, and you can add as much as you want combining a number of them.
	7. Graphics card: Though most motherboards these days come with some graphics and sound built-in, youll need this add-on for better display and to boost your graphic capabilities, particularly while playing video games. This does much of the graphic processing that would otherwise be done by the microprocessor.
	8. Sound card: An optional plug-in circuit card that improves a PCs sound quality. The high-quality stereo sound output that you get, as well as the ability to connect to speakers and microphones, is to the credit of the sound card.
	9. Power supply: Distributes power supply to the different parts of the computer.
	10. Cabinet: The plastic casing that holds it all together.
	Term tips
	Bit, Byte, Kilobyte (KB), Megabyte (MB), Gigabyte (GB): Measurement units for computer file size. A Binary Digit (Bit) is the smallest unit of information a computer can hold. 8 Bits=1 Byte. 1024 Bytes=1 KB. 1024 KB=1 MB. 1024 MB=1 GB.
	 Device driver: A set of instructions that allows the applications to use devices like sound card, modem and so on. Acts as an interface between the components (hardware) and the applications (software).
	 MP3: Or MPEG Layer Audio-3 is a format for compressing sound files without significant quality loss. If a song on an audio CD (in WAV format) occupies 40 MB space, its MP3 form may occupy only 4 MB.
	 UPS: Or Uninterrupted Power Supply is a device that helps you to retain electricity supply for some time when a power-cut occurs. It gets charged (like an inverter) when connected to a power source and helps you save your work and shutdown the computer during that dreaded load-shedding.SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

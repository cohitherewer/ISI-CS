Fronted by novelist and filmmaker  Jayabrato Chatterjee, the glossy was unveiled at a high-flying  do at the ballroom of The Oberoi Grand. Doing the honours at Thats Style,  as the event was billed, were the effervescent Shobhaa De,  danseuse Mallika Sarabhai, Mr Iyer AKA Rahul Bose and British  writer Joe Roberts  all of whom were joined on the dais  by Harsh Neotia and the larger-than-life Lee Allison Sibley.  Preceding the unveiling was a rather interesting chat show  involving the aforementioned where the main topic of discussion  was, but naturally, style. Looking lovely in a gypsy skirt  and kurti, Shobhaa pointed out that style was largely  influenced by who one is and where ones at while Lee ruled  that a person should be what he/she wants to be and never  apologise for it. Rahul too, explained that style is what  you are best doing unconsciously, a thought echoed by almost  all the others. Sponsored by A. Sirkar, Mcdowells  Signature, Hiland Park, The Oberoi Grand and organised by  Open Doors, the affair also had the big-singing Usha Uthup  in the house who fittingly sang the Frank Sinatra-classic  I did it my way to mark the launch. Later in the  evening, she was joined by her siblings, Indira and Maya  and the select audience was regaled with a burst of melody   in foot-tapping Sami Sisters-style. And what would the evening be  without a little fashion? Offering just the right dose of  this was a showing of designer scarves by Monapali. Designed  for the occasion and inspired by the culture and traditions  of Calcutta, the throws were shown off by models Pinky,  Amrita, Shreshta, Sudipta and Ria  all dressed in black  saris with joba-malas strung around their necks.  Three scarves were also auctioned in aid of Helpage but  here, only a few hands were raised for the good cause. The  maximum bid was Rs 20,000 and saw among others, two husbands   Harsh Neotia and Dilip De  digging into their pockets  to buy the scarves for wives, Madhu and Shobhaa. Pinky shows off  a sari from Mantra at the Bengal Rowing Club  The mantra of life Silks swirled, shapely ankles  twirled and the glitter of antique borders caught the fancy  of one and all as Mantra, one of the citys popular boutiques  presented a fashion show featuring a collection of ethnic  eveningwear on the lush green grounds of the Bengal Rowing  Club recently. Titled The Elements of Nature, based on the  theme Tatva and dealing with the five different elements  of nature and their essences, the fashion extravaganza,  choreographed by Ashish Banerjee, unleashed a medley of  colours, cuts and fabrics, including the stunning Vintage  collection, the latest from designer Usha Bagri, also the  director of Mantra. Usha, who has been running the  boutique on 3A Camac Street with her friend Sharda Duggar  for the last couple of years, is by now a familiar name  on the citys fashionscape, best-known for her USP of blending  fabrics, colours and traditional hand-crafted embroidery  details with a contemporary twist. Although a self-taught  designer who started out with an exhibition at the Genesis  Art Gallery about six years ago, her career has since grown  by leaps and bounds and her designs now occupy pride of  place at such boutiques as Oorja and Elahe in Hyderabad,  Ffolio in Bangalore and Studio Saks in Chennai among others. At the Bengal Rowing Club, as  models Pinky, Nicola, Priyanka, Sharmistha, Ishika, Paromita,  Arijit and Niraj strode onto the ramp in heavy salwar-suits,  semi-formal saris, heavily-embroidered drapes and menswear,  Ushas forte was much in evidence in the mixing and matching  of vibrant hues of emerald, red, fuchsia and pretty turquoises  with such types of embroidery as zardosi, antique-work  with kundan and more. The cynosure of all eyes, though,  was the dazzling vintage collection of saris and salwar-suits  inspired by the antique jewellery of the rajgharanas  of Rajasthan. While the embroidery techniques used here  took in dabka, gota and jadau-work,  earlier seen only in the jewellery in stately homes, the  glittering antique brocade borders were all sourced from  the royal collections of Jaipur and Mewar  altogether a  scintillating mix that had clients reaching for their chequebooks.

 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Hepatitis hunts out another 50
 																											- Situation in South Dum Dum wards grim, patient tally 650 A STAFF REPORTER																								With 50 more people falling ill with hepatitis, the situation in Dum Dum and its adjoining areas remained grim on Tuesday. 																								Fresh cases were reported from two municipal wards in the south Dum Dum area, including Chasipara, Barmanpara, Low Land, Kalindi, Pratichi and Narayangarh.																								A total of 650 people are reported to be suffering from hepatitis in the two wards over the past few weeks. Srihir Bhattacharya, chairman of South Dum Dum Municipality, said the situation was improving, but people were still not out of danger.																								Inspection has revealed that sewerage water has seeped into drinking waterpipes, causing the jaundice outbreak in the municipality. The authorities have asked people to drink boiled water and heed the advice of doctors and healthcare workers, who have been making the rounds for the past few weeks.																								However, Anup Mitra, chairman-in-council (water supply), of South Dum Dum Municipality, refuses to believe that faecal contamination of drinking water was in any way responsible for the outbreak. 																								Let the report from the health department confirm that the hepatitis outbreak was caused by sewerage water seeping into drinking water, Mitra challenged.																								The health department inquiry is nearing completion and the final report should reach the authorities shortly.																								Not only hepatitis, but gastro-enteritis cases, too, have kept the health department busy for the past few months. Many gastro-enteritis cases have been reported from Tiljala, Beleghata, Narkeldanga and Phoolbagan in the past few weeks. 																								By the end of last week, nearly 200 people were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata and another 50 approached the hospital for treatment. The patients had reported dehydration and vomiting, apart from stomach disorder, health department officials said.																								The grim situation prompted the government to convene a special meeting, at which it was decided to shift all hepatitis cases to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and NRS Medical College and Hospital. 																								Special wards were kept ready for patients, as and when they arrived. The government has invited sharp criticism from various quarters, including the opposition parties, for its failure to tackle the situation.																								Recently, the government received a report on faecal contamination of drinking water. The survey, at the behest of various government health agencies, revealed how faecal contamination of water has increased by leaps and bounds.

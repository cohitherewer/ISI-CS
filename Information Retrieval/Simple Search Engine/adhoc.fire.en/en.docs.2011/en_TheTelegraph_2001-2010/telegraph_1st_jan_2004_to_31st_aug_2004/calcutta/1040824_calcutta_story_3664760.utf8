 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 September season to cheer
 																											- 38 new liquor outlets across city to raise excise revenue A STAFF REPORTER																								Come September, and Calcutta will find more reason to say cheers. Thanks to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments latest thrust on mopping up revenue, the city looks ready to raise a toast to 38 new liquor retail outlets.																								For the first time, the government has drawn up plans for 1,000 new liquor retail outlets across Bengal at one go. 																								Announcing this, excise officials said 38 licences would be issued in Calcutta, of which 20 are slotted for the northern part of the city, and 18 for the southern. 																								The decision was taken recently and a circular issued to all district magistrates and excise superintendents. 																								Prabodh Chandra Sinha, minister in charge of the excise department, said on Monday: We are working towards setting up more outlets to meet the rising demand, as well as for raising revenue. 																								According to the circular, licence for a liquor shop could be issued in a city, town or suburban area where population is dense. 																								However, permission for opening a shop cannot be given beside an existing outlet. In a city, one retail outlet will be opened for every 12,000 heads, while in a village, it will be one for every 18,000 heads.																								Changing its earlier decision, the state government will not depend on the recommendations of district officials about issuing licences for liquor shops. 																								The excise department will fix the number of liquor retail outlets in the districts.																								We will seek applications through newspaper advertisements, starting next month, a senior excise department official said. 																								The official added that of 1,000 shops, 300 would be given to unemployed youths of the state through a lottery.																								For a liquor shop licence in the city, one will have to pay Rs 1.5 lakh, while for one in the villages, the rate has been fixed at Rs 70,000. 																								Presently there are 4,100 liquor shops, of which 1,700 are country liquor shops, 1,500 are bars and 900 outlets sell foreign liquor. 																								Official sources said the state government earns an annual revenue of around Rs 500 crore from these outlets. 																								The move is aimed at increasing the revenue of the cash-strapped state exchequer. There is no other way for increasing earnings at the moment, the official pointed out. 																								Apart from Calcutta, 115 liquor outlets are being planned in South 24-Parganas, 106 in North 24-Parganas, 53 in Howrah and 63 in Hooghly.

 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Departments drag feet over manpower report 
 SWATI SENGUPTA																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government seems to have forgotten its do it now mantra. This is clear from the fact that most state government departments have not yet submitted their reports on optimum utilisation of manpower to the personnel and administrative reforms (PAR) department. 																								Bhattacharjee had asked each department to study its staff strength and indicate whether the manpower is being used optimally. They were also asked to suggest by December 31 whether the staff strength was in excess or fell short, and whether there was any scope to re-deploy additional manpower to other departments. 																								Some important departments like finance, health and home department have not yet submitted their reports. Only about seven out of 59 government departments have submitted their reports till January 2. The following two days being state government holidays  Saturday and Sunday  the rest have delayed the process by at least another two days.																								Officially though, none of them has gone wrong in delaying submission of the reports. When a note was sent to all the departments in September, they were asked to complete the exercise by December 31. So all departments can send their reports to PAR at their own convenience by reasoning that they had completed the exercise on that date and have sent the reports thereafter, a senior officer of Writers Buildings said. 																								Another note sent later said that the exercise must be completed by December 31 and the reports submitted thereafter. In government parlance, each department has its own way of defining the term thereafter. So it is not really known when all the reports would be submitted, the official added. 																								Chief secretary Asok Gupta, who heads an apex committee comprising the secretaries of development and planning, finance and PAR, will study the results of all departments and submit a report to the chief minister by month-end. The committee will also offer its suggestions to the government on the possibilities of redeployment.																								Only about 26 out of 59 departments have submitted preliminary reports on the sanctioned strength and existing strength in their departments. They were supposed to have completed the exercise much earlier. 																								Almost all departments have said their existing strength falls short of the sanctioned strength.																								But this does not indicate whether the existing strength is essential. So the next phase of the report showing optimum requirement of manpower is crucial, the official said.

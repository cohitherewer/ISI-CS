 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Top cop pulls out all stops on rash driving
 PRONAB MONDAL 																								With January ending up as one of the bloodiest months having several road accidents to its credit, city police went on action gear to reduce the increasing fatality rate on the streets. The traffic wings new move was initiated at the instance of city police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty who blamed rash driving for most mishaps. 																								He issued a circular during the last road safety week, asking his subordinates to check recklessness on wheels. We initiated the move 12 days ago and have already impounded 1,416 vehicles for rash driving, said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police, traffic department.																								In January, 42 persons were run over. The police-driven road safety week witnessed seven road deaths, three higher than the previous safety week. This prompted the police commissioner to voice concern over the spiralling fatality count. 																								In a traffic review meeting held at Lalbazar, Chakraborty expressed his displeasure. Reckless driving seems to have been responsible for most of the accidents And, obviously, drivers of buses and minibuses are responsible. Do something against them. We put all our 250 traffic sergeants on alert asking them to prosecute reckless drivers, said an official of the traffic department.																								Of the vehicles booked under Section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act (action against reckless driving), 562 were buses. We prosecuted 272 drivers of minibuses, too, for careless driving. Lightweight vehicles such as the Matador van and three-wheelers, too, were booked. We revoked the licenses of the offenders, said Basu, adding, There was no question of excusing rash driving even if it was the first offence. The rogue drivers caught by the traffic sergeants are being slapped fines as high as Rs 2,000.																								Traffic sergeants, who patrol city streets, were informed about Chakrabortys instructions. We issue six litres of fuel to each sergeant and it is enough to keep a close watch on the roads. They were told to patrol different intersections like Moulali, Chowringhee, Shyambazar five-point crossing and Park Circus seven-point crossing. Besides, busy roads like Chittaranjan Avenue, Jawahar Lal Nehru Road, Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Road were brought under the scanner, said Basu.																								He said the drive against reckless driving will continue. We have no plan to withdraw our vigil on the roads. The patrol vans of traffic police have also been instructed to keep a close eye on the streets instead of watching from the sidelines, he added.																								nMalaria centre: A 24-hour malaria detection centre will be inaugurated at SSKM Hospital on Thursday. The state government has invested a few lakhs in equipping the centre with state-of-the-art gadgets which will facilitate faster detection and treatment of malaria.

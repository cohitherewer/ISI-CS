The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 After Meenaxi, a crowded canvas
 															- INTRIGUE amp; A BREAK FROM CONVENTION A STAFF REPORTER Actress Tabu with painter and film-maker M.F. Husain in Calcutta on Tuesday for a promotional tour of Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities. Pictures by Pabitra Das 																								At 88, Maqbool Fida Husain is making yet another start  distancing himself from son Owais on the big screen, exploring his favourite cinematic form, keeping his options open about his next leading lady and preparing for a canvas count of a hundred in his next artistic venture.																								The painter- filmmaker turned up in town on Tuesday for a promotional tour of Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities with a select team of the cast and crew  heroine Tabu, debutant Kunnal Kapoor, associate director Owais and cinematographer Santosh Sivan.																								Husain will rush back to Dubai in a couple of days to finish the Vision of the 20th Century project, where he will do a series of 100 paintings. The collection will later tour the world.																								I dont like repeating myself. My first film was shot entirely in the studio, the scenery was all created on the sets. So, with the second one, I wanted to move outdoors and have exotic backdrops. Gajagamini was classical, the tone of Meenaxi is very down-to-earth, said Husain, listing Kurosawa, Bunuel, Fellini, Ritwik Ghatak and Adoor Gopalakrishnan as his favourite film-makers.																								For leading lady Tabu, dressed in bright red salwar kameez, Meenaxi offered the opportunity to be part of the painters creative universe. I do films for the intrigue In Meenaxi, there were no rules to follow and the style of working was also very different from conventional film-making, as I have seen it, she said. Kunnal Kapoor (top) and Owais Husain: Debutant duo																								Tabu as Meenaxi was the choice of both father and son, admits Owais, because shes a very good actress. My father, my wife Reima and I decided to make a film together when we were at the Berlin Film Festival three years ago. We wanted it to be a sublime love story, recounted Owais, on his collaborative directorial debut.																								But integrating his fathers vision into his own, conceptualising the frames, the shots, the sets and the music had its share of conflict and contradiction. I tried to do my own styling on his abstract ideas, he added. Owais has distorted my script; he thought he was improving it, laughed his father.																								With the euphoria of filming Meenaxi fading, father and son are poised to part ways and chart their individual cinematic courses. I want to shoot my next film, which I will direct myself, in the fascinating Northeast, said Owais, a painter passionate about films. I want to explore the rasa theory. The film should make you want to put your hand on the screen and eat it because it looks so delicious.																								Husain, too, will be steering his next feature himself because one was enough with Owais. This time, its a comedy with only action and very few words. Komedy.com will centre around three women hailing from Bihar, Punjab and Goa. One is dumb, one deaf and the other has just forgotten to laugh, said the painter, who loves watching the poker-faced comedian Buster Keaton. He was the greatest of them all, even greater than Charlie Chaplin.

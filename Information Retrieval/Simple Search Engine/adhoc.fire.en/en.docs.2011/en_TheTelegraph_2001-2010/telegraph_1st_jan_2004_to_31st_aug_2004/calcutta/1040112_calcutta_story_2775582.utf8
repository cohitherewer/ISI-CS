 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Drop in count of fatalities on streets
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The number of accident deaths has come down in the past year, police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty claimed on Sunday.																								Speaking on the Rabindra Sadan stage during the concluding programme of the Road Safety Week, Chakraborty rattled off the figures: The number of deaths from fatal accidents in 2002 stood at 457, while the corresponding figure in 2003 is 442.																								Also, if the fatality count during the Road Safety Week in 2002 was 14, it dropped to seven in 2003 and six this January. 																								The police commissioner observed that the figures were a pointer to the fact that both pedestrians and drivers were becoming more aware of their road responsibilities.																								The number of deaths in road accidents is also low, considering the area of the city and the manner in which the number of vehicles and the population is growing, Chakraborty added.																								Deputy commissioner of traffic Peeyush Pandey stressed the importance of the traffic safety week as it acts like a precaution by ensuring that citizens are made aware of road rules and responsibilities.																								The role of schoolchildren and NCC cadets in managing traffic during this past week was also highlighted. The young traffic managers manned 20 road safety booths, including those at vital intersections on Park Street, MG Road, Central Avenue, Dhakuria and Diamond Harbour Road.																								A workshop for drivers was also organised by the cops.

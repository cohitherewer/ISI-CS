The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Club pads up for indoor sports arena
 SUBHRO SAHADI-SCOVERY ROUTE Swimming pool to be relocated with childrens pool and jacuzzi Modern health club with spa Cue sports room and card room Indoor arena for cricket, basketball, volleyball, soccer, badminton Squash court with viewers gallery Deluxe suitesA hearty game of squash, smashing slam-dunk action, right on cue at the snooker tabletop or slick passing in a bout of breathless indoor soccer action. Around the time World Cup (Germany 2006) fever grips Calcutta, the city will gear up to welcome a composite sports complex right in the heart of its crme-de-la-crme south.																								At a time when traditional (read pre-Partition) clubs in town are faced with serious competition from the swank, new-age avatars, a fitting response has come from one of the age-old clubbing bastions of Bengal, Dalhousie Institute. DI-scovery: Sports complex n suites, a Rs 4-crore, fully air-conditioned integrated sports-cum-leisure facility, is set to roll out in 2006 on the clubs 42, Jhowtala Road campus, after being passed with an overwhelming majority at Sundays AGM.																								We want to provide our members with a facility no other club in Calcutta has and we hope this would engineer a paradigm shift in the way clubs are run in town, stresses DI president Derek OBrien, who was elected for a second term on Sunday. Half of the project cost will be raised from the 400-odd new members (getting in at Rs 55,000 each) and the rest through borrowings. The 2,200 existing members wont be burdened with the cost of the new project.																								The complex, with a total built-up area of 30,000 sq ft, will include a squash court, an indoor arena with viewers gallery for cricket, football, basketball, volleyball and badminton, besides two rooms for cue sports, a card room, a health club and spa and six luxury suites. Architect Jayprakash Agrawal is likely to provide the design solution.																								This will be a wonderful value-add to the city once complete, providing youngsters with talent in sports the right kind of ambience to blossom, observes former Test cricketer Arun Lal, who plans to become a DI member to use the upcoming facility.																								Existing member Ravi Kidwai agrees. The sports complex will surely put DI in the top-five bracket in terms of facilities. It also means the club can add serious sports meets to its calendar of fun events, says Kidwai, a keen sportsperson himself.																								The DI management has obtained approval of 50 seniormost members for the project and the funds are also in place. The only factor, which can still derail the mega project, though, is the agreement with the staff union, that comes up for renewal in August.																								Mindset could be the biggest stumbling block when you try to do something like this at an old institution. We want to take everybody with us and we are trying different routes, without tampering with the culture and heritage of the club, OBrien points out.																								In keeping with the drift of change and as a precursor to DI-scovery, the club is brewing up another storm this Christmas. DI-version, a coffee bar with a road theme, will be unveiled, replete with zebra crossings, signages, neons and plasma screen TV to go with the motif. The idea is to create enough reasons for the family to frequent DI as a family.

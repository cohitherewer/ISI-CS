 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Math paper in Bypass bush, result withheld
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Amartya Sengupta was one of three examinees from St Lawrence High School whose answer-scripts mysteriously went missing after the completion of the second mathematics paper.																								While it is still unclear what had occurred back in April, the boys results were withheld on Tuesday.																								The answer-scripts had been recovered a day after the exam from a bush on the EM Bypass. 																								The teachers of Tiljala High School  where the three boys had written their papers  accused the students of walking out of the examination hall without submitting their scripts.																								While the other two boys received their results, Sengupta will have to wait till the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education finishes its investigation and clears him of some circumstantial evidence.																								One of the other boys, Nikhil Goenka was placed in first division and has got a seat in a private engineering college in the city, having cleared the joint entrance examinations. The third student, Kushal Patel, scored second division marks, said Father K. Thottam, vice-principal, St Lawrence School.																								The council had launched an inquiry into how the answer-scripts may have been smuggled out of the exam hall. 																								The three students have appeared before the committee several times over the past two months for interrogation.																								The students guardians, on the other hand, are unhappy because the Council has been silent about what action it will take against the invigilators. 																								The students have been harassed because of their negligence, the parents claim, as it is invigilators duty to ensure the safety of answer-scripts till they are locked away in strong rooms.																								Council secretary Dibyendu Chakraborty said that Amartyas results have been withheld till certain doubts are clarified.																								Amartya was the only Bengali-speaking boy among the three, said Council officials, and the answer-scripts, when found on the EM Bypass, were wrapped in a Bengali newspaper. He was also the last of the three to leave the examination hall.																								The Councils decision to withhold Amartyas results is a fresh blow to him and the family, said father Amit. 																								He has cleared the joint entrance as well, and secured a marine engineering berth in a private college. His final admission depends on the release of his results.																								I have already deposited Rs 21,000 for my sons admission. I dont know why the Council has singled him out for this treatment, added Amit Sengupta.																								The Council is still investigating the matter, stressed Chakraborty, and it will punish the teachers of the Tiljala school, if found guilty.

Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: We have been married for the past seven years but I have not been able to conceive. I was told that we should sleep with our heads pointing to the west of our room, as according to Feng Shui this direction is connected with children. But this is not feasible because our house is placed diagonal to the four main directions. Please help.																								Name and address withheld																								A: In a house where the cardinal directions are diagonal, you need not position your bed at 45 degrees from the wall to tap the energy from the west. It is best to keep your bed against a wall and activate the childrens area with a metal and an earthen object. Try placing a Laughing Buddha with lots of children all over, along with photographs of your nieces and nephews. You can even keep some silver baby rattlers in a cabinet in this corner.Q: We moved into a high-rise builPlacing a Laughing Buddha in the western corner of the bedroom

ding about five years back, where the south-west portion of the apartment is completely cut off. My husband is facing multiple problems in his business, which he started two years ago. The instability is leading to frustrations and rising tempers in the family. Please suggest remedies.																								Sanjana Tiwary, Calcutta																								A: South-west is undoubtedly an important direction connected with stability, be it in marriage or business. This can be achieved by keeping heavy earthen pots filled with pebbles or stones in the area. These can also be accompanied by heavy boulders hidden behind them or by creating a rocky area that is decorated with potted plants and highlighted with lights. 																								It helps if you place a couples photograph along with the paraphernalia. Take care not to introduce anything in the area that suggests movement, like a water feature, wind chime or pendulum clock. However, you must ensure before placing any objects from the earth like stones and boulders, that they are thoroughly cleansed to remove any negative energy. Do not forget to tap an auspicious day for the placement of this arrangement.  Placing a Laughing Buddha in the western corner of the bedroom can enhance luck in conceiving a childQ: My date of birth is 05.12.1950. In 1994, I had purchased a new flat. Its on the top floor of a building facing north-west. In 1997, I lost my husband in an accident and in 2001, I took voluntary retirement from my job. I have also lost Rs 30,000 in a business. My only joys in life are my two sons who are aged 16 (DOB: 27.11.1988) and 21 (DOB: 31.05.1983). My bedroom is in the north-west while my sons bedroom is in the south-west. Please suggest measures to bring us luck.																								Susan Bhowmick, Calcutta																								A: According to the Flying Star method of Feng Shui, any property that was constructed between 1984 to 2003 facing north-west (second and third sector), attained negative stars known as Strings of Pearls. As a result, its occupants undergo tragedies and do not prosper. 																								The best way to bring in auspicious stars is by making major renovations with cement and concrete in this new age of eight, which began from January 22 this year. You can also try shifting to the south-west bedroom to bring a degree of stability to your life. Your sons can use the north-west bedroom till they get married. After marriage, one should avoid staying in this direction as a north-west room has adverse effects on a couples relationship, often leading to separation. 																								Q: My date of birth is 05.02.1976. I am doing quite well in my career but my personal life is in shambles. I am not happy as my heart is not into what Im doing. I feel restless and am given to bouts of frustration, anger and depression. I also find it hard to concentrate on tasks at hand and feel lazy and lethargic most of the time. Please suggest some tips that will help calm me and concentrate better. 																								Priyanka Mehta, Kadapara																								A: According to your pillars of destiny, you are going through a phase that shows a major change in life. The positive effect of this is reflected in your shining career. But the negative aspect of this period is that there will be a lot of mental pressure. I would recommend you shift to a room in the north-east direction and surround yourself with earthy colours like beige, cream, yellow or brown. The vibrations in this area are very peaceful, which will help you relax and calm your mind.

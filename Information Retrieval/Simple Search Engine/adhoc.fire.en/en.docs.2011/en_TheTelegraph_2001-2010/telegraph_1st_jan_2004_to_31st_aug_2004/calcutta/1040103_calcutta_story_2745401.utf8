 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Daylight dacoity in Salt Lake apartment
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three young men broke into a flat in Salt Lakes Purbachal housing estate, opposite Hyatt Regency, at around 11 am on Friday. They ransacked the flat for half-an-hour, before fleeing the area in a taxi. A complaint has been lodged with Bidhannagar (South) police station and a hunt launched for the gang.																								The dacoits struck at Purbachals Phase II, in flat no. 3R 6/4. Flat-owner Arpita Chanda runs a business in computer networking and lives alone with an elderly maid. On Friday morning, Arpita was out shopping and her maid had gone to the ration shop nearby. The three youths broke the lock on the front door and entered the first-floor flat.																								The maid, Usha Kayal, returned to find the lock broken and tried to rush down the stairs to alert some labourers at work on the ground floor. She had barely climbed down a few steps when the robbers rushed out and dragged her into apartment. They were probably keeping a watch through the keyhole, a police officer later said.																								The youths were speaking in Hindi among themselves and one of them held a gun to Usha, Arpita said. They forced the maid into a toilet, threatened to shoot her if she tried to raise an alarm and bolted the door.																								The gang then ransacked the flat but found precious little. They took some cash, gold-plated jewellery and gold ornaments. But they could not lay their hands on the fixed-deposit certificates and cash in my locker, Arpita said.																								They seemed to have left in a hurry as the iron rod, with which they broke the lock on the door, was found on the bed, an officer said. 																								Once the robbers were gone, Usha opened a window and shouted for help. One of the neighbours let her out.																								We have launched a hunt for the miscreants, said Sujoy Chanda, sub-divisional police officer of Salt Lake.																								The dacoity has left Arpita in a state of shock. I have been living here since 1988 and never has anything like this happened before. I am very worried, as they might come back, she said.																								The law-and-order situation in the area is going from bad to worse, said local Trinamul Congress councillor Minu Chakraborty. Alleging that the police in Salt Lake only had time for VIP duties, she added: It may be difficult to provide individual security, but police patrolling must be intensified.

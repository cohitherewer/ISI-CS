 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Bagha Pratap
																								Pratap Singha is a man troubled by the sheer materialism that has consumed his fellowmen. Engulfed in an irrepressible bitterness towards the world at large, he becomes a loner and a rebel refusing to compromise on his principles. He envisions a society cleansed of its parasites and sets out to achieve his goal by infusing practicality to his vision. In this war against complacence, he is joined by his fiancee. They take on civilisation by its horns and begin by throwing consumerism out of its very system, all the while dreaming of a purer world, pristine in its goodness and glory. Bagha Pratap is a story of this journey towards a higher social order.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Birthday bash for pub pilgrims
 Hip Pocket drummer Nondon Bagchi cuts the Someplace Else birthday cake while musicians and guests look on. Picture by Rashbehari DasIts got under the citys skin. Someplace Else, which started as a disco with a hanky for a dance floor 10 years ago, has evolved into a place of pilgrimage.																								The pub, which redefined the citys live music scene, is celebrating its 10th birthday this month, with a line-up carefully balanced to reach out to its loyalists, brought up over the years on an appetite of the best bands in town, and around the country.																								The special events start off at The Park this Friday, with rock act Zero kicking off the show. The next week, Louis Banks with Skinny Alley will perform.																								For those with a soft spot for the Someplace Else of old, there will be a chance to step on to the floor again, packed as tightly as a can of sardines.																								Saturday, August 21, will see the pub turn back into a disco for a night, in a Back to Someplace Else 94 evening. The promise is that the same DJ (Austin) will be back with the same music, and the bar will be back with the same prices.																								The finale is on the following Saturday, August 28, with Gary Lawyer and Hip Pocket holding fort. That, plans the hotel, is likely to be accompanied by the launch of a coffee table book about Someplace Else over the years, with images from the past and quotes from most prized patrons.																								The pub has enough reason to celebrate. Every year, we have had increases in footfalls and revenue, which is rare in the industry, explains Anirban Simlai, manager, food and beverages, The Park, who used to be in charge of the show at Someplace Else.																								A recent customer engagement survey conducted by Gallup was also encouraging for the management. We were above the national and international average in terms of engagement with the customer, adds Simlai. That explains the reluctance to tamper with the existing model. 																								Week in, week out, the Someplace Else groupies come back to hear the same bands play mostly the same tracks over and over again. The songs are enduring in themselves, observes musician Nondon Bagchi, who started performing live on the tiny wooden floor on March 30, 1997. But it is also about coming back to a place where you are comfortable and can let your hair down.																								Most of the guest performers, too, treasure the experience of playing for the pulsating crowd that flocks to shows. Many charge a fraction of their regular fees and end up playing for much longer than they had intended.																								The audience never lets them down, either. The largely male crowd is a mix of young guys learning music, corporate executives, and people in their 40s, who enjoy their beer, but most of all, love their music.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

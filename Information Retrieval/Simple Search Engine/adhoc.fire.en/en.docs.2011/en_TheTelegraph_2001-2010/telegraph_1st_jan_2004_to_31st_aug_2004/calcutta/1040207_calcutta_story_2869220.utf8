 Udita Goswami shows off an outfit designed by Poonam Bhagat of Taika 															Its always teeming with women hunting for the perfect outfit. But thats not surprising given that Zenon has managed to build up quite a formidable reputation for itself when it comes to looking good, the traditional way. Known for its extensive variety and top-notch quality, this designer atelier at 113, Park Street, helmed by Namrata and Ashish Goenka, now has even more stuff for fashion-watchers to feast their eyes on  a spanking-new collection of ethnicwear and Indo-Westerns courtesy designer Poonam Bhagat of Taika.																					Working with natural and hand-woven fabrics, Poonams collection encompasses all that is good about Indian textiles  cotton silks, gossamer-thin Chanderis, diaphanous organzas, sensuous crepe de chines, tawny tussars with shimmering brocade borders and more. The clothes are as much about stylish cuts and silhouettes as about embroidery, which is either minimal or discreet, but always eye-catching. Machine and hand-embroideries are often combined for a stunning antique look, stitching details and surface textures such as tucking, pleating, hemming, anchor thread-stitching and dori lines are used liberally, while block-printing techniques, appliqu-work and sequins also come into play for that extra edge. The colour palette is both soothing and delicious, incorporating pretty hues of mint, leaf-green, lemon, peach and lime as well as the more vibrant reds. Stealing the show here are the appliqud Chanderi on Chanderi short kurtas with crepe bottoms, the shaded georgette saris with dabka-work as well as a classic black collection complete with crinkled dupattas, brocade borders and pattis or tilla-work in old gold.																					The best part about buying a Taika  the word means magic in Finnish  creation is that the pricing is not over-the-top. So, while the cotton silk kurtas start at about Rs 3,500, the saris with abstract and geometric motifs that are a hallmark of Poonams label are priced upwards of Rs 7,000.

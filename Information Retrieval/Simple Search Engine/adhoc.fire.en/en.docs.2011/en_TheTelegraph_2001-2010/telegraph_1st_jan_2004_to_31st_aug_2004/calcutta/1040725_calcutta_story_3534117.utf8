The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 25, 2004 No holds barred on Saturday night
ClubSandwichFashion designer Anamika Khanna, mall-man Rahul Saraf, restaurateur Rajiv Kothari, Spandan star Renu Roy, Rollick lady Sadhana Agarwal and Hiland Park chief Sumit Dabriwal are among the 300-odd Calcuttans youre likely to meet chilling or dancing their hearts out at Saturday Club on a Saturday night, post midnight.Indeed, the pub night that rocks this club on Wednesdays and Saturdays is the most happening thing in the citys club circuit today. A Saturday night for most of Calcuttas talked about party people is not well spent without a few drinks at the bar and some moves on the floor to DJ Ferozs beat (so what if he plays the same song thrice in an evening or takes a minute-long break between songs?).However, this hip affair got on track just five years ago. The Saturday Club pub night was the brainchild of the present president of this Wood Street address, Shyamal Mitra, who was then in charge of the bar. I wanted to introduce something similar to the pubs I had visited in European countries where one could relax over a few drinks while listening to soft music, says Mitra, who tip-toed the topic in front of other committee members.It was agreed that we would run the pub night on an experimental basis to see if it gelled with the formal image of the club, remembers Mitra. So, the bar was set up with some extra chairs and tables and saxophone-player Paul Mullick  the only man who agreed to play within the budget the club had  was roped in to start the first ever pub night.Soon, the nights were a hit and so was Paul. People were gradually loosening up and making use of the little space around the furniture to jive. In two weeks, the furniture was removed and the jivers took over the place; we have not looked back since, explains Mitra.The monotony of a single instrument made way for DJ music two years ago. Now, most members and their guests prefer a pub night to a nightclub. Parents feel safe that their children are partying in the club while they themselves like to party here since they find people of their own age-group and dont feel out of place, reasons Mitra.A typical pub night does not get underway without some freebies in the form of buy one get one free on drinks, free cocktails for women, sponsored gifts against interactive gamesThank god its Saturday they say these days at Saturday Club.HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

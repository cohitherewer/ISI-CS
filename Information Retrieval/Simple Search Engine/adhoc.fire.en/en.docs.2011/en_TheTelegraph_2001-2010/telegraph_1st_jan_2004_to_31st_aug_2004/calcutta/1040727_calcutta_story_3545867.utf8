The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 HS results at noon, a week late
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The results of Higher Secondary (HS) 2004 will be out on Tuesday, officials of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education announced on Monday. Around 391,000 students appeared for the April examinations.																								The marksheets will be distributed to schools from 33 centres across the state. The results should reach students by the afternoon. This years results have been delayed by nearly a week, as many teachers checking answer-scripts were also involved in election duty. 																								Delays inconvenience students, mainly those who have gained admission in colleges in other states. 																								But we have tried to minimise errors in the published marks, in view of the large number of legal cases filed by examinees over the past two years, an official said.																								The results will be available on the following websites from Tuesday noon:																								www.wbchsc.nic.in www.wbresults.nic.in www.calcuttatelephones.com www.calcutta.bsnl.org www.tathyabangla.org www.wbgov.com www.banglarmukh.com																								The results will also be available through an interactive voice response system. This can be accessed by dialling 1250102 from any BSNL line, followed by the roll number. 																								Outstation students can access it by dialling (9533) 1250102.

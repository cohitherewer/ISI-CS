 																											- Only green patch in Howrahs industrial belt withers for funds OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The 150-year-old Belilious Park, once the pride of Howrah town, has been reduced to a wreck today, thanks to the neglect and apathy of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC). 																								The towns civic authorities maintain that they dont have the funds to spare for the 93-odd bigha parks upkeep. Consequently, the kilometre-wide waterbody in the park has turned into an open-air toilet. 																								It is the only plot of green in central Howrahs industrial belt, but the HMC has always turned a blind eye to it, complained Sachindranath Banerjee, a long-time resident of Belilious Road. 																								Other residents said a major chunk of the park had been occupied by shanties. It required a reprimand from the green bench of Calcutta High Court to prompt the municipal authorities to evict them. 																								The high court directed the HMC early in 2003 to clear the park of encroachments and preserve it, said a civic official. But since then, the HMC has continued to be slothful about renovating the park.																								Inquiries revealed that the green bench order required the HMC to evict the slum-dwellers and declare an agenda on renovation of the park to the high court within two months. 																								The HMC took a spate of dates from the court, but till today, it has not presented an action plan to the court, said another civic official.																								It had been decided at the mayoral council meetings that the park would be handed over to a non-government organisation. According to HMC officials, the private party would convert the green zone into a childrens park, renovating it with all sorts of modern sports equipment. 																								The project was estimated to cost Rs 15 crores, which may be why it was dropped.																								We have decided about the project at the mayoral council meetings and I have asked officials to draw up the plans for renovation of the park as early as possible, said Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee. 																								It was also decided at the mayoral council meetings last year that tenders would be invited from private parties, who would ultimately take on the project for the Howrah parks beautification. 																								But since then, the HMC has been sitting tight and doing nothing to carry forward the revamp plans.																								Mayor Mukherjee explained the inaction as waiting for the high court to pass an order on the renovation plan. The HMC can go ahead with the revamp project only after a court nod.

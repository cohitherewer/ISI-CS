The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Will the babus bus it while the cops pedal?
 															- SUBHAS DIKTAT ON NON-BHARAT II CARS				 	 The gun is trained on vehicles used by Writers Buildings and the police department. Most of their cars do not match the Bharat Stage II norms																								The day appears imminent when the babus of Writers Buildings will have to travel by bus and officers of the city police stations will roll out on bicycles for investigations, courtesy the court deadline of April 2004 to abide by the Bharat Stage II norms.																								The transport department has decided to despatch its old vehicles to the districts and fill the vacuum with new vehicles for ministers, bureaucrats and other officers entitled to cars. It will also upgrade the engines of its cars, the ones not so old, to Bharat II norms. Most government cars do not conform to the norms.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said his department would ensure that not a single non-Bharat II government vehicle was on the road after the deadline. We have to replace the old cars with new ones, but it is not possible to buy so many vehicles at a time when we have a funds crunch. So, it will not be possible to provide cars to all officers who are entitled to them. They will have to make their own travel arrangements, Chakraborty asserted.																								On a directive from the transport department, the police department, the worst hit by the Bharat II whip, has decided to go the same way and send all its old vehicles to the districts that do not fall under the deadline area.																								Officials said the transport department owns 142 cars, of which 102 do not conform to Bharat II norms. That apart, about 250 of the 300 vehicles used by different corporations and agencies do not conform to the emission norms. The situation is worse in the force, where 700 of the 850 vehicles used by various police stations in the city and suburbs and by the police headquarters are non-Bharat II.																								Writers has issued a directive to all undertakings, corporations and agencies, like the WBIDC, CMDA and the CIT, and 38 civic bodies within the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, including Calcutta Municipal Corporation, either to upgrade the engines of their vehicles or phase them out.																								The transport department has also sought lists of vehicles that ply under various government departments and agencies. We shall upgrade the old engines of some of the pool cars. The rest will be sent to the districts for use by officials there. As the high court order will not affect most of the districts, the old cars can easily ply there. We shall buy new vehicles to replace the pool cars, said H Mohan, joint secretary, transport department.																								Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb held meetings with the city and state police top brass and asked them to start phasing out the old vehicles in their departments. He made it clear that no non-BS II police vehicle will be allowed to ply after the April 2004 deadline.																								The severest test we face is with the old vehicles. Some of them have to be scrapped anyway, because of their condition. We shall upgrade some that are in proper shape and send the rest to the district police offices. For the city proper, we will buy new cars. I dont know where well get the funds, though. We are discussing the matter with the finance department, home secretary Deb said. 																								Home department officials said that as a result of the phase-out decision, the city police will face an acute crisis of vehicles, which will be detrimental to investigations.																								We admit that the police will be rendered almost immobile after phasing out the non-Bharat II vehicles, as there is no certainty of the immediate purchase of new cars, given the governments present financial condition. However, we shall try to manage the crisis by hiring cars, the home secretary said.						 A STAFF REPORTER

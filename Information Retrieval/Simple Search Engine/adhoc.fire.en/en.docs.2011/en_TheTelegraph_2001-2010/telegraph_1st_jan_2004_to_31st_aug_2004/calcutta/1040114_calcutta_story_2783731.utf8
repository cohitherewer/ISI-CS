 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Rescue act erupts into bitter battle
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Sonagachhi was the scene of a bitter clash on Tuesday between sex workers and pimps, and policemen, who had gone to rescue an under-aged sex worker.																								The sex workers and pimps hurled bottles, stones and other missiles at the policemen. At least six cops were injured, several shops damaged and a police vehicle heavily stoned. 																								Officer-in-charge Shib Shankar Guha of Lalbazars immoral trafficking section reached the spot around 1 pm to conduct the raid. He was accompanied by only two constables.																								Members of the Durbar Mahila Samanyay Committee, an association of sex workers in Sonagachhi, however, claimed that Payal was no minor, that she was in her mid-twenties, a mother of two, and had been operating out of Sonagachhi for the past six years. They alleged that Guha had hit some women while questioning them. 																								This incited the sex workers, and suddenly, the three policemen found themselves confronted by a mob of angry women, who pelted them with bricks, stones and even coconut shells. 																								A contingent from Burtola thana managed to rescue the trio, but not before six of the team were injured. Later, Lalbazar officers said Payal, 14, was rescued and brothel operator Nilima Das arrested. However, Rabi Dutta, owner of the building, could not be located.																								Proper inquiries were made before the raid was conducted. The girl had been sold to Nilima Das last Puja for Rs 5,000, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner (detective department).

Its time to wax eloquent about the humble candle. Gone are the days when the wax-and-wick combine only came to light up dark times during a power cut or to set the mood during a rare candlelit dinner. Candles are now melting hearts in a variety of shapes and sizes, in a riot of colours and smells.																								Rectangles, rounds, pyramids, stars, flowers, leaves, hearts - the pliant wax can liven up the most dismal nook and corner of a house. While big, chunky candles get pride of place on side-tables, shelves and mantelpieces, more subtle creations like tiny flowers and leaves work their magic floating about in water arrangements to create an oasis of calm. 																								Often, you will see unlit candles scattered around houses indefinitely. To burn some of these pretty pieces sometimes feels like quite a shame. But if you work up the nerve to enjoy your acquisition, it can do wonders. The tiny flame can fill a room with scents like sandalwood, khus, kewra, lavender, rose, jasmine or mystic blends. Like the fusion of sandalwood, lavender, basil and geranium, which forms, apparently, the stress-busting combine recommended in aromatherapy.RACK RAIDER Candle Craze
 What 
Chunky candles, perfumed candles, floating candles, gel candles
 Where 
Avishkar, The Address, Landmark, Shoppers Stop
 How much 
Rs 10 (small floating ones) to Rs 1,000 (big pieces to be placed on the floor)For those more concerned about a longer shelf life, gel candles stick around the longest. Available in transparent containers, the gel melts and solidifies again to last longer than their wax counterparts. The wick turns out to be the wicked devil that spoils the show eventually. But you can do away with the pique by sticking another wick firmly in place when the original burns out.																								If your do-it-yourself instinct burns bright, try your hand at making your own gel candles. Heres how it goes: Put some gel (available in most wholesale markets) in a glass container. Cover it with a lid and keep in the freezer. Let it stand for an hour, stick a wick in and light your fire! You can let loose your imagination and play around with sparkles and glitter or a few of your favourite things.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

				 	PUJA PALTwinkle toes...Is Puja Pal. The 14-year-old has been learning Odissi since age seven, but picked up Bharatanatyam as the sixth subject for the boards. While Odissi she feels is effeminate, Bharatanatyam is smart but graceful. But what makes the achievements of The Heritage School student most commendable is that she lost her left arm in an accident when she was eight years old. The speeding taxi might have left her disabled in body, but not in spirit.Historys mysteries...Is what the Salt Lake girl wants to unravel. Her favourite subject is history, with a keen interest in Egyptology. One day, Puja hopes to roam the world, with a must-stop in three hot spots  venturing into the hidden chambers of the Giza pyramids, delving deep into the Amazon forest and enjoying the sea, sun, sand, beauty and culture in the Mediterranean. For the moment though, a history honours in college will suffice. Smart and simple...Is the way the Class IX student likes things, whether its the dance she does or the books she reads. Satyajit Ray and Ruskin Bond are her preferred choices when it comes to books. Puja is a bit of a writer herself, although shes better known for her artistic talents. Landscapes and sceneries are what shes best at, which are often on display in school. But she does keep a diary, to help her through the tough times.Tough cookie...Puja may be, but even she needs help and inspiration. And her sources of strength are her schoolteachers and tutor, and of course, her parents. She says...I dont dance in public, because people see my body as incomplete, especially when it comes to Indian classical dance, which is such a physical art form. So its a hobby. But I love to sing. Although Im a bathroom singer, Im quite good at it. And I dont care what people think. But I am pretty good at art. Numbers is something I am not good at, but Im working on it.

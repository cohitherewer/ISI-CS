The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Booked busmen block rush-hour road
 															- Operators hit the STREETS to protest police high-handedness A STAFF REPORTER																								At a time when the citys fatal mishap count is climbing because of rash driving, vehicle-owners and operators booked for flouting road rules blocked the eastern flank of Bridge No. 4, in the Karaya police station area, on Monday morning, disrupting peak-hour traffic for more than 30 minutes.																								According to police, an officer on duty booked several buses because their drivers were flouting road rules and stopping in between scheduled stops. In protest, the owners and operators of buses on the route hit the road.																								The officer was registering cases against the violators at the junction, when one of them refused to pay the fine. The officer warned him to pay up and soon after the altercation, the other bus operators set up the roadblock and started shouting slogans against the police, said an officer of Karaya police station.																								The demonstrators refused to budge, ignoring requests by traffic constables. Vehicles came to a standstill, with the buses blocking the entire stretch. After about half an hour of protest, they agreed to disperse. That, too, after senior police officers intervened, the officer added. 																								Road safety is our prime objective and to curb rash driving, we have to bring the violators to book. They ply the vehicles recklessly in the competition for more passengers. Pedestrians and even passengers fall victim to their reckless driving all through the year, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma.																								However, the bus operators alleged that police officers harass them to make some quick money for themselves. 																								It is not true that drivers do not ever follow road rules or drive recklessly. Sometimes, they fall victim to the system that demands a police officer to fulfil a quota of revenue-collection every month. To reach his target, he has to often falsely implicate a bus operator and collect the fine, a member of a vehicle operators union pointed out, on condition of anonymity.																								According to Himadri Ganguly, general secretary of West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners and Operators Association, a few drivers are guilty of rash driving and as a result, there are fatal accidents. 																								It is, indeed, necessary for the police to take action against the guilty and I feel Calcuttas roads should be safer. On our part, we carry out workshops and seminars, at which we brief the drivers on road safety rules and tell them to avoid driving recklessly, he said.																								Last Saturday, the bus operators association had said that its members would even go on strike to protest police harassment. A spokesperson of the association complained: The police are extremely high-handed and refuse to listen to reason.

 SREYASHI DASTIDAR Amartya Sen at Nandan and (above) Ashok Mitra at Bangla Akademi. Pictures by Pradip Sanyal 																								Akbar was preaching tolerance in India when Giordano Bruno was being burnt at the stakes in Rome on charges of heresy. The Buddhist councils were one of the earliest instances of democracy, which struck roots here long before it was discovered by the West, said Amartya Sen at Nandan on Wednesday. The lecture, entitled Democracy and the future of India, was organised by the Institute of Development Studies Kolkata, in collaboration with the government of West Bengal. The future of democracy in India, as Sen saw it, had plenty of room for hope.																								Barely a hundred yards away, at the Bangla Akademi auditorium, another economist, Ashok Mitra, was speaking of democracy too. Only, his words were bitter and not laced with hope. The former Bengal finance minister warned against the Centres evil designs to stop the flow of power and finances to the states, even though the elevation of the regional parties to the same plane as the two big national parties in the last elections indicates that the people want greater devolution of power. 																								If there was a distinct difference in tone, one did not have to look far for similarities. The most significant being in what Sen and Mitra had to say, directly or by implication, about the states communist government. Perhaps Mitras leftist associations stopped him short of naming left parties and criticising them for lending support to a budget which went against all communist ideals. The Nobel winner was far more gentle and solicitous: he made a passing reference to the Pratichi Trusts criticism of Bengals education to make the point that reproach from the media and other watchdogs act in the interests of democracy. It was difficult to guess whether the chief minister agreed. He was sharing the stage with the Nobel laureate, but only as an admirer and listener.																								For the former Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, the election results were proof of the importance of the minorities in a democracy, proof also of the viability of a democratic model in a poor and low-literacy country like India. Sens favoured definition of democracy arising out of public reasoning leads him to see elections as just one part of a much larger story. For Mitra, on the other hand, the result was the mandate for a complete restructuring of Centre-state relations. But if the fate of the Sarkaria commission is anything to go by, it may be another 25 years before any progress is made.																								Thanks to the economist duo, the Nandan-Rabindra Sadan complex got a chance to live up to its reputation as the cultural hub of the city. Long after darkness fell, and the VIP cars had left one by one, the complex was still vibrating with heated arguments and discussions over tea and mosquito bites. Calcutta hasnt had such sumptuous food for thought in some time.

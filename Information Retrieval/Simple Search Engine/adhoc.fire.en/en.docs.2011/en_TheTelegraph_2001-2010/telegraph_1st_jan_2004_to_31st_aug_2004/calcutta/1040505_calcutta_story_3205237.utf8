The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 A war of ideas
What is truth? Does it exist at all in a world consumed with the material and the transient? Does one need to believe in this truth? What would happen if truth and anarchy were to collide? These are the questions raised by Virus - M, a socially relevant play directed by Bratya Basu. It explores the principles of truth and the universality of its existence. As opposed to this is the concept of anarchy that is in effect a negation of all order and of truth itself. Bahitra and Nilanjan are at loggerheads in a society that is in a limbo between the two conflicting ideas of truth and anarchy. Whereas Bahitra believes in the reformatory powers of truth, Nilanjan is an apostle of anarchism that demands a complete and uncompromising change of the very fabric of society. Virus - M is poised on the crossroads at which the two forces confront each other and fight to establish their individualistic views on life and society as the final word on existence.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Virus-M, produced by Ganakrishti																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

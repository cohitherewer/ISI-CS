The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Losses mount, legacy fades
				 	 Jagannath Bag, member-secretary and chief executive officer of the Great Eastern Hotel Authority, met readers of The Telegraph to reply to their queries. Participants included G. Laha, Diptimoy Ghosh, Md. Amiruzzaman, Sandip Banerjee, Ranajit Basu, S.S. Dey and G. Biswas				 																																																																																																																																																																		

G. Laha: Please tell us how Great Eastern Hotel came into existence. We hear it had another name.																																																			Great Eastern Hotel was previously called Auckland Hotel, or Wilsons Hotel. Going by our records, the hotel was established on November 19, 1840, by David Wilson, who owned a confectionery shop in the area around that time. He bought the property and turned it into a hotel. Later, in 1915, the hotel was renamed Great Eastern Hotel Wine and General Purveying Company. Till 1975, the ownership was in private hands. In 1980, the tourism department of the state government took up the hotel, and still is the sole owner of the property.																																																									

Diptimoy Ghosh: What led to the hotels deterioration?																																																			Mounting losses and the want of maintenance. We need a revamp and introduction of some modern facilities to vie with the other hotels of the city. The cost will run into several lakhs. It is not possible at present to modernise the hotel. Recently, we received some funds from the government, with which we are trying to give the suites a new look.																																																									

Ranajit Basu: What led the government to think about inviting private participation in the hotel? When did the process of privatisation start?																																																			Since 1975, when the hotel started running up losses. We felt that private participation could save the hotel. The building and the air-conditioning unit had to be repaired immediately. Initially, we thought of handing over the maintenance to a private firm or leasing the hotel to some private enterprise. Accordingly, a tender was floated. Though a French firm did come forward, the deal could not be finalised. Later, an attempt  again fruitless  to privatise the hotel was made in 2001. Last year saw three private institutions bid to take over the hotel but the government found none of them suitable. 																																																									

S.S. Dey: We hear labour trouble had put off the private firms.																																																			I wouldnt put it that way. There is an active union of employees (about 450 in number, both regular and on contract). It may have so happened that the regular employees had refused to accept the conditions set by the private firm on their service facilities. That might have led to a dispute. The stalemate is being viewed very seriously, as it is stalling the transfer of government property. We are equally mindful to ensure that the employees do not lose their legitimate dues in this handover.																																																									

Md. Amiruzzaman: Leading hotels organise food festivals to draw more visitors. Your hotel has a legacy of cookies. Why dont you capitalise on it?																																																			In fact, we were toying with the idea, but a paucity of funds is restraining us. Our cakes, pastries, cookies and baked products are still a rage. If all goes well, we may organise a confectionary festival this winter. 																																																									

G. Biswas : What is the occupancy status of the hotel? Can the middle class afford it?																																																			The average occupancy rate is 20 per cent annually. The rush increases during festivals or key events in the city. Due to its location, many tourists still prefer the Great Eastern. Recently, we received a booking request from Japan. Moreover, the city being a convenient stopover to the Far East, many tourists stay over when in transit. Guests of the state government, too, are accommodated here.																																																											The room rates are from a few hundreds to a maximum of Rs 6,000, which is highly affordable. Since this is an industry, we, too, are trying to infuse blood into the marketing wing of our hotel, which is a little weak at present. Many private firms are now coming forward to hold their annual meetings and conferences at concessional rates.

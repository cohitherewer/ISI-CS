The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Mellow sun ushers in fog amp; freeze
 OUR BUREAU																								By Calcutta winter standards, Friday froze over as the minimum temperature dipped to 11.9 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. At Dum Dum, the minimum temperature was pegged at 11 degrees on the coldest day of the season so far.																								The city and its adjoining areas awoke to a foggy Friday morning, as a steady north wind blew at about five kilometres per hour. K.K. Chakraborty, director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore, said the chill was expected to stay for the next 48 hours, with the minimum temperature around 12 degrees Celsius.																								The sky is clear and there is no low-pressure development over the Bay of Bengal. The north wind is blowing in unhindered from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The cold conditions are expected to continue for the next two days, said Chakraborty.																								Met officials explained that the morning was hazy and the sky appeared cloudy because of the fog. At this time of the season, the air mass around us becomes cold and loses the capacity to retain moisture, leading to formation of fog and mist. In areas where the congestion is less  say, along the southern stretches of the EM Bypass  the fog is heavier because the air mass is colder, they added.																								The chill really set in when the fog lifted and the sky cleared. The sunshine was mellow and did not allow much rise in the day temperature, either. The temperature at 2.30 pm on Friday was 21.1 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal, said the weather office. The minimum temperature over the past few days has been lower than the correspoding period last winter. On January 2, 2003, the minimum temperature in Calcutta had been 14.1 degrees Celsius.

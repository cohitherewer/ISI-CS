The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 13, 2004  Kantha goes couture Model Sharan Mishra sports a Shamlu Dudeja creation.															The kantha has come of age! From the intricately-designed pallus of saris meant for that extremely formal evening, its now invaded the nightclub.																					This summer, kantha is as trendy as can be. The sari has made way for a pair of flared trousers with funky geometric designs interspersed with sequin work, something just right for a haute, hot night out.																					The sexy wraparound with intricate kantha work all over is just right to stun the sun. Pair it with a short kurti and a chiffon scarf in the evening and youre the sure-fire show-stealer at the party.																					This summer, we are trying these fusion outfits for the first time, says kantha activist-turned-designer Shamlu Dudeja, who is all set to showcase these interesting outfits at this years Bridal Asia show to be held in Delhi.																					But well give Calcutta a sneak peek into the collection at the fashion show to be held on May 15 at RCGC, promises Shamlu.																					Laid out in a special type of cotton, with the look of tussar but the comfort of the cooler fabric, these outfits fit well into the trendy yet exclusive look.																					But its not just the hip-hugging trouser or the side slit warp-around on offer for the supposedly conservative Calcuttan. The chiffon and crepe saris with intensive kantha work are the newest additions to Shamlus summer creations.																					In summer, people cant wear silk or tussar and cotton can never be made to look glamorous enough for a formal evening do, she smiles, sitting in her Alipore Park Road boutique and taking us through the decidedly cosmopolitan collection.																					Both chiffon and georgette perk up the glam quotient on the one hand, while allowing the skin to breathe easy during these torrid months.																					To get the party look going, Shamlu has gone for the essentially jazzy combinations of yellow and ink blue or the eternal favourite of black and red. While the sari itself is in chiffon or georgette, the pallu and border in crepe have been attached to the sari holding the kantha work.

	It is sad that extra-curricular activities are not encouraged in higher-level educational institutions in the state. Outdoor sports are also given a miss in most colleges in the city due to space constraints. Till a few years ago, inter-college sports meets used to attract a large number of spectators. But nowadays, the college events have been reduced to just a few cultural functions and fashion shows. College authorities should organise more sport meets.

	The entire length of the footpath from Rani Rashmoni Avenue to the Esplanade bus terminus has turned into a mini market. I walk that stretch every day on my way to office and have experienced and observed the inconvenience it causes to pedestrians. Even a year ago, there were just five to six vendors on the pavement. The number has gone up to almost 30. The authorities are indifferent to the clutter. 
	Madhabi D. Ghosh, Salt Lake.

 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 The canvas of life
																								Art is an expression of life. It represents human experience in a way as to reflect the mind of its creator. The paintings of Avijit Mukherjee are particularly significant in this regard. An exhibition of his works of art, mainly done on oil and acrylic, bears out the philosophy of life of this self-taught artist. His canvas holds up a mirror to his attitudes and perceptions, his beliefs and ideologies, as well as his understanding of the unpredictable ways of the natural world. Among the paintings on show, Image on Green (that appears above), can best be described as a mindscape, where the artist reveals the serenity of his soul. The painting is one, among many, that depicts the artists happiness when in confluence with nature. Most of his paintings, built around the theme of nature and childhood, express his concern for preserving the natural harmony of this universe and his anguish at the loss of childhood innocence.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings by Avijit Mukherjee																								When: Till June 6; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

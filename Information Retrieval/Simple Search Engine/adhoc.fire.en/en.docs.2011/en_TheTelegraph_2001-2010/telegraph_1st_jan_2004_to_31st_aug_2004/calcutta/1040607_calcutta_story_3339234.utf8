 																											- Mayor drags feet over restoration five months after heritage cave-in A STAFF REPORTER																								Five months after the roof of Howrahs Town Hall caved in, the civic authorities are yet to take any initiative for restoring the 100-year-old building. 																								They have merely erected a temporary roof, made of bamboo and tarpaulin, to cover the 2,500 sq ft void that the cave-in has left. It will save the inner structure from the ravages of nature, claimed an officer of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC). However, the makeshift ceiling already has developed gaps, through which rainwater streams in.																								After the collapse of the Town Halls roof, the state government had set up a four-member expert committee under Bikash Chandra Chatterjee, head of the department of civil engineering, BE College, Shibpur, to find out what led to the collapse.																								The committee, which submitted its report in February, blamed unintentional negligence on the part of the civic authorities for the cave-in. 																								The civic body had no way to gauge the condition of the heritage building or determine the extent of damage to the inner layers of the ceiling, it observed. 																								But since then, the hall has been under lock and key, without any attempt at repairs. The oil paintings have been stored in a room inside the HMC building. 																								Subsequently, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said the building would be renovated as early as possible and efforts were on to gather the necessary funds to cover reconstruction costs  about Rs 1.3 crore.																								Nothing had been done since then and the mayor keeps repeating that work is held up owing to lack of funds, said an officer of the HMC. He added that the mayor had not taken any initiative to invite non-government organisations and other private parties to repair the hall.																								The state government has looked into the matter so that funds could flow in and we have received some donations over and above the Rs 25 lakh sanctioned by Howrah MP Swadesh Chakraborty from his local area development fund, the mayor said. We have prepared a scheme for the reconstruction of the vaulting roof and a proposal for raising of funds has been placed before the heritage committee. Without its approval, we cannot move in the matter, he added.																								Chairman of the heritage committees Howrah wing Nemai Sadhan Bose said: We will request the mayor to take steps and a meeting of the committee should be organised as early as possible to consider the matter. 																								He added that at least some steps to renovate the building should be taken at once, to check further decay of Howrahs heritage hall.

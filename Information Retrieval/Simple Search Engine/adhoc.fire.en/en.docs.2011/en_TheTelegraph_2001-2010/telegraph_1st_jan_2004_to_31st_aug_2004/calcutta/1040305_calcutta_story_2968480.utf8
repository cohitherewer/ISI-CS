 Friday, March 05, 2004  Guide to City LivingMrs sen offers solutions to your day-to-day problems				 																																												Q: I am a 27-year-old schoolteacher dating a colleague for the past six months now. I teach in the mid-school section while he teaches the senior classes. We are very much in love and although we havent spoken about marriage, I know that it isnt far off. The problem is that my boyfriend refuses to acknowledge me at school apart from polite nods. His take on it is that while in school, we should maintain a professional relationship and not bring in our personal lives. While I agree with him, I also feel that a professional relationship can involve more than a silent nod. How do I make him understand that it is okay to exchange a few words with me every now and then, on the job? Please advise. 				 																																												 M.S, Ultadanga 				 																																												A: Why is it so important to you that your boyfriend acknowledges you at work? Are you in any way insecure about the relationship that you need public confirmation of it? If your boyfriend wants to restrict your social intercourse at school to polite nods, presumably to avoid any gossip about the two of you, then what is wrong with that? Just go along with it. Once you are married, you can exchange as many words as you want, whether on the job or off it.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bankim Park, one of central Howrahs biggest patches of green, lies in a state of ruin. The one-bigha-and-five-cottah park cannot be maintained because caretaker Howrah Citizens Forum has no funds.																								The forum alleged that though the local MLA had sanctioned an amount from his area development fund, the district administration was delaying disbursement of the money. 																								The state governments planning and development department had sanctioned some funds on a recommendation made by Trinamul Congress MLA Ambica Banerjee on October 10 last year. Though the recommendation was made in fiscal 2001-2002, the amount was sanctioned in 2003, said Nisith Sarkar, convener of the forum. 																								The executing authority is the Howrah Municipal Corporation, which has been entrusted with carrying out the maintenance project by inviting tenders from contractors.																								A total of Rs 99,990 was sanctioned for the uplift of the park and, according to the state government order, the amount was to be properly utilised to preserve the park and to beautify it.																								Claiming that the order of execution had not been forwarded yet by district magistrate S. Kishore, Howrahs mayor Gopal Mukherjee said the civic bodys hands were tied. Till the order of execution reaches us. we can do nothing, he pointed out.																								The district magistrate, however, lay the onus on the civic body. Howrah Municipal Corporation should send me the estimate first. Only then can I release the funds, he said.																								Forum members alleged that equipment in the park, like slips and swings, could collapse any time for want of upkeep.																								We require funds to renovate the park for our children. That is why we have asked the authorities for help, said forum convener Sarkar. 																								According to other forum members, an annual Bankim Mela is organised in the park to commemorate Rishi Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay. 																								They alleged that at last years mela, PWD minister Amar Choudhury had said he would provide funds for the renovation of the park. The money has yet to arrive.

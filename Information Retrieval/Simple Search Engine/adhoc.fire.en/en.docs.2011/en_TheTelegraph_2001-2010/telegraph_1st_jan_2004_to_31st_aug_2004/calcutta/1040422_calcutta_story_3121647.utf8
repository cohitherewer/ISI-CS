The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Profit denied, civic venture nears end
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY				 	 The housing complex lying incomplete for months. Picture by Aranya Sen																								After being delayed by 11 years, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s first commercial venture, a housing complex on DL Khan Road, will be ready before the Pujas. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has sanctioned Rs 1.25 crore to the CMCs project and development department for its completion.																								The project is coming up on CMC land. The civic authorities do not stand to gain by it. I am allotting funds only as a face-saving gesture for the CMC, he said. Some buyers have already withdrawn their registration and taken back the money they had deposited as first premium because of the inordinate delay in completing construction work.																								So we have to place 15 flats in the open market for sale. The CMC will charge a minimum of Rs 1,500 per square feet for these flats, said a senior engineer working on the project. 																								We have already handed over four flats to buyers by registered deeds. Some more flats are ready for transfer, said director general (project amp; development) Nilangshu Bose.																								There are two blocks and 42 flats, each measuring not less than 1,000 square feet. Most of the flats were booked by non-resident Indians and several organisations like the Victoria Memorial Hall and the audit department of the central government.																								The CMC decided to let them out on lease term by taking first premium as initial basic rent and the second premium as monthly rent at a rate of Rs three per square foot. Construction started in 1994 after collecting over Rs 4 crore from the intended buyers as the first premium at a rate of Rs 1,000 per square foot. The civic authorities gave them the assurance by agreement that the flats would be ready by 1997.																								Though construction work started on time it had to be suspended frequently for paucity of funds. The CMC had spent the amount collected as first premium on other things. 																								The DL Khan Road housing project had been hanging fire as the CMC would gain nothing from it because of wrong cost calculations by the former CPM-led board, said Mukherjee.																								I am surprised to know that the value of the land was not taken into account in fixing the selling price of the flats, he said.																								DL Khan Road is on the western side of SSKM Hospital and is a posh residential area.

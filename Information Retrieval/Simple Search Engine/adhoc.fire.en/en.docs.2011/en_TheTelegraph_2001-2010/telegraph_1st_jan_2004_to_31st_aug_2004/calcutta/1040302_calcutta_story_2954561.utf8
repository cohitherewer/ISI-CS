 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Wada Chirebandi
Padatiks latest Hindi play,Wada Chirebandi, vividly captures the gradual decline of the Vada or joint family culture in Maharashtra that fails to stand the test of time and of the social changes in the world beyond. Wada, which means an old, ancestral country house, stands as the prime motif, revealing the ashes of a dying culture and struggling against the changes brought in by the new. Through the family crisis depicted in the play, we become mute witnesses to the slow but steady social decadence that has taken a firm grip on our lives. More than just a social drama, it brings into focus the clash between traditional and commercial or consumer cultures in modern Indian society. Written in Marathi by Mahesh Elkunchwar, Wada Chirebandi has been translated into Hindi by Vasant Dev, and designed and directed by Kunal Padhi.																								Event: Play Wada Chirebandi by Padatik																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

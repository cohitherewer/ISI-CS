The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Retail eyes priority sector tag
 																											- Market leaders urge govt to play a more pro-active role A STAFF REPORTER																								Pantaloons is looking at business in excess of Rs 100 crore out of Calcutta this fiscal. RPG Enterprises is setting up the countrys largest hypermarket in the city. Lifestyle is gearing up to join the fray, while others, like Globus, are on recce.																								From the big boxes to convenios, discounters to cash-n-carries, theres a beeline of different formats keen to set up shop in town. Organised retail, the second largest employer in the country after the farm sector, is poised for a take-off in Calcutta, but the market leaders feel theres a lot the government can do to smoothen the creases that line the growth path.																								For a sector that contributes 10 per cent to the GDP, retail is one of the least evolved and although Calcutta has emerged as a strong destination, its still not a revolution, just a pilgrimage for the players, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka observed on Wednesday. 																								He was addressing a special plenary on the opening day of the two-day retail summit in the city, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Eastern Region.																								Calling for changes in archaic legislation and seeking priority sector status for organised retail, Goenka, past president, CII, spelt out a wish-list to facilitate growth. Apart from implementation of a national VAT, his charter includes incentives for cold chain investments, abolition of octroi and entry tax, rationalising property tax and stamp duties, besides a review of rent and zoning laws.																								Strong endorsement for a majority of these prescription points came from Kishore Biyani, chief knowledge officer, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, one of the pioneers of large-format retailing in Calcutta. Worldwide, the index of retail is taken as an indicator of the nations mood. We are looking at a paradigm shift in shopping patterns and the upbeat tempo can be sustained only with certain changes in policy, like single-window clearance, allowing stores to stay open 24x7, 365 days and rationalising property taxes, stressed Biyani.																								State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, chief guest at the plenary, promised to look into the wish-list and asked CII to collate the vexatious issues plaguing growth. Retail in Bengal is undergoing a sea-change in both character and content. We need to be sensitive to these changes, while keeping our focus on equitable distribution of wealth and pursuing rural reforms, the minister said.																								CII Eastern Region chairman B. Muthuraman joined the chorus for a more pro-active government role. The government needs to play the facilitator by addressing roadblocks like the Urban Land Ceiling Act in metros to the Shops amp; Establishment Act, MRP to the Weights amp; Measures Act, he said.

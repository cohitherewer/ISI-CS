Feng Shui Pinky Kapoor								The working conditions in an office, its environment and the manner in which the chi flows are all instrumental in creating healthy or unhealthy vibrations. If you walk into an office and feel good, you can be sure that those working in such a place are happy and they will be courteous and helpful.																								On the other hand, there will be chaos in a disorganised office. Tempers and tensions will run high and the performance of the office staff is likely to suffer.																								We must ensure there is a healthy and smooth flow of chi into the office. If the doorway is well lit, the effect will be more pronounced. Where chi flows gently through an office, the people will be positive and will have an easy passage through life. The employees will be happy and supportive because their stress levels will be lower. Projects will be completed on time and the business will prosper. If it moves sluggishly or gets stuck, the business house will face problems and will not flourish.																								The first impression a visitor gets on entering an office should be one of success. Avoid placing waste bins or mops at the entrance. Cluttered entrances send out a negative message to the prospective clients. Healthy plants are a better alternative. 																								The positioning of office chambers and the internal designs influence performance. Fresh air and a healthy environment are necessary for improved performance. For employers, working conditions are an ideal investment, as the better they are, the richer the dividends are likely to be.																								Piles of old magazines and business journals should not be stored. They should be regularly sorted out. Do not keep thorny plants or cacti in the office environment, as they are negative.																								We must have a clear idea in our minds as to what actually constitutes office clutter and take steps to get rid of it. Otherwise it can lead to stress and undue tension. Books and vouchers that will no longer be required should be cleared to make space for current records.																								The information stored in our computer hard drive should be regularly reviewed and unnecessary matter deleted. Information stored on compact discs and floppies occupy much less space. Broken office equipment should either be repaired or discarded. Drained batteries in clocks and fused bulbs should immediately be replaced. Desks should only have current files as any unnecessary papers will lead to tension. If the stacked working papers are magnified by a mirror, it only adds to your workload. Is seeing green the secret to seeing more moolah? Feng Shui says that plants add positive energy to a workspace. Maybe that is what keeps the greenbacks flowing into N.R. Narayana Murthys Infosys and Azim Premjis Wipro (AFP) 																								The Feng Shui of your office will be at its best only if it is clean and clutter free. The moment you remove all the unnecessary bits and pieces, you will feel relaxed and clear. Cleaning clutter, space clearing and creating good vibrations in your environment are the most powerful Feng Shui remedies, which show immediate results.																								If we sit in a cramped place in office, we may feel restricted and will never be able to progress. Narrow desks causing you to sit too close to the computer screen can also disturb the movement of chi. Sources of positive energy can be found in plants, fresh air, and healthy fish in an aquarium. Bright lighting and pendulum clocks placed strategically will work wonders.																								Tip of the week: The most powerful person in the office should always sit in the southwest. If a person of lower rank sits here, his authority will increase and he may start dominating.

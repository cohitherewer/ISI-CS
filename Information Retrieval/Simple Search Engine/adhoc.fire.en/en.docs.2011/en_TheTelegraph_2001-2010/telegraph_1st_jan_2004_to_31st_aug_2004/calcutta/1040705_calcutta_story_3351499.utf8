The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Looks good, sounds great
																								Flat screen gives way to plasma. Stereo gives way to surround sound. Calcuttas tight wallets have proved that they have enough room in their hearts and credit cards to give the high-end home entertainment system retailers a reason to turn up the volume.																								Promises, one of the only showrooms in the city to stock audio and video equipment fit to put a sizeable dent in bank accounts, is all set to open another outlet on the ground floor of its Shakespeare Sarani premises. LG is bringing X Canvas to town, its retail brand for its high-value plasma and LCD screens, in collaboration with the city-based retailer.																								We have been very happy with our performance so far in Calcutta, explains Manoj Bhatia, proprietor, Promises, which has been in the business for a year now.																								Counting amongst its clients the cream of Calcutta as well as establishments like hotels and auditoriums, the outlet has found an eager response for international brands like Onkyo, Jamo, B amp;W and LG in the home theatre, audio and video equipment markets.																								Soon, a new 450 sq ft demo room, which will show off LG plasma and rear-projection TVs and a host of audio and projection brands, will open its doors to provide entertainment solutions for the house and office.																								From dimmers that control the lighting around the house to set the right tone at the right time, to centralised sound control  you can hear music in your bathroom, too  at the touch of a button, there are a number of new products ready to hit the high-end market. The price tag, of course, ranges from tens of thousands to many hundreds of thousands  and beyond. The sky is clearly the limit for audiophiles.																								The Calcutta clientele  mainly industrialists, businessmen, CEOs  has, according to Bhatia, taken to plasma screens (prices have come down from upwards of Rs 4.50 lakh to around Rs 3 lakh). Mid-range speakers with the THX accreditation (a stamp of quality from Lucas Films) are also winners. Word of mouth, eye and ear have been enough to spread the excitement about the big-budget buys so far.																								Jamo speakers with a five-year warranty and wide range have also won their way into the conservative market.																								Fifty per cent of Promises business comes from the domestic segment while the rest is an even split between corporate users and the hospitality and entertainment industries.																								Calcutta may not be buying nearly as much as a Delhi or Mumbai, but there is a growing interest and knowledge about this kind of equipment, adds Bhatia, who hopes to open a music restaurant soon, specialising in dishing out not food, but the sound from the 60s and 70s.																								The other organised high-end player is Sonodyne, with its sound room off Elgin Road. While happy with their conversion rates in the city, the buying volumes are no where near what they have achieved at their Bangalore outlet in a few months.																								With an entry-level stereo system coming for as little as Rs 15,000, Sonodynes target audience is broader. We are selling audio solutions as well as a lifestyle, says Anindya Mukherjee, vice-president, sales and marketing, Sonodyne, which is looking to tie up soon with a big Indian brand ambassador.																								While audio products across the board have been doing well, stereo sales head the list. Ours is a me-too product, though we are looking at upper-class professionals as our main market, adds Mukherjee.																								Domestic buyers make up 60 per cent of their clientele currently, a segment they hope will grow. The next big spurt in the industry, feels Mukherjee, will be fuelled by the entry of direct-to-home cable broadcast, with the high-quality beam making high-quality audio systems more relevant.

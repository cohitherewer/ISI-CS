Nandikars twin plays Dulia and Aandharmoni, based on stories by Leela Majumdar, explore the intricacies of human nature. Dulia examines the dynamics of human relationships. Built along the lines of a fable, it traces an old milkmaids journey between two villages during which she comes across many of her near and dear ones. With Sohini Sengupta Halder in the lead, it is accompanied by a live musical chorus to recreate the effect of medieval morality plays. Aandharmoni (a scene from this play appears above), performed by advanced trainees of Nandikar, deals with the frailties and weaknesses of the human character, which can be overcome only under conditions of severe stress. A fairy-tale-like plot adds a unique dimension to this cleverly constructed play. Directed by Swatilekha Sengupta, with Goutam Halder as the creative associate, the plays provide the perfect way to end every theatre-lovers day.																								Event: Plays in Bengali, Dulia and Aandharmoni, by Nandikar																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

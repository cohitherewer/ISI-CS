 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Torture tale in lost amp; found
 																											- Teenager abducted, abused to get even with policeman father  A STAFF REPORTER																								A girl disappeared and returned on her own  that is the sum, not the substance, of a missing case lodged earlier this month. For, these innocuous words mask  not mirror  the trauma undergone by a teenager.																								A 13-year-old girl (name withheld on request) was tormented and allegedly abused for four days by a gang of abductors, out to settle a score with her father, a traffic policeman.																								A dispute over property matters in Birati was allegedly at the centre of the kidnap, of which the only record is a missing case mentioned in the ledger of Kotwali police station, in Krishnagar: A girl disappeared and returned on her own.																								The girl is now with one of her relatives in Barasat and undergoing medical treatment. Initial tests confirmed that there were signs of ill-treatment. But local doctors will keep her under observation for a month.																								The teenager was abducted on February 8 while returning home from school. Some goons, with the help of a rickshaw-puller, waylaid her. When she did not reach home till late, her father, attached to a north Calcutta traffic guard, went to Kotwali police station and lodged a missing complaint. He even mentioned the property dispute.																								Police initiated a search and the trail led to a village in Kultali, South 24-Parganas. Police, along with the girls family members, reached the area on February 11. After extensive raids, we found her lying on the wet floor of a mud hut, said the father, when contacted in Barasat. She was almost unconscious and could not even speak properly.																								After his daughter was rescued, the traffic policeman decided to change the complaint. 																								I asked the police to record the incident as a case of kidnapping. But they insisted that I should let it stay as a missing case, he alleged.																								They did not allow me to question the persons whom I suspect to be behind the kidnapping, and nor have they interrogated anyone in connection with the abduction, he added.																								The day after his daughter was rescued, some youths owing allegiance to the CPM met the policeman and told him not to pursue the case. 																								We told the local police about it. But no action has been taken so far, said a relative.																								The family, meanwhile, is trying to help the girl recover from her ordeal. She keeps crying most of the time. She does not want to sleep. And even if she does fall asleep, it is always very disturbed, said the girls mother.																								A doctor is checking on her twice a day and has advised us to keep a close watch on her. I dont know when she will shut out this nightmare, she cried.																								According to the kidnap victims father, a dispute had arisen over a house in Birati. I wanted to buy the house. But another person, whose name I dont want to disclose, has been trying to stop me from doing so. My daughter was tortured because a powerful group wanted to teach me a lesson, said the traffic policeman.

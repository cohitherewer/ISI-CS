																									Neha jajodia																									In almost every subject and class has been this 17-year-olds trademark trend since Class II. A young age to begin, perhaps, but for this doctor-to-be, its important to get the timing right. Neha has just taken her Class X CBSE board exam and come out with flying colours  100 per cent in maths, 99 per cent in science, 90 per cent in Hindi																									Is what everyone is saying, after the Gemini notched up a winning 94 per cent overall, topping her school, Mahadevi Birla, and is right up there with the other famous few in Calcutta. So getting into the science stream in Class XI should be as easy as 91, 92, 93 for this girl from Deodar Street.																									Neha is, too, with several prizes for creative writing  mostly first, of course  under her belt, from inter-school workshops like the annual one for young writers by Scrites Scratch, to intra-school. She keeps an eye out and ear open, and enters whatever contest she hears about. Writing is her love in life, she explains. Making music is her other hobby  not as a singing sensation, but with string hanging round her neck.																									You might call her, for Neha is quite a hand at the Spanish guitar. She learnt only for three years, but is a part of the school band, Dollfinz, which has won more than a few laurels in the inter-school fest circuit, belting out chart-topping numbers. Most memorable was the win at Spartafest in 2001. Shes proud of her talent, but its just a hobby, she insists, although one that she intends to keep up with in future.Was she, as house captain in Class VII and again in Class X. Although being a member of the nature club didnt mean too much activity, being in the student council had a lot more action, and something she enjoyed. Role model she has none, but with a younger sister looking up to her, she does her best to keep shining. A glimpse into the crystal ball shows an MBBS  several of her cousins are part of the medical fraternity  and a future as a cardiologist. Thats where her heart is.

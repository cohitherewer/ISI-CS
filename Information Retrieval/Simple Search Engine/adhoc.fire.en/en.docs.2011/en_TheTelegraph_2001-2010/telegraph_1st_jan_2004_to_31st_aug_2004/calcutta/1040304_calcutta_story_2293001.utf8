 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								Next time you go to buy a new television set or a computer, do not forget to return the old one. Otherwise, you may face legal action.																								The state pollution control board (PCB) recently received a circular from the Central PCB to include electronics goods in the list of items considered potential pollutants. The list, sent to the PCB of every state, has asked the respective agencies to enforce the policy immediately.																								The state PCB, however, had a problem classifying the electronic gadgets to be included and sought further clarification on the items and the nature of pollutants contained in them. 																								There is an electronic gadget in every house now. We do not have any standard method for their disposal. Many of them contain lead, titanium, phosphorus, germanium and other types of pollutants. We are yet to find a standard way to test them and to declare them as pollutants, said D. Chakrabarty, senior scientist of the PCB. 																								Board officials are perplexed also because there is no standard survey to locate the number of such gadgets to be disposed of. As the item has been listed recently, we are trying to collect the data about it to chalk out a plan for execution of the Delhi directive, said Chakrabarty. 																								The printed circuit boards of electronic gadgets contain polluting heavy metals like lead and copper. Their oxides, when burnt, produce toxic gases.																								The PCB strategy for tackling the problem is similar to what it did with the secondary accumulators, commonly known as storage batteries, used in inverters and other power-storing devices. 																								We had a similar problem in tackling the secondary battery-recycling process. But we persuaded several big secondary battery manufacturers to start a buy-back process. Each battery sold by the company or its dealer would be returned to them before the customer is sold another unit. Since there is a price discount for returning the exhausted one and we check out the number of units sold and returned, things have started looking up slowly, said said S.K. Adhikary, PCB environment engineer.																								It is also mandatory to register workshops that have an environmentally-correct recycling process of these secondary batteries, which otherwise emit dangerous lead smoke during the process, Adhikary added. At present, about 37 such recycling units are in operation in the state. We have been able to tackle the problem, which we feel is similar to electronic goods disposal.																								Branded battery manufacturers say the grey market for used batteries and absence of stringent measures to stop recycling of used batteries in a faulty manner is contributing to pollution.

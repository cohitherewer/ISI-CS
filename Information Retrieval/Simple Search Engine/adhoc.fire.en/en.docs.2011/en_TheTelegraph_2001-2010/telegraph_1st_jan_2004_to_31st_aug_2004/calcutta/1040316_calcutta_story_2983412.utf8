The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Witness to a silent struggle
 Villagers of Kasba, near Santiniketan, with students of the first-year economics batch from St Xaviers College A bunch of first-year students of the department of economics, St Xaviers College, went on a study tour to Santiniketan in February-end. On the agenda were health, education and gender bias in the village of Kasba. A snippet on the trip.				 				 																															On reaching Santiniketan, we planned a visit to Jishuniketan, an NGO working with the Santhals, providing them with food, shelter and education. We were told that the Santhals were a generous people, with a culture soaked in dance and music. During our interactions, we found them to be a vibrant group of people. They love cricket, enjoy football and are born dancers.				 				 																															Father DeSouza, head of Jishuniketan who also teaches the boys, has been working with the Santhals for 25 years. He felt that education would save them from persecution  something which the community is increasingly becoming aware of.				 				 																															Our assignment began the next day, with a full-fledged survey of Kasba. We split up in 10 groups of about six each, which was further divided into pairs. We covered a total of around 120 households. One member from each group met the Kasba panchayat.				 				 																															Since many of us had never been to a village before, we were often dismayed by the poverty. But the people were very hospitable, offering us several rounds of tea and muri. Riding bicycles down the rural roads was sheer fun.				 				 																															We found that although the poorest of the families want their children to attend school, the dropout rate is quite high  40 per cent from classes I to IV and 20 per cent from classes V to VIII. 				 				 																															Children from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes marry young, with girls being married off even at age 12. Among the relatively well-off, girls settle down at age 18 and boys at 25-26. 				 				 																															Dowry is still rampant and a major reason for not wanting girl children. The abortion rate, too, is very high.				 				 																															The panchayat is trying to improve the system with a string of schemes  the Indra Abash Yojna, Anna Purna Yojna, Maternity Benefit Scheme and National Benefit Scheme  to provide aid to below poverty-line families. The panchayat has also been instrumental in bringing in self-employment groups. With a contributory provident fund scheme, a villager can open an account with Rs 10 lakh, while the government will give the same amount. Cheap credit is also available.				 				 																															Much has changed in the agricultural scenario of the village. Better irrigation facilities mean employment for farmers eight months a year. But rice imports from Taiwan have dealt them a deadly blow. About 25 per cent of the land has lost its fertility. 				 				 																															As there is an acute shortage of supply of bio-fertilisers, people use eco-friendly techniques like wormiculture. Canal irrigation is occasional, and the water-table is depleting. Rainwater harvesting is known, but not implemented.				 				 																															Healthcare, too, is a problem area, with acute shortage of resources. Sian Hospital is miles away from Kasba. Vaccinations are available at the sub-centres, but HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns have suffered a setback due to lack of funds. 				 				 																															Some of us went on the trip with notions of preparing a fascinating project, others to enjoy a short vacation. But we were witnesses to the silent struggles of these villagers.

Heres the final set of answers to the question Should higher education be subsidised? 				 				 																															lKeeping in mind the dismal condition of education in the state, greater subsidies would only result in increased inefficiency, delays and mistakes. Saadia Sitwat,
IInd year, B.ScWhen grants are rendered to students, it is initially taken seriously. But later, it causes sloth and complacency. When destitute people are provided with aid, they usually try to use it to the fullest. But there is a tendency to take things for granted. There should be a thorough screening of candidates before doling out subsidies. 				 				 																															 Gabriel GomesTo an extent, yes. Students who are meritorious but not rich dont get sufficient opportunities. Those with bags full of notes bag seats in prestigious colleges. Merit is seldom taken into account. Average students are hogging the limelight, while the deserving ones are slipping into oblivion. The government policy of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes is discriminatory. Therefore, higher education should be subsidised. 				 				 																															 Tanmoy Das Lala, 				 				 																															St Xaviers Collegiate SchoolCertainly not. Higher education is not the stranglehold of the rich any more. With the help of education loans, even middle-class students can afford to study in the so-called expensive institutes. Subsidising higher education would mean unnecessarily burdening the public exchequer, which means an extra load on the tax-payer. Subsidies can instead be diverted to other sectors, like primary education. A cash-starved nation like India cant afford to squander public money. Roshni Sengupta,

	 Mind games				 				 																															It was a battle of wits at the St Xaviers College Literature Quiz on March 11, held in association with Red FM and IMS. Around 20 teams from various institutes, including five from the host college, fought it out at the St Xaviers auditorium. The moderator was Charanpreet Singh. The Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM), Presidency College, Jadavpur University (JU) and three teams from St Xaviers, having sailed through in the preliminary round, faced a set of nine difficult rounds, including visuals. A picture of Christopher Marlowe bearing a striking resemblance to William Shakespeare had left the contestants thoroughly confused. But IEM emerged the literary scholars with 78 points for the second time in a row. JU claimed the second position, falling short by just one point, followed by St Xaviers Team 1 with 45 points.

	 Gift of the gab				 				 																															Next up at the St Xaviers auditorium was a war of words for the XV Fr Joris Memorial Trophy Nihil Ultra Debate, hosted by the St Xaviers Alumni Association Calcutta in association with Patton, on March 13. Arguing for the motion  disinvestment is not a boon to the nation  was the Xaverian team comprising chartered accountant A.P. Singh, St Xaviers vice-principal Fr Felix Raj, Selvel director Noomi Mehta and Uttam Sengupta of The Telegraph.				 				 																															The opponent team consisted of additional solicitor-general of India S.K. Kapoor, ex-chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (eastern region) Dipankar Chatterjee, management consultant Vinod Kothari and journalist Pradip Gooptu.				 				 																															The Xaverians won the day, as two high court judges Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Aniruddha Bose upheld the argument that while disinvestment was necessary, the process of implementation was wrong.

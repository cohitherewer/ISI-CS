And the young ambassadors from Europe just lapped it up.																								The 11 students from France, Austria, Germany and Belgium who landed in the city on Wednesday morning as part of the Association of 41 Clubs of Indias Young Ambassadors Programme (YAP), have put Calcutta back on the reach out-renew-revive loop.																								Its wonderful to be in the city of Ray at last, gushed 20-year-old Maxi Kowalke, who studies arts with special interest in film studies and theatre in the University of Dresden, Germany.

The pursuit of YAP is to strengthen understanding and bondage with other countries, which goes with the 41 motto  may the hinges of friendship never rust in the world, explained association vice-president Micky Oberoi. And the young visitors are keen to keep the flowers blooming. I would love to visit some of the temples here and just walk the streets of this great city to soak in more of its infectious warmth, said Daphne Heuvelmans from Antwerp, Belgium, the oldest member of the batch at 25.

																																																		Tension ran high in Nabapally, Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city, on Friday after a 26-year-old housewife Sulekha Chowdhury was found hanging from the ceiling in her bedroom. Local residents alleged that Sulekha was murdered and then hung to give the impression that she had committed suicide. Sulekhas husband Asim has been arrested and her in-laws detained for their alleged involvement. Sulekha was married to Asim a year ago. She was an orphan and brought up by her maternal uncle in Burdwan. Soon after the marriage, Asim and his parents started to torture her demanding more dowry. Sulekha was Asims second wife. He married her after divorcing his first wife. There were complaints that Asim used to torture even his first wife who divorced him, said Kanad Mukherjee, sub-divisional police officer of Barasat. Police said trouble started since Sulekha failed to conceive even after one year of marriage. The first wife too had complained that her in-laws used to blame her for her inability to give birth to a child. But they never made Asim undertake a medical test for potency, said a neighbour. We are awaiting the post-mortem report though preliminary investigations revealed that she was hanged by others, added the SDPO.																																																		Trinamul Congress MLA Arunava Ghosh on Friday filed a case before Calcutta High Court against WBSEB alleging that due to the negligence on the part of the power supply agency he had been deprived of the fund allotted for area development in his constituency. Ghosh alleged that he had given Rs 1.42 lakh to WBSEB for new connections in an area of 77 residents. The payment was made on the basis of the quotation from the WBSEB contractors. After three months, the SEB demanded Rs 2.8 lakh for the job. As a result, Ghosh could not submit the expenditure for the first half of the year and did not get the remaining amount of the area development fund. The judge directed him to file an affidavit for hearing on April 8.

No arrest had been made in this connection.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								How long does it take for the government to figure out whether it needs a fire station or not? Forty years and counting.																								The Roy brothers of Nagerbazar have reason to see red. A smokescreen hangs heavy over their large plot on the Dum Dum-Cossipore Road, with the government toying with the idea of putting up a fire station at the address for four decades now.																								Tarun Roy and Dilip Roy on Tuesday urged Calcutta High Court to get the government to clarify its stand on the five-bigha plot it has acquired three times in the past 40 years to set up a fire station that has never materialised.																								It appears that we are stuck with a dead asset because of the harassment we are facing from the government since 1965, said brothers Tarun and Dilip in their joint petition.																								They (the government) are using their power to keep the land with them, though they cannot do so legally. We cannot do anything productive with the land, thanks to their unknown plans, they added.																								According to the petition, the government first acquired the plot, a two-storeyed house and an annexe on it in September 1965 to build a large fire station, complete with bays for a number of modern fire engines and quarters for fire-fighters and training staff.																								The government soon changed its mind, restored a portion of the house and the annexe to the owners, but made it clear that the land and the rest of the house would stay under its control. 																								In 1983, the petitioners moved a division bench of Calcutta High Court, challenging the acquisition. It is apparent that you have taken no step to build the promised fire station. You must release the land without delay, the division bench directed the government.																								Chastised by the court, the government complied with the directive and released the land, only to re-acquire it in January 1985  to build a modern fire station.																								The court stepped in to stop the government from giving effect to the notice of acquisition. It was a brief respite for the Roys, who soon found another acquisition notice slapped on their door, for the same purpose.																								The turf tussle went on. The brothers won a favourable verdict this year and started developing the plot with the help of a realtor, only to realise that the government had not actually released the land. 																								They must now tell us what they want, the brothers submitted to the court.

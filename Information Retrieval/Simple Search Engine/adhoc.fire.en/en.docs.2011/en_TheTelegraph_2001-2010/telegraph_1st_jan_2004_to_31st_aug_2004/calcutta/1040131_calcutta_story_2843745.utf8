 																											- Seniors verdict axing health plea to halt transfer stayed in court OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A Calcutta High Court judge on Thursday stayed an earlier decision signed by three of the most senior judges in the court.																								Justice Pratap Ray, asked to adjudicate in a case involving the transfer of a family court judge, also gave three reasons for staying till February 27 the order issued by his seniors.																								According to Justice Ray, the three judges must furnish reasons for their refusal to entertain the family court judges prayer for a stay on her transfer. 																								Justice Ray also found fault with one of the committees orders that had been signed by one of the three judges.																								The case, that could set something of a precedent, began with city family court additional principal judge Chitra Biswas suffering a mishap while playing at home with her granddaughter. She lost her right eye and the left one was nearly rendered blind.																								But soon after the mishap late last year, Biswas was served with a transfer order. She was asked to move to West Midnapore and assume office on January 8 as additional district sessions court judge.																								Biswas pleaded against the transfer on health-grounds. She wrote to Chief Justice A.K. Mathur, informing him how the accident had occurred and why she could not possibly take up a posting in West Midnapore. Besides, she had to get her eyes checked every fortnight in Calcutta.																								The chief justice, in turn, referred the matter to the courts administrative committee, comprising the three seniormost judges after him (Justice Ajay Nath Ray, Justice Ashok Ganguly and Justice Jayatosh Banerjee). But the trio overruled Biswas plea and asked her to proceed to West Midnapore, as ordered. Her plea for some lighter work in the city was also denied.																								Biswas then moved a writ petition on January 28 through counsel Shaktinath Mukherjee, challenging the decision of the administrative committee in the high court. 																								Somnath De appeared on behalf of the state judicial department, that was made a party to the case, as it had issued the transfer order. Alok Ghosh argued on behalf of the high court administrative committee.																								Since Biswas was due to retire in August 2005, she expected the government to allow her to discharge her duties from Calcutta till then, given her physical condition, Mukherjee argued. Her prayer should have been sympathetically considered, he said.																								Ghosh pointed out that an administration was expected to decide on an issue solely on its intrinsic merit and not on sympathetic grounds. The judicial department did not seek to roll back the transfer order.																								But Justice Ray has added what could turn out to be a significant twist in the tale. The next hearing is on February 24.

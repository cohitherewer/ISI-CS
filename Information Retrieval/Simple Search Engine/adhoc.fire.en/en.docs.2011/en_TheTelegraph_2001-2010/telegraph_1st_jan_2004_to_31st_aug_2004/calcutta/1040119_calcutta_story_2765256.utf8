 															- GREEN BOARD survey lays stress on toxic trouble A STAFF REPORTER																								Be warned, a walk on the grounds of the Victoria Memorial Hall will not fill your lungs with fresh air alone.																								A survey of the grounds by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) has revealed that toxic gases, like carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are present in the atmosphere far beyond their permissible limits.																								The PCB has installed a sophisticated, automatic air-monitoring system on the Victoria Memorial grounds to check the air quality on the spot. The gadget has also recorded the amount of poisonous gas that people inhaled on Christmas and New Years eve. On Christmas eve, at around 1 am, NO was pegged at 716 microgram (mg) per cubic metre (the normal is around 15) and NO2 was recorded at 335 mg per cubic metre (normal is 30).																								The content of NO varied between 716 and 435 and NO2 between 335 and 205 till dawn. The lowest content of N02 was recorded at 43.4 at 2 pm, which is still higher than normal. The NO and NO2 count was very high after dusk and at midnight, it stood at 523 and 296, respectively.																								On New Years eve, NO content varied from 125 to 204 and NO2 from 133 to 165 between 8 pm and 1 am. The CO count was 7.32 mg per cubic metre. CO has been detected at least four to five times higher than normal in the morning (6 am to 9 am), and after dusk (6 pm to 9 pm) in the Maidan area.																								On December 7, near Victoria Memorial, the content of CO was recorded at 6 mg per cubic metre in the morning (the normal is around 2 mg per cubic metre). On December 9 morning, the CO content was almost the same and, in the evening, it jumped to 11.1 mg, nearly six times the permissible limit.																								PCB scientists blamed auto emission for the high level of CO in the air. The high content of NO, NO2 and SO2 is also because of auto-emission. And in winter people burn leaves and tyres for warmth, raising the level of toxic gases in the atmosphere, they explained.																								Inhaling nitrogen oxides causes soreness in the throat and cough, while SO2 may lead to asthma, lung infections and also cardiac problems. Alarmed at the findings, PCB officials said they had decided to monitor the air quality at some key intersections. If auto emission is not checked, the pollution count will never improve, warned chairman Hirak Ghosh.

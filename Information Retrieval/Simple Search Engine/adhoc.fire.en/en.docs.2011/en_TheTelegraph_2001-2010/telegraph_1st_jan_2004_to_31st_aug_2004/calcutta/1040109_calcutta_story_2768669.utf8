 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Contemporary club celebrates family spirit
 SUBHRO SAHA																								Make a splash in the temperature-controlled swimming pool, sunbathe on the artificial beach along the one-acre waterbody, indulge in virtual golfing or Formula One racing, unwind at the oxygen bar, or tickle your taste buds at the multi-cuisine restaurant. All this while the kids can be carefully groomed through tutorials in music, performing arts, sports and public speaking courses.																								The Spring, the contemporary family club coming up beside the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, promises to perceptibly change the quality of life by celebrating family spirit and rejuvenating the body and mind, providing recreational as well as educational benefits for all age groups.																								There is an overdose of entertainment in most of the city clubs at the moment, and our effort is towards adding an element of self-improvement through vocational training programmes. So, there will be lessons in music, arts, theatre and of course, sports, observes director Sanjay M. Bavishi.																								The club management is likely to form an advisory board and is in dialogue with various institutions for teachers and inputs. We will organise professional coaching sessions in cricket, basketball, tennis and karate, besides the lessons in performing arts and public speaking, says developer and director Piyush Bhagat, who had co-promoted Space Circle, on VIP Road.																								Inside the high-profile Silver Spring housing project, the Rs 12-crore, 70,000-sq-ft club will take in around 1,000 members, both residents and walk-ins. While apartment owners in Silver Spring have to pay Rs 75,000 as refundable deposit to get in, the entry barrier for outsiders has been pegged at Rs 2.5 lakh, with meticulous screening to ensure compatibility.																								Bhagat feels the location of The Spring is its greatest USP. The Bypass is fast becoming the most happening spine of the city and The Spring will add a new dimension to the whirlwind of activity all around, he promises. With its futuristic elevation, the club will be ready to give the Bypass lifestyle a boost next January.																								I have used predominantly bright blue solar reflective glass on the exterior to provide that sense of surprise and drama to passers-by and motorists. Inside, all activities will overlook a central landscaped courtyard, says architect J.P. Agarwal, who has designed The Spring, with ideation inputs from ad guru Alyque Padamsee.																								Apart from the 9,200-sq-ft air-conditioned indoor playing arena and the temperature-controlled swimming pool, the latest entrant on the citys vibrant clubbing canvas will have two floodlit synthetic tennis courts on the roof  one normal sized and one smaller, for short tennis.																								A roller skating rink, a childrens arena, a discotheque, an amphitheatre for cultural/community programmes, coffee shop, reference library and health club will complete the club.

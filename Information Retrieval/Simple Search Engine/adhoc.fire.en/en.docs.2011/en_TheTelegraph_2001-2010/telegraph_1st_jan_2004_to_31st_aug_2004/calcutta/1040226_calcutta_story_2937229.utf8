 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Lifetime tax dealt court jab 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Advocate-general Balai Ray was pushed on to the backfoot on Wednesday by Justice B. Bhattacharya, who asked some uncomfortable questions during the hearing of the case filed by some owners of two-wheeler, challenging the new lifetime tax.																								Justice Bhattacharya asked the advocate-general whether the state government had the legal sanction to collect lifetime tax from the vehicle-owners, who had already paid a one-time tax when buying their two-wheelers.																								The judge also wanted to know why the government had decided to impose a fresh tax and whether it was to do so without prior approval from the President of the country.																								The advocate-general told the court that his government had the authority to impose new taxes on vehicle-owners. 																								Ray also said the expenses for the development and maintenance of roads had spiralled and the government had undertaken several programmes in this regard. So, it has become necessary on the part of the government to collect more money from vehicle-owners, he argued.																								The submission of the advocate-general will continue on Thursday, when he will clarify whether presidential approval is required for the state government to impose a fresh tax on vehicle-owners.																								After the filing of petitions and counter-applications relating to the imposition of the lifetime tax on two-wheelers, a division bench of Calcutta High Court, presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur, had assigned Justice Bhattacharya to dispose of the matter. Wednesday was the first day of the hearing, attended by a large number of two-wheeler owners.

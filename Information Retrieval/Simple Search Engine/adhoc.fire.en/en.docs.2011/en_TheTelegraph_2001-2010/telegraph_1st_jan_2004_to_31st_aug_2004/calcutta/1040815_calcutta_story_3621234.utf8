AdLibThe brand Olympic has converted a sports competition into a sacred contest of skill and characterShiloo Chattopadhyay(Top) Flags of participating nations in the Athletes Village in Athens and (above) Swiss swimmers at the Olympic Pool: united coloursLet us face it, in popular perception marketing has an association of falsehood. Marketing a brand implies to many an attempt in making people believe what is not wholly true about the brand. Yet there are brands that work overtime to deserve the trust bestowed on them. Perhaps the best example of this genre is the Olympic Games.Modern-day Olympics started with the aim to be the ultimate contest to choose the best sportspersons in the world. Naturally, sanctity of the contest on the field was a must. Perhaps more crucially, the credibility of the Games had to be maintained off the field too. Remember, the Games happen once every four years. So they needed to adopt symbols and rituals that connote sanctity and that transcend nationality, religion, language and all such parochial variables. It indeed is a challenging brief, even for the best creative minds of today.We, however, are talking about 1896. What a bag of communication items they came up with. A transnational relay with the Olympic torch, the Olympic flag with five rings symbolising the five continents, a flame that burns right through the Games and reminds every contestant of the oath to compete fairly. What at best was a sports competition was converted through these icons into a sacred contest of skill and character. Truly, the brand Olympic was very well conceived.Todays Olympics have different demands. The cost of organising the Games had been spiralling. The brand so carefully built over the years needed to perform financially now. It has to earn revenues. Gate receipts were drops in the ocean. Telecast rights were paying but still not adequate. Sponsorship was the name of the game. Eyebrows were raised. Should Olympics, the religion among sport, be allowed to be sponsored?The debate perhaps became most poignant this year. And the case for the defence has been well drafted: Sponsoring is a tradition that goes back to Ancient Greece, where wealthy Athenians would contribute financially to expenses related to culture, defence, the state and sports, in order to make them more accessible to all citizens. In return, the state honoured them by engraving their names on marble tablets. This tribute was a mark of respect and high appreciation by the city.To remain faithful to this heritage, the Athens 2004 Sponsoring Department has delivered set targets to fulfil Athens 2004 needs and to protect the Olympic ideals by controlling the commercial aspects In addition, it will offer high-quality marketing services, guarantee the greatest possible return for sponsors and develop strong bonds with the business community  Official Website of Athens Olympics 2004.

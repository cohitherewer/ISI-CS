 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Peace crusade, in words and deed
 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Lapierre with the rickshawpullers bell he carries with him. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Could Osama bin Laden have gone a step further than the 9/11 attack? Could he have, for instance, planted an atomic bomb in the heart of New York?																								Yes, says Dominique Lapierre in his new book Is New York Burning? Having launched the English edition of his latest release in New Delhi on Monday, the best-selling author was in town to promote his latest literary offering and inaugurate a home for challenged children near Uluberia.																								The book has been on the bestseller lists in France, Italy and Spain for the past few weeks. This is the first English translation to come out, says Lapierre. The novel is also a revival of the collaboration with co-author Larry Collins, who Lapierre joined hands with for works such as Is Paris Burning? and Freedom at Midnight four decades ago. Here, two years of extensive research across the globe helped the duo create a plausible though fictitious scenario of what could happen if terrorists planted a bomb and held the nation hostage.																								The characters are all taken from life and words attributed to them have been uttered in different situations. Our research led to extraordinary revelations about the security risks we live with, stresses Lapierre, hoping leaders will realise the importance of solving Israeli-Palestinian problems with more will.																								To the victims of terrorism of all forms, and to the men and women of good faith who strive for truth, justice and peace. This  the dedication of the novel  says as much about the author as the book. Causes have been the core of the Frenchmans personal and professional crusade. He may be famous for the novel The City of Joy, made into a movie starring Patrick Swayze, but he is less renowned for his substantial humanitarian contribution to the state. I have invested over $1.2 million in Bengal, says the 74-year-old.																								The City of Joy Foundation already runs four hospital boats in the Sunderbans and contributes to Udayan, a home for children whose families have been hit by leprosy. On Friday, he is scheduled to inaugurate a home for 350 mentally and physically handicapped boys and girls. A team of French doctors is training the Indian staff on the latest techniques in physiotherapy. The centre will have a unit for artificial limbs and other aids.																								Lapierre spent much of Wednesday locking horns with the health authorities. We only get around 30 per cent of the free tuberculosis medicine we are supposed to for our medical work The rest disappears somewhere along the way and we have to buy it ourselves. 																								Lapierre is scheduled to be back in the country for the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal gas tragedy, another cause he has campaigned extensively for. We have a gynaecological clinic there now and we will inaugurate a larger one soon, he says. Here, too, he has used his pen to put his conviction in words in It Was Five Past Midnight In Bhopal. The book ensured the tragedy was not forgotten, says the man with a mission.

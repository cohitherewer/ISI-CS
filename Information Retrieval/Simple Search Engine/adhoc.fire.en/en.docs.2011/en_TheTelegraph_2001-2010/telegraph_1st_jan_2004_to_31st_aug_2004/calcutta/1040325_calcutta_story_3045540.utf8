 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Protest over pavement trim for wider roads
 A STAFF REPORTERResidents of New Park Street and its adjoining areas are up in arms over their roads being widened by trimming the pavements.																								They have demanded a footpath that is a minimum of 10 feet wide, throwing a spanner in the recent drive to widen roads. 																								The project is being carried out by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC).																								Both agencies have so far widened more than 20 roads in the city, at a cost of over Rs 10 crore.																								In their mass petition to HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee and mayoral council member (roads) Anup Chatterjee, the residents of New Park Street have threatened to take legal recourse unless their four-point charter of demands is not met within five days.																								HRBC vice-chairman Banerjee said: I saw the petition on Tuesday. But what can be done? It has already been decided at a joint meeting with the civic authorities, the CMDA and other agencies that the minimum width of the pavement will be five feet (1.5 metres).																								New Park Street is an important east-west corridor connecting the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and AJC Bose Road. Trimming its pavements will make it possible to add two more lanes for vehicular traffic, pointed out Banerjee.																								Widening of roads by trimming the pavement is essential in a city like Calcutta, where the roadspace is severely limited, reasoned mayor Subrata Mukherjee. Is there a single thoroughfare in the city where more than five feet of the pavement is freely available for pedestrians use? he asked.																								The wider the pavements, the greater the number of hawkers and encroachers, the mayor pointed out.																								Altogether 40 residents of New Park Street and also a restaurant have lent their signatures to the petition.																								The main reason for their objection is that a large number of trees have been uprooted while widening the road. Besides, the pavements are being trimmed to beyond the usable limit, hampering the movement of pedestrians and elderly people.																								 The residents pointed out that there was a police station, two Montessori schools, shops and eateries on the stretch of road, and the footpaths were used by thousands of men, women and children daily for their safe passage.																								Now, they claimed, the footpaths had been trimmed to such an extent that two men could not walk abreast on them. 																								They have also demanded zebra-crossings on the carriageway for pedestrian safety.

		 Binod Kumar Shroff Binod Kumar Shroff A self-made man who prefers to  keep a low profile, Binod Kumar Shroff has quietly touched  lives over the decades.																								Known mainly for Shroffs Carpets and his two and four-wheeler business, not many are aware of Shroffs involvement with a gamut of other organisations.																								Born in Calcutta on May 3, 1945, Shroff studied at Hindi (now Birla) High School, after which he went to St Xaviers College, where he completed a bachelors degree in commerce. He joined the family business that had been started in 1944 by his grandfather and father. The company is now a regular supplier to top corporates and hospitality players in the domestic market, besides extensive exports.																								The operations are based in Calcutta, on Little Russell Street, with the factory near Varanasi. Shroff is also a distributor of electrical goods and automobile products, with a workshop for two-wheelers and a car-cum-two-wheeler showroom on Chowringhee, Arvind Projects.																								Shroffs professional commitments led him to numerous other posts. In 1999, he was named president of the Motor Industries Association, a position he held till 2002. In 1993-95, Shroff served as chairman of the Oriental Chamber of Commerce, an area in which he has had many years of experience, having previously been president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, and later a functionary of the National Alliance of Young Entrepreneurs.																								I joined all these organisations through business. Then I found that I felt comfortable with it, and it was easy to work, says Shroff.																								He held positions in several government and semi-governmental committees like the Import Export Advisory Committee and the Sales Tax Advisory Committee. Till five years ago, he was also a member of the Indian Arts and Crafts Exporters Association promoting small-scale industries.																								Shroff serves as managing trustee of the Mandawa Shiksha Sansthan Trust, which runs a free school in Mandawa, Rajasthan. This is also an association he traces back to his grandfather, who started the Marwari Youth Society. Around 600 children study in the school, and a college, catering to 250 so far has been operational for a while. Now a new building will be ready by March, which will accommodate up to 500, making it the largest educational institution in the area.																								The former Rotarian was also vice-president of the Hindustan Club between 1995-98. The Sarat Bose Road club is where Shroff likes to spend his time, and he was happy to be part of the committee that initiated its revamp. The nine-storey complex should be functional in four to five months, smiles Shroff.

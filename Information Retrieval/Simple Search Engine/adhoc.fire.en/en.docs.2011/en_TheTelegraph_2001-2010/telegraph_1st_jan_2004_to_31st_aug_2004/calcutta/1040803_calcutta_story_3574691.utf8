 A STAFF REPORTERTHE DARE BRIGADE: (Top): Lawrence amp; Mayo, that stuck faithfully to its no-shutters-down-on-a-bandh tradition of 127 years. Picture by Amit Datta. (Above): Techies at Wipro, in Saltlec, take a break after logging in on Monday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyay Lawrence amp; Mayo has stuck strictly to one tradition through its 127-year history: turning a blind eye to bandhs.																								On Monday, too, it refused to down shutters for the Trinamul Congress shutdown, with the three Lawrence amp; Mayo branches in the city open for business as usual.																								For most, bandhs are all about food, drink and making merry, says Michael Mendonca, director, Lawrence amp; Mayo. Its our privilege to say that we have not closed our retail shops on any bandh, he smiles.																								It is all about attitude. Do not buckle under pressure and get your work done, suggests Mendonca. They have never run into trouble either, except on one occasion, when bandh backers threatened employees at the Kankurgachhi outlet. 																								Even then, the closure lasted for about an hour. I managed to bring the situation under control, he recalls.																								The policy is not dependent on any kind of political backing, Mendonca stresses, adding that none of his staff members are forced to attend office. They come in of their own will, and I have been surprised by 100 per cent attendance on most occasions. Mondays attendance stood at 80 per cent.																								But why take the risk? Moral responsibility fuels the commitment to customers, ensuring loyalty and trust, the management feels.																								Mendoncas team also reflects the same culture. What will we do sitting at home? We can make the most of the day. With over 100 customers coming in usually, the rush can be too much to handle. On a bandh, we catch up on pending work and use the time to network with clients, says Lloyd DSouza.																								If we cannot make it to work due to lack of conveyance, it is not a problem. The decision rests entirely on each of us, explains Fazrul Rehman, another employee. We are here to prove the point that the image of the city and its work culture need to change.

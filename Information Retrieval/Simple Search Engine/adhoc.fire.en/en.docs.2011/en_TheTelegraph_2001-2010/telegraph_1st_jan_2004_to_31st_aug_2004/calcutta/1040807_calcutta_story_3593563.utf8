 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Snags hit power supply
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The city and its adjoining areas suffered power cuts for three to four hours on Friday evening, following the collapse of two generating units in Budge Budge and Farakka. 																								The shortfall in the CESC-served areas shot up to 250 mw. In the districts, the deficit was 300 mw. Power cuts are likely to continue through Saturday. 																								A CESC spokesman said a 250-mw unit at Budge Budge broke down early on Friday after the boiler tube sprung a leak. The unit is likely to be operational by Sunday morning, he added.																								Power department officials said a 500-mw unit of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at Farakka collapsed after developing some snags. 																								The situation was compounded as two 210-mw units, at Bakreswar and Kolaghat, have been shut down for overhauling to ensure uninterrupted supply during the Pujas.																								On account of poor supply from the NTPC, the state electricity board restricted its supply to the CESC grid on Friday evening. The power utility was informed that the state board would not be able to supply more than 250 mw.																								Soon after sundown on Friday, vast areas of the city were plunged into darkness as the CESC resorted to power cuts by rotation. 																								Those living in multi-storeyed buildings faced a water crisis as well, since pumps could not be operated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Apathy prime fire hazard
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The fire department has failed to upgrade itself to provide maximum safety to citizens, and the state government hasnt leveraged the river and a full-fledged fire ministry, according to S.K. Dheri, ex-chief, Delhi Fire Services.																								The ace fireman was speaking at a seminar, Suraksha 2004  trends and technologies, organised by the International Institute of Security amp; Safety Management (IISSM), in association with Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India) Bengal on Friday.																								There was a time when we looked up to the Bengal fire services for direction. Unfortunately, it has failed to move with the times in terms of both planning and resource mobilisation. Even the maximum fire protection law, formulated in Delhi and adopted by cities like Hyderabad and Bangalore, is yet to be enforced here, Dheri pointed out.																								While state director-general of fire services Sujit Sarkar wasnt too sure if the law had, indeed, not been upgraded in his backyard (Im fairly new), he agreed that there were crippling constraints and enough grey areas. Delhi is the capital and we cant really compare our resources with it. We have been trying to sort out deficiencies, but without the cooperation of the people and builders, we cant provide optimum protection, Sarkar said.																								Earlier, fire minister Pratim Chatterjee admitted it would be a tough ask to combat two major fires raging simultaneously with the existing resources. However, we are looking ahead and gearing up for new challenges. The latest amendment to the fire protection act takes into account the profusion of highrises and the risk they present, he said.																								The minister agreed with B.K. Basu, ex-commissioner of Calcutta Police and chairman of IISSMs Calcutta chapter, that the root cause of a fire is very often not detected and hence, exemplary punishment not meted out to those responsible. The developers can make our task easier by investing in built-in fire checks. Routine maintenance of such devices, to ensure they are in working condition, is equally important, Chatterjee stressed.																								Dheri, who had broken his spine and collarbones in a rescue drill during the Uphaar cinema fire in Delhi, concurred that investment at origin was absolutely imperative. In Tokyo, they spend 35 per cent of a buildings project cost to ensure fire safety. By contrast, we are often far too casual, he lamented.																								Credai-Bengal honorary secretary Pradip Kumar Chopra also thought indifference is the main hazard and appealed for greater awareness. D.C. Nath, ex-special director, IB, and founder-member of IISSM, said security concerns should be dovetailed with fire safety.

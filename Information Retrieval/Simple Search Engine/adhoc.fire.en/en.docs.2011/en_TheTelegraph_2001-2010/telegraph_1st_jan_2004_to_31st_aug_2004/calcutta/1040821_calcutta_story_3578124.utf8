The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Mayor foot down on footbridges
 A STAFF REPORTER
	Existing Footbridges: Sealdah, Ultadanga, Bidhan Sishu Udyan, Rajabazar, Ekdalia (under construction)
	Number of Billboards in Calcutta: 3,000
	 Number of illegal Billboards: 1,500-plus
	CMC's revenue: Rs 12 crore
	Cost of a footbridge: Rs 80 lakh
	Cost of a footbridge with Escalator: Over Rs 1.5 crore
No more footbridges without escalators.																								The civic body has realised that pedestrians face an uphill task climbing the flight of stairs of a footbridge and find it more convenient to cross a road by just walking across it. Footbridges, thus, only serve the interests of advertisers by offering vantage spots for billboards.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: Footbridges are rarely used by the pedestrian because of the height one has to climb. Besides, they are inconvenient for the aged. They only add to visual pollution by being strategic spots for putting up billboards. Underpasses and subways, he said, are much better. 																								An outdoor advertising agency has come up with proposals for constructing more footbridges at busy road intersections and giving a facelift to bus shelters, in exchange of right to put up billboards. 																								The agency has started work on a footbridge in the Ekdalia area and approached Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for approval to build another, connecting Biresh Guha Street with Darga Road, Bright Street and New Park Street. 																								Backed by local Trinamul Congress councillor Arup Biswas, the agency has already beautified 12 bus shelters in New Alipore (the city has more than 10,000 such shelters).																								Congress councillor from Park Circus Shammi Jahan is against the proposed footbridge in her locality. She, instead, has demanded a subway. 																								She has told the mayor that footbridges were being set up at the cost of the citys looks, only to make advertisers happy. The city has half-a-dozen footbridges, and all are shunned by pedestrians, she has pointed out. 																								We are now hesitant about the Park Circus footbridge. The company has demanded advertising rights for 20 years without any payment to CMC, said a civic official. 																								The Ekdalia footbridge will be fitted with an escalator and will cost more than Rs 1.5 crore. But the one at Park Circus, to be built at a cost of Rs 80 lakh, will not have an escalator, said Dilip Chatterjee of Selvel, an outdoor advertising agency. 																								According to him, giving a facelift to a bus shelter costs more than Rs 70,000. If we are denied the scope of realising the cost, how can we involve ourselves in the citys development? he asked. 																								CMC Opposition leader Nirmal Mukherjee alleged: The Trinamul Congress is leading the city backward. 																								Civic rules, he pointed out, do not approve of billboards at road intersections. And a footbridge is the easiest way to dodge the rules. 																								After bringing back hawkers on the pavements, the Trinamul has now decided to turn the city into a billboard jungle, Mukherjee claimed.

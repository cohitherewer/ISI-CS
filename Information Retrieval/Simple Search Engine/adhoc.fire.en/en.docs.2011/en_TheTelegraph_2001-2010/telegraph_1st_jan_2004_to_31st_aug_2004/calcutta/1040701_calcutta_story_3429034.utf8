 Medical College and Hospital: Left in the darkApropos the report Hospital assault over illicit activity, June 2, it is a serious concern that junior doctors of state medical colleges and hospitals are being assaulted on the hospital campus by Group-D staff members. This seems to happen whenever the junior doctors speak up against any racket run by some of these people with the help of outsiders. Such corrupt practices are now on the increase due to support from union leaders and inaction of the hospital authorities.  If junior doctors of the hospital are not safe in the hands of the Group-D staff, how can patients expect fair treatment from them? Rackets run by Group-D staff members also pose serious stumbling blocks in the functioning of hospitals.  Perhaps in this context, the most crucial question remains to be answered by the director of medical education and health authorities  are the oft-reported illegal activities of Group-D staff on hospital premises in collusion with outsiders not alarming enough to tarnish whatever is left of quality of service provided in government hospitals? If so, what action has been taken so far to discipline such workers who deserve stringent punishment for their immoral and violent acts?  It is high time that the authorities understood that patients are getting fed up with the declining standards of treatment and lack of work culture in state hospitals and opting for private hospitals and nursing homes, even at higher costs. Sunil Banerjee,
VIP RoadApropos the report Dark disarray halts therapy, June 1, it is appaling how frequent and prolonged power cuts sent hundreds of cancer patients back home from Medical College and Hospital for two weeks. How can the CESC trip on its job when hospitals fall under the essential services category? Govinda Bakshi, 
Budge BudgeApropos the report Dilly dally over fume folly, May 28, it is a matter of concern that the state government is not strict in implementing the ban on smoking. Presumably, the authorities are dilli-dallying as some of them are smokers themselves. The votebank is also a worry. But why should non-smokers suffer? Rabindra Nath Kar,
Sankar Ghosh Lane Most smokers in our country do not bother about others. It is distressing that even high-ranking government officials are found smoking in the no-smoking areas. Hara Lal Chakraborty,
Arabinda Nagar Apropos the report Signs of the times: silence zone boards, June 2, it is distressing how vehicular traffic adds to sound pollution. The drivers are uncaring about the elderly, the ill or the examinees. Putting up sign boards in silence zones will yield precious little unless awareness programmes are undertaken. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town Building the AJC Bose Road and Lockgate flyovers on time has yielded Rs 40 crore as savings to the exchequer (Funds spill over after flyover feat, April 30). Kudos to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government for this feat. T.R. Anand, 
Budge BudgeApropos the report Snag windfall for ATM cards, May 31, when most customers draw more than the amount on their balance sheet, it is due to faulty machines as most ATM users are unaware of the actual amount in their accounts at the time of withdrawal. So the responsibility for overdrawing lies with SBI authorities who do not set their machines right. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty Road I was thinking of buying a computer when the article PC made easy appeared in Metro on Sunday (May 30). Looking forward to more such informative stories. Preetish Chatterjee,
AliporeIn Hard Talk on cancer management, dated May 17, Dr Subir Ganguly has remarked that voluntary organisations like Indian Cancer Society, Oncolink and Fight Cancer have ceased to exist at present. But our organisation is very much active and has been so for the past two decades to provide guidance to cancer patients and their families. Dr Debashis Banerjee, 
Secretary, Indian Cancer Society

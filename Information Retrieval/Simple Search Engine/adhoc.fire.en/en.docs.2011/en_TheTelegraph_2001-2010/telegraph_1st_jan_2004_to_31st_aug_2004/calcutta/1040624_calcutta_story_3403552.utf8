The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 The world in his inkpot
 Rajorshi ChakrabortiRajorshi ChakrabortiHes a budding novelist, part-time teacher and traveller at large. Rajorshi Chakraborti has many labels, but none are stereotypical. 																								Born in Calcutta, the 26-year-old was dragged off to Mumbai for part of his childhood, and then came back to the city to finish his education from St James School. From then on, he was footloose and fancy-free, but with a purpose. His aim was to be a writer, and his methods were meritorious  scholarships all the way. I couldnt afford to pay, he says.																								First stop was the United World College on Vancouver Island, Canada. Then came a literature under-graduate degree at Hull University  1st class, with the Philip Larkin prize  and finally, a Ph.D from Edinburgh University in African and Indian literature. It was during his stay in Scotland that Chakraborti began to write, and do a whole lot more.																								Fleet-footing across continents, the man from Lake Gardens made his way from Germany to France and even Brazil, staying with friends, thinking, writing and discovering. But when it came to his first novel, the city of choice was the city of joy.																								I am mesmerised by the architecture here, he grins. So, Or The Day Seizes You, to be published by Penguin India in October this year, had to be set in Calcutta (and partly in London). He has already penned his second novel, Derangements: A triptych of ghost stories, with three separate novellas intertwined.																								Back in Calcutta since November, he has been practising what he does best  teaching. Well, sometimes. Having just completed a workshop for schoolchildren on script-development, hes headed for Edinburgh in July for the next two months, to teach English at the Scottish Universities International Summer School.																								Ive found myself playing chef, television interviewer, maitre d, national park guide, film critic, university tutor, trainee cinematographer and location scout. But they are not as interesting as the lives I would like to have lived  spy, filmmaker, big-shot lawyer, model. I guess thats why I tell stories, he laughs.																								Chakrabortis favourite occupation was as interviewer for the Television Trust of Scotland, during the Edinburgh International Book Festival last year. His meetings with authors like William Dalrymple, Tariq Ali and George Monbiot have since been screened on several channels in the UK and Northern Ireland.																								In future though, he hopes to pursue filmmaking. I have made a few short films with the help of my friends, he explains. Next step  scriptwriting, and then, behind the camera, hopefully. Thats after finishing the collection of short stories hes just begun.

 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 Egg 'n' shoe arsenal greets Avtar Singh
 															- Mild lathicharge on chock-a-block court compound as sleaze racket suspects guided in A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Avtar Singh is brought into Barrackpore court on Monday morning. Picture by Amit Datta																								Chaos stoked by political power play engulfed the Barrackpore sub-divisional court compound on Monday afternoon as Avtar Singh, husband of CPM parliamentarian Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, was showered with shoes and rotten eggs.																								Trinamul Congress activists flaunting party banners ganged up with some residents of the area to hurl abuse and ammunition at the national athlete-turned-businessman accused of running a sleaze racket from his hotel in Salt Lake. At the end of the brief hearing, Singh was remanded in judicial custody for another 14 days.																								The crowd started gathering on the court premises from morning as word spread that Singh, arrested on the night of August 15, would be produced in the sub-divisional magistrates court. A large police force, led by senior officers, was posted to prevent an ugly incident.																								As the van carrying Singh  along with two of the four girls arrested from Merlin Park hotel for their alleged involvement in the sleaze racket  rolled into the court compound, shouts of anger rang out.																								From one section of the audience, however, the decibel rose in defence of Singh. Abusing police for baseless action against the former athlete, they took up position as if to offer protection to the CPM parliamentarians husband, in case things spun out of control.																								As Singh emerged from the van, an arsenal of rotten eggs, old shoes and ink balls (cloth balls dipped in ink) was unleashed. Some missiles hit a few policemen guarding and guiding Singh from the van to the courtroom, while others thumped on the van.																								A mild lathicharge was launched to prevent the mob from surging towards Singh as he and the two girls, their faces covered with cloth, were being led away. The judicial magistrate heard the accused and their lawyers briefly before extending the remand till September 13.																								Singh was pelted with eggs and shoes once again as he emerged from the courtroom and got back into the police van. He was driven to Dum Dum Central jail, where he will be lodged till the next hearing.

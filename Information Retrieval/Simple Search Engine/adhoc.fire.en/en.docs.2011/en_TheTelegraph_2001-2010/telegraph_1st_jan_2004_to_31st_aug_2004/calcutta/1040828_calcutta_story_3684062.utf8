The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 With hope as partner, one step at a time 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Heather Mills McCartney (right), is a model, television presenter and leading landmine activist, whom the loss of a limb could not stop. 																								Thousands are left limbless in our country every year. Only five per cent of the people with amputation get prostheses (an artificial limb), of which a high percentage is rejected because the user finds its unsuitable for his way of life. With very little help by way of the expensive Ottobock from Germany or our very own Jaipur Foot, there is good news for those seeking normal lives after losing a limb.																								Mobility India, a 10-year-old NGO, has recently introduced Sathi  a component of prostheses which gives new hope after amputation of the lower limb. Sathi which promises to be cheaper than the German Ottobock and easier to handle than the Jaipur Foot. 																								Amit Kumar, programme manager at Mobility India Regional Resource Centre at Majherhat, told Metro, For the prostheses imported from Germany, the kit cost (or cost of the extension piece of the artificial limb between the socket at the knee and the foot) is as high as Rs 10,000. The full product fabrication costs between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000, in cases crossing Rs 2 lakh. The masses cannot afford this. Mobility Indias Sathi component comes at a kit cost of Rs 700 and a fabrication cost of Rs 2,500. 																								Imported limbs have been found more suitable for the West, for the foot piece is made with heel height which cannot be worn without shoes. Sathi has a definite advantage over that as it has been manufactured keeping in mind the thousands of poor people in our villages who walk barefoot, added Kumar.																								The popular Jaipur Foot, comparable to our product as far as cost is concerned, has one problem. If anything goes wrong, the whole limb has to be replaced. But with Sathi, only the problematic portion can be taken apart and replaced, explained Kumar.																								With the best innovation award from the International Society of Prosthetics and Orthotics World Congress at Hong Kong earlier this month, Mobility India has already fitted over 300 people all over India with the Sathi component. Various organisations working with the poor place orders with us. We go to villages, measure the patient and deliver his new foot at his doorstep, Kumar signed off.

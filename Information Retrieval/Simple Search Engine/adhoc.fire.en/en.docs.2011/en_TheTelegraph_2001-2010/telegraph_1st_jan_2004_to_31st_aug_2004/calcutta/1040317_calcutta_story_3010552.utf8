																								Anamorphosis in art is a relatively elusive subject. It is not an art form that is frequently indulged in, if only because of its vastly scientific base. Propounded by the great master Leonardo da Vinci himself, anamorphosis has found very few learners. The images that were born out of anamorphosis were mostly sketches and abstract figures, the only exception being Da Vincis self portrait. Under the patronage of AS Vridi, anamorphic art has touched a more distant horizon. Vridi, who recently entered the Guinness Book of World Records for having created the largest anamorphic portrait, is a self taught artist who has juggled with various forms in the artistic domain while carving out a commendable niche for himself as perhaps the greatest anamorphic artist. Art lovers in the city have an unusual visual treat awaiting them at the Academy which is holding an exhibition of some of Vridis creative masterpieces.																								Event: Anamorphosis art exhibition by A.S. Virdi																								When: Till March 19; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

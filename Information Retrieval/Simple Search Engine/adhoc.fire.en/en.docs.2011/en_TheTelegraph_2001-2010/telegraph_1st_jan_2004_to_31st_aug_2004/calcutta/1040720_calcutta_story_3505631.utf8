Sujoy with his posters at the Bletchley Park venue. (Below) The presentation ceremonySujoy Mukherjee, a student of Heritage Institute of Technology, topped the Asian circuit to qualify for the poster competition at a high-profile conference in the UK on the history of electronics, organised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), an umbrella body of electrical professionals. Young Metro flips through the diary of the 22-year-old, who emerged the winner.				 				 																															June 25: Left home early brimming with enthusiasm. Used the flight time to prepare my conference speech. Was received at Heathrow by my aunt. Set off for her Northampton home. No potholes on roads or garbage on pavements! And the sun was blazing at 10 pm. 				 				 																															June 26: Prepared for the conference. 				 				 																															June 27: Travelled to Bletchley Park. Most of my competitors were Ph.D or Masters candidates. Three were from the US, one from Canada, one from the UK and another from Bangladesh. 				 				 																															June 28: The big day. The poster presentation was after the seminar sessions. Electronics giants were present. It was 4.30 pm when the judges  former IEEE President Wallace Read, senior research historians Frederik Nebeker and J. Vardalas, and manager, IEEE virtual museum, Kim Breitfelder  called the nine regional toppers to present their papers. Each of us had five minutes. After months of preparation I was confident, yet it was unnerving to have so many eyes on me. Fingers crossed, I managed to complete my presentation (on the history of microwaves) on time.				 				 																															June 29: Attended the seminar. During the breaks, the delegates thronged in front of our posters. Many sought details on Acharya Jagadish Chandra Boses work. No sweat, I was ready with the answers. The tour around Bletchley Park was an experience. The working of the Lorenz and Enigma code-breakers was explained. These had given the Allies a vital edge during WW II. We were presented with the earliest diodes and tetrodes from the Park archives. 				 				 																															June 30: The seminar carried on till 12.15 pm after which was the awards luncheon. Many senior research workers had emotional recollections of WW II and made moving speeches. The award ceremony was a star-studded affair with the presence of four IEEE presidents, one current (Arthur Winston) and three former (Wallace Read, J. Thompson and Tony Davies). The nine of us were awarded certificates. Then came the results. Michael (Yu-Herng Tu, Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania) was third, Asif (Islam Khan, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) came second. And then it was me! I was in a daze as I collected the booty  a certificate, a memento and an IEEE branded shirt. A cash prize was also announced, which will be sent to IEEE, Calcutta. The atmosphere was electric. Many dignitaries congratulated me. I rushed out and tried to call my mother. No luck, but managed to reach my grandmother in Dakshineswar. Shot off an e-mail to my institute in the evening.				 				 																															July 1: The battle was won. Time for fun and games. Went to Wimbledon with my aunt. Saw the womens semi-finals on the centre court. Sharapova and Serena Williams were exciting, but my heart was set on seeing Lee-Hesh in action. Bhupathis mixed doubles was next. Then we watched Paes/Navratilova. Security was tight but I managed Leanders autograph. 				 				 																															July 2: Spent all day sight-seeing in London. 				 				 																															July 3: Went to Shakespeares house in Stratford. 				 				 																															July 4-7: Scoped the neighbourhood, checked out Harrods and watched Shrek 2 in Northampton. 				 				 																															July 8: Foul weather delayed the flight, but it didnt matter. I had lived a dream. Only, it was real. 				 				 																
	 Creative moves				 				 																															Kshitij made its debut in November 2003, born of an idea by the Rotaract Club of Belur, to provide the mentally and physically challenged children a platform to express themselves. It was awarded the best project for the year 2003-2004 by the Rotaract District Council (Rotary International Dist: 3290).				 				 																															This year, Kshitij was held on July 4 by Rotaract Club of Belur, along with SNEH (social service club) of Birla High School Girls and the Interact Club of Mahadevi Birla. 				 				 																															About 30 schools took part in the fest with great enthusiasm. The first event was the fancy dress competition, which saw the children at their creative best, dressed as doctors, pundits, teachers and more. The art competition was held in the respective schools, and the judge Kiran Mazumdar had a tough time making up her mind.				 				 																															The students of SHIRC performed a foot-tapping Punjabi number for which they bagged the top honours. Noble Mission gave them tough competition. A superb mime show by Manovikas Kendra also took home a prize. The talent hunt showcased skills in vocal and instrumental music. Students from Bodhayan Path Finder and Mentaid were wonderful on the tabla and the harmonium.  Vinay Mundhra,
Bhawanipur College A scene from the Theatrecian play Us and Them. Picture by Pradip SanyalDreamer of dreams				 				 																															Left alone in the world at age four, fending for food and shelter, doing odd jobs at a tea stall and a leather factory, film-making was the last thing that he could have ever dreamt of. But it happened for Ashikul Islam, 12, the conceptual director of the 20-minute documentary Aami  I Am, which bagged the overall prize at the Kids International Film Festival in Athens and was recently screened at Oxford Bookstore. 				 				 																															From a beggar at four to a film-maker at 12, it has been a long journey for Ashikul, an inmate of Muktoneer, after his mother died and he was abandoned by his grandmother and older brother.				 				 																															Alamgir, a child labour in a sweet shop, earning Rs 10 a day, and Saiful, who has a mentally-challenged mother, missing sisters and no father, helped Ashikul with the camera. Rahul, Ashis, Raju, Bapi, Gopal, Arjun, Biswanath and Tanmoy, all between the ages of six and 12, formed the rest of the cast and crew. 				 				 																															The idea of Aami was born at a workshop when Ashikul said that hed like to tell other children about the things elder people find too funny to answer but are a wonder to us. One day of rehearsals and 10 hours of shooting on a hot day in villages saw the making of Aami				 				 																															In his endeavour to depict the tragedies and traumas, hopes and aspirations of destitute children, he is supported by conceptual director Nidhi Malhotra and producer Manav Jalan of Gaurang Films. 				 				 																															Aami is a simple but moving tale of those children who face the adversities of life without any grudges and with a smile, depicting the joy and pride of being who they are  Aami  I Am.

	 Bloom of talent				 				 																															Theatrecian staged the play Us and Them on July 16, written and directed by school students Jhinuk Sen, from CIS, and Aditya in Class XII in St Xaviers. The actors were also school students. In spite of their age, the script was well-written and though the execution was slightly amateurish, it bore promise. 				 				 																															The play is about the contemporary world where war is just another word and escapism is another way. The first act depicted political leaders and their whims and fancies, which govern the fate of ordinary people. The world is gradually torn apart by the conflicting ideas of various leaders and then there were wars. 				 				 																															The second act showed a pantheon of gods who wanted to create a new world where human relationships still serve as the foundation. However, here too, the different gods have different perspectives. Ironically, the end too, is common for the gods  death. As they say: You are us today but you will be them tomorrow so lets start walking.  Radhika Basu Thakur,

	 War of words				 				 																															The final regional round of the 5th LN Birla National Debate of Birla High School was a nail-biting session. The motion was India is shining. Suman K. Mukherjee, director, Birla High School, chaired the debate.				 				 																															Schools locking horns included MHS, BHS, CIS, MP Birla Foundation, LMB and St Xaviers Collegiate. The participating colleges comprised Presidency, Bethune, NUJS, JD Birla Institute, Bhowanipur Gujrati Education Society (BGES) and St Xaviers. 				 				 																															The panel of judges included professionals like editors, neurosurgeons and professors. While one side tried to highlight Indias glory with examples like Amartya Sen and Kalpana Chawla, the opposition laid emphasis on poverty, crime and abuse of women. Comments from the moderator and participants added momentum. 				 				 																															If Max Mueller could praise India 50 years ago, why cant we now? shot one. If we think India is shining, then we are living in a fools paradise, responded another. The moderators question of why do Indian flowers bloom only on foreign lands? made sure it was a heated war of words, which covered every aspect of India, from Bollywood to illiteracy.				 				 																															Zubien D. Rozario of St Xaviers school and Rahul Chauria of BGES were adjudged the two best speakers, ensuring their participation in the national finals on November 25.  Puja Agarwal,

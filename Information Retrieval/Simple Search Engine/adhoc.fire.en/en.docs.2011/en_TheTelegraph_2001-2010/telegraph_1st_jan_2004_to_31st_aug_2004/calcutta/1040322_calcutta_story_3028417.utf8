 Monday, March 22, 2004 Old haunt, new home 
 The regal spread at The Kenilworth. Picture by Rashbehari Das No alcoholic beverages and no non-vegetarian food. Any takers?																								Plenty, it seems, for Hindustan Club at Sarat Bose Road, which serves only vegetarian food and no hard drinks, has pulled along just fine with a loyal membership base for the past 59 years.																								Catering, according to the club management, to a largely Marwari and Gujarati crowd, the club is going in for a complete makeover. A 10-storey building already stands tall beside the old structure that is now being demolished.																								Spread across 70,000 sq ft, the new club premises will boast of banquet halls to host parties, a swimming pool, health clubs, guest rooms, squash courts, cardrooms, billiards, table tennis, carrom, and more, strengthening its good, clean, family fun proposition.																								Earlier, Hindustan Club was run from a rented property. We purchased the premises in 1993 and demolished the old building. We put a temporary structure in place and began construction of the new building, says honorary secretary, Hindustan Club, Vinit Mehta. The new venue is due to be completed by June. 																								A brand new restaurant  FG 7 x 11  is already doing roaring business, after it was launched with a cook-in by ghazal singer Pankaj Udhas earlier this month. FG stands for feel great and is open from 7 am to 11 pm, extended from the earlier club timings of 2.30 pm to 10 pm.																								And there are plenty of reasons to feel great, for the regular menu features more than 300 Indian as well as continental dishes. Resident chef Anthony Lawrence has whipped up a host of new delicacies as part of the ongoing food festival at the club.Even though the fare is strictly vegetarian  without any onion or garlic  the menu makes an attempt at experimental cooking like Rajasthani Pizza (pizza base baked with a topping of stringy vegetables and khichdi). Earlier, we would serve only Rajasthani and Gujarati food, but now our clients, especially the younger crowd, like to experiment with food, says Lawrence.Fit for a kingYou dont have to be born with blue blood to be treated like royalty. The Nizam-E-Dawat fest at The Marble Room, The Kenilworth, brings delicacies straight from the regal kitchen of the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad. Apart from the ubiquitous biryanis and kebabs, the festival features a host of dishes fit for a king. 																								The Nizam is said to have been very fond of travelling and would often bring back tips for his cooks picked up from various cuisine during his exploits at home and abroad, explains executive chef Niraj Kumar Sinha.																								The beauty of Hyderabadi cuisine is that despite outside influences, it has been able to retain an identity of its own and has also contributed towards popularising Indian cuisine worldwide, he adds. The kebabs, for example, an intrinsic part of Hyderabadi food, he says, originate in Greece.																								Sinha believes it is the special ingredients, carefully chosen and cooked to just the right degree, that makes Hyderabadi cuisine such a favourite with foodies. The names of dishes are usually derived from the herbs and spices used. Murgh Do Pyaza, he explains, gets its name from onions that are added twice during the cooking process in two variations.																								Meat, especially lamb, is another essential feature of the cuisine. Halim (lamb cooked in three varieties of dal), Kachche Gosht Ki Biryani (biryani with tender lamb chunks) and Lukmi (pancake stuffed with mutton keema) are a few dishes to look out for at the festival.																								Those who are adventurous with their food can try out Hara Bhara Kebab (spinach and cottage cheese dumplings), Saunfiani Paneer Tikka (cottage cheese marinated in fenugreek seeds and green chutney) and Zanat-E-Numa (potatoes stuffed with khoya, cottage cheese and raisins, simmered in mint and spinach gravy).																								The festival will be on till March 31. 						CONTRIBUTED BY SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

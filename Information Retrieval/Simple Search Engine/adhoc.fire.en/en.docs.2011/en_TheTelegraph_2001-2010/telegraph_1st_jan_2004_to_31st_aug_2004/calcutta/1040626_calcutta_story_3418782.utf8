 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Death penalty in hot debate at power seat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The life-or-death debate over Dhananjoy Chatterjee has all but split the ruling ranks wide open.																								If chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee threw his hat into the death-by-hanging ring by declaring that this would go out as a signal that a civilised society would not tolerate the perpetrator of such crimes, his predecessor Jyoti Basu expressed reservations over capital punishment.																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, too, had said he was personally against the death penalty, but then added that the gravity and the enormity of Dhananjoys crime must also be kept in mind in this case.																								According to CPM insiders, the chief minister had discussed the matter with Biswas, Left Front chairman Biman Bose and Benoy Konar but a difference of opinion had crept in. 																								Alimuddin Street then left it to Writers Buildings to resolve the thorny matter, as it was, finally, a law-and-order issue.																								Chief minister Bhattacharjee, meanwhile, found vocal support from crucial quarters at work and at home.																								At Writers, law minister Nisith Adhikary said: Whenever there is a provision for death sentence in the law, it must be executed. If it is not done, then criminals will be enthused.																								And from Palm Avenue, Suchetana Bhattacharjee, the chief ministers daughter, told Metro: I am in a state of shock over the stay order. In this case, I support capital punishment because what this man did was the sub-human act of a perverted criminal. With due respect to Dhananjoys family, it is time Hetal Parekhs memory, and her familys grief, is honoured.																								Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, meanwhile, came out against the hanging.  I do not believe that if a criminal is hanged, nobody will commit such a crime in future A criminal must be punished, but at the same time, we have to take steps to curb the malaise of criminal activity, Halim said.																								RSP, a major constituent of the Left Front, echoed the Speaker, with former minister Kshiti Goswami demanding a debate on death sentence in Parliament.																								Gitanath Ganguly, executive chairman, Legal Aid Services, West Bengal, said: Capital punishment is a retributive theory of punishment, while we follow a reformatory concept now. When the state cannot ensure life, why should it be given the power to take a life?

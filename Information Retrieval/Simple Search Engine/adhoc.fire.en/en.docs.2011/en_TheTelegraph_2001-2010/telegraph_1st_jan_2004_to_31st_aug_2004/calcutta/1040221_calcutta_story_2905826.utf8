 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Teachers on contract for new CU courses
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta University (CU) has decided to appoint teachers on a yearly contract basis after the success of the system in government-run colleges and some state-aided universities.																								For the first time, the university is set to appoint six lecturers for its information technology (IT) department on contract, renewable every year. 																								Advertisements were placed in city dailies on Monday seeking applications from candidates for the six IT lecturers posts.																								Sources in the CU said after these six posts are filled, the university will appoint teachers on contract for other subjects, too.																								More and more new courses are being opened every year to meet the increasing demands of students. We need many more teachers for the new courses. The decision to appoint teachers on contract has been taken after getting a nod from the government, a senior CU official said.																								Contractual appointment of teachers has already been introduced by Jadavpur and Kalyani universities, as well as by government-run colleges.																								The need for such contracts was felt after the government decided to freeze funds to the institutions for paying salaries to teachers of courses in emerging areas like IT, bio-technology, journalism and mass communication, computer science and business administration. The salaries would have to be paid by the university concerned. 																								At present, the government spends about Rs 580 crore every year on higher education, comprising Rs 230 crore for the universities and Rs 350 crore for the 360 colleges across the state.																								However, teachers lobbies in the CU on Tuesday voiced fears over the trend of such contractual appointments finding favour in more and more institutions.																								According to them, the new appointments would not be opposed as long as they were restricted to courses in the emerging areas. 																								We have no objection if teachers are appointed on contract for new courses in the emerging areas, where the government does not provide any funds for paying the teachers salaries. But we will not allow contractual appointments if there is any attempt to appoint such teachers for conventional courses, the lobbies asserted. The government already provides the salaries for such teachers, pointed out Gautam Ganguly, general secretary, Calcutta University Teachers Association.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Fleece the buyer, favour the realtor
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Buyers of apartments are being fleeced in the name of property registration. Apart from a consultation fee, some advocates charge a percentage (usually, one per cent) of the stamp duty as the registration fee.																								In return, they draw up an agreement that gives the promoter rights to the roof or suppresses irregularities in construction.																								As complaints flood the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to bring out a buyers guide to create awareness on constructions that are illegal or on a disputed plot or of inferior quality. The book will also guide buyers on how to avoid extortion at the time of mutation and registration.																								He has entrusted CMC deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh to draft the brochure.																								Ghosh pointed out that it had become a practice for promoters to hire lawyers to draw up sale deeds and get the apartments registered for buyers in their housing estates. A buyer has to fork out Rs 500 or more to the lawyer for the sale deed and then an additional amount by way of stamp duty paid at the time of getting his flat registered.																								So, the buyer of a flat in an estate of 10 pays Rs 80,000 as stamp duty and then another Rs 8,000 as registration fee to the lawyer  though a lawyer is redundant at the time of registration. 																								Second, an advocate, who charges Rs 500 or so for drafting a sale deed, can at best charge Rs 500 as his fee for registering the deed, Ghosh explained.																								Welcoming mayor Mukherjees decision, chairman of West Bengal Bar Councils executive committee Uttam Majumdar said:  This sort of extortion is unethical. It requires public awareness to put an end to it. The malpractice is rampant not only in Calcutta but in Howrah, Hooghly and other districts, too. 																								According to him, the fee of a professional lawyer is always on declaration. He fixes the rate and charges it for offering his services to a client. Some solicitor firms, though, charge for service a percentage of the valuation of the property under transaction.																								What is worrying the civic body is that even after paying such an exorbitant sum to a lawyer, the buyers interests are not protected. We have received sale deeds for mutation of flats that have been constructed illegally, some by converting the garage space on the ground floor and others on the rooftop, flouting the plan sanctioned by the CMC, Ghosh pointed out. In some cases, the roof right was reserved for the realtor, though the CMC rules do not allow it.

Ocio, the new leisureplex at 5, Belvedere Road, is all set to open its doors to members from May 22, with finishing touches to be added to the first two floors  the gym on the ground floor and the pools, caf and youngsters play zone at the basement level.				 																																																											The rest of the facilities, including a rooftop restaurant, nightclub, bar, nine-hole putting golf course and boardroom, will be ready in the next three months, promises S.S. Kanoria, the man behind the Alipore complex.				 																																																											The gym is equipped with cardio-vascular equipment, eight individual television screens with headphones and a big plasma TV with cable connection, as well as a radio/CD/DVD player. Its fitted with hi-tech equipment, including a 360 functional trainer, seated leg press, chest and overhead press and a pull down and hip combo.				 																																																											There are separate weight stacks for men and women, and the cross trainer is fit for hardcore enthusiasts. The monitors on the machines indicate temperature. Plus, professional trainers are at hand to guide members. On a more relaxing note, there is a sauna, chilled shower baths and massage service.				 																																																											Twenty-six feet below the ground is the indoor swimming pool, with an even temperature maintained all year round. There are fibre-optics chandeliers on the ceiling, and murals on the walls.				 																																																											Its mainly for the children, says Kanoria, adding that the rain shower space, too, is just for the kids. For the parents, theres a jacuzzi and two steam closets with body jet massage, alongside the swimming area.				 																																																											While the kids have their own little water hole, adjoining the aqua aerobics pool (which is also shallow enough for older children learning to swim), the adult pool is fitted with a counter current device at the deep end. When switched on, it creates varying degrees of currents in the opposite direction to the swimmer, allowing for rigorous exercise.				 																																																											The caf, halfway between the pool and the gym, serves beverages and snacks. But its the kids play area next to it that is guaranteed to attract the crowds. The little ones have a corner all to themselves, with baby toys. And the older children can while away the hours on one of the six machines, including two Playstations and an Eye Toy, which is played with hand movements in the air.				 																																																											Leisure, pleasure, fitness and business is what the management of Ocio offers members of the first leisureplex in the country.				 																																									 Rabindrasangeet has received a shot in the arm in Rome and London, thanks to the efforts of Reba Som, wife of Indian ambassador to Italy Himachal Som. 				 																																																											This Pochishe Boishakh (Saturday), Saregama India will release a novel 12-track Rabindrasangeet CD by Reba. Rabindranath Tagore: selected songs has been recorded, mixed, edited and mastered at the OASI Studio, Rome, under Italian producer and artistic director Francesca Cassio, a trained singer of western classical and jazz. She later trained in dhrupad music with the Dagar brothers.				 																																																											The uniqueness of the product lies in the transliteration into English of all the 12 songs by the singer herself, a Jawaharlal Nehru University Fellow and author of several books. To enable a more authentic pronunciation in Bengali, a phonetic pattern has been adopted for the transliteration of the songs, rather than the use of only diacritical marks.				 																																																											Of late, there has been a lot of curiosity about Tagore songs and poems among westerners and non-Bengalis. We wanted to give them the meanings of the songs in an acceptable format so that they can really appreciate the music, explains S.F. Karim, business manager, Saregama India Ltd. The English translations are narrated by Kenneth Hurry, an Englishman based in Italy.				 																																																											Tagore songs are unique musical compositions, highlighting not only the rich descriptive quality of his lyrics, but also their profound philosophical content. The sheer spiritual beauty of his verses continues to make his lyrics relevant in the contemporary climate of uncertainty and violence, says Som in her introduction.				 																																																											The selection of 12 songs represents several of the themes dealt with by Tagore  prem (love), puja (devotional), prakriti (seasons) as also bichitra (miscellaneous) and a baul song. While Rashmi Bhatt, long settled in Florence, plays the tabla, Gianni Ricchizzi, qualified at the University of Benaras, has played the sitar and surbahar. Cassio also accompanies on the tanpura, and Kamal Sabri plays the sarengi.				 																																																											According to Karim, the London launch of the CD will be made by Tapan Raychaudhuri, professor emeritus, St Anthonys College, Oxford, in the presence of acting high commissioner Satyabrata Pal at the Nehru Centre on May 12.

Both hail from an army background and their parents wanted them to join the services too. But they believed that words are mightier than the sword and so, wanted to create the magic of visuals, which leaves a lasting impression on the world. 				 																																																											Their shared a passion for films brought them back together again a year ago, when Men on the Moon Productions was launched. The duos first project, Divine Mystics, another side of Islam  a documentary on Sufism is being bought by Discovery Channel for broadcast in Asia and the SAARC nations.				 																																																											In the present international scenario, this documentary is an attempt to show an aspect of Islam that many around the world dont know exists. It is an attempt to explain, in very simple words, Sufi history, methodology, ceremonies and festivals, especially those practised in India. Featuring interviews of Sufi followers from all walks of life, it explores the core beliefs of the sect.				 																																																											Set against the amazing background of the Bareilly Khankah or the abode of the Sufi Saint Hazrat Shah Hasnain Mian Niyazia, the spiritual head of the Niyazia Silsila, the documentary brings to life the various rituals and festivals that Sufis practise. The film starts with a historical background of the Sufi movement in India and moves on to present-day saints and teachers. All through, the differences and similarities with traditional Islam are maintained.				 																																																											Extensively shot in Bareilly, Ajmer and Delhi, it features the famous dargahs of the great Sufi teachers who are worshipped and venerated to this day. What is the Peer Mureed relationship? What is Fana? What makes a man a saint? are some of the questions the film attempts to answer, accompanied by a live qawwali soundtrack. Featured and explained for the first time will be ceremonies like the Chiragaan or the oil-lamp ceremony, the Grand Urs and the Sama.				 																																																											To re-live the Calcutta experience, Shantanu and Sheershak are also working on a Bengali feature film to be shot in the city, reviving all the zeal and enthusiasm of the city they met in.				 																																									 The top clubs of the city have battled it out through the week and now Saturday is the day of crowning glory. The prize distribution of the inter-club carnival takes place at The Saturday Club at 6 pm, after the finals of swimming, the only discipline remaining undecided. Nine clubs, seven events in seven days  its been a madhouse, laughed club president Shyamal Mitra, raising his voice over the carnival cacophony on Friday.

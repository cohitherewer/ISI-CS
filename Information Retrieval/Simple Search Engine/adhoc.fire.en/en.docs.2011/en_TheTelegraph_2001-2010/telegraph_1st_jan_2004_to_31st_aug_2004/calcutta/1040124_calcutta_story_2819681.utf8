 With winter on its way out in 
 Calcutta, this time it was South India and Southern delights 
 that had people scurrying to Swabhumi, the heritage plaza 
 on the EM Bypass. Simpli South!, as their ongoing festival 
 is aptly termed, was inaugurated by freedom fighter Capt. 
 Lakshmi Sehgal and social activist Subhashini Ali and is 
 on till January 27.
 From art and culture to Ayurvedic 
 medicinal solutions, clothes and handicrafts of the four 
 southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu 
 and Kerala, the festival is showcasing it all. While the 
 aim is to promote the art and creativity of the artisans 
 of South India including craftsmen, artists, performers 
 and culinary experts, for the enthusiastic Calcuttan, it 
 all translates into an opportunity for hectic buying. With 
 the wedding season in full swing, heres your chance to 
 stock up on South silks and cottons as well as fabrics even 
 as South Indian traders and karigars explain the 
 various nuances of Narayanpets, Mangalgiris, Ikkats, Gadwals 
 or Kanjeevarams. Also on display at the stalls are silk 
 stoles priced between Rs 450 and Rs 650 and dupattas 
 at Rs 900 onwards. And if youre the type who likes to do 
 up your home in style, theres an extensive variety of products 
 including Tanjore paintings, silver filigree-work, lacquerware, 
 leather puppets and coir items to take your pick from.
 Food, the biggest turn-on for 
 Calcuttans, hasnt been forgotten either. With its wide 
 variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisine, the 
 food court beckons all and sundry. While Kerala is represented 
 by its special filter coffee and such snacks as Masala Vada, 
 Banana Roast, Puttu Kadal, Idiyappam, Palappam and Elayada, 
 Hyderabadi and Chettinad cuisines are also well taken care 
 of. The range of South Indian chutneys made of tamarind, 
 coconut, peanuts, dal, fenugreek seeds and cilantro 
 with tapioca and banana chips also come highly recommended. 
 e you take in the flavours and 
 fragrances of South India, a plethora of cultural performances 
 will keep you hooked to the place. The performances to watch 
 out for include classical dances such as Kathakali and Mohiniattam, 
 and theatre performances called Therukuthu. 
 Chefs Ashfaque and 
 Irfan Qureshi with tandoori specialities from 
 the festival at Saffron
 Tandoori nights
 The tandoor churns out 
 some of the greatest delicacies of the world and over the 
 years, it has been an integral part of Indias culinary 
 heritage. To celebrate the specialities of tandoori 
 cuisine in this part of the country, Saffron at The Park 
 is hosting a unique gourmet event  2000 years of the tandoor 
 till February 8.
 Kebabs and naans 
 are the essence of tandoori cuisine and to give Calcuttans 
 an opportunity to sample the best of both, master chefs 
 Ashfaque and Irfan Qureshi have sculpted a special menu 
 for Saffron. Cleverly crafted bearing in mind the preferences 
 of both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, the a la carte 
 menu includes kebabs and naans from every 
 corner of the country, which is why, apart from popular 
 Kashmiri kebabs, the menu includes kebabs 
 from Rajasthan, Lucknow and Hyderabad. From Phandari Seekh 
 (kebabs made of raw bananas and assorted fresh vegetables, 
 skewered on a wooden seekh and deep-fried) to the 
 Kakori Kebab (a delicate blend of finely-minced mutton, 
 cloves and cinnamon, drizzled with saffron), theres something 
 here to suit every palate.
 e such delectable specialities 
 as Nali Barrah Kebab (shanks of lamb marinated and braised 
 with whole spices and cooked in tandoor) and Shikampur 
 Kebab (mutton patties spiced with cinnamon and peppercorns) 
 are sure to bring back that craving for red meat, theres 
 good news for vegetarians also. Chef Qureshis Malai Seekh 
 Kebab and Peshawari Paneer Tikka bring out the subtle taste 
 of corn spiced with fresh herbs and cottage cheese cooked 
 on char-grill.
 Not just that, for all those who 
 prefer chicken, there are such unusual delights as Murgh 
 Kastoori Kebab (melt-in-the-mouth morsels of chicken with 
 cream, grilled in tandoor) and Murgh Potlee Kebab 
 (tender rolls of succulent chicken mince). The vegetarian 
 kebabs are priced at Rs 265 while at Rs 825, Red 
 Snapper Mussalam is the highest-priced item on the menu. 
 To complement the succulent kebabs, there is a selection 
 of rotis from Afghani Naan to Naan Changezi and Parathdar 
 Ajwain Paratha to choose from.

 of the new promotional offer at Tanishq 
 When nature calls 
 Ibiza, the swish country club 
 on Diamond Harbour Road has pulled out yet another winner 
 from its hat. Aangan  a brand new extension of guesthouses 
 on the premises was recently unveiled with the main aim 
 of helping one reconnect with nature.
 Located amidst lush greens and 
 circled by swaying palms, the cluster of nine cottages is 
 indeed a sight to behold. Modelled after a true-blue Bengali 
 village, the rural touch is more than evident by way of 
 thatched roofs, wooden frameworks, mud-look walls and folk 
 art. Bamboos, clay pots and terracotta knick-knacks only 
 add to the appeal. And if rural charm reigns on the outside, 
 the interiors are all about modern comforts and conveniences 
 what with televisions, ACs, tiled toilets and more lined 
 up to take care of your every need. Floor-to-ceiling window-panes 
 allow a gorgeous view of the greenery outside while bamboo 
 blinds offer privacy when needed. While the swimming pool 
 just outside the cottages beckons temptingly for a dip, 
 theres an attached health club as well to stay fit and 
 fine.
 Perhaps no one sums it up better 
 than Suchandra Bardhan, the young architect behind the project 
  Aangan is a meeting ground of complete coherence between 
 rural architecture, comfortable interiors and a luxuriant 
 landscape  a non-aggressive, down-to-earth weekend retreat 
 in the lap of nature, away from the hustle-bustle of the 
 city.
 The newly-launched wing is strictly 
 for members, though. And membership means coughing up little 
 over a lakh of rupees. For further details, contact the 
 club office at 2470 9928/9.

 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Optimism boost for water supply
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcuttas intermittent crisis in filtered water appears headed for a final resolution, courtesy a clutch of supply augmentation projects that are underway,																								Work is on schedule, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Thursday. The booster pumping stations at Bagmari, Ranikuthi and Kalighat are set to be commissioned by July. 																								For the first time in the past decade and a half, the civic authorities have managed to underwrite the projects by generating resources to the tune of Rs 200 crore to boost supply of filtered water. 																								The Kasba booster station is expected to be ready by 2004-end. The water treatment plants-cum-booster stations at Jorabagan and Watgunge (Dahighat) will be ready by March 2005.																								The mayor is confident that the problems faced by the citys southern fringes  relating to the use of hard water from deep tubewells and the scarcity of potable water will be resolved once the projects are ready.																								Filtered surface water will be supplied to one and all, minus the risks of arsenic contamination and hardness. The projects, once implemented, will cut the number of deep tubewells in use from 300 to 50 or even less, mayor Mukherjee said.																								Drawing a parallel with Mumbai, Beijing and Singapore, he said that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) supplies more water per capita. 																								Mukherjee cited a survey that says an individual requires 130 litres of water a day. In this respect, Calcutta, with 202 litres per 10 hours, has scored over Mumbai and Singapore (183 litres in 24 hours).																								My dream is to ensure Calcuttans a 24-hour filtered water supply, as in Singapore. Further upgrade of supply will certainly be undertaken, he added.																								However, leader of the opposition in the CMC Nirmal Mukherjee alleged that the mayor had siphoned off half the funds raised for the projects to nurse his constituencies. He doesnt deserve any special credit, as all eight projects were conceived by the former Left Front board. 																								The mayor countered: To dream of a project without having the capacity to implement it is a beggars prerogative. If I could raise Rs 400 crore of extra resources in three years, why couldnt the CPM in its 15-year tenure in the CMC?

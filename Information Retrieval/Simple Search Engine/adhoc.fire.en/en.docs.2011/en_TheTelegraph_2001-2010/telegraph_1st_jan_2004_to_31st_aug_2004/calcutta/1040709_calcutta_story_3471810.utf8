 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Battered, bruised, dumped in a bag
 							 - Twin tales of woe: one woman barely alive, the other dead A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The 70-year-old woman in hospital. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								A moving gunny bag, all tied up, caught the eye of some residents of Thakurpukur late on Wednesday. When they untied the knot, out rolled an old woman, battered, bruised and barely breathing.																								The 70-year-old woman, police said, had been thrashed mercilessly before being forced into a gunny-bag and left for dead. But she survived  though barely  and is now fighting to regain consciousness in a Behala hospital.																								Raja Rammohun Roy Road was where some members of local club Sree Ma Pally Samaj spotted something moving inside a gunny-bag near a drain.																								Prasanta Kumar Basu, Tarun Thakur, Babin Malakar and others dragged the bag to one side of the road to untie the knot and unravel the old woman and a terrible tale of torture.																								The shocked club members rallied to offer basic medical aid, cleaning and dressing the wounds, before alerting the Sahapur police outpost.																								The cops arrived, only to throw up their hands and insist that this case was beyond their jurisdiction.																								The club members then called the Behala police, who did turn up, but only to push the case into the court of Thakurpukur police station.																								The womans condition deteriorated amidst the cop joust over jurisdiction. 																								It was only after the Thakurpukur police arrived that she was shifted to Vidyasagar Hospital.																								Realising that the womans condition was critical, the hospital put together a special team under physician B. Hazra to monitor her treatment.																								Close to 24 hours after she was discovered in the bag, the old woman was on a saline drip, still unconscious.																								Doctors said on Thursday that the womans condition was still critical, and there was no way investigating officers could interrogate her.																								After registering a case, Thakurpukur police are on the lookout for the old womans assailants who had abandoned her in a Thakurpukur drain assuming that she had died from the multiple injuries she had suffered.																								She is still unconscious. As a result, we cant get from her a description of her attackers, said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta.

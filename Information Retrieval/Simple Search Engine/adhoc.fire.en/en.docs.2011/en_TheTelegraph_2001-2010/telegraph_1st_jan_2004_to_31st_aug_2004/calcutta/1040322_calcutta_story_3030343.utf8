The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 22, 2004  Calcutta Column

	A number of problems plague Metro Railway services. Compartment doors malfunction and the trains stop and start with a jerk. People use the station stairs to sit and idle away time. The Metro authorities should take steps. 
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 
	Some butchers in Howrahs Pilkhana Second Lane dump animal waste (rotten meat, excreta, bones) in the main sewerage line. The drain remains clogged and an unbearable stench fills the air. Will the PCB and the municipal corporation take measures?
	 K. Prosad, Howrah.

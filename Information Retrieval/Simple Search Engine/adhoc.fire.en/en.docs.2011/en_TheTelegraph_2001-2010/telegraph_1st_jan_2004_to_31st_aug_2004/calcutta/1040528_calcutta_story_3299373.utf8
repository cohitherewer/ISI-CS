The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 28, 2004 Life - Social RegisterCruises magic mix 
Himika Chaudhuri, Smita Roy Chowdhury The show-tending trio to perform at The Park from Friday night.  Tom Cruise as the sexy show-tender in the movie Cocktail inspired them to take up the profession of flair bartending. The chances of gaining popularity, the glamour and the fun of the job is what they came looking for. Today, as three of UKs top 15 flair bartenders, Miki, Perry and Ugo have shaken and stirred, tossed and twirled their dreams into reality.Out to tour the world and the most happening nightclubs, the trio has been travelling since April. After a stint in Japan and Thailand, they are now in Calcutta, before moving on to Australia, North and South America.We will perform at Tantra for a week from Friday, and will go by what the crowd wants, explains Ugo. Though they can indulge in a little light flirting with an interesting guest or get onto the bar top to do an impromptu gig in their home country, they want to test the city waters first before turning on the heat.It depends on how comfortable the guests are. Good bartending is not all about doing crazy things, its about doing what the guest wants, stresses Perry.But they are still all charged up about showing Calcutta some cool tricks behind the counter. We also want the citys party people to have the chance to try some really different cocktails, smile the three amigos.The showmen are optimistic about the Calcutta reception. We have heard that Tantra is one of the best nightclubs in India. So, we are here to see if the night life in the city matches international standards, explain the audacious Britons, throwing a challenge at party-happy Calcutta as they feasted on some kebabs and Bacardi on the rocks soon after they landed on Wednesday.Japan is where the night life is happening 24 hours a day. People just dont stop partying, says Perry who has won the TGIF (Thank God Its Friday) Best Bartender award this year.Miki, who has performed in Mumbai, Delhi and Jaipur in the past, is looking forward to serving it up in Calcutta from Friday onwards. Indian food and Indian women are just too good, he announced, biting into his fourth kebab. He and Ugo have bagged the Tandem Flair Championships 2003 in UK, which has, apparently, elevated them to celebrity bartender status.And even as they give the city the best they can on their maiden trip, the trio is also looking forward to picking up various aspects of the nightlife here, an experience that they might find handy the next time they come back.Diamond drip  Models flaunt the new diamond collection. Pictures by Rashbehari DasIf diamonds are a girls best friend, what better way to launch a new brand of diamond jewellery than to get some of the citys glam dolls to flaunt the sparkles. Thats precisely what Kabir Jewels Pvt Ltd, a Mumbai-based jewellery house, did when it launched its diamond-studded jewellery range called Vanshi on Thursday. The top bosses of the company who flew down to Calcutta for the launch at The Park didnt have much to say, and decided to let the jewellery do the talking instead.Looking stunning in a red and black sari set off by a heavy necklace, model Pinky said: The Vanshi range is stunning. And what I like about it is that it is not only beautiful, but very wearable too.The line includes three different ranges of necklaces, bracelets, rings and earrings for women. The traditional range, consisting of heavy pieces with diamonds and other precious stones, have a traditional Indian look, suited for special occasions. The contemporary range focusses on jewellery that can be worn with formal attire. The casual range, which also uses some semi-precious stones, is ideal for everyday wear. For men, apart from traditional rings and buttons, there are also belt-buckles, tie-pins and wrist-watches. Prices start at Rs 2,000.We have a team of professional and skilled jewellery designers who have done extensive research all over the country before coming up with the designs, said Dharmesh Vaghashia, director of the company. Our research in Calcutta shows that the market is upcoming. People are buying diamonds along with gold and there is also a lot of brand consciousness. Our designers also picked up some traditional designs from Bengal and worked on them. The range is meant for all segments and age groups, he added. Each piece comes with a buy-back and exchange policy.The company is planning to have a three-day exhibition in Calcutta soon to showcase the range of jewellery, after which it will be scouting for franchisees. We will showcase around 2,200 designs at the exhibition and plan to tie up with around 20 franchisees in the city, added Vaghashia.Home spun  Actor Rituparna Sen at the Nextiles launch. Picture by Rashbehari DasKhadi is not only about shapeless kurtas or a boring sling bag. Flaunt it at a nightclub, or wear it to an evening do. Make it into a stylised short shirt for the man or a kurti with embroidery for the woman. Reinvent the exotic side of the natural fabric. And grab them before the Armanis and the Versaces of the fashion world ship it into their workshops, put a tag on them and sell them for a bomb.These are few of the thoughts that were behind the conceptualisation of Nextiles, a design line of trendy and extremely affordable uppers with a young textile designer in the background.I have worked for an export house for four years and seen how the best natural fabrics from India are shipped out to the big design labels in the west and then imported back to India or bought by Indians abroad. That is when I decided that we need to do something in order to hold back the great treasure trove of fabrics, said Suchismita Dasgupta, the woman who is trying to give a little twist to the textile tale.And the reaction from potential clients at the launch of the line at Calcutta Rowing Club on Wednesday evening was proof enough that the concept had clicked. This is a very uncomplicated and wearable line. I particularly liked the linen shirts and booked myself one, said city musician Neel Adhikari. Food entrepreneur Naveen Pai, also at the launch, picked up a couple of khadi shirts. Actor and television anchor Rituparna Sen was bowled over by the linen dupattas, all in pastel shades and perfect for the slightly dressy look. The garments are all in khadi, cotton, linen or a blend of these.While the womens tops are on sale for anything between Rs 650 and Rs 1,950, the party-look crochet tops come for Rs 450 to Rs 650. Scarves in the range of Rs 298 to Rs 1,075 and mens wear for Rs 500 to Rs 950 are worth more than just a quick look.As neat as the clothes was the event, organised by Obhijit Das. Not only did Obhijit ensure that the audience was spared a predictable fashion show, he roped in the wonderfully talented Dhwani. The band wove the evening with some melodious numbers while bringing out the close resemblance of music between the east and the west.

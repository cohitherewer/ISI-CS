 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Mother beaten up on kidnapper cry
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rumours ran rife early on Wednesday: burkha-clad kidnappers had been sighted around some schools. Hours later, a mob even beat up a mother for plotting the abduction of a child. The tot was her own.																								Shaheeda Banu was pushed, slapped and punched for quite some time before the police came to her rescue.																								The incident took place in Mafiqul Islam Lane, in Beniapukur, when Banu went to a local school to fetch her seven-year-old daughter Rahema.																								A similar incident occurred barely 10 days ago, in which a mob all but beat up two women, believing they were out to kidnap children. The duo, also in burkhas, was detained by residents of the Karaya area while waiting in front of a school for their children. Both women were released after police verified their statements and residential addresses.																								These incidents seem to be a fall-out of a rumour that burkha-clad kidnappers are out to trap schoolchildren. The rumour is strong in some eastern pockets, said an officer of Beniapukur police station. The view was echoed by a Karaya thana officer.																								Trouble started for Shaheeda Banu, a resident of Gorachand Road, when she asked for directions to the school daughter Rahema studies in.																								It was the first day she was going to school to fetch her daughter, who studies in Class II. Usually, her husband goes, explained an officer of Beniapukur police station. Her husband went to Ranchi yesterday on some work.																								Banu was confused about the location of the school. She asked a number of people for directions. That gave rise to suspicion. The residents surrounded her and challenged her identity.																								Matters worsened when the mob asked Banu to raise her veil. She refused, and the mob tried to unveil her forcibly. Then started the assault.																								The police were called in. We rushed and rescued the woman, said a thana officer. We kept her in the police station and brought back Rahema from school. The child identified her mother, he added.																								A hunt is on for those behind the assault. All the people are from this locality. Arrests are expected soon, said the officer.																								Sanjay Mukherjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters) said: We have deployed men in plain clothes to monitor the schools and track down those responsible for spreading rumours. Legal action will be taken against them.

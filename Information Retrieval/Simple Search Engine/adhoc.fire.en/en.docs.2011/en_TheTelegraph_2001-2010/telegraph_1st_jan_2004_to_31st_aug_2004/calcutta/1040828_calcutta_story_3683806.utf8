 Saturday, August 28, 2004 Life Thai litchi in breakfast buffetHIMIKA CHAUDHURI Rambutan and mangosteen treat at Oberoi Grand. Picture by Rashbehari DasThe fruit basket on your breakfast table could soon be having lesser apples and bananas and more rambutan, mangosteen, longan and durian. Indeed, the exotic names from Thailand are all set to flood the Indian fruit market as early as next month.Following a reduction in import duties on 82 Thai items, among them five varieties of fruits, Calcutta is likely to taste more of the litchi look-alike rambutan than the homegrown varieties. A kilo of rambutan in Thailand is priced at 30 Baht, while mangosteen is available at 25 to 30 Baht for a kilo. 																					However, before the grocery shops from New Market to Maniktala come alive with the vibrant colours of the yummy fruits, star hotels are already offering a taste of the seasonal treats. Hyatt Regency and Oberoi Grand are the first to promote the fruits in association with the Thai Consulate in Calcutta. 																					The fruits are our gift to the citizens of Calcutta, smiled Thai consul-general Wanna Perngmark at Hyatt. 																					The gifts are malleable to concoct innovative mocktails as well as a straight bite into the sweet-tasting fleshy fruit of rambutan and the sweet and sour flavoured mangosteen. The fruits also make excellent dessert toppings as can be found out first hand at the three-day promotion at Hyatt beginning Friday. Guests can dig into the fruits as part of the usual buffet spreads at its restaurants or pamper their sweet tooth at the same time at Oberoi Grand that has a special dessert menu on till September 5. 																					The trade agreement between the two countries is an effort to strengthen the bond between Thailand and India and we are trying to play our part to perfection, said Praveen Chawla, general manager, Hyatt. 																					The Thai Consulate team in turn dropped by at the Waterside Caf, the coffee shop at the hotel, early Friday morning for a fruity breakfast washed down with mocktails prepared especially for the occasion. 																					The second meal of the day was savoured by the group at Oberoi Grand, where they were treated to an elaborate Thai lunch at Baan Thai, wrapped up with desserts prepared with the exotic fruits again. 																					Baan Thai is known for its authentic Thai cuisine, and now the fruits will add to the experience, smiled Amitabh Rai, general manager, Oberoi Grand.

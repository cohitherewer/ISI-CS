 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Residents trapped in building blaze
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A fire broke out on Friday evening on the fourth floor of a six-storeyed building on Darga Road, near Park Circus, leaving at least 60 people trapped in the office-cum-residential building for hours. 																								The residents could not come down the staircase as it was engulfed in smoke and heat. Finally, around 9 pm, a hydraulic platform was used to bring residents down from the terrace to safety. 																								No one was reported injured, though many complained of suffocation after remaining stuck on the terrace in the smoke. 																								Earlier, when the fire began to spread, people from the fourth and fifth floors, including women and children, climbed up to the buildings terrace. 																								Fire-fighters kept spraying water on the metal staircase at the rear of the building to keep it cool and help people use it later to climb down. 																								Local people alleged that fire service officials did not use ladders to help people come out of the building. However, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), Ranveer Kumar, said: It was impossible to use ladders, as the fire originated in the fourth floor of the building. The firefighters are trying their best, he assured.																								The fire originated in a factory for leather handbags  Afro-Arts  located on the buildings fourth floor. The building houses a number of offices and three residential flats. The owner of the building stays in one. There is also a newspaper office on the ground floor of the building, a fire services official said.																								People from the top floor noticed smoke around 6 pm and they tried to extinguish the fire themselves. When that did not work, we called in fire services personnel, a resident of the building said. 																								Though the fire was brought under control within two hours, the building kept breaking out in flames all over again. Firefighters suspected that this was because toxic substances, including chemicals from the factory, repeatedly caught fire. 																								At least 500 people and three families  including that of the owner  were present in the house when the fire broke out. 																								While the residents on the lower floors came rushing out, at least 60 people, most of whom were present in the fourth, fifth and sixth floors of the building, got trapped and took shelter on the terrace. The 500 people working in shops and offices housed in the building also stay there. 																								With smoke belching out from the building, a crowd gathered for a glimpse, closing the congested Darga Road to traffic. 																								Asked if the leather handbags-manufacturing factory had a licence to run the unit in a residential and commercial building, Kumar said: This aspect will surely be verified.

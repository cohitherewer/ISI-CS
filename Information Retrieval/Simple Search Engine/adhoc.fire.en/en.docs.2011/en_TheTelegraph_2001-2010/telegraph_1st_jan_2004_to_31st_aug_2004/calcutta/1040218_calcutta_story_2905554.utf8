 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Medicine stock at mouse click
 																											- Hospital drug stores to go online for rational use and distribution SUVRO ROY																								The state government has decided to connect the medicine stores in hospitals and drug shops in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal through computers to keep tabs on their stocks and to ensure rational use and distribution. 																								The move comes in the wake of health officials noticing a glut of a particular medicine in one hospital, while it was scarce in another. So, we need a system by which a click of the mouse will allow us to keep tabs on the stocks of life-saving drugs and other medicines at the Central Medical Stores at Sealdah and in all the medical colleges and district hospitals, said Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services, on Tuesday. 																								Work to bring the medicine stores online will begin early next month and take about two months to complete. The project will cost over Rs 1 crore.																								Senior demonstrators in practical pharmacy will oversee the feeding of continuous data on medicines in the computers in the medical colleges and hospitals in Calcutta, while in the districts, the job will be supervised by the deputy chief medical officer of health (I). 																								Health officials said computers will be installed in the medicine stores of all seven medical colleges, 19 district hospitals, drug shops in 19 districts and a few sub-divisional hospitals.																								So, even while sitting in our office in Salt Lake, we will know what the stock position is of life-saving drugs in our hospitals. If we find amoxycillin is in short supply at National Medical College and Hospital and there is a surplus of the drug in SSKM, we can have the stock diverted, said health services director Chatterjee. Similarly, medicines can be sent from one district hospital to another. 																								Health officials said the online system will also help them monitor the expiry dates of medicines. Large quantities of medicine that have crossed their expiry dates have often had to be destroyed in hospitals because we we did not know where they were needed. The online system will give us every detail about the medicines and help us relocate them, an official said. 																								The health services director felt the system would also help the government keep a vigil on whether drugs were being procured as per the rules  of high-cost, medium-cost and low-cost medicines. 																								Chatterjee, however, said that when the stocks of medicines will be monitored, special care will be taken to ensure that each hospital maintains a sufficient buffer stock of three to four weeks. Maintaining a buffer stock is essential, because in the districts, transporting medicine from one hospital to another takes time, he pointed out.

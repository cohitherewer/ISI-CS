 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Tests point to cholera outbreak
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tests conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases have revealed that nearly all the patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital at Beleghata following the gastro-enteritis outbreak in several parts of Calcutta were victims of cholera.																								A report submitted to the state health department by the institute says that as much as 99 per cent of the over 1,500 patients admitted to the ID Hospital between April 5 and 17  the period during which the spate of casualties was the most  were suffering from diarrhoea caused by the vibrio cholerae 01 bacteria.																								Hundreds of residents in the congested slum areas of Narkeldanga, Rajabazar, Tangra and Beniapukur had to be rushed to the hospital with symptoms of severe dehydration and stomach upset following consumption of contaminated piped water provided by the Corporation.																								Meanwhile, the hepatitis outbreak in the South Dum Dum Municipality has been confirmed as being caused by the Hepatitis E virus, which is also transmitted through polluted water or food. Tests on blood samples collected from affected persons have revealed this.																								Hepatologist Abhijit Choudhury of SSKM Hospital, who has been deputed by the health department to supervise intervention measures in the affected areas, said on Saturday that even now, 15 new cases were being detected every day. It will take another four or five days for the incidence to come down. At the peak of the outbreak, as many as 48 residents of south Dum Dum had been detected with the disease.																								The route of infection for both gastro-enteritis and cholera is the same: the faeco-oral route. Experts explained that unhygienic habits, like taking meals near toilets, lead to contamination of both food and water. 																								Doctors at the ID hospital, however, point out that most of the patients admitted got the infection through polluted water. Sewage water, leaking through damaged pipes, had mixed with filtered drinking water.																								Though the symptoms and treatment for attacks of gastro-enteritis and cholera are the same, an infection from the latter could be fatal if medication is not provided. The antibiotic, tetracycline, is the drug of choice.																								Health department officials, however, say that cholera is usual in Calcutta with the onset of summer and the number of admissions was coming down.

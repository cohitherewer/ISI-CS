Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: We are planning to sell our existing four-storied house and buy a smaller one with a garden, which would also house my office. Please suggest how to go about it smoothly. I am doing good business but I lost quite a bit of money recently due to some problems with my staff and clients. Also, my domestic help doesnt last long. Please suggest remedies.																								SB																								A: North-west is associated with mentors and helpful people. Asking for help from this area of your house can solve any problem one has in life. 																								Paste the photograph of your existing house in the north-west corner of your bedroom. Place a sticker on it and write SOLD in capital letters and the owner of the property should sign in an upward direction. Adjacent to it, paste another picture of your dream house with a beautiful garden from any magazine with a sticker saying BOUGHT. As far as your domestic help is concerned, it is best to treat them well so that they serve you better. House hunting? Put up a pretty picture for best results, advises Feng Shui. (ReutersQ: Feng Shui fascinates me and I would like to know more about it. Can you please suggest a basic book for beginners? I would like to learn about its basic principles to be able to apply it in my day-to-day life. In the meantime, can you please advise me on the following: My date of birth is 18.10.1967 and that of my husband is 12.02.1958. I would like to know what our respective elements and lucky colours are. 																								Anuradha Dhuliya, via e-mail																								A: Feng Shui is certainly a very fascinating science and you can learn a lot from my book Change Your Life The Feng Shui Way (Rupa Publications). It contains a wealth of information on every aspect of your life whether it is health, wealth, career, education, marriage or relationships.																								According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak wood person. You need a lot of nourishment and strength from the water element. Hence, blue, black and shades of green are favourable for you. Your husband is a strong metal person who needs to be balanced with water and wood elements. Since both of you share the same elements, this should be the right colour scheme of your bedroom.																								Q: Is it a good idea to use box beds? Someone advised me that the clutter inside the bed causes disturbances in the sleep pattern and I must admit I do have nightmares! But then in modern housing it is not quite possible to do without them as well, space being at a premium. So, can you please devise a Feng Shui trick to get around the problem?																								Kunal Roy, Beleghata 																								A: Feng Shui advises against having bed boxes, because they look like coffins. However, with space constraints it sometimes becomes necessary to store household items there. In that case, it is best to keep fresh bed and bath linen there. Avoid keeping dirty clothes, shoes, heavy metallic items, mops etc., in or under these boxes. The negative energy emitted from these items deprives us of quality sleep, which we deserve after a hard days work. 																								Q: I am a student of Class X and will be appearing for my board exams soon (DOB: 24.09.1988). My study table faces the east and is placed against the bathroom wall in the north-western corner of the room. After reading one of your articles I realised this position could affect my studies. Please advise me on how to alter the present position so that I can do well in my exams. 																								Name and address withheld																								A: If the study table touches the bathroom wall it tends to absorb its negativity. Moreover, it is difficult to concentrate in the north-west corner because the area is known for a lot of movement. Relocate the table against the south-west corner and you will instantly feel the difference. Keep facing east as this direction is associated with personal development.

 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Drugs sell briskly under police nose
 DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY																								Right under the nose of the city police, drug-pushers offer their varied stock-in-trade  it comes with the assurance that it is the best available at the intersection of Deshapran Sashmal Road-Prince Anwar Shah Road, in south Calcutta.																								The peddlers operate on the main road, about half a minutes walk from Charu Market police station, and they never could have got away with it without the blessings of a section of the police force. 																								The entire area has earned such notoreity that a local school, affiliated to the Indian Council of Secondary Education, has had to shift out. The schools authorities said: Drug peddling in the area is one of the main reasons why we had to move out. It was in consideration of the childrens future.																								Although police undertook measures to stop the menace following protests from local residents a fortnight ago, the peddlers are now out on bail. So, drug-pushers like Namita Sarkar, Laltu Das, Sona, Pintu Datta, Netai Ghosh and Fandi carry on their trade with impunity. Namita is the woman who runs the show and hands out the regular payments to some policemen. Such an organised racket cannot possibly thrive without the blessings of local politicians either, said a police officer.																								The drug racket thrives in the area without much resistance because Gobinda Banerjee Lane is partly under the jurisdiction of Regent Park police station, in the South 24-Parganas police area, and partly under Charu Market thana of Calcutta Police.																								So, if chased by the police from South 24-Parganas, all a criminal has to do is to walk over to the city police area. In case of complaints from local people, officers of Charu Market police station pass the buck on Regent Park police station and vice versa. 																								A local businessman said the racket has been in operation for more than a decade but police do nothing except to make some routine arrests. Here one will get ganja, charas and other drugs quite easily. All these items are sold in packets and daily sales exceed Rs 1 lakh, he added. Usually, the stocks come from Nepal, Manipur and Bihar and drugs are supplied to different areas of Bengal. Here, peddlers are engaged both in wholesale and retail business. 																								When the situation becomes quite unbearable, we complain to the police. They make some arrests but what is most disconcerting is that the arrested men come out and start their business within a fortnight with renewed vigour, said a local resident.																								Apart from a section of policemen, some local political leaders, too, shield these peddlers. They come and collect their haftas (weekly payments) quite openly. So, no one dare protest, the resident added.																								Deputy superintendent of police (Town) of South 24-Parganas Humayun Kabir said raids are conducted in the area from time to time and arrests are made. But the problem is that no one can be imprisoned for a long time unless one is arrested with at least 21 kg of ganja in his possession. Similarly, for every drug, there are certain specifications without which an arrested person cannot be kept in the lock-up for a long time, he said.																								Deputy commissioner of police (South) Anuj Sharma said he was aware of the problem. We conduct raids jointly with Regent Park police station and make arrests. However, the raids should be continuous, he said.																								Officer-in-charge of Charu Market police station Subrata Banerjee said the spot where the drugs are peddled is looked after by Regent Park police station. However, we help them whenever they approach us, he added.

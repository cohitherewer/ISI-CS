The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 India shines in designer shimmer
Face of Fashion Kiran Uttam Ghosh A model sports a Kiran Uttam Ghosh creation at the Lakm eacute; India Fashion Week in New Delhi. (PTI)It all started over an innocent lunch at the Taipan in Delhi. I was lunching with two old Calcutta friends of mine  Iram Mukherjee and Swapan Seth.																								Quite accidentally, the topic swerved towards The Lakm India Fashion Week and Swapan lamented how most of fashion and indeed fashion shows lacked a cohesive, consumer-centric marketing idea.																								Thats when we hit upon India Shining.																								Swapans idea was quite simple. India is Shining in various spheres  IT, economy and cinema. Even cricket, where Sourav Ganguly and his men had essayed a heroic win against the Aussies. Thereafter, destiny played the Pied Piper. Elections were announced. Kiran Mazumdar became the beacon of biotech and Gangulys gang plundered Pakistan.																								In his fantastic book, Fashion Today, Colin McDowell says that fashion must be societys servant and messenger. The only reason why I felt that a theme such as India Shining was powerful was because it was a relevant statement that could be made by fashion. The fact is that Indian fashions only hope is its Indianness. That, in my estimation, will separate the men from the boys.																								The opportunity was in interpreting fashion in terms of IT, economy, cinema, politics as well as agriculture. Thats when my task began. In hindsight, it turned out to be great fun.																								Since marketing and not meenawork was to be the axis of my existence this year, we got into the act with aplomb. We sent off bookmarks as direct mailers asking people to bookmark April 29, 2004, the day of my show. Sooner than expected, the calendar showed April 27.																								I arrived in Delhi with absolutely no idea about what the audio-visual would be or how the music would sound. On the night of April 28, we trudged into a studio post-midnight and brainstormed details of the music. It began with Nehrus Tryst with Destiny, and then morphed into the sound of the Internet connection signifying how as a nation we had travelled through technologys corridors. Then it took off with Indian chants that morphed into Dil cheez kya hai from Umrao Jaan that trailed into Sarah Brightmans Take my breath away This was followed by Its the Time to Disco which then morphed into Lagaan. Finally, we closed it with Nanha Munna Rahi Hoon from Son of India. Before, of course, a smashing techno take on Vande Mataram.																								The AV was equally retro looking. Shots of Gandhi, Nehru, Vajpayee, Narayan Murthy, Sourav, Amitabh, people and moments that have made our country proud, all culminating in India Shining.																								On the day of the show, surprisingly I was calm as hell. Come 4.30 pm, the auditorium was handed over to me. One hour to fine tune a show without any rehearsal. I walked into the show area and watched as my team of friends placed flags of India on every seat. Another juggled with the projector positions. A third struggled to judge how my props would get onto the ramp. A fourth, my assistant, ran helter skelter to get the 16 models dressed in time. I sat on the stairs with tears in my eyes... I was truly blessed.																								At 6.45 pm, the crowds came in. In a business where the front row is the fulcrum of ones ability, I had a row to die for. Gautam Singhania, Ritu Kumar, Sabina Singh, polo prince Adhiraj Singh, Colin McDowell (his presence at LIFW this year and at my show was destiny, considering I had quoted him extensively in my concept note) and of course all my friends. Andaleeb Rana from Pakistan cheered and whistled holding up the Indian flag perched high on her hairdo.																								When the lights went out, the hooting happened. 																								I had a male model take off his India T-Shirt a la Sourav and fling it into the crowd. I had shoes made out of CDs, film rolls, bags made out of gamchas.																								Backstage, I could hear it all. The wild rooting, whistling. For a moment, the tiredness disappeared. For a second, the stress evaporated. For a nanosecond, I loved what I did.																								For me, April 29, 2004 was a time to disco.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Spreading the word about the scourge
 															- AIDS campaign at Maidan Mela				 	 File picture of a street play to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS																								It was a chilly January evening, with people streaming in and out of Vidyasagar Mela, on the Maidan. There were plenty of stalls, of food and fun, and families with grandparents and children out for some holiday entertainment. But there was one stall that was not just spreading good cheer, but also the word of awareness and prevention from a deadly disease.																								What drew the crowds to the West Bengal AIDS Prevention Cell corner, in association with banglanatak.com, were the games organised at the stall. The first round involved a question-answer session on HIV/AIDS. There was nothing technical, like t-cells and medication, but simple information, such as it doesnt hurt to touch an HIV-infected person.																								Earlier, people wouldnt know the answer to a simple question like, can you get AIDS from a mosquito bite, explained Subhro Majumdar, who has been working on the project for the past three years. But this time, most people knew the answer, which shows that the knowledge level has increased. Not all could explain why it is so, but the basic point that you have to watch out for malaria, not AIDS, after being bitten by a mosquito, has percolated down to the masses.																								The advantage at the mela, said Rahul Roy, another member of the team, is that there was a multitude of people, from villagers to urbane youth. And it was the young  school students, college-goers and newly-marrieds  who made their way to the stall and were not as shy or embarrassed to talk about AIDS as was the case a few years ago, added Roy.																								The stall might not have attracted too many eager visitors at all times, but the message was one that people seem to be heeding, felt Majumdar. The means they use is not just the printed word, but also games, quizzes and the audio-visual medium, via the stage.																								The centre of attraction through the three days, from December 31 to January 2, was the gambhira gaan programme, a theatre style that originated in Midnapore as a tool to propagate awareness on important social issues. 																								While the initial response to the actors on stage drew attention, the topic was often too taboo to handle for some. The short play, by the troupe of six from Malda, was repeated several times for four hours each evening.																								For the individuals involved in the campaign, it was gratifying just to know that awareness is rising.						 NISHA LAHIRI

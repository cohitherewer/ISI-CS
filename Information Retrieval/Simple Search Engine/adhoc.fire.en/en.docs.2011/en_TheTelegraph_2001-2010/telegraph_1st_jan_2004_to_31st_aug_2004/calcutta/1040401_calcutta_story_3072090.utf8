 A STAFF REPORTER																								What started as a quarrel among three friends took a tragic turn. 																								By the end of it on Wednesday afternoon, one of the teenagers was admitted with serious burns to NRS Medical College and Hospital and another ended up behind bars for attempted murder. Police said a hunt is on for the third youth.																								The trio was sitting at a tea-stall on DC Dey Road, in the Tangra area, when the friendly banter turned serious. Mahindra Prasad and Sajid ganged up against Mohammad Sajjad. They assaulted him and when he returned the blows, they picked up a pot from the clay oven and poured boiling water on him.																								Sajjad was rushed to hospital. Sajid was rounded up from home later. Prasad is absconding.

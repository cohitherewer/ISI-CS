 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 The world of magic reality
																								Tapas Sarkar is a renowned sculptor. He sculpts with light fingers, creating a fluidity in form; a mood, a celebration, a moment of truth caught in eternity. Whether big or small, his sculptures reflect the quality of the abstract and the modern, while remaining stylistically akin to the traditional and the tribal. In his sculpture, the overall impact of the work is more important than the minute details in the forms created. He blends power with subtlety in his works to create perfect harmony and balance that lend his sculptures a rare elegance. Sarkars magic fingers are equally deft in creating mesmerising drawings and paintings as is evident in the current exhibition. His works in black and white, as in colour, display a unique three-dimensional quality normally associated with sculptures. Unlike his sculptures, he painstakingly produces the finest details like a filigree master when he holds a pen or a brush. Heavily stylised, minutely detailed and full of grandeur, he creates an aura of magic reality that makes us see his figures as sculpted paintings. 																								When: Till January 18; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Vikalp Art Shop, Swabhumi

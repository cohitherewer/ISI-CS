 Feng Shui / Pinky KapoorQ: My son will be appearing for his ICSE examinations soon and is finding it very hard to concentrate and study for long hours at night. Could you please suggest some Feng Shui tips for students, so that they do well in their exams?																								Sujata Dey, Calcutta																								A: Burning a candle has an extremely peaceful effect and helps one focus his or her energies on one particular thing. Therefore, keep a candle burning on a students study table to help him burn the midnight oil and concentrate more on his studies. Ideally, the candle should be kept in the north-east side of the table as this is connected with education.Q: We have been married for the last two years but thus far, ours has not been a very happy marriage. We always seem to argue about petty issues and try to patch up later. A large area of our homes south-west sector is cut and I wonder if this may be the reason for our quarrels. Do we have to shift to another house in order to improve our relationship?																								Name and address withheld																								A: It is very rare to find a house that is absolutely perfect as far as Feng Shui is concerned, and even rarer to find happy families with no problems at all. Since both of you realise that your tiffs are about petty matters, it is best to resolve these problems first rather than switch homes. To make your house more Feng Shui friendly, you should introduce a strong light in the south-west area of the house to uplift the energy associated with this sector. Further, enhance the south-west of your bedroom with a bunch of yellow flowers that are symbolic of joy and warmth. A laughing Buddha symbolises happiness and contentment and when placed in the south-west, creates good vibes. A pair of doves placed in the south-west corner of your bedroom will bring peace, love, patience and understanding, besides enhancing your marital happiness. Connect yourself with whatever you place in the house, because it is your positive attitude and belief that will ensure cordial relations in your marriage. To enhance a marital relationship, place yellow flowers and a laughing Buddha in the south-west sector of the houseQ: I am 35-years-old born on March 14, 1969 and have not yet found a suitable partner. My parents are really worried about this as well. Please let me know if I can do something in the house to enhance my marriage prospects. At present, I am occupying a large bedroom that extends from the south-west to the north-west of the house and I sleep in the south-west sector. 																								M. Agarwal, Calcutta																								A: To begin with, divide the room into two sections, either with a brick wall or a wooden partition and begin sleeping in the north-west. According to Feng Shui, it is not advisable for unmarried girls to sleep in the south-west sector of the house. This is because the south-west is ruled by earth energy and since the earth has great gravitational pull, it grounds the person occupying this room to such an extent that moving out from here becomes difficult. On the other hand, the north-west sector has tremendous movement and is ideal for unmarried girls. The north-east, west, north-west and south-west are your favourable directions, as derived from your date of birth. The north-west in particular, is your nien-yen or personal marriage direction. So start sleeping in this part of the bedroom and create a cosy corner with pictures of couples and an aeroplane taking off, to attract marriage proposals. Placing a metal clock with a pendulum here will also help to bring about movement. Remember to face this direction when prospective husbands come to meet you. Q: My husband started a new business but incurred heavy losses. As a result, he is unable to repay his debts and has gone into a deep depression. Please guide me as to what changes we can make in the house to improve his business and mental state.																								Name and address withheld																								A: Please check the south-east area of your house as it is related with wealth. You must get rid of any clutter in this sector and remove anything that is negative such as bins, brooms or mops. Place a healthy green plant here along with a water feature containing three silver or regular coins. Add a fresh glass of water to it everyday. Start keeping money in the south-east cupboard that opens towards the north. The north is associated with business and when these cupboards open towards the north, funds start flowing in from the business. Your wealth area should never remain empty and always contain some money to ensure that more wealth is attracted towards it.Picture by Rashbehari Das

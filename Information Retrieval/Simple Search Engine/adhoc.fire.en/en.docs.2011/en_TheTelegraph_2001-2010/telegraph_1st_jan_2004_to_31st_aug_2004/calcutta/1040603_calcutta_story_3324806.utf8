 Thursday, June 03, 2004  The City Diary
																																																		Four days after her gruesome killing on the Maidan, the identity of the victim, in her mid- 20s, has yet to be established. Officers of Maidan police station on Wednesday made several attempts to find out who the woman was, but all their efforts proved futile. They displayed photographs of the victim in housing estates in the adjoining police station areas, but no one could recognise her. What is confusing the investigators further is that no missing diary has been filed in any police station across the city.																																																		Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, at a pre-budget meeting with trade union leaders on Wednesday, announced that there would be no downsizing of the civic workforce and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was not looking at any voluntary retirement scheme. The meeting was convened by Mukherjee to dispel union fears that the CMC was set to introduce the scheme as part of its capacity-building programme, with a financial grant from the British government. 																																																		Traffic was badly affected in Howrah on Wednesday by twin roadblocks. Youth Congress activists squatted on Howrah-Amta Road, near Domjur, in protest against CPM atrocities in the area. They alleged that a group of CPM cadres had set their party flag on fire a few days ago and even after lodging a specific complaint, no action was taken against the culprits. Congress activists blocked traffic on JN Mukherjee Road, near Kalitala, in protest against the sudden closure of Hanuman Jute Mill. They were demanding immediate reopening of the mill. Both blockades were withdrawn after senior police officers intervened.																																																		A motorcyclist was seriously injured on Wednesday when his two-wheeler skidded on Taratala Road after dashing into a bicyclist. The 35-year-old motorcyclist, identified as Ayub Khan, was admitted to Calcutta Medical Research Institute. The cyclist, Arabindo Mandal, escaped unhurt.																																																		The CMDA will conduct an inspection with the railways and the transport department to assess the requirements of the proposed truck terminal at Chitpur. CMDA chief executive officer Alapan Bandopadhyay said a few roads would have to be upgraded to meet the requirements, once the terminal opens in early 2005. 																																																		A 35-year old man, Lab Mondal, poisoned his son Taron before killing himself at Malipara, in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Wednesday. Police said that Lab, father of three children, had a quarrel with his wife Sandhya on Tuesday. Sandhya left home with their other son and daughter after the quarrel.																																																		An elderly woman was crushed under the wheels of a private bus on route 222 near Prabhat cinema, on Chittaranjan Avenue, around 6.50 pm on Wednesday. Witnesses were divided in their description of the accident, police said. The woman either fell off the bus and was run over, or was hit from behind by the vehicle. The driver of the bus fled, leaving the vehicle behind, which was impounded at Jorasanko police station.																																																		The civic conservancy department has decided to crack down on offenders littering the roads from next week. Mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb said that in some pockets of south Calcutta and Burrabazar, households were dumping garbage in packets on the road, instead of handing it over to the sweepers. The minimum cash fine for littering a road will be Rs 50.																																																		Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Subrata Mukherjee will visit the CMCs water supply augmentation projects at Bansdroni, Ranikuthi, Kasba and Palta on Saturday. The projects are to be ready in July-end.To Prayasam for conducting awareness camps in Kamarhati on improving the condition of government primary schools

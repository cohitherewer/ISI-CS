The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Test centre deadline Test unit upgrade
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE AND JAYANTA BASU																								The state transport department has called for the upgrade of auto emission testing centres by August 31, a month ahead of the October 1 deadline set by the Centre and the Calcutta High Court.																								Equipment specifications having just come in with the transport department notice, dated July 28, none of the 130 testing centres in the city have upgraded so far. 																								Now, it will be a scramble to meet the deadline and submit a compliance report to the public vehicles department (PVD), regional transport authority and the Pollution Control Board (PCB) by September 7.																								We didnt know which machines to instal, as we had not received any information from the Centre, said PVD director H. Mohan. 																								Now, test centres are left with four weeks to buy the necessary machinery. The mandatory requirements include:Opacimeters for diesel vehicles with rotation per minute (RPM) and lubricating oil temperature sensors Computer, web camera, software and printer that can be connected with the opacimeter, one gas analyser Gas analysers for petrol vehicles that can test for exhaust gases like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, oxygen and carbon dioxide as soon as government-approved equipment is available Provision of networking among the testing centres and regional transport authorities.																								It may be tough for the centres, but there is no alternative, said Asim Banerjee, secretary of the auto emission testing centres union.																								The PCB has trained about 300 operators in north Bengal, Durgapur and Calcutta who will be using the new machines. Apart from the four-gas analyser, which awaits central approval, everything else is already in the market. 																								Details of computers and networking have been discussed with Webel, added a PCB official.																								Once the compliance reports come in, our officials will issue a fresh licence to centres, explained PCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar. 																								But, after the deadline, pollution under control (PUC) certificates cannot be issued on the basis of tests conducted on old machines, and without these certificates, no vehicle can ply in the city (at least on paper).																								Existing machines can, apparently, be upgraded by installing parts to measure respirable particulate matter (RPM) and engine oil temperature, as well as a computer and web camera. This, experts estimate, could come at an investment of Rs 35,000 to Rs 45,000, while the cost of a new machine is nearly Rs 6 lakh.																								The new machine is not easily available in the market. But new norms can be followed at a much lower cost, stressed A. Poddar of a Bangalore-based emission testing machine company.

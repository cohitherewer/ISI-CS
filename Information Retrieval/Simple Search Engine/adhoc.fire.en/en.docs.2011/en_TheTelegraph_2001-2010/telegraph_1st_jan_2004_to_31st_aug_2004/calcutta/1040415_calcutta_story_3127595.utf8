 Leaping and licking: The flames that destroyed Firpos I would like to refute the general misconception that ICSE and CBSE board examinations are very easy and marks are awarded very leniently (Examinees fall ill, doctor not found, March 12). Each time there is a tough paper from either of the West Bengal boards of examinations, there is a lot of hue and cry. Does anyone care to note that this year the ISC mathematics paper had two in-correct questions? Why is it that while the West Bengal board students are pampered, the state doesnt spare a thought for us? We also work hard but in spite of that, the cut-off marks required for us to get admitted in local colleges is much higher. We wish the system would not take a step-motherly attitude towards us and treat us on a par with students studying under the local boards. Debolina Sengupta, 
Address not given. The mayors decision to allow reconstruction of the Firpos market and restore its original structure (Mayor nod for as-it-was Firpos, March 15) is quite reasonable. All those who lost their jobs or businesses in the fire should be resettled. Usually, after a market place is ruined by a fire, the area is used to build a multi-storeyed commercial complex. This trend must be changed. Otherwise, more and more buildings will be destroyed by sabotage to serve the interests of landowners and promoters. Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
Behala. The change in the mayors stance regarding reconstruction of the market will definitely raise a few eyebrows. It may be said that the mayor has bowed to pressure from promoters in order to brighten his prospects in the forthcoming elections. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town. The report Twins ring up dues in crores, March 12, is one-sided. There are defaulters who are not paying their outstanding bills. But what is BSNL doing about refunds to former subscribers? There are lakhs of such cases where the security money alongwith an interest at the rate of 11 per cent per annum have not been refunded for years. Many such cases are also pending before the consumer forums. B.P. Choudhury, 
Narkelbagan. One feels ashamed to read of the harassment caused to UK-based writer Christopher Eager seeking an appointment with the transport minister (Foreign writer suffers Writers block, March 15). When a famous author was kept waiting for three hours on a hot sultry afternoon, one shudders to think how common people are treated by the Left Front government. Chandan Ray, 
Sarsuna Apropos the report Boy bias in custody queue, March 16, it is sad to note that a gender bias exists even today. Abortion of the female foetus is nothing less than a crime. While women are rapidly progressing in all spheres, most people are still averse to the idea of giving birth to a girl child or even adopting one. Unless our attitude towards the girl child changes, society will fail to make meaningful progress. Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
Nayapatty Road Like all other goods, education is also a commodity that can be exchanged for money (Seven years after, leak blot rerun, March 16). So, it is not surprising that the mathematics paper has been leaked. Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
Beleghata Apropos the information published in Metro Guide, Birla Academy of Art and Culture does not conduct any dance and music classes. There is an institution of the Birla group named Swar Sangam which conducts these classes on the academy premises. Its number is 2464-8215. Archana Roy,
Director, Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture

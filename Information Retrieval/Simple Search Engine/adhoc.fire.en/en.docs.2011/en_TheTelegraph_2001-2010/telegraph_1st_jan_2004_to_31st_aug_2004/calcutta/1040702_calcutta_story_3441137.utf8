The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Monsoon painting
																								Art needs no excuse to be where it is. It can flourish in the most unlikely places and may very well be triggered off by the uncanniest of situations. The seasons, as we know them, have for long inspired artists to undo the fetters of their minds and let forth a flourish of the aesthetic sense that revels in the beauty and freshness of every changing season. The monsoons in Calcutta have always provided that much-needed relief from the harrowing summer heat. This year being no different, it is only fitting that Gallery Kanishkas has decided to celebrate the Calcutta monsoons. The ongoing exhibition got off to a thundering start with a workshop on umbrella painting, which was organised by Gallery Kanishkas together with Hyatt Regency, Calcutta. The paintings on display are based on the theme of the monsoons and showcase the works of two promising artists, Ashis Kirtania and Subhashish Saha, whose painting appears above.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings																								When: Till July 10; 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindustan Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 2007 target for Setu twin
 A STAFF REPORTER			Vivekananda bridge II will straddle the Hooghly by 2007.																								Already under construction, the Rs 650-crore bridge, once complete, will help reduce traffic congestion in northern parts of the city, the government announced on Thursday.																								The tollway will be built 50 metres downstream from the existing Vivekananda bridge. It will connect Delhi Road, on the western banks of the river, with PWD Road on the Calcutta side.																								We have approved the project, which has been mainly designed by Consulting Engineering Services. Work will be carried out by Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T), said B.K. Sadhu, chief traffic and transportation engineer, transport department.																								According to a senior official of the transport department, the project has been undertaken by the Second Vivekananda Bridge Tollway Company (SVBTC), a consortium of engineering and construction firms, and will be funded under a private-public partnership.																								We agreed to hand over the project on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis for a period of 15 years, the official said.																								The 6.1-km, 29-metre-wide, six-lane tollway  including the 0.88-km cable-supported stretch across the river, the ramps and the approach road  will be the largest transportation project in eastern India.																								The 1.56-km approach road to the bridge will provide the link to Belghoria Expressway, the airport, Salt Lake, Rajarhat and the northern parts of the city through BT Road. The 3.67-km approach road on the Howrah side will link up with Durgapur Expressway and the national highway network, said S.S. Chakraborty, SVBTC chairman.																								The bridge is projected to bear a load of 40,000 vehicles every 12 hours. The plan to construct this bridge was conceived in 1992, keeping in mind the enormous vehicular traffic that passes through the existing bridge constructed in December 1931, added Chakraborty.																								The new bridge will also make a difference to the North Bengal and Bangladesh-bound traffic. These vehicles need not enter the city at all, said Jay Ved, co-chairman and chief executive officer of Pacific Alliance Group.																								J. Ganguly, director of SVBTC and vice-president of L amp;T, said the project, ready to hit fast-track basis in 36 months, will be completed on time.

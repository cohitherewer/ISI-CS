The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Metro link benefit for district commuter 
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 																								To allow office-goers commuting from as far as Burdwan and Hooghly to avail of Metro Railway services, Eastern Railway has made special arrangements so that local trains reach Dum Dum station faster.																								Railway officials said though daily commuters from the districts would like to catch the Metro, they are unwilling to do so because the tracks leading to Dum Dum are clogged with goods trains.																								The railway authorities have decided to take goods trains off from a stretch between Dankuni and Central Chord (CC) Link, on the Sealdah-Dankuni section (there are 20 pairs of EMUs on this section), so that the locals reach Dum Dum faster. 																								The movement of trains is expected to make notable improvements between Bally Halt and Dum Dum.																								Officials said that by withdrawing the goods trains and diverting them through a railway flyover that is rarely in use, the tracks would clear up. 																								This will immensely benefit about a million passengers from Burdwan, Bandel and Tarakeswar, all willing to avail of the Metro. 																								Now, local trains will not be held up for long hours and they wont crawl behind slow-moving goods trains, said S.R. Thakur, chief operations manager of Eastern Railway.																								Officials said on an average, a passenger targeting Dum Dum from Palla Road or Kalna, in Burdwan, and Haripal or Panduah, in Hooghly, to reach Tollygunge, Bhowanipore or Shyambazar by Metro would save about two hours. 																								All the passengers will have to do is get off at Bally, walk up to the Bally Halt station overhead and board another local train to Dum Dum. It takes only 18 minutes to reach Dum Dum from Bally Halt if the tracks are not blocked by goods trains, said an official. A railway flyover constructed by the British between Dankuni and CC Link (west) cabin would be used to divert the goods trains.																								Local trains crawled behind goods trains owing to lack of co-ordination between Howrah and Sealdah divisions  and not because of the high frequency of goods trains. We plan to introduce two or three more local trains for the benefit of passengers, said Thakur.

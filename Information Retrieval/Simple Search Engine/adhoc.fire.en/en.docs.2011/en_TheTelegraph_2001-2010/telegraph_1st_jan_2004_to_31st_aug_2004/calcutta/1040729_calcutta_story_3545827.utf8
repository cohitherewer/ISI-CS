 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 The magic of black and white
																								Black and white - perhaps the most solemn colours in the spectrum, colours that pale in comparison with the brilliant hues of red and green and blue. Yet it is this very sedateness associated with black and white that lends them the poignancy that grants grandeur to art. Jahangir, a photographer with an avid passion for the lens, has captured Paris, a city renowned for a vibrancy that is infectious, in the stark shades of black and white. And the photographs are all the more engaging by virtue of the pronounced absence of the colourful glitter that is synonymous with Parisian life. In capturing his images in black and white, Jahangir has lent them an air of romantic serenity that finds its subtlest expression in the photographs on display at the exhibition.																								Event: An exhibition of photographs by Jahangir																								When: Till July 30; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Metropolitan Art Salon, Suite 18, 3rd floor, 7 Jawaharlal Nehru Road

 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Law rues lack of rule of law
 															- High court orders harass case to be taken away from errant cop OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court appears convinced that there is no rule of law in the state.																								Agreeing with every aspect of an interim verdict recently passed by Justice Barin Ghosh, a division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee, on Tuesday voiced a lack of faith in the system. The bench made the observation while taking a case away from a police officer at the centre of a controversy and ordering that it be handed over to any other officer, irrespective of geographical jurisdiction.																								After hearing a complaint filed by Manoj Kumar Mitra, a resident of Baruipur, Justice Ghosh had observed that the police appeared to be a mere puppet in the hands of the mafia and warned that if this continued, there would be no rule of law in the state.																								He then ordered the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police to lodge an FIR against Omar Farooq, officer-in-charge (OC) of Baruipur police station. Farooq was accused of colluding with some hoodlums of the area, who were harassing Mitra for protesting an autorickshaw stand being set up on his property.																								Mitra alleged that the Baruipur police had not just failed to help him, but even sided with the hoodlums. Mitra was forced to leave home, leaving behind his wife and daughter who, too, were humiliated and threatened by the goons.																								Mitra then turned to Calcutta High Court for justice. The case came up in Justice Ghoshs court. After hearing Mitras tale, he ordered Farooq to appear in court. When Farooq failed to turn up, Justice Ghosh passed the order. The Baruipur OC contested this order last week, claiming that the court did not have any authority to recommend the filing of an FIR against him.																								Chief Justice Mathur and Justice Bannerjee, while conceding that the FIR was not legally valid, added that the judge of the trial court (Justice Ghosh) had every reason to be angry with the police. The division bench ordered the districts superintendent of police to take all necessary action against Farooq.																								And in a clear note of no-confidence in the Baruipur OC, Chief Justice Mathur and Justice Bannerjee ordered that Mitras case be taken away from Farooq. Remove him from the investigation (into Mitras allegations), the order said, adding that it could be handed over to the inspector-in-charge of any other police station.

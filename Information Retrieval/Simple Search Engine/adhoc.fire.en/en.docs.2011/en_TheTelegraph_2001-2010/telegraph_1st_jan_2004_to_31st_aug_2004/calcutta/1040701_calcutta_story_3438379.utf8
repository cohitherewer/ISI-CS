The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Murder past, future bleak
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Soma, Bapi Sens widow, needs money for her sons schooling. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Relieved at hearing the news that her husbands killers have been found guilty, Soma Sen quietly walked back to her eldest son Somshubhra in her room. She was worried about what the future held for her.																								I am only concerned about my sons education. My only goal is to set them up in life, Soma told Metro, several hours after the five constables who beat Bapi Sen to death were convicted in court.																								It is this urge to see that both Somshubhra, 9, known as Dodo, and two-and-a-half-year-old Shankhashubhra (Dingo) shine in life that compelled Soma to write to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last week, seeking financial help.																								At the outset, let me express my heartfelt gratitude and sincere thanks for the arrangements made by you (chief minister) for getting my son admitted to Vivekananda Mission School... We would like to put forward a humble prayer for assistance for continuation of my sons education, in the form of financial help, either from a government organisation or any other source best suited for this purpose, Somas letter to the chief minister reads.																								A routine acknowledgement has come from the chief ministers office. But no assurance of financial help.																								After Bapi Sens death on January 6, 2003, the family decided to put Dodo into Ramakrishna Mission at Narendrapur, so that Soma, who suddenly found herself fighting all odds with two minor sons, could try to take up a job and also take care of toddler Dingo.																								Accordingly, Dodo was admitted to RKM, but within a few months, he had to return because he pined for his mother. 																								But Dodos old school refused to take him back. So, we put him in a smaller school in Behala, recalled Anup Sen, Bapis elder brother.																								At this point, the government, specially the chief minister intervened and Dodo was soon re-inducted into the old school, where he used to study before his fathers death.																								The chief minister had met both Soma and Anup Sen at Writers Buildings on February 9 and promised help. 																								The government offered Soma a job in the traffic department, but she declined.																								However, with no source of income, the Sens are now worried about the cost of education. We have run out of ideas. We hope to meet the chief minister again, requesting some financial help, said Anup Sen.

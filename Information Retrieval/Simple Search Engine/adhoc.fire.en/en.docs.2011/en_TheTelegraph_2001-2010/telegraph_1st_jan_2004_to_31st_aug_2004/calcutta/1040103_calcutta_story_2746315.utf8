																																																		Even 24 hours after the incident in which the co-owner of Haldiram Bhujiawala was fired at from close range on Thursday afternoon, none of the assailants had been traced, despite a massive hunt being launched . The injured woman and other employees of the outlet have identified one of the gangsters. It seems they were from the locality, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department. Three miscreants armed with revolvers raided the outlet in Kankurgachhi on Thursday. They tried to snatch a bag containing Rs 40,000. But the woman put up a fight and managed to cling on to the bag. When she raised an alarm, the goons fired at her, said a police official. According to police, the attack was the fallout of an incident that had occurred on Christmas Day. A person was caught red-handed by store employees while trying to purchase some stuff with false coupons. He was handed over to the local police. The accused was arrested, slapped with a cheating charge and later released on bail, said an official of Phoolbagan police station. Later, the injured woman told the cops that she had recognised one of the attackers as the cheat out on bail. An intention of revenge triggered the incident. Preliminary investigation suggested they had planned to rob the woman, not shoot her. But they panicked when the woman started screaming, said the official,																																																		Three miscreants were arrested when they tried to rob three policemen on duty of their valuables at a government office in Baduria, on the northern fringes of the city, on Thursday night.

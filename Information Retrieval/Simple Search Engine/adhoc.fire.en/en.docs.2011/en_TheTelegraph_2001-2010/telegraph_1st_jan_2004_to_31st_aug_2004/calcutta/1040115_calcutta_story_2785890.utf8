 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 A script to ward off disaster
				 Amit Maitra  Amit Maitra Hes an indian Institute of Technology  (IIT) graduate, but his interest in life is radically different.  Although Amit Maitra has spent the past 20 years working  day jobs, its his evening hobby of writing plays that has  kept him going.																								The ex-student of Hartnet High School in Kanchrapara was passionate about pure science and maths. But it was chemical engineering that he took up in IIT Kharagpur, because everyone said it was the right thing to do. I won a scholarship, and in those days, to pursue a profession, one either became a doctor or an engineer, the 45-year-old recalls.																								It was while at IIT that Maitra discovered a love for theatre. I had the scope and opportunity to pursue it, so I did. From then on, penning plays about people has been not just a hobby, but the the love of my life. All this was despite working in companies like Thermax, HCL and Iron Exchange, from the factory floor to marketing and even in human resource development.																								After graduation in 1980, however, he and some friends started an amateur theatre group in Kanchrapara, called Patha Sena, performing street plays on the micro-analysis of daily life.																								But it was after joining banglanatak.com some years ago that he began scripting in earnest, this time on social issues, to create awareness. It gave me the opportunity to finally focus on what I liked to do best -- portray the dogmas of life that people dont often want to address, he says. Hundreds of scripts later, on a variety of issues, hes still going strong.																								Polio campaigns for Unicef, HIV/AIDS awareness for Catholic Relief Society and Population Services International, anti-drug plays for Calcutta Police  hes written them all. Also on the list was a play on safe practices in the workplace for Indian Aluminium. Safety is a culture. You cant start it and then stop. That play should have been shown regularly. Otherwise, people tend to forget, he adds.																								Currently, Maitra is involved with an organisation of a different kind. Spade, an NGO working in the area of disaster management and micro finance in north Bengal, in places like Nadia, Murshidabad and Jalpaiguri, was started by his batchmate, and is managed by a group of ex-IITians.																								At the moment, he is compiling a training manual on combating disasters by being better prepared. Disaster management is all about integrated communication, he explains. That is the purpose of the manual. Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to continue this work, Maitra signs off.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								The city civic authorities do not have a functional environment wing of their own, though they have undertaken the massive Calcutta environment improvement project with a loan of Rs 1,548 crore from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 																								Evincing a keen interest in the matter for the first time, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said an active environment wing, comprising experts, needs to be put in place to monitor the various development activities going on in the city. The ultimate objective of the wing would be to make the city a better place to live in. 																								For the past 20 years or so, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had an environment department that existed only on paper, though city governance needs one to keep a check on the development activities.																								I am surprised to see the lack of perception about the importance of environment in my predecessors, he said. But neither Mukherjee, nor his predecessors in the civic board  Prasanta Chatterjee and Kamal Bose  had ever thought of allocating funds for the wing in the past 18 budgets, till 2003-2004.																								I have advised my council member in charge of slum improvement and environment Javed Ahmed Khan to submit a budget proposal for setting up an environment wing in his department, mayor Mukherjee said. In the CMC, environment affairs come under the department of slum improvement.																								It is expected that an allocation to the tune of Rs 5 crore will be made in the CMC budget for 2004-2005 for setting up the environment wing. 																								I plan to seek help from environment experts in Jadavpur University, the pollution control board and specialised organisations, like Man and Environment, in drawing up a framework for the environment wing, said Khan. 																								It is the civic authority, and not the state government, that is legally and morally bound to provide a clean environment to its citizens, with amenities like safe drinking water, better roads and smooth sewerage system, pointed out the mayor. 																								But critics in the civic board are far from convinced by the mayors promises. If he is so sincere about it, then he should have done something by now, instead of criticising his predecessors, said a mayoral council member, on condition of anonymity. Several other councillors, too, felt that Mukherjee might only be paying mere lip service, as he has done precious little till now.

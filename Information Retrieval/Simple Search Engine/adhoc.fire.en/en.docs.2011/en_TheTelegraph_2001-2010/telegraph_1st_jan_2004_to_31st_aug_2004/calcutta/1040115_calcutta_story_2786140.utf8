The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 State matches mayor with tax sop
 															- Twin-edged  revamp of property levy to ensure quality services  A STAFF REPORTER 																								The state government plans more property-tax reforms in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area  the ninth largest urban agglomeration in the world, with the highest density of population. The objective: assured delivery of quality civic services through better city governance. 																								Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya says the tax will be restructured in such a manner that owners of old houses are not forced to sell their holdings to promoters; also, old tenants will have the option of paying a portion of the tax.																								Two important tools will be used by the state government to achieve its goal: an amendment of the rent control enactment, since it acts as a deterrent in the introduction of property valuation on a rational basis, and introduction of area-wise valuation of property.																								Minister Bhattacharya pointed out that Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Patna had already delinked the valuation of landed property from rental value while determining property tax. According to him, an area-wise tax is more transparent but does not deliver justice to all house-owners in cities with old built-up areas as in Calcutta, Howrah or Chandernagore. Hence, the area-wise tax will be implemented first on an experimental basis in Salt Lake, Rajarhat and Durgapur. 																								To analyse the revamp, a state-level seminar on Property Tax and Municipal Accounting Reforms was organised jointly by the state government and the British Department for International Development at Hyatt Regency on Wednesday. It was attended by the municipal commissioners of Delhi, Ahmedabad and Calcutta and the chairmen of district municipalities. Speakers included municipal commissioners Rakesh Mehta (Delhi), R.K. Tripathi (Ahmedabad) and Debashis Som (Calcutta), apart from the chairman of the central valuation board.																								Dubbing mayor Subrata Mukherjees announcement of a Rs 38-crore property tax relief a political gimmick with an eye on the impending Lok Sabha election, minister Bhattacharya claimed the state government had already slashed the tax burden on house-owners in the municipal areas.																								Also, the mayors much-hyped tax relief, announced on Tuesday, will not be effective for another six months, at least, the minister added. Mukherjee had said the tax breather would be effective from April, but Bhattacharya pointed out: It will take the municipal affairs department no less than six months to give its assent, after a thorough scrutiny and with a necessary amendment to the relevant sections of the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1980. If everything goes right, the new rate of property tax will come into force from January 2005.																								Municipal affairs department principal secretary Dipankar Mukhopadhyay echoed the ministers views and said advance announcements of premature policy decisions create confusion and problems.

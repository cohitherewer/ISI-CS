 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Actresses Chandreyee Ghosh and Chaiti Ghoshal at Divercity on Wednesday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Some of them gather tea leaves in the hills, some help grind the leaves in factories in the foothills. Others collect herbs for flavour, while some others package it all, off the EM Bypass. But all these 200 women have been victims of violence, torture or poverty in some way. And starting from Wednesday, a store near Lake Market will attempt to make their lives a little better.																								Livelihood support groups for women have been brought together at Divercity in south Calcutta, which launched its range of herbal teas and gift packs, in a Sasha initiative developed by Ruro Agro Services Association (RASA), Swayam and Self Help Womens Handicraft Society.																								This is our latest effort in promoting means of livelihood for less privileged women in rural and semi-urban areas by teaching them holistic skills in the use of herbs, said Sudatta Chakraborty of Sasha. The gift packs have been hand-painted by girls of Swayam which works with women against violence and the packs contain packaged tea, mugs and tea napkins, embroidered by members of Self Help Womens Handicraft Society, she added.																								Even the paper for the tea packs has been made by a womens self-help group in Patuli while women from the Howrah Pilot Project have made the rose extracts for flavour.																								And thats not all. For four-year-old street children Sujon Das and Rohit Ghorai, Divercity, the city memorabilia shop, means much more than T-shirts, stickers, towels, crockery, glass-work and pottery bric-a-brac. The sale of each item, gives these kids a reason to smile at their Salt Lake Prayasam centre. 																								Owner Papiya Mukherjee explained: Thanks to designers who provide the products for my shop, a part of the proceeds sponsors the childrens education, toys and food. Sujon and Rohit love rasogolla and football, and we try to give them what they want. A few items at Divercity have also been made by the children of Tangras Asha Niketan, a centre for the physically challenged.																								Life has been one long battle for Ria and Soma, both 19, and Ranjana, 21. And a little store near Deshapriya Park means the world to them. 																								The three inmates of the NGO Sanlaap run their own business from the Hub, a boutique selling goods created by girls at the NGOs Narendrapur and Bagha Jatin homes. 																								Social rehabilitation seems to have worked wonders for the girls. Soma enjoys selling out stuff at the boutique. Ria, looking up from her embroidery said: All of us are chipping in for our exhibition in September. Ranjana, on the other hand, loves rustling up pizzas for customers.

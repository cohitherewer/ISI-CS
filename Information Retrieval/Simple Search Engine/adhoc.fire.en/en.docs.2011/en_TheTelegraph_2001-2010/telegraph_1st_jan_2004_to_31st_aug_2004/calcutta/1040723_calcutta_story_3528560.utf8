 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Polluters put paid to Lake restoration
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government has decided to put on hold conservation work at Rabindra Sarobar till it is able to stop outsiders from polluting the waterbody.																								State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya told the Assembly during the question hour on Thursday: For the time being, the government has decided not to proceed with the conservation work at the Dhakuria Lakes because we have realised that there is no point in cleaning the waterbody until we are able to stop the people residing in the vicinity from polluting it.																								Bhattacharya said the most important part of the project  cleaning of the water has been temporarily put off. 																								The minister, however, added that a considerable portion of the work has already been completed. 																								The central government is sponsoring the project for developing Rabindra Sarobar to include it in the list of national lakes. 																								The effort suffered a setback when the state government failed to evict the people illegally residing on the Sarobar periphery. 																								These people are using the Lakes waters for bathing and cleaning utensils. The garbage and waste dumped on the banks are also polluting the Sarobar, Bhattacharya said.																								He added that the clubs located in the vicinity are also causing pollution in the water. 																								A corpus of Rs 6.96 lakh was earmarked by the Centre for the entire project. As per the agreement, Rs 4.86 crore is being borne by the Centre while the state will provide the rest of the sum.																								According to the urban development minister, the Centre has so far released Rs 3 crore for the project. 																								A substantial portion of this has been spent so far in constructing roads, installing streetlights and building embankments around the Sarobar, he said.																								In reply to a question by Kashinath Mishra, Bhattacharya said the Centre has not sanctioned more funds for Rabindra Sarobar in the fiscal 2004-05. Nor would the state urge it to release the remaining share until it draws up a scheme to evict the encroachers, he elaborated.																								The government is now drawing up plans to set up a committee, comprising all the MLAs of south Calcutta, to chalk out a strategy for the eviction. 																								The MLAs will sit together and draw up a concrete plan for evicting the unauthorised occupants on the Sarobar grounds, Bhattacharya said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 16, 2004 Parking peril
Make Calcutta Better - RN Mukherjee RoadAny hapless officegoer who has to park his car anywhere in the Dalhousie area would know what a nightmare that can be. With the main roads generally sporting No Parking signs, finding precious resting space in the lanes and bylanes can be tougher than finding a job.RN Mukherjee Road is no exception. What makes matters worse here is the proximity to Lalbazar. Vehicles eat up three-fourth of the stretch in front of Birla Building with vehicles parked on both sides.One side is completely taken up by vans and small buses belonging to Calcutta Police, the other by private two-wheelers and cars.Its an ordeal every morning to park my car here, says Kingshuk Banerjee, an executive who is forced to fight for a place where there is none.But theres nothing much the authorities can do about the parking peeve. The problem certainly is of space, feels Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic). Its not possible for us to park the police cars too far away from the headquarters. Unless there is an alternative car parking area that we can locate, there doesnt seem to be any immediate solution, shrugs Basu.Wanted: a giant parking lot, under, on or above ground, in the central business district. Pay more we can, just give us some space to park.

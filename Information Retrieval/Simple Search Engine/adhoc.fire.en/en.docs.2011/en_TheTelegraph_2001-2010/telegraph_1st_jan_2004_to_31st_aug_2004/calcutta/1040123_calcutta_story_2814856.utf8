 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Overnight southern swoop nets 50
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In one of the biggest nightlong raids in recent times across south Calcutta, nearly 50 criminals were rounded up till Thursday morning. All of them were wanted for a good number of cases. The swoops yielded pirated compact discs, foreign liquor and drugs, apart from arms and ammunition. 																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir said the simultaneous raids began on Wednesday night and were conducted at hideouts in Regent Park and Behala.																								In the Regent Park area, more than 46 criminals were rounded up in the crackdown on vice dens on Prince Anwar Shah Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road and KP Roy Road. Some shop-owners were arrested for selling drugs and foreign liquor without a valid licence.																								The police made a haul of 500 litres of foreign liquor, five kg of ganja and other drugs.																								The arrested include Khoka, Kochi, Nelo and Bhola, who were wanted in a number of other cases. The last three had been in hiding but police feel they had assembled again on Wednesday night to draw up plans for a dacoity.																								We were on the look-out for for the trio for quite some time, but they were changing their hideouts frequently. They would remain at a particular place for a fortnight at the most. By this time, they would have committed a crime and fled to a new place, throwing the police off their scent, said deputy superintendent Kabir.																								But on Wednesday night, we had a tip-off about their whereabouts. Accordingly, a large contingent of police was sent out to raid the hideouts and we picked up the criminals and their associates, he said. 																								The Wednesday night raids also targetted two compact disc shops opposite Bengal Government Press, in Behala. Residents of the area had lodged complaints against the shops. More than 500 cassettes of pornography and 300 pirated cassettes were seized. 																								These two shops were selling pirated cassettes and blue films for a long time. People of the area were making complaints but the clandestine business kept flourishing. Our men dropped into the shops posing as customers and caught the owners red-handed, Kabir signed off.

 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Second suicide on campus
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Death has cast a disturbing shadow on the Shibpur campus.																								Early on Tuesday, Anthony Sugaijam, 21, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Bengal Engineering College (Deemed University) hostel room.																								Seventeen days ago, Bisheswar Hazari, a student of electronics and telecommunication engineering, had hanged himself on campus.																								Anthony, from Imphal, was always eager to mix with other students. He had many friends, said hostel superintendent S.P. Chakraborty, expressing shock over the suicide. His nature was the exact opposite of Bisheswar, the boy who committed suicide last month, he added. 																								Police later said the young man had probably taken his life because of a failed relationship.																								An officer of Shibpur police station said a suicide note had revealed that Anthony was upset after the Mizo girl he had set his heart on had turned down his marriage proposal. The note also referred to his parents being divorced, police added.																								The letter is in the form of a diary, maintained since February 4, and addressed to the Mizo girl. It documents Anthonys desire to marry her. It even has detailed references to how their dream house would look, revealed the officer.																								The last entry was dated Tuesday, 10.30 pm  after Anthony had squared off all his dues and treated his friends to dinner  and had repeated references to his desire to kill himself if the relationship did not work out.

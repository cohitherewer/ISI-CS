The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Glow golf and glitter, nostalgia and growth
 															- RCGCS 175th will be WEEKLONG, NON-STOP CARNIVALKapil Dev (top) and Arjun Atwal: Icons and club loyalists 																								Chilled out on the blissful nothingness of the 10th fairway, lending a wistful ear to Louis Banks, Usha Uthup and the rest of the gang belting out those nostalgic Park Street numbers under a brilliant blanket of stars.																								Putting from memory in a round of glow-golf where the ball is illuminated and the fairways lit up by Chinese candles.																								Or travelling down history lane with Bill Shafer (captain, 1962-63) and Joe Hardwick (the clubs golf pro around the same time).																								Theres a lot you can do at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) during that balmy November week (21 to 28) as the worlds oldest golf club outside the British Isles attempts to drive its way out of troubled bunkers on the back of its 175th anniversary celebrations. We are at the bottom of the U taking the bend and its now or never for us. So, we are leaving no stone unturned to make the celebrations a memorable occasion, declares captain Ashit Luthra.																								Brandon DSouza, president, Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM) and head of the core committee steering the November gala, couldnt agree more. This is a tailor-made platform for Royals resurgence and we would like to use this opportunity to revisit and honour some of Calcuttas most famous names from all walks of life, he says.																								The showpiece event in the weeklong non-stop carnival will be the Oh Calcutta evening on November 24, with the blast from the past anchored by Banks and Uthup, and Leander Paes playing the brand mascot.																								Club memorabilia will be presented to present-day icons like Arjun Atwal and Jeev Milkha Singh, as well as those who have done Royal proud in the past  from the Ashok Maliks and R.K. Pitambars down to Bunny Lakshman Singh, Alan Singh, Raju Mohta and Firoze Ali.																								While Kapil Dev, a self-professed Royal loyalist, has confirmed his participation, efforts are on to get Ravi Shastri and Sachin Tendulkar, an honorary life member, down for the celebrations. A day in the week (November 26) has been kept aside for the races, and a karaoke night will woo aspiring singers.																								Invitations have gone out to all the 16 Royal clubs (knighted by the Queen) around the world, and the RCGC management expects around 100 visitors from abroad, including past captains. 																								An invitational lawn bowling tournament will also be organised on the clubs Maidan lawns, with participation from Bangkok, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.																								Whatever we do, golf has to be at the core of it all, since its the life-blood of the heritage institution, stresses DSouza. Hence, glow golf and other user-friendly formats to make the game more broad-based. And the RCGC management is also looking beyond the euphoria of 2004, with judicious investment of sponsors money.																								We have to be pragmatic when we plan for the future. A boutique hotel is certainly not our priority at this juncture. Instead, we would focus on basics like better changing rooms, starters and marshals and look to procure serious equipment to maintain the course properly, besides putting in place a professional administrative set-up, adds Luthra.																								The club hopes to also fine-tune its structured junior programme under Indrajit Bhalotia, incorporating coaching for mental skills, yoga regimens and associated inputs linked to the modern-day game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Civic body given a month to revamp waste disposal system
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) has asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and other municipalities in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) to work on a thorough revamp of the existing system of garbage collection, handling and dumping.																								The board has given the CMC a month to submit a comprehensive plan of action.																								We have framed the municipal solid waste (management and handling) rules in coordination with the Centre and all the civic bodies in the CMA will have to abide by them. The entire process of solid waste management will have to change, said state PCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar.																								Solid waste management does not mean merely collecting the garbage from different parts of the city and dumping it at Dhapa. The mountain of garbage will have to be recycled or treated for the sake of development activities and the environment, he pointed out.																								According to the municipal solid waste (management and handling) rules, all the solid waste collected from the CMC areas and other urban pockets in the CMA will have to be treated properly or recycled. 																								The municipal waste (except clinical and bio-medical waste) will have to be used for filling lowlands, treated for making organic manure or chemically removed of all germs and odour. Dumping of solid waste will not be allowed for a long period at a particular place. We have asked the CMC to submit a plan of action, asserted PCB member-secretary Sarkar.																								Besides, he said, there should not be any open vat anywhere in the city and the CMC will have to design closed vats. 																								Also, the collection and transport of garbage to any central place will have to be carried out in a scientific way, so that there is no spillover during transportation or malodour emitted. 																								State PCB officials said the CMC and other municipal authorities will have to obtain an authorisation from the environment panel for carrying out garbage clearance. To obtain an authorisation, the CMC will have to indicate how much of the garbage will be treated, how much will be used for landfills and where it will be used, the officials said.																								Member-secretary Sarkar foresaw no problem for the CMC or the other civic bodies to follow the rules. There are vast tracts of lowlands around the city and its suburbs. The municipal waste can be used to fill up those pockets and the civic authorities can even claim money from the land-owners for the service, he pointed out.																								Besides, there is a huge demand for organic manure in the districts, especially at the tea gardens. So, organic manure can be made from the garbage. Everything is possible if the CMC takes serious steps in the matter, Sarkar said.The state PCB and the CMDA will provide technical assistance to the CMC for implementing the rules.																								CMC mayor-in-council member Rajiv Deb, in charge of solid waste management, said the civic body had no intention of flouting the PCB stricture. We admit that the existing system of solid waste management has to be revamped for the sake of the environment and human health. But, the change cannot be possible in a day or a month. It will take time, he said.																								Calcutta can not be compared with other urban towns, he pointed out. Nearly 3,000 tonnes of garbage are generated in the city daily and it is not an easy task to treat that volume of garbage. However, we are trying our best to draw up a plan of action, Deb said.																								Criticising the role of the state PCB, Deb said the responsibilities of the environment panel were confined to issuing instructions and ultimatums. 																								The PCB had taken on the responsibility of clearing clinical waste but failed on the job. It couldnt even set up a clinical waste treatment plant in two years, Deb pointed out.

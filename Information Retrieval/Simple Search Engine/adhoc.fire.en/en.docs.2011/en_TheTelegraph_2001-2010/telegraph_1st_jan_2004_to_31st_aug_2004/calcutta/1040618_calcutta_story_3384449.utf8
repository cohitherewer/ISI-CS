 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 CPM man shot dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bhakti Das, 32, a criminal-turned-businessman who enjoyed CPM patronage and was wanted in the murders of three local goons, was shot dead from point-blank range in Dum Dum on Thursday afternoon. 																								His assailants also threw bombs at him to ensure he was liquidated.																								Bhakti was shielded by a local CPM leader, who is also a member of the partys North 24-Parganas district committee, and CPM activists went on the rampage on R.N. Guha Road after his murder. 																								Bhakti had allegedly forced two Congress leaders to withdraw from the June 27 municipal polls in Dum Dum and South Dum Dum municipalities, under orders from the local CPM leader. 																								Bhakti and brother Mukti ran an extortion racket in the area, but police could not touch them.

		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 True blue career colour
Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: After shifting to our new house my husbands career has plummeted. Our home has two bedrooms and a south-facing hall. The kitchen is in the northeast and the cooking is done in the southeast. The main entrance is from the north and the south side is open.Could you suggest ways in which we can bring in new business opportunities?Manisha,
Calcutta 																								A: The problem with your house is that chi, which is the life giving force, enters from the north and goes out from the south, which is open. This leads to a drain on health, wealth and business opportunities. It is like having a hole in your pocket out of which money falls out. You must try to conserve energy by keeping the southern doors closed or by keeping heavy curtains drawn all the time.																								Activate the northern wall with a moving water feature. Or, if that is not possible, hang a picture of dolphins jumping into water. The colour blue should be used as generously as possible. This is the colour of water, and it is also the ruling element for careers. Pictures of dolphins in water on a northern wall may help boost a 
flagging career. (AFP)Q: I am a student of Class XI (date of birth: 26.07.85) and want to be a doctor. Could you recommend ways to improve my academic performance? I study facing the east, with a small tortoise facing north on my table.Name withheld on request,
CalcuttaA: You should take special care that all is in order in the extreme northern part of the house. See there is no clutter of any kind here. Activate the northern wall of your bedroom by hanging a blue soft board with a picture of a successful doctor you admire.																								Your picture  in a confident pose  should be placed alongside it. Cover your study table with a blue tablecloth and then place the tortoise on a metal plate kept in the north, facing south.Q: My daughter is academically weak, particularly in maths. Her room is on the southern side of our flat. The door to her room  painted light green  is opposite the main entrance. It has three steel shelves. We are moving to a flat where her room will be in the southeast, with windows in the east and south. Could you suggest a colour scheme and furniture placement for the room? How can her performance improve at our current home?L. Das,
Salt LakeA: The position of the door to her room is not productive. Cosmic energy enters the house, travelling in a straight line and hits her room directly. She should sit far away from the door in the northeast sector of her bedroom with the door shut, particularly when she studies.																								Keep her books in this corner along with a cluster of eight crystals placed on a round mirror. They can be further energised with a table lamp. The formulae she finds difficult to remember should be pinned to a soft board on a northeastern wall. The colour of her room is fine and the same would be appropriate for her new room.																								 Care should be taken that furniture does not obstruct the flow of energy. The bed should not be pushed against the wall because this is symbolic of getting stuck in life. The corners of the bed and study table should not be sharp. They should be rounded so that the child does not bump into these by any means.																								Make sure the desk is not placed against a bathroom wall. The child should avoid studying with her back facing the door. There should be no overhead or open steel shelves to store books as these are believed to kill positive energy.Q: I run a medicine store since March 8, 1997. From 2002, it has not been doing very well. Money comes in but I can never seem to hold on to it. I have also sold a plot of land and have not received the payment for it. What can I do to change my luck?G. Sarkar,
CIT Road																								A: It is best to check your money collection point. If it is in the northwest side of the store, or if it is kept in the northwest cupboard of your house, the drainage of wealth is inevitable. Shift them to the southeast corner, where wealth grows.Keep an affirmative note in the southeast corner (the wealth area) of your bedroom, saying that the concerned person has paid you the money for the plot of land you have sold to him. If this is done with full conviction and faith, you may be surprised by the results.E-mail your Feng Shui queries to: goodlifeabpmail.com or post them to:The Good Life

				 Passport to clubs takes wingsLive life club class, here and abroad Soak in the sights and sounds of London and luxuriate in the regal tea lounge of the Royal Overseas League, just 400 metres from Buckingham Palace. Or enjoy the laid-back charm of the Scottish countryside with a hearty round of golf thrown in. Closer home, make a splash in the cool pool of Hyderabads Country Club International, or raise a toast to the awesome Kanchenjungha from the lazy elegance of the Darjeeling Gymkhana Club. All with a plastic passport issued by a city institution.				 																																																											One year into its operation and boasting a membership base close to 2,000, Happy Club, the countrys first virtual club, has decided to spread its wings. A string of reciprocal tie-ups with clubs and institutions around the country and abroad with two new free foreign holiday destinations (Bangkok and Singapore) thrown in, have given its newly-launched Platinum card holders an added edge, claims the management.				 																																																											This card is the gateway to the world of entertainment, not just in the City of Joy, but elsewhere too, says Sushil Poddar, chairman of Happy Group of Companies, which owns Happy Club. The novel virtual club extends a host of benefits to its members, including entry and access to facilities of several leading clubs, pubs and hotels of Calcutta and beyond.				 																																																											Beginning with eastern India, Happy Club plans to make inroads into every nook and corner of the Northeast market as well. We always had plans to go national. However, the rising demand from other areas made us think of intensifying our presence deep in the east, adds Poddar.				 																																																											The management has plans to open up more leisure points for its members, and new tie-ups are being sealed every month for this purpose. Apart from the arrangement with Royal Overseas League in London and Edinburgh, which has already been worked out, Happy Club is in dialogue with other institutions in London, New York, Scotland, Melbourne and New Zealand.				 																																																											Back home, the virtual club now has affiliations with five city clubs  The Calcutta South Club, The Calcutta Polo Club, Marine Club, Lake Land Country Club and Anderson Club. Efforts are on to tie up with the Royal Calcutta Golf Club and Calcutta Swimming Club, too. Happy Club members already enjoy pubbing facilities at hotspots like London Pub, Winning Streak, Big Ben and Spice.				 																																																											We want to open up the whole world of entertainment for the citys middle class by making facilities affordable, promises Poddar. While the Gold card membership fee has now gone up to Rs 12,345 per year from Rs 7,777 when initially launched, the new Platinum card primary membership comes for an annual cost of Rs 15,567. Family membership (for a couple and one child below 12) is pegged at Rs 30,567.				 																																																											The club offers its members an interest-free deferred payment option through Citibank, with an EMI of Rs 1,298 over 10 months after a down payment of two instalments. For Gold cardholders, the EMI works out to Rs 1,028. Taking into account all the facilities on offer, the perceived value of the total facilities and benefits for the Platinum card is not less than Rs 4,15,567, stresses the chairman, hoping to have over 500 members in the Happy fold by the year-end.Actors Arjun and Chhaya Singh during the shooting of Tamil feature film Jaya Surya on Vidyasagar Setu.

Adolf Hitler played by Pip Utton  the biggest and the most recognised example of racism and intolerance stood up on a Calcutta stage on Wednesday. That Hitlers methods are the same as those of politicians, advertisers and marketers, and that the same hatred festers in most minds even today was the powerful warning he had for somewhat uncomfortably riveted audience.				 																																																											Adolf devastated with its brutal look at the bigotry alive in us all, making another holocaust possible even today. A packed GD Birla Sabhagar was a little shocked, a little awed by this one-man show sizzling with satire. The reaction, worldwide, has been pretty similar. While some embrace the politically explosive piece, others get put out, said Utton after the show. A woman came on stage once and punched me, recalls Utton, who has tied up with British Council to tour India with a performance that has won rave reviews since it premiered in 1997.				 																																																											The play starts with Utton, playing Hitler, on the stage bare but for a desk, chair and swastika. He is giving his final orders before committing suicide. His last speech is delivered in an almost hypnotic, measured tone. But there are impassioned moments too, when Hitler becomes the propaganda-spewing monster of hate. How can it be judged wrong if I have always put the German people first, he asks, deeming that a captain must always go down with his ship.				 																																																											Utton has no desire to decode Hitlers mind. I might be interested in the way he thinks if I was his psychiatrist. I am more interested in how he managed to persuade people to get the German nation to believe in him, he says. He spends the second section of the play doing just this.				 																																																											As Hitler goes down, Utton takes the stage. Or so we think, when he asks the audience for a cigarette, pulls off his wig and trademark moustache and takes a swig of Coke. He follows a stand-up routine format to cut with incisive irony the politics of hatred, heroism and colonialism. He fits in local references with surprising relevance  from the India Shining campaign to Bal Thakeray  and he packs in many a punch.				 																																																											But then, in an explosive climax, this ordinary man morphs into Hitler. You hear my voice everyday All you have to do is let me in. I can do all the rest.				 																																																											Utton jokes about straying into theatre as part of a mid-life crisis, and has no formal training in the medium. But he uses his tool with power. He does not attempt to offer any solutions. I am not sure if there is a solution. But it is important to keep asking questions, he says. Now, he is working on a play about the relationship between Mary and Joseph. The man from a town near Bath with two traffic lights wants to come back to India. And Calcuttas theatre lovers can only hope that he brings his next venture with him.				 																																									 Green is the colour to be seen in at a charity ball this Sunday. The Irish Tenors will perform for a Hope Calcutta Foundation fundraiser at the Hyatt Regency. The proceeds will go to Hope, an Ireland-based funding agency that supports a number of NGOs in Calcutta working with underprivileged children. The bash starts at 7 pm, with a few words from Maureen Forrest, director, Hope Foundation Ireland, followed by the performance, dinner and a dance.

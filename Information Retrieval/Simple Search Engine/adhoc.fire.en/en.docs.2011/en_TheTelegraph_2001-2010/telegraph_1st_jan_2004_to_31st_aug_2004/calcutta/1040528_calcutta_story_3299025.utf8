 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Interpreting Kali
																								Art for arts sake may very well be the dictum for Tamal Krsna. In him is an artist who has no qualms in admitting that his sole responsibility is towards the sake of art. It is purely his artistic allegiance that has granted him the licence to ignore the divinity of Kali. The artist worships the malicious aspect in the goddess because he believes it is through her unbridled destruction that the eternity of Kali shines. It is the spirit, the force and the energy associated with Kali that have inspired Tamal Krsna to explore Her diverse facets and reproduce them in his paintings. The artist owes much of his inspiration to Sister Nivedita whose lecture in the courtyard of the Kali temple in Kalighat, more than a century earlier, has made an impact deep enough for his exhibition to be held at the same premises as a tribute to his muse.

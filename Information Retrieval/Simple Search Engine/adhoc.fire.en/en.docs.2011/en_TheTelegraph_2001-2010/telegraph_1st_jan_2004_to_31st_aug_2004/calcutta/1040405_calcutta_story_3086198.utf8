The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, April 05, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Elderly people like me enjoy a stroll in Millennium Park. The picturesque view of the riverside is very soothing. But as failing health prevents many of us from walking for long, I request the authorities to arrange for wheelchairs that can be hired.

	A recent visit to Dum Dum airport to see off a friend proved to be an embarrassing experience. The first-floor toilet was very dirty and littered with tissue paper, while the one on the ground floor was closed for renovation. Will the airport authorities please take steps?
	 Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.

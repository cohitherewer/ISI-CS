		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Facelift for the unplanned and oldest
 CAVE-IN CHUNKS: The walls of BD Market need urgent repairs. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChoudhuryWrik Bhattasali: BD Market is the oldest of its kind in the township. It needs urgent maintenance, as portions of its walls and ceiling are caving in.																																																													I had sent a proposal to the municipality more than a year ago to carry out some maintenance work at the market. Recently, a tender has been floated for renovating it. A few months ago, a proposal had been sanctioned in the civic board meeting that the market, which has come up in an unplanned manner, will be modernised. Work will start soon.

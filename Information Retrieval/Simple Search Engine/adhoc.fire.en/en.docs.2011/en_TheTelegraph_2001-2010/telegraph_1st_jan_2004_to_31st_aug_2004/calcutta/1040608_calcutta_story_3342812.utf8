 Actor Churni Ganguly sits pretty in the dummy cafeteria created by NiFD students. Picture by Rashbehari DasThe azure of the sky peeps through stark white icicles that spread out to engulf you in a cool embrace. If you think this has anything to do with a surreal sequel of The Day After Tomorrow, just check out the 527 sq ft creation of a dummy cafeteria on Lindsay Street inspired by Iceland.																								Created over a period of three months by 22 students of interior design at the New Market branch of the National Institute of Fashion Design (NiFD), the cafeteria christened Capic is made to resemble something straight out of the frigid environs of Iceland. The ceiling and walls are adorned with dripping plaster of Paris icicles. The ceiling reflecting patches of blue is nothing but satin cloth made to resemble a late evening sky with tiny bulbs symbolising a starlit sky.																								The 30-seater eatery features wooden chairs and tables with the finish reflecting pinewood. The chairs have been painted peppy blue and green, the tables are topped with broken glass panels to lend the effect of melting ice. The broken glass treatment is given to the standalone corner sofa as well and the bright red upholstery with a touch of fur reminds you of Christmas bang in the middle of summer. The cafeteria counter is modelled on a sledge. The trickling waterfall outside the fibre-glass windows, simulated by a water pump, is a top draw.																								Funky motifs on the walls include a wacky take on Gandhijis monkeys with three masks featuring sunglasses perched on forehead, headphones firmly plugged in and half-opened stitches hanging from the lips of another. Here, you can see, hear and talk as much mischief as you want to, giggles a student.																								Built at a cost of Rs 65,000, the dummy is part of the students annual project supposed to give them a hands-on practical experience and showcase their skills to the industry. The idea is to give the students exposure and increase their chances for placements and absorption, says interior design department head Anju Haldar.																								From fantasy to facts  the students are also showcasing scale models of various rooms in an apartment that pack in the tiniest things to the last detail. The tiny living room, bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom reflect thoughtful planning that covers everything from furniture, fittings to furnishings.																								Each of the rooms features a price tag, the result of the students painstaking market surveys that factor in everything you would need to build and furnish an apartment. So, the next time you go house hunting, pause for a peep, you know where. Members of The Circle Club walk the ramp on Sunday. Picture by Aranya SenFull circle A child turning five is a big event. A club turning five is no less. Or so we gathered, at the birthday bash of The Circle Club, that completed five years of its existence in Calcutta on Sunday evening.																								The high point of this club has always been participation of its members. Be it a Sunday afternoon tambola, or a beauty contest, the annual sports or a DJ night, the members have always been deeply involved with the goings-on in the club.																								So, on a day as big as bday, it was only natural for the members themselves to get their act together and put up a show. And that they  from six to 60  sure did.																								Dance performances, fashion show, games and finally DJ Harish and DJ Kunal churning out music for some footloose fun marked a long-awaited evening.																								The members have put in a lot of effort to get this show together We squeezed out time from our busy schedules to meet up for rehearsals, said Nilima Lokre, who participated in both the fashion show and a self-choreographed dance sequence to Bollywood hits.																								The prize for the most frequent visitor to the club was waiting to be picked up by Pradip Roy, who apparently begins and ends his day at Circle. The excitement meter ticked the loudest when anchors Sougata and Kriti sent the members hunting for their pairs. Tom went crying out for Jerry in a room packed with over 400 members, and Laurel looked for Hardy in a bid to win a bottle of beer sponsored by Royal Challenge.																								The ladies made a dash for their lipsticks as the spotlight shifted to the best-dressed woman of the evening. Dazzling in green and blue sequinned chiffon with co-ordinated kundan, Sangeeta Dutta won the crown.But it was left to the song and dance  with the DJ console booming to life  to really bring the birthday bash to its feet.

Picture by Rashbehari DasRustic chic 																								The lure of returning to the roots, city style, drove hordes of visitors on Sunday evening to The Stadel, as the Salt Lake hotel hosted a village fair on its lush green stadium lawns.																								The event had enough rustic elements on hand to lend it an authentic look. So, the traditional jyotishi with parrot and tarot card lured the Levis and Nike clad brigade by the dozens, as did the sculptures and plate paintings by artist Nabendu Sengupta.																								The jewellery stalls selling colourful beads, glass bangles and pretty earrings caught the eye of most women and the textiles from Kalna district weavers drew in the sari freaks. The food stalls with mostly North Indian fare kept the foodie fulfilled, and the Kingfisher beer counter was on a real roll. 																								The evening, some observed, offered the best of both worlds on one platter  a village feel in air-conditioned comfort.																								There was more entertainment in store for the guests as the evening merged into night and pop crooner Avril Quadros took centre stage. The reason why we had to have western music was because we wanted to cater to all tastes, explained Anil Bhutoria, director, Stadel.Staying puttGolf, they say, is much more than a game. Its a lifestyle.																								A quick game early in the morning or a stretch-out session every Sunday is the norm for many, these days. So, when Royal Challenge decided to bring golf enthusiasts from the citys corporate circle on to one course, it sparked a mini riot.																								A hundred participants from 25 companies lined up to tee off for the first in-house putting championship the city has, apparently, seen.																								The preliminary rounds were held in the respective offices of the contesting companies but the final event moved on to the lush greens of Tollygunge Club on Friday.																								Four top scorers from each company put their best putt forward, but Eveready Industries, ICICI Bank and The Park hotel birdied away with the top three honours.																								And whats a golfing drive without some cocktails and yummy munchies on the follow through? With the sun going down and the putt prizes won and lost, it was time to throw away the clubs and pick up a chicken drumstick and a beer mug, instead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 Life  Soul food fest June Maliah enjoying herself on World Music Day. Pictures by Rashbehari Das A celebration of music around the globe for World Music Day was all too audible in Calcutta on Monday as the city swayed to the beat of an annual event spearheaded in France way back in 1982.																					The Calcutta chapter of the celebrations was a collaborative effort of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta, The Park, and the Calcutta School of Music.																					A gamut of bands and singers offered a large choice of music, from fusion to classical, through Monday.																					The sound started at 1.30 pm with Cassinis Division at The Atrium, moving to a city music store with Krosswindz, on to La Martiniere for a western pop and classic concert. At the same time, around 6 pm, Alliance Francaise hosted a performance of French music by its students. At Calcutta School of Music, a music and dance programme was followed by a show by Paresh Sengupta.																					Back at The Park, the Violin Brothers held sway before Anjan Dutt, Orient Express and New Illusion started jamming at Someplace Else and DJ Rom from France teamed up for an impromptu fusion gig with Bikram Ghosh at Tantra.																					Monday afternoon might not be when the city usually starts tuning into live shows, but it had no trouble warming up to alternative rock outfit Cassinis Division.																					The first public gig of the band with its new line-up (with Rahul Guha Roy on vocals and guitar, Sukanti Roy and Mainak Nag Chowdhury on guitars, John Bose on bass, Sanjay Gupta on drums and Ritoban Das on drums and percussion), was lapped up by fans and a casual lunch crowd at The Atrium.																					The original rock band belted out an impressive array of covers. The group, influenced by Pearl Jam, Incubus, Lifehouse, REM and The Cure, displayed an impressive song list, spanning decades. Kick-starting the performance with REMs Imitation of Life, the band moved on to Dylans Blowing In The Wind, Bob Marleys No Woman No Cry and Ticket To Ride and Imagine by Beatles.The list was interspersed with original compositions, touching a wide range of issues. While Only For A While is about learning to savour the little pleasures of life, Drown spoke of a boy who overcomes low self-esteem and depression. DJ Rom mixing it up for music lovers at the disc.

The song explores the relation between lust for power and self-destruction. Mr Mishra in contrast was the mellow sing-along tune that got the crowd joining in for the chorus.																					The special attraction of the day was the finale. DJ Rom and Bikram Ghosh were attractive enough to draw quite a crowd to Tantra, despite it usually being kept firmly shut on the slowest day of the week.																					The Paris-based Romuald Tual  otherwise known as DJ Rom  warmed up the room, mixing his blend of electronic music on the catwalk before he was joined by Bikram. 																					Tantra regulars happily hit the dance floor to the techno beats, while special invitees  including the citys consular and expat communities and local celebrities like Arjun Chakraborty and wife Nilanjana  preferred to stay seated. Actor June Maliah did strike a pretty pose though.																					The spontaneous performance was well received by the crowd. As Rom kept the beat flowing, Bikram added his desi-meets-world-music touch for a few tracks, in a short performance, finishing with a tribute to his father.																					e the people on the floor cheered on the duo, there were others who were not as impressed. The lack of preparation shows, a guest at Bodhi Bar was heard saying.																					And though the tabla player confessed at the outset that it was an off-the-cuff performance, the crowd had a little more in mind for Monday night. The live beat succeeded in breaking the monotony of pre-recorded, electronic tracks, felt others.																					Rom  who came to Calcutta after performances in Delhi and Mumbai  played till around midnight, rounding off the celebrations on a trancy note.

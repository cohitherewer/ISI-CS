 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Steal her heart, rob her gold
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Young ladies, beware. Theres a rogue Romeo on the prowl, whos robbed about 20 women of their hearts and then their valuables.																								The police have launched a hunt for Rahul Roy, who operates in the New Market-Shakespeare Sarani area. 																								Over the past two years, Roy has earned himself notoriety in the local police stations, though only three of his victims have mustered enough courage to register cases against him to date. 																								Roys latest victim, a young girl, lodged a complaint with Maidan police station on Monday. She was initially hesitant to confess to the police, and only wanted her gold ring back, without getting into any trouble with her parents at home.																								After much coaxing, she provided a written account of how the young man had befriended her, earned her trust and then made off with her ring.																								According to Ashish Sengupta, officer-in-charge of Maidan thana, Roy is fair and good-looking, about 27 or 28 years old. He wears spectacles, is about 5 ft 8 inches tall and of slim build. 																								Roys modus operandi has remained the same all the while. He gives his female victim a mobile phone number: 9830328025. 																								After the first couple of dates and a few telephonic conversations, he admires the pretty jewellery his victim wears and cautions her about the abundance of thugs and thieves in the area. 																								He persuades her to give him the jewellery for safekeeping, asks her to wait for a while and then flees the scene, never to be seen again.Mayor, 37 held amp; freed: Thirty-eight Trinamul Congress MLAs, including mayor Subrata Mukherjee, were arrested around 5 pm on Monday from Kiron Shankar Roy Road, central Calcutta, for gathering in a protected place. 																								The MLAs had taken out a protest procession from the Assembly to Writers Buildings. All were released later in the evening, police said.

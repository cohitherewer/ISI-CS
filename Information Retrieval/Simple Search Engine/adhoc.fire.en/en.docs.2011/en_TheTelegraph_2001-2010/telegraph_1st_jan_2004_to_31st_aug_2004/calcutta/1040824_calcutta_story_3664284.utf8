 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Swimmers fete is commuters fret
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A crowd gathered to felicitate swimmer Bula Chowdhury blocks VIP Road on Monday morning. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Peak-hour traffic ground to a halt for more than two hours on VIP Road on Monday morning, when local CPM and Congress workers took to the streets to felicitate swimmer Bula Chowdhury, on her arrival in the city from Chennai after conquering the Palk Strait. 																								The organisers of the felicitation, who thronged the entire stretch from the airport to the Ultadanga crossing, couldnt care less for the stranded commuters on their way to office and other important appointments.																								Bula has done us proud. We must give her the recognition she deserves. We are here to felicitate her and it does not matter if there is some suffering, said Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality.																								The road was dotted with makeshift podiums, with loudspeakers fixed on trucks. At major junctions  Keshtopur, Teghoria, Baguiati and Lake Town  the organisers had erected bamboo structures to cheer the conqueror of the seven seas.																								It is only possible here. Where else will you find yourself in a situation like this? grumbled Biswanath Chatterjee, employee of a private firm. How do political leaders allow these men to cripple an entire city in the name of felicitating an achiever? Bulas feat is undeniable, but this is certainly not the way to congratulate her, he added.																								According to Ghanashyam Das, who was taking an elderly relative to RG Kar Hospital, the crowd would not even let the ambulance pass. 																								We tried to convince the organisers that my relative was in need of urgent medical attention, but they would not make way, Das said.																								The Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality chairman observed: People always have a lot to complain about. It is necessary to cheer our achievers to encourage them to perform even better. This is not the first time that we have organised something like this. We had felicitated Sourav Ganguly, Jyotirmoyee Sikdar and Masudur Rahman Baidya the same way. We will continue to do so in future.																								Parveen Kumar, district superintendent of police, admitted that neither the cop top brass nor the traffic department was informed about the programme. The organisers did not seek permission and we had no idea that the situation would spin out of control. If we had been sounded out about a reception for Bula Chowdhury, an alternative arrangement would have been made for daily commuters, Kumar added.

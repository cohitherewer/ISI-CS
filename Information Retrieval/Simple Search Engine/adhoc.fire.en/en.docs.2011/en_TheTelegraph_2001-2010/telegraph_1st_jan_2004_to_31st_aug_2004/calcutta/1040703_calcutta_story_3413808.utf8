 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Parents back in class for tips
 NISHA LAHIRI																								Theres silence in class, as the teacher elaborates on concepts flickering on the screen. And for every question put forward by Father George Palamattam, the students shoot up eager hands.																								Nothing exceptional in the scene except that the students are the parents of Don Bosco Park Circus (DBPC) boys, and the subject of instruction is the A-Z of parenting. The week-long workshop for the parents  one day for two batches, beginning with Classes I and II  was optional. But each day, from 9 am to 3 pm, it was full house in the auditorium, with over 600 guardians glued to their seats.																								A is for?																								Affection! Admiration! Attention!																								You parents have come up with more valid points than what the book says (the textbook for the exercise was What do you really want for your children by Wayne W. Dyer). 																								And so it continues, like R is for restrict TV, computer and video games, which drew plenty of appreciative applause. 																								Some issues emerged as the source of moral dilemmas. As one confused mother put it: If a child hits my son, do I tell him to hit back or just tolerate it?																								The reply: We want them to be assertive, not aggressive; do not take it like a passive victim.																								The point was clear: Stand your ground, clarifies Father George, a clinical psychologist and vice-principal of Anthonys College in Shillong.																								The parents realise that there is a lot to learn about bringing up children, especially in this age of competition, he observes later. Thats why there was such keen participation.																								Then comes the icing on the communication cake. Principal, DBPC, Father T.V. Jacob, announces that the parents are free to voice their grievances against the school, even if it means giving galagali. That opens the floodgates, and out pours a torrent of tirade.																								From teachers chewing paan masala in class to the school being unreasonable in granting leave, banning wooden rulers to less homework and more play, strict marking systems to easing the burden of school bags, there was no stopping the complaints and suggestions.																								But it all boiled down to one common criticism  not enough such interactions to create smoother communications channels between parents, teachers and the school, something that the institution hopes to rectify in future.																								The school ran up a Rs-1.5 lakh bill for the event, but the result was worth the expenditure.

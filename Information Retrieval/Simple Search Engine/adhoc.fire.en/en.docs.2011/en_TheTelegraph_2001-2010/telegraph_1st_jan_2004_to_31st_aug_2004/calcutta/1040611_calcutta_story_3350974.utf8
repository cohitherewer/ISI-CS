 Friday, June 11, 2004 Workings of a world within 
A workplace can never be oppressive as long as there are people proud of their inner lives and private kingdoms, as Samir Mukerjee discoveredWhen I joined Martin Burn Ltd, in January 1956, straight out of Cambridge, I did not know what to expect. The company was a family concern, so I wasnt terribly intimidated by the impersonal atmosphere, but the strangeness of a vast mercantile concern did cause minor pinpricks.I was taken to the accounts department by my father, who was one of the managing directors. The officers stood up and greeted me with welcoming smiles. I sat at one of the desks with no clutter in front of me. Goodness knew what was to follow.I noticed all the officers poring over their files, writing on their pads. The clerks had a preoccupied air and were moving from room to room with files and ledgers and what-have-you.In a corner, the Anglo-Indian stenographer clattered away at the typewriter. She was comely and presentable, concentrating on her work with the utmost seriousness.In the purchase department we had an extraordinary man as the boss. P.C. Ghosh wasnt just the epitome of benevolence, he exuded a different kind of radiance which probably came from his proximity to Swami Yogananda, seer and philosopher.Once I settled down, I shared my literary and other interests with quite a few of the officers. Ashis Kumar Roy was one such colleague, a voracious reader and addicted to the world of drama. He came from a family that dabbled in literature and with him around, boredom couldnt set in.In the metal department, I came across two other men, P. Mukherjee and Tarun Sarkar, who had a rich cultural life and their intellectual curiosity made their companionship sturdy and robust.Although they worked devilishly hard, they always had time for the latest books and journals. As they were both fond of Tagore, one heard a lot about Rabindranaths songs and memorable poems from them.Strangely enough, a number of members of the Tagore family were tucked away in hidden corners of our office. I met Abanindranaths son Manindranath Tagore, Samarendranaths son Joyendra Tagore and Abanindranaths grandson Tarak Mukherjee. Our chief cashier, P.N. Mukherjee, also belonged to this redoubtable clan.Members of a sacred world, dynamic and pulsating, imaginative and creative had got into a commercial organisation just to make ends meet.Some of the departmental heads were very pleasant Englishmen. They were benign, approachable and affable. Officers like A.G. Gidley, M.F. Anderson, J.W. Fawcett, Ted Acons and S.C. Newman were very friendly with my parents and they often met for lunches, teas and dinners.One of our directors, F.G. Liversedge, went to Tahiti on one of his holidays. During one of our annual steamer trips, I remember him saying he could not forget the uninhibited and uncluttered lives of the people there. He also talked about Gaugins love for these simple people.Anderson was a dyed-in-the-wool Scotsman who had a house in Lossiemouth, in Northern Scotland. We called him Uncle Jock and were charmed by his sunny disposition. He could burst into Roaming in the Gloaming any time.Whenever he lunched with my father at Firpos, he sent me and my brother our favourite chocolates. How we looked forward to his weekly gift, how we gorged on them shamelessly.For a good many years, Uncle Jock and Aunty Koko and my parents were almost inseparable. It was the sort of abiding friendship that leaves a lingering scent behind.The Anglo-Indian girls working there were pretty and often seductively perfumed. They were easy to talk to and their smiles and chatter broke the monotony of a dull and repetitive office life. They made excellent secretaries, never divulged secrets and were models of discipline.Martin Burn retained its flavour as long as the Anglo-Indian girls were around. After them, we sensed a deluge in the offing.The clerks of Martin Burn Ltd surprised me at every step. A lot of them were avid readers and had strong political views. They were members of various cine clubs, where they were regularly exposed to Bergman, Fellini and Truffaut.Quite a few of them from the accounts department took trekking seriously and were climbing mountains and hills during their long holidays. Some were seasoned photographers.Keshto Chatterjee of the sales tax department was a bookworm and gently led me into the world of novelist Narendra Nath Mitra. If any writer understood the Bengali middle-class psyche with its infinite quirks and complexities, it was him.Keshtobabu was friendly with poets Pronobendu Das Gupta and Alokeranjan Das Gupta, whose works extended his vistas and coloured his life. He was also a regular cinema-goer and his enthusiastic response to serious Western films gave him a distinctiveness which others lacked.Even today, he writes to me regularly, with suitable quotations from poets who meant something to him.There was also the Left brigade that spawned some inflammable kinds, like Sakti Banerjee. He was an active member of the Gana Natya Sangha and must have staged innumerable street plays with agit-prop as its main ingredient.As a dedicated communist, he believed in the cause he espoused. The class struggle wasnt just an empty phrase for Saktibabu. He used to bring me the magazine Gana Natya regularly and, occasionally, the party newspaper Desh Hitaishi.At the end of the day, I think of those clerks who were steeped in music and gave private lessons at home. Subodh Ganguly concentrated on Loksangeet and Baul songs. Towering above everyone else was Himangshu Banerjee, of our cash department, who exuded music from every pore and could never talk enough about the delirious effects of Bade Ghulam Ali Khans poignant outpourings.Martin Burn could never be oppressive, the exaltations could never fade as long as there were people proud of their inner lives and private kingdoms.

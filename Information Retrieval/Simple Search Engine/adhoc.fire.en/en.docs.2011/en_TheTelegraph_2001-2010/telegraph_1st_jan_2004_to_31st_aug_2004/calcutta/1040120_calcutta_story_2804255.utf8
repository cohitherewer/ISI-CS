 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Shah slur on former chief of SSKM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After a punishment posting for the death of Susmita Biswas, Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay, former surgeon superintendent of SSKM Hospital, faces yet another departmental proceeding. This time, the charge is dereliction of duty, levelled by Governor Viren J. Shah.																								On September 5, mason Tapan Bera had an accidental fall while working at Raj Bhavan. He was rushed to SSKMs emergency wing around 7.30 pm in a serious condition. However, the hospital authorities, apart from bandaging Beras injuries on the head and body, did little else. Around 9.30 pm, Raj Bhavan officials called up SSKM, with a request to look into the case.																								But Bera continued to languish, prompting Raj Bhavan to get in touch with surgeon superintendent Chattopadhyay. An acute space crunch forced SSKM to ask Beras family to shift him elsewhere. Around 11.30 pm, he was taken to National Medical College and Hospital and from there to a private nursing home. Seven days later, Bera died. His family alleged neglect at SSKM, which had refused him admission. 																								The case was taken up by Governor Shah, who asked health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and his department to intervene. Accordingly, investigations were launched into the charges of negligence against Chattopadhyay and the doctor on duty. 																								Chattopadhyay said he was in the dark about the latest slur on him, but director of medical education C.R. Maiti admitted that action was being initiated against the former surgeon superintendent. The punishment has not been finalised yet, he added.

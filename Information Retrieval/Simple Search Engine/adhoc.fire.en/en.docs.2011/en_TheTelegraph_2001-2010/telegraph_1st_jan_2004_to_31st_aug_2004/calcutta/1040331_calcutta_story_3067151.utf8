The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Hawkers jam streets
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hawkers crippled traffic in central Calcutta by blocking Ganesh Chandra Avenue for nearly an hour on Tuesday afternoon.																								They were protesting their eviction and police extortion, and demanding that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) grant them licences.																								More than 70 of them were arrested around 4 pm for refusing to budge. Central Avenue, Nirmal Chandra Street, Bowbazar Street, College Street and Dharamtala Street were some of the major roads affected.																								Conservancy department officials estimate that the number of hawkers has doubled over the past three years. They linked the sudden spurt of protests to the CMCs decision to narrow down pavements and widen roads.

Pix by Rashbehari Das Painter Sujoy Majumdar with guests at his painting exhibition															Artist Sanjoy Majumdars 10th solo exhibition of paintings was inaugurated at The Address, the lifestyle shop-cum-gallery on Shakespeare Sarani recently by Nicholas Blasquez, director of Alliance Francaise Calcutta, and Susan Schultz, public affairs officer of the American Centre. The works displayed are all oil paintings done with the wash technique. Unlike most artists who do oil paintings, Majumdar has allowed the paint to flow and shape itself, a technique normally used in works done with watercolours. Particularly eye-catching was his 8 feet by 4 feet tribute to Michelangelo, which is done on masonite.																					The artist, who was born and brought up in Mumbai, began painting before he could even talk. His training started early under the guidance of Mihir Majumdar and Ashok Banerjee, but he did not always want to be a professional painter. Majumdar got himself a degree in microbiology and dabbled in management before yielding to the charms of his passion. He has been a full-time, professional painter for around eight years now and has held 15 group exhibitions. Starting from 1997, when he held his first exhibition at Domas Art Gallery, his works have been exhibited all over India and in Bangladesh. His next exhibition is slated to be held at the Lalit Kala Academy in New Delhi. Says Majumdar, My paintings are invariably personal and reflect the phases of my life. I try to freeze time in my works. If I can recreate particular moments from my life through my paintings, then I would consider it an achievement.																					The day after the inauguration of the exhibition, Majumdar interacted with the members of the International Womens Council of Calcutta to commemorate International Womens Day. Some of the members of the council, who are amateur painters themselves, created a composition on a canvas along with Majumdar.																					The exhibition of Sanjoy Majumdars works will continue till March 10 at The Address, which remains open from 11 am to 7 pm on weekdays except Monday, when it remains open from 2.30 pm to 7 pm. Devdatta shows off an outfit from Earthy Myths 												Summer chic																					Designer Sucheta Merh has been a busy lady these past few weeks adding the finishing touches to her brand new collection of summer chic styles. And whats she got in store for fashionistas in the city this time around? A whole lot of kotas and breezy georgettes in prints and patterns that can only originate from Earthy Myths, her studio at 8/2, Loudon Street. 																					Especially appealing is the range of crisp kota saris (ranging between Rs 990 and Rs 2,950) in vanilla shades with interesting crushed pallus. Adornments here come by way of vibrantlycoloured appliqud flowers with unstitched edges for a bit of the unfinished look thats all the rage nowadays. In fact, if theres one particular embellishment trend that Sucheta has explored increasingly for her new line, its appliqu-work. Several of her creations for the season be it saris, salwar-kameezes or kurtas, show off different types of appliqu such as printed appliqu sprinkled with sequins, eye-catching mud appliqu, crepe appliqu and even patchwork appliqu graced with intricate kantha. 																					so a part of the summer line-up are a range of georgette and organza saris, starting from about Rs 1,350. The motifs are usually floral in keeping with the spirit of spring and the colours of the collection vary from refreshing pastel hues such as summer greens, icecream pinks and aqua shades to brighter peaches and blues. Simple yet extremely chic, Suchetas kurta sets (pegged at Rs 1,800 onwards) are also a great buy. In solid colours with floral appliqu patterns on the shoulder, these are ideal for beating the heat in style.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Violence, arrests and a repoll
 OUR BUREAU				 	 The ransacked polling centre at Barrackpores Hindi UP School, where voters smashed EVMs and beat up poll officials for having been kept waiting in the sun for more than three hours. There were complaints of booth-jamming, too. Picture by Soumen Bhattacharya																								On the face of it, polling on Monday passed off without anything worth reporting. 																								But booth-jamming and rigging were very much in evidence at both Barrackpore and Howrah parliamentary constituencies, where 11 people were injured in poll-related violence. Two electronic voting machines (EVMs) were smashed in Barrackpore.																								Later in the evening, the Election Commission ordered a repoll on Wednesday in three booths, two in Barrackpore and one in Howrah, where polling was cancelled midway owing to violence.																								Around 12.30 pm, people kept waiting for over three hours outside two booths set up at Hindi UP School, in the Titagarh Assembly segment of Barrackpore, barged into booths 93 and 94 and smashed the EVMs. Broken pieces were thrown into an adjacent drain and polling officers were beaten up.																								We waited here for hours, but from early morning, CPM cadres had jammed the booth. Local people lost their cool and destroyed the machines, said Ramesh Shaw, an eyewitness. 																								While the CPM alleged that Trinamul workers were behind the attack, Arjun Singh, Trinamul Congress candidate, has complained to the central observers that a local CPM leader led the mob. Later, five men were arrested on charges of ransacking booths in Barrackpore. In Howrah, 26 people were rounded up for poll-related violence.																								In Howrah, repolling was ordered at Beral Primary High School, in the Kalyanpur Assembly segment, where Trinamul and Congress activists resorted to booth-jamming, denying voters a chance to cast their ballot. 																								In Barrackpore, several Trinamul agents were assaulted and thrown out of the booths. Debasish Dutta, Trinamul polling agent in booth no. 11 and 12 in Halisahar, under Bijpur Assembly segment, was first threatened with death by CPM cadres and then thrown out from the booth around 11 am.																								Surendra Naik, in booth 107, in Titagarh, and H. Naik in the adjacent booth were beaten up by CPM cadres and removed from the booths. Angry Trinamul supporters retaliated by hurling bombs at a CPM party office in Bhatpara.																								Even in Howrah, particularly in the south, central and north, Trinamul agents were nowhere to be seen in the booths. 																								The situation took a violent turn at Dinabandhu Institution in Howrah, where Trinamul agents tried to re-enter the booths, only to be thrown out. Police in both Howrah and Barrackpore remained inactive. 																								The Election Commission removed a presiding officer, Jaduptai Kandar, from a Nimdhariya booth in Deganga, under Barasat parliamentary constituency, for allegedly asking voters to vote for a particular political party candidate.																								Booth-jamming was witnessed in Howrah, where people waited in vain to cast their votes, and returned home helplessly  first at Dinabandhu Institution in Shibpur, where voters waited for three hours, and at Salkia AS High School, where booth-jamming forced valid voters to walk back dejectedly, when they were allegedly informed by CPM agents that their votes had already been cast. 																								In another case, CPM activists forced reporters holding EC identity cards out of the polling premises at Salkia Hanuman Vidyalay (booth no. 162/33) when they were caught rigging. 																								In Howrah and Barrackpore, valid voters were intimidated and asked not to turn up at booths from Sunday itself. I ignored the threats and went to the booth, but some CPM cadres threatened to kill me and even my wife and children, Samir Mukherjee, a resident of Purbachal in Halisahar added. 																								In Howrah, Atindra and Suprabha Chakraboty were assaulted as they dared to report that someone had cast their votes.

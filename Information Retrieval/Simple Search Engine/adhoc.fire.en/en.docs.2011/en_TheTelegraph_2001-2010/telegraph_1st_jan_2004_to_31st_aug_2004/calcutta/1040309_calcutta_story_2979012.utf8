Students at a government-run college: Pick up the tab for the skills you learnMost colleges in the state operate on government grants, and charge students  economically able and impoverished  a pittance. While the degree and source of subsidy have been different, depending on the institute, few can be reasonably sustained through fees. Young Metro asked readers to take out the Time to Talk about whether higher education should be subsidised by the state at all. Here are the first few answers received, with more to follow next week:				 				 																															lArguments for subsidising higher education are plenty. In a welfare state, education is for public benefit, and has a trickle-down effect on the rest of society. This in turn can cause significant changes in demographic structure and qualities, particularly for developing countries. This leads to a drop in poverty, crime rate, strengthening of democracy Education is a commodity with intrinsic value, consumption of which ought to be encouraged. It also goes with the concept of equality of opportunity.				 				 																															But there is another side to the coin. It is often argued that equal subsidies for all, even the rich, is unfair and subsidies for higher education should be given in the form of scholarships to the needy.Ranjana Das,
Lady Brabourne CollegeSubsidising education is mea-ningless unless more jobs are generated to absorb graduates.Pravati Maulik Gupta, 
IIIrd year, Shri Shikshayatan CollegeHigher education should not be subsidised. It only has an adverse effect on the infrastructure of institutes of higher learning. The national and global repute of these institutions will also be at stake. If there is a reduction in the fee, it will be difficult to maintain excellence in educational standards. Fee cuts make it difficult to keep up standards of faculty, libraries, IT and management. Rather, scholarships or stipends can be granted to bright but economically weak students. A number of banks offer educational loans that can be repaid over time.				 				 																															Rimli DattaHigher education is already greatly subsidised, and any cuts in fees should make us wary of compromising quality. If the government can assure that quality shall not suffer, any financial help is welcome as many students are unable to meet the financial demands of higher studies.Linda Lopa Ashok,
Class XI, K.V.O.F Dum DumWithout higher education for all, betterment of the system is impossible. So it is important to ensure that it is as accessible as possible to the largest number of people.Tanmoy Ghosh,
IInd year, Asutosh CollegeThis is currently a hot topic of discussion across the country. Increasing subsidies in specialist institutes is totally uncalled for. If the government is allowed to interfere with the financial choices of all institutes, control also increases. Now there are a lot of banks and financial institutions that offer loans at competitive rates. So whatever the cost, higher education is not out of the reach of the deserving, though financially troubled, students.Subhobrata Basu,
Bharatiya Vidya BhavanReducing fees further is asking too much of higher education institutes, at par with the best in the world. This can only lead to increased involvement of government in all matters of education administration. Higher education in India should be affordable. But reduction in fees will lower the teaching standards too. Credibility is also at stake.Saurabh Dhanuka,

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Multiplex multiplied: bigger, better
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Eight months of record-breaking performance later, the citys first multiplex has multiplied. And this time, its bigger and, they say, better.																								City Centre, in Salt Lake, is the destination for INOX II, with more space for the same price. Two levels of cinema-viewing pleasure have been packed into Salt Lakes newest mall, starting Friday.																								We expect INOX City Centre to do even better than the one at Forum, primarily because of the ample parking space available. Plus, City Centre is bigger and its the first plaza of its kind in Salt Lake, feels Shishir Baijal, CEO, INOX.																								If the first days sales are anything to go by, then the second multiplex, partly funded by UBI, is more than likely to live up to all expectations. Opened for advance bookings on June 16, tickets sold out before you could say Hrithik Roshan  all 10 shows of Lakshya over the weekend are house full, with an earning of Rs 6.79 lakh on Day One. 																								Wider screens, more space and semi-circular seating promise an even better movie experience, promises Baijal.																								Movie buffs, meanwhile, can look forward to innovative ideas from the INOX stable, with a centralised call centre for information, SMS and Internet booking, home delivery of tickets and even calorie-conscious mini meals on the menu at Refuel, on the way in.																								For a fix on the multiplex success story in Calcutta, one need only look at the figures at the Elgin Road hall  in the first eight months of its existence, INOX raked in Rs 7.17 crore. The annual earnings from its three locations in India moved up more than a few notches to Rs 30.16 crore in 2003-04 from Rs 16.05 crore the previous year.																								The hall recorded the highest ticket sales in a day in the country with Rs 6.67 lakh on June 13, beating its own mark. And the record for highest advance booking goes to INOX, too, for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hum Tum, Kal Ho Naa Ho and Yuva, says Baijal.																								In fact, with the arrival of INOX at Forum, the footfall went up by 40 per cent, and revenue at retail outlets rose by 20 to 25 per cent, because of impulse buys, adds the CEO.																								Not to mention the fact that the viewing of Bengali and animation films has been phenomenal  if Chokher Bali ran for five weeks, Bombaiyer Bombetey had a five-week stint at 85 per cent occupancy, if Finding Nemo clocked up 50 per cent occupancy for eight weeks, Peter Pan was screened for seven weeks.																								The popularity of the morning and late-night slots have shot up, too, from 10 per cent to 40 per cent occupancy. Besides, Calcuttans now get simultaneous releases of Hollywood blockbusters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Quality thrust, from city to suburb
 															- Hall Takeover part of programming for exhibition network A STAFF REPORTER																								After the city centre, the districts. After Globe and Metro in Chowringhee, its Annapurna in Sonarpur. 																								Having consolidated its urban base, film exhibitor and distributor Priya Entertainment is eyeing a major chunk of the rural cine-going populace as part of a move to strengthen its exhibition network. 																								In less than a month of acquiring Metro cinema in partnership with Sri Venkatesh Films, the organisation, with hall-owner Arijit Dutta at the helm, has taken over the reins of Annapurna cinema, located off the proposed National Highway. The takeover deal was signed on Thursday.																								The acquisition is aimed at strengthening our exhibition chain across the state. It gives us more bargaining power in the districts. We started with acquiring Gitanjali in Santiniketan. Annapurna was picked because it has a monopoly in South 24-Parganas, said Dutta, owner of Priya cinema and president of the Eastern India Motion Picture Association (EIMPA).																								On Thursday, Annapurna became part of the programming devised for a chain of theatres, comprising Priya, Basusree and Navina in the citys south, Globe and Metro in central, Mitra and Jaya in the north and Gitanjali in the district. The programming, which decides which film is to be screened at which hall, is devised jointly by Venkatesh Films, owner of Navina cinema, and Priya Entertaiment.																								Just as the multiplex chain cutting across the country, we want to offer the distributors a state-wide chain of theatres that can screen quality films, Dutta added. Screening quality films will remain a priority even in the suburbs. Though the rural halls mainly run commercial Bengali movies, Dutta felt sporadic screening of quality films will let the audience acquire a finer taste. 																								Take Gitanjali cinema, for instance. After the takeover, we started showing quality films on and off at the hall, which used to run only commercial films. Now, our collections have soared by 40-50 per cent, more than what the commercial releases used to bring in, added Dutta, who wants to bring about a dramatic change in the quality of screening, sound and ambience of the district halls. 																								Priya Entertainment will also branch out to Burdwan and some pockets of Midnapore. Talks with hall-owners have reached the final stages. But only those theatres will be chosen where the management and payment to distributors is right, insisted Dutta. All the halls will be given a facelift, with refurbished toilets and seating arrangements.																								Annapurna, which is currently showing Agni, will be closed for renovation once the film is taken off.

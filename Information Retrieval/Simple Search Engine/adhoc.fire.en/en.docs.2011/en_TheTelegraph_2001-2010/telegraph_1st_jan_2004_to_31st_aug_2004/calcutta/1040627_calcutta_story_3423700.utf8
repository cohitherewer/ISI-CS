 Sunday, June 27, 2004 Power to the pester people
Catch them young is the loudest anthem in advertising. But throwing caution to the winds is dangerousShiloo Chattopadhyay adLIB Virender Coca Cola Sehwag woos a kidIt was only a few weeks ago that we discussed the story of a kid who rode a tricycle imagining it to be a bike. The only explanation the two-year-old had provided was a big huuuush in front of the TV. The conjecture was that the ads on television made his imagination flourish.Now, another story has hit the headlines. A nine-year-old girl of our city was trying to demonstrate an act that she saw on TV to her younger sibling. Unfortunately, the act involved something akin to a hanging rope. She died in the process. The act that this particular girl was trying to emulate may or may not have been from a television ad. The point is, it could have been. That clearly was the case in some previous, equally tragic, instances. And that is worrying. Most fingers are pointed towards the admen. Yet, it is unreasonable to put the blame only on them.Look at the sea change around us. Even in the late 1970s or early 80s, it was rare for a six or even a 16-year-old to tell his father to buy a particular brand of refrigerator. Today, it is the dominant reality.Advertising till then was in the adult domain. TV carried advertising, but children were not attracted. Nor did they care much about the print media. So, advertising stayed out of their orbit. Marketing in India then was simple. Or so they thought. The encapsulation was brief  sell to the trade and talk to the wife. In case of slightly more expensive goods, the target was the man of the house.First, the national network and then the satellite transmissions changed all that. Then came colour television. It made the content and the advertising look a lot more enticing.Just for Gen-Y: Britney Spears in a Pepsi ad. Today, television is family fare. These days, brand decisions are taken democratically. Each member of the household has a vote. But children, many suspect, enjoy a slight advantage. They exploit the soft corners we have for our children and swing the votes in their favour. Marketers know it. So do the creators of communication.Desirability of this change could have merited a moral debate. It perhaps is a bit late in the day now. That is possibly the most crucial point. The inevitability of this phenomenon. Children will watch every ad we create.Obviously we need to be a lot more careful. Is it feasible? Can a creative team really keep the ill-effects on a child in mind when writing the storyboard for a Honda bike or a Thums Up variant? Highly unlikely.The need to be different, to be noticeable, is too strong. The advertiser is ultimately the publisher of the communication. They have to be cautious. And responsible. A simple first step could be a belief that an extra percent share of the market is less important than loss of a young life. Easier said than done.

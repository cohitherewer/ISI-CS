	With the onset of summer, roadside vendors have resumed selling lemonade in front of Birla Planetarium, Victoria Memorial and elsewhere. The CMC health officials should ascertain whether the water used by the vendors is safe for consumption. Most sellers seldom bother to clean the water containers.

	Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia.

 																											- Bapis friends seek retribution for ruthless and deliberate attack A STAFF REPORTER																								Shalake mere phel. Ekdom shesh kore de (Kill him finish him off)  these were the words the five rogue constables screamed while showering kicks and blows on Bapi Sen. The ferocity with which they were dealt has convinced the witnesses of the crime that those responsible for Bapi Sens death should be dealt with a heavy hand.																								Not only Bapis friends, others who witnessed the deadly attack and deposed before the judge during the one-year-and-five-month trial, believe in retribution. They raised their voice saying: The five constables have killed him. Now, they should be dealt a heavy blow.																								Looking back on the night of the murder, Kanai Kundu, one of the four friends who were out with Bapi, finds it difficult to forget the 20-minute tragedy. It was a night that will haunt me forever. Five young men pounced on him and beat him up ruthlessly. They were determined to silence him forever, said Kundu, who identified all five guilty constables of the Reserve Force.																								Recounting the incident, Kundu, who is posted in Howrah police station, said: It was around 1 am on January 1, 2003, and we were in a festive mood. We were driving down Nirmal Chandra Dey Street from Park Street. The moment we crossed the Lenin Sarani intersection and were heading towards Hind cinema, we spotted a taxi moving alongside a motorcycle with a young woman riding pillion. We saw the youth in the cab were shouting at the woman and gesticulating at her.																								Bapi and his friends knew something was amiss when they noticed one of the youths lean out of the window and try to pull the womans hair. 																								As our vehicle moved closer to the taxi and blocked its way partly, Bapi got off and ran towards the men. The moment he dragged out one, the four others jumped out of the vehicle and surrounded him. All five started beating him, recalled Kundu. 																								Ganesh Bain, a guard appointed by the traders of Nirmal Chandra Dey Street, said: All five should be awarded capital punishment because of the deliberate manner in which they killed Bapi.

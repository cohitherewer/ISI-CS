 Tax-payers fill out their return forms at Ayakar Bhavan. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryDiptimoy Ghosh: Could you please elaborate on the procedure of e-filing of tax returns?																																																													The return form can be downloaded free from our website, www.nsdl.com. The tax-payer will have to load the return file in an electronic form, that is, in a floppy or on a compact disc (CD). He can deposit the same at the nearest Tax Info Network (TIN) centre. The return form, stored in the floppy, will be accepted there and he will be handed back the floppy, along with a paper receipt as acknowledgement. Both personal returns and company returns can be filed this way. To locate the TIN centre nearest to you, please contact our public relations executives.

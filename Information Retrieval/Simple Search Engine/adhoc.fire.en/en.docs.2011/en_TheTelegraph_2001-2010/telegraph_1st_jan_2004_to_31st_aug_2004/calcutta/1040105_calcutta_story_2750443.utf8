	I work in an office on Shakespeare Sarani, next to HSBC.  A stretch of the pavement there has been converted into  a urinal. Although traffic police are posted at the corner,  they do not haul up or fine those relieving themselves.  For women, it is awkward to walk past. This needs to be  stopped.

	The government is on a drive to realise land revenue from  plot-holders. But it is an uphill task. The collection centres  have few staff, and it takes hours to deposit the money.  It could be collected with municipal taxes to save time. 
	 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road.

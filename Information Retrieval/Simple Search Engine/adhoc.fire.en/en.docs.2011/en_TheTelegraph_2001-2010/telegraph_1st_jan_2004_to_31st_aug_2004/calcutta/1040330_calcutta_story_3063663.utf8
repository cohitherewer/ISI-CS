An expert from Ruf International, the Danish company that provides monorail services, met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers Buildings on Monday and briefed him about Rufs plan to introduce monorail services in the city and adjoining areas. There are a number of proposals for introduction of monorail services in Calcutta and the suburbs. One such proposal is to provide monorail services between Joka and Barasat and another between Naihati and Namkhana. But nothing has been finalised yet, said Chakraborty. According to the proposal, the monorail will be operational 20 ft above the ground. If necessary, it can ply on the road with the help of a multiple wheel system fitted with the rail. A preliminary study puts the cost at Rs 600 crore for every 50 km.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Now, easy access to Calcuttas annals
 															- Town hall to throw open its treasure trove reading room RAJRUPA GHOSH				 	 The Town Hall: A leaf out of history																								The Calcutta Disturbances Commission of Inquiry, Record of Proceedings, minutes of evidence between February 1, 1947, to February 13, 1947, had kept track of all the deaths and mishaps that happened in Calcutta in that period. India gained independence six months later and all such evidences were set ablaze. Only one copy remains now, up a winding staircase, down a musty hallway, tucked away in a Town Hall bookcase.																								With it lie other books, documents, magazines, journals, maps and illustrations  most a few centuries old, and each carrying with it the essence of a Calcutta that was.																								Come August 25, anybody can access this treasure trove of information at the Town Hall Library and Archive, maintained by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). On the heels of its hi-tech storytelling museum, Calcutta Panorama, the Town Hall will now throw open the doors of its public reading room at its Esplanade Row (West) address. 																								Interested readers, provided with a years free membership card, will enjoy easy access to any rare document minus the hassles of picking up a book from National Library, officials claim.																								Digging deep into Calcuttas history for the making of Calcutta Panorama, through books, documents and pictures had started way back in 1999  three years before it happened. A Town Hall official said: We had collected thousands of books, of which the most authentic ones came from research scholar P.T. Nairs personal collection.																								The Keralite historian has been working on rebuilding Calcuttas history for the past 40 years now. His collection of over 5,500 books were bought by the CMC in 1999 for Rs 10 lakh. Ever since, the books have been lying at the Town Hall. Of the 5,500 books, 3,850 can be classified as rare. 																								With so many people interested in information and with such a lot of resource material, painstakingly gathered, at our disposal, its only logical that we share our treasure trove with others, added the Town Hall official.																								These books are very close to my heart. I wouldnt buy any book or document unless I was sure that it wouldnt be available anywhere else. There isnt a second copy of most text material youll find here, stressed P.T. Nair.

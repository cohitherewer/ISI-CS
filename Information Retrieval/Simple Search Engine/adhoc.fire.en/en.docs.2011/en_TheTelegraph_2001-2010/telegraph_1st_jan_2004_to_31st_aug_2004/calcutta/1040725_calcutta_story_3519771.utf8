The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 25, 2004 Bank on us, Kalidasa style
AdLibSir, i am calling from your bank. My antenna was up. Did I overshoot my credit-card limit? Wasnt last months cheque deposited on time? I was convinced something had gone wrong somewhere. Why else would someone from my bank call me? The person proceeded to explain that the kind of savings bank account I have is totally inappropriate and I should switch to a new type of account the bank had launched.A week later, when I got back home, my wife was sitting with a stranger. I overheard the stranger ask a few questions to my wife. The details being sought were not the kind that I would like to advertise. I intervened and my wife hastened to pacify. She explained that the person was from the bank. In her book, like mine, bankers, doctors and lawyers are completely trustworthy.To both these persons I tried to explain a simple thing  the details they are seeking are all available with the bank. Something like my date of birth, which I had given when I opened my account. I assured them that it has not changed since. Some other information the bank should have known better than me. Indeed, who but my bank would know my month-end balance better? In fact, I suggested that they get in touch with the person who the bank has assigned to look after my interests.Their responses were varied. One tried to hoodwink me by suggesting that my relationship manager had left the bank (I had met him the previous afternoon). The other said he was from a far more hallowed division of the bank and mere mortals like a relationship manager would never comprehend the full import of his and his divisions mission. Cash in: Rupa Ganguly roped in for an image boostI must admit that all this left me very confused  both as a customer and as a student of marketing. Consumer or retail banking, I am told, is the name of the game. Relationship-building is the key. After all, who can complain about the sellers of services becoming more consumer-oriented? The issue really lies in the execution.Many banks, it would appear, have misinterpreted the term relationship building. Aggressive selling is possibly not the best tool to build relationships with. Worse still if you are exploiting the bankers credentials to intrude into consumer homes. Strong revenue pressure, multiple financial products, and multiple divisions responsible for the products  banks are becoming hydra-headed. One head often is totally ignorant about what the other is doing.To the consumer, the bank is a single entity, a financial supermarket. It, therefore, hurts the banks credibility when the so-called relationship manager pleads helplessness if a shop unjustifiably refuses to honour a customers credit card.The core value of a bank has always been trust. No marketing strategy is worth its name if it devalues that core value. Consumer or retail banking, in its current form, is possibly doing just that.It is a bit like Kalidasa chopping the same branch of a tree on which he was sitting.

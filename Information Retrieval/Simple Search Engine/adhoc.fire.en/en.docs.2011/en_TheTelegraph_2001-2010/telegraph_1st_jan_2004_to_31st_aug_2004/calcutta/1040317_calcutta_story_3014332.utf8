The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 17, 2004  A feast of cricket, match for match Whats on the menu? Skipper Sourav Ganguly (above) is the inspiration behind Maharajas Favourite, (top) being served up at Cloud 9. Picture by Pabitra Das Getting hyper watching the action beyond the LoC caged up in your living room? Lighten the mood, while not missing a single over of the hottest clash since the World Cup. Some of the most happening places are cashing in on the cricket craze with a host of offers for those who cant stand to be too far away from Sourav and the boys in blue as they take on Inzys gang in green:																					Perfect pitch																					Action enabled Astor? You bet (or maybe not), and larger than life. A giant screen will keep drinkers and diners glued at Cloud 9, the restobar. At arms length are life-size cutouts of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Shoaib Akhtar and Inzamam-ul Haq. The entrance now resembles a pitch, the interiors are done up with cricket gear, with waiters dressed in Indian jerseys.																					The selectors choice: Go bottoms up as you raise a toast to the Pakistani team going belly up (may the best man win, you say? Get outta here!) Try a sip of an Opener (Smirnoff with Kahlua and Crme de Cacao), or go Between the Gully (Smirnoff, Brandy, Cointreau and orange juice). Cheer the boys on as you have a First Fifty (Smirnoff, rum with Hot Tea Liqueur), or better yet, a Century (Smirnoff, rum, gin and tequila).																					Munch break: Is a must, with snacks to keep it light. Mr Dependable (summer vegetable cooked in Schezwan sauce), Hit Wicket (potato fingers with cajun spices), Bouncer (cheese and cornballs with salsa), Maharajas Favourite (grilled chicken with cajun spices), Zaheers Bouncer (stuffed chicken with olive and orange sauce) and Man of the Match (ginger-flavoured barbecued prawns) are some of the yummies on offer.																					One for the galleries: There are prizes to be won for those who guess the Man of the Match or highest run-scorer correctly. Each time an Indian batsman hits a six, the drink or food on the table is repeated.																					Since most cant follow Team India from town to town, settle for a new bar stool instead...																																													Passion play...																					At London Pub, at the Golden Park Hotel, where a tattoo painter will man the entrance to paste cricket logos and India flags on guests. Matches will be telecast, during which time 50 per cent discounts will be available on F amp;B. Feel at the centre of it all, surrounded by stumps, cricket balls, bats																																													Its a stadium...At least... Well, kind of, when you are at The Stadel, the Salt Lake stadium hotel. If that isnt enough, pay a Rs 249 cover charge and get four pints of beer and free-flowing snacks. At Heka, the bar, and First Innings, the restaurant, special snacks include Souravs Match-Winning Decision (chicken Peshawari kebab), the Rawalpindi Express vs Grand Maratha Express, Shoaibs Dahi Jeera Kebab with Sachins Mint Chutney.																																													Park yourself...																					At The Park. Matches are being beamed live on a giant Plasma TV at The Atrium Caf. Happy hours are on at Someplace Else, during matches, with the fun extending to cocktails, mocktails, draught beer and other select alcoholic beverages. Interesting stakes on beer, with special discounts on pints.																																													Bottoms up...																					And you can take your pick of destination, too. At The Incognito, Taj Bengal, catch the matches live and cough up a cover charge of Rs 360 for unlimited Kingfisher and Bacardi Breezers. 																					Stay glued at The Big Ben, The Kenilworth, and get a 30 per cent discount on alcoholic beverages during the ODIs. For Rs 125 per couple, get two draughts of beer free.																					Shisha, the hookah bar at Grain of Salt, has discount offers on alcoholic beverages between 1.30 pm to 9 pm on match days.																					At Winning Streak, the sports bar at The HHI, matches will be screened on a giant screen. Palm Court finds beer flowing for Rs 299 during the games and at The Blues, the recently opened restobar, a bottle of Fosters beer comes free.																																													Call in sick...																					And use your phone for some more good. At ITC Sonar Bangla, Eden Pavilion scores with 25 per cent on the buffet while the matches are on, for Airtel subscribers. Open for all is the offer at the Westview Bar and Grill, where, for Rs 250, the Kingfisher just keeps on coming, as long as the cricket does.																					Down the bypass, the Hyatt Regency welcomes Hutch users with The Bar offering unlimited beer and kebabs for Rs 499. A 30 per cent discount is being dished out, for the lunch and dinner buffet.																																													Keep it real...																					And sweat it out, like the boys on the run in Rawalpindi, if you choose. While you could do that on the Maidan any day of the year, opt instead for floodlit comfy evenings at the CC amp;FC, where a Merchants Cup six-a-side cricket tournament is in progress. The final face-off is slated for March 20.																																													...virtual will do, too																					So what if it doesnt have an address? Happy Club members will also be able to join in the revelry on March 21. At MBD Airport Hotel, members of the virtual club can cheer, cry scream at every ball, with a big screen, food and beverages at a happy price for the company.

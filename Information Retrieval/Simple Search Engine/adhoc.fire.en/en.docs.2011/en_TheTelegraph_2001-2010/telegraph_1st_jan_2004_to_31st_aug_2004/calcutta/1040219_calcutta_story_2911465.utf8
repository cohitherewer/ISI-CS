 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Three held for trader kidnap
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Less than 48 hours after Mohammad Abbas managed to give his abductors the slip, police detained three persons from the Metiabruz and Ekbalpore areas.																								Abbas, 26, had been kidnapped at gunpoint from his medical store, off CR Avenue, on Monday evening. Late at night, police laid a trap on the spot designated for the handover of the ransom and forced the kidnappers to flee without the money (Rs 1 lakh) or the victim.																								According to police sources, after nightlong interrogation, Mohammad Asif, who was arrested from Ekbalpore early on Tuesday, revealed the names of his associates and their hideouts. Asif said he had been asked to carry out the abduction by Pintu and knew all the others involved, except one person, who we suspect is the kingpin, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.																								The youths do not seem to be experts in the kidnapping-for-ransom business. So far, we have come to know that personal rivalry drove them to target Abbas, the officer added.																								Police sources went on to add that all the miscreants have not been identified yet. According to deputy commissioner of police (central division) Rajiv Kumar, raids would be carried out through the night to round up the remaining members of the kidnap gang. We have got some leads and should be able to wrap things up on Thursday, he added.

 Ball boys: A game on the way homeApropos the report Play hard to study hard, July 31, it is quite alarming that physical exercise and sports for children are gradually giving way to sedentary activities such as video games, bridge, chess or simply watching television. And this, after they spend most of their waking hours at the study table.  There are a lot of reasons behind such social conditioning of children and their parents. For a guardian today, his or her wards academic record is the pivotal point of the kids as well as the parents own life. School texts, class tests, tuitions, homework, assignments and sundry other regime throughout the day leave them with little or no time to indulge in outdoor games. As it is, most schools today are not equipped with open space to give students a chance to stretch their legs.  But physical exercise should be an intrinsic part of students curriculum. It helps them relax, get fresh air after being cooped up in a room all day, studying. Instead of television, video games or other new forms of entertainment, good old playing in the field or park releases the childs pent-up energy, making him less prone to bouts of violence or ill temper.  It is strange that parents think their children should take rest on Sundays, to wear off the hard labour they put in through the week. This is a ridiculous idea.  Studying is merely a part of life, it is not everything. Extracurricular activities not only help children unwind, they also give them the extra edge of confidence which props them up later in life in times of trouble. Biman Saha,
Lake Town. Apropos the report Parents push for sons arrest, July 24, it is tragic that parents are being forced to file suits in court pleading for their sons arrest. The case of a drug-addict torturing his father for money throws light on the plight of helpless parents, forced to put their son behind bars for their own safety. The problem of drug addiction has increased recently, and the government and NGOs have failed to control it despite numerous awareness programmes. The menace of drugs is increasingly hooking a section of youth from affluent backgrounds. Erosion of family values is suggested by the lifestyle of such youngsters. Rabindranath Kar,
Shankar Ghosh Lane. It was probably the first of its kind arrest in the city, with aged parents of 23-year-old Sourav Chatterjee calling the cops to take away their spoilt son for harassing them. Will Sourav change his attitude after being released from jail and reform as a human being? T.R. Anand,
Budge Budge. Apropos Steered by the cell, July 25, though there is a law of a Rs 100 fine on people talking on the cell phone while driving, nobody is ever caught. This gives people the chance to nurture the bad habit without any sense of guilt, even though the frequency of accidents in our city is increasing. Dev Mandi,
Karl Marx Sarani. Apropos the report Jailed for husband murder, absolved, July 30, Surita Bhattacharya, a staff nurse, was behind bars for about five years for murdering her husband. But she was freed recently by the order of Calcutta High Court. This once again points to the loopholes in the system. Sachindra Nath Mitra,
Beleghata.Apropos the report Polluters put paid to Lake restoration, July 23, it is unfortunate that a section of people lacking civic sense is polluting Rabindra Sarobar. The immediate need of the hour is to post security guards at the Lake in order to stop people from harming the waterbody. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty Road.Apropos the report Minerva scripts makeover masque, July 28, kudos to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority for its plan to revamp the old Minerva theatre and also use the area to house a museum on Utpal Dutt. It would be a treat for theatre lovers. Prahlad Agarwala,
Majdia.Apropos the report Tied to a tree, thrashed to death July 27, it was shocking to learn that a petty thief was lynched by a mob for stealing pieces of scrap iron. All the people involved should be rounded up and given exemplary punishment for the crime. Hara Lal Chakroborty,
Aurobindo Nagar.Apropos the report Hot words over car chaos, July 27, in order to ensure better traffic movement in the city, the transport minister mentioned expensive efforts for improving the infrastructure. However, measures like removal of pavement-dwellers, illegally parked cars, garbage, etc can be implemented easily. Trams could be withdrawn from narrow roads and buses made to stop only at designated stops. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
Behala. Apropos the letter Fruitful wish for mayors orchard scheme, August 19, orchards on the roads will attract ruffians who will pelt stones at trees to get hold of ripe fruits. The plan might lead to accidents when children, lured by fruits, would move at random on the carriageway. Instead, fruit tree samples could be distributed among interested people owning a plot of land at a nominal cost. A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,
Collin Lane.

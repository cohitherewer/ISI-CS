The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Challenged, but moving ahead
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sudam and Jeeja: Resolute voices. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Awareness, access, education, employment and legislation  five simple steps to build a better life for people with disabilities. But more often than not, these basic rights have to be fought for. It was to give them a platform to express their views that two organisations from different parts of the country came together in Calcutta on August 17 and 18.																								The problem is that people with cerebral palsy have no separate identity. In the disability act, cerebral palsy falls under the locomotive handicap segment. We are marginalised even within the disability sector. The aim of this workshop was to talk about the rights of people with neurological disorders, create a common advocacy group and an action plan, stressed Jeeja Ghosh, speaking slowly but surely from her wheelchair.																								We have to break the myth that people with cerebral palsy are mentally retarded, she insisted, setting the tone for the two-day seminar at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP). 																								Held by Ankur, IICPs advocacy group for adults, in collaboration with Ektha, a Chennai-based consortium of people with cerebral palsy, autism, mental retardation and multiple-disability, participants included those with neurological disorders, parents and professionals from NGOs like MentAid and Reach. They came from all over the eastern region, Shillong to Mizoram, Jamshedpur to Jharkhand and Cooch Behar.																								Although attended on the first day by police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty and chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Women Jasodhara Bagchi, the spotlight was on people with disabilities presenting papers on five issues important to them and action plans.																								There was also an election, where two representatives from the region  Sudam Pal and Jeeja from IICP  were elected. They will take part in the national seminar in Delhi on September 12.																								Ekthas four-city tour will move to Mumbai next, and end in Delhi. The purpose is to devise regional action plans, to carry forward the movement in our areas. Ankur, in fact, has done several community interaction workshops using theatre to spread our message last year in different places. We talked about continuing with it, added Jeeja, coordinator of Ankur.																								The event was as much an exchange of ideas as of emotions and opinions. 																								Relationships between people with disabilities and their parents and professionals, the problems and successes were all part of the discussion, as was the fact that more pro-active measures were needed from the government. 																								We have to unite and form a core group to spread the word, summed up Jeeja.

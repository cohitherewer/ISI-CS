 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 The cast of Crossings: Interplay of power and passion																								Four performers in ghagra choli, the faade of a house as backdrop and a lawn for the audience. Just as one is grappling with what all this might have to do with Lady Macbeth, the performers usher the theatregoers into a hall where they are asked to settle down along a wall. Where, soaking in the soft yellow light and oriental ambience, each woman reveals a facet of Lady Macbeth, the riveting interplay of power and passion through kathak, Manipuri, Bharatanatyam, or just monologue.																								With three dancers, an actress, a singer and a percussionist, the young Vikram Iyenger has adapted the Shakespearean text into an ambitious and challenging dance drama. Crossings  so titled because it evolved with images and ideas thrown up during rehearsals  is the debut production of Ranan, the performance company set up by Iyengar and colleague Debashree Bhattacharya, also a performer in the piece.																								The creative process was difficult, admits Iyengar, as it involved a varied texture of dialogue, dance, music and acting. We needed to be certain about where dance would end and acting take over. Or just how much of music was essential, reveals Iyengar, armed with a Masters in performing arts from the University of Wales and trained in kathak under Rani Karnaa for close to two decades. Crossings is part of a Sangeet Natak Akademi project undertaken by Iyengar.																								Weaving the dance forms into the dialogue was also difficult, as such fusion usually ends up as just decorations. We wanted the dance to add to the exploration. The use of shringar, for instance. A vital part of all Indian dance forms, it was an apt vehicle to enhance Lady Macbeths continuous disguising and reinventing herself. It also marks her transition through the four stages in the play, he explains.																								The dance drama has been enriched with the vocal rendition by Nageen Tanvir, daughter of theatre veteran Habib Tanvir. The rehearsals were also significant because Habib Tanvir was around for the first few days. He gave us vital tips on how to read the text and deliver the lines, adds Iyengar. After the final show on Sunday, at Uma Gallery, on Sarat Bose Road, the Crossings group will temporarily disband. But by the year-end, Iyengar promises to resurface with an adaptation of Girish Karnads Nagamandalam.

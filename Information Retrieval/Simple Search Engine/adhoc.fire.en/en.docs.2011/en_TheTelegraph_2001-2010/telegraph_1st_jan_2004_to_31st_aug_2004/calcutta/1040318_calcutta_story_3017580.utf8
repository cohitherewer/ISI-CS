The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 18, 2004  Haute and home CONTRIBUTED BY SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND SOMA BANERJEE June Maliah at the Orly sale. Picture by Rashbehari Das He counts Norah Jones amongst his celebrity clients. Not surprising then that home is not haute enough for Calcutta-based fashion designer Pritam Panda, who retails at stores in the UK and Thailand, with dreams of making a high fashion mark in Paris.																					But home is still where his heart is, and retailing from Calcutta in the near future is not terribly out of sync for Pritam, a fashion design diploma holder seven months into the business. City fashionistas got a glimpse of this 20-year-olds style at a show in Saturday Club on Wednesday.																					It was the same style that won Norah Jones over, claims the designer. She picked up a brocade gown from Khushboo in Birmingham, where I retail. She wanted a stole to match the gown, and called me a few weeks ago, says Pritam.																					The Indianwear specialist, with very western cuts showcased Indian garments, Indo-westerns and some fusionwear, with city models shimmering in shocking pinks, oranges, fuschias and turquoise. Saris, lehnga-cholis, churidar-kurtis and long jackets in khadi are what Pritam chose for the evening. The wedding season being over and out, the lehngas were long fish tail skirts rather than voluminous and flowing, embellished with sequins, diamonties, resham work and kantha, with bra and bikini-knotted tops. Long khadi jackets were embellished with intricate kantha work. The fabrics of choice were georgette, crpe, pure silk, raw silk and matka silk.																					Wearability is the rule of the thumb as far as Pritams creations go. I create stuff my mother and sister can wear to a party, not just what an actress would wear for an item number, says the designer.																																													Well-healed																					If you thought the feel-good factor gripping the nation was passing you by, take heart  you could be just an apple (or sweet lime, this season) away. If that doesnt work, you could take a cue from ancient India instead.																					Joining the list of diet experts to hit town recently is nutritionist Priscilla Marmot, who started a lecture series at Solace, the spa at 4, Sunny Park, on Wednesday. The London-based diabetes educator will do her bit to spread the word on healthy eating and nutrition during pregnancy. Talks are open for spa members, representatives of medical clinics, hospitals, hotels and dietary associations.																					Priscilla recommends a healthy and balanced diet. Western ways have infiltrated the Indian lifestyle, resulting in decreased physical activity, which leads to eating disorders and diseases like diabetes, she says. Controlling obesity is the first step to prevent this. A check on the consumption of refined carbohydrates, unhealthy fat and sweeteners, punched with regular exercise, is what Priscilla prescribes.																					Checking for blood sugar abnormalities is essential if one experiences sudden weight loss, excessive fatigue, unusually large appetite or blurred vision. Diabetes also causes largely unknown side effects like infertility in women and impotence in men, warns Priscilla.																					Junk food, high in saturated fat and low in fibre, should be consumed in moderation, while too much of anything, even the most nutritional of foods, is bad for the body, adds the expert.																					ace has another solution for health woes: stress-busting pranic healing. This form of non-touch, vertical energy healing originated in ancient India. Filipino Master Hector Ramos, who has been teaching pranic healing since 1990, is taking classes on psychic self-defence, which uses meditation skills to teach self-healing. The trick is in sensitising different parts of the body to feel energy levels and control them.																					I want to simplify pranic healing so it can be used to effectively cure disease. I have been working with patients who have tumours, cysts and arthritis, says Hector. Model Sayantani showcases designer Pritam Pandas creation. Picture by Pabitra DasPasta plus																					Delicious as they may be, pastas and pizzas are not the final word in Italian food. Taking a step past pop cuisine, Waterside Cafe at Hyatt Regency is rustling up some authentic Italian dishes till March 21.																					Chef Mitele Sbardellini, who has been flown in for the promotion from Hyatt Regency, Delhi, has put together a winning combination of dishes.																					Amongst some interesting, cheesy choices for vegetarians are delicacies like Scamorza alla Griglia con Caponata di Verdure al Basilico (grilled Scamorza cheese with vegetables ratatouille), Minestrone alla Genovese con Pasta (Genovese style vegetable soup with pesto and pasta). And the die-hard pizza lover can still opt for a Pizza La 																					Pizza (pizza with roasted garlic, goat cheese, pesto and sun-dried tomatoes).																					Non-vegetarians can take their pick of Zuppa di Pesce Con Crostini alAglio (fish soup with garlic crouton and saffron potatoes), Risotto Mare e Monti (risotto with mushroom and prawns), Filetti di Sogliola con Salsa al Pepe Verde su un Letto di Spinaci e Patate (fillet of Sole on a bed of crushed potato and spinach served with green peppercorn), Garretto Dagnello con Polenta Morbida (braised lamb shank with soft polenta) and more. Its a good idea to round off with some Pannacotta con Fragole Fresche (traditional Pannacotta with fresh strawberries).																					But it may be wise not to over-order. In the Chinese culture, it is polite to leave a bit of your food on the plate, but in Italy, it signifies you didnt enjoy your meal! the chef warns.																																													Price perfect																					Orlys annual sale is drawing in the crowds, once again, till March 28.																					Prices have been slashed on menswear and the limited collection of womens garments.																					There is a discount of 20 to 30 per cent on casual kurtas, and the Indiana range of kurta sets. On the Gharana line (wedding wear), there is a flat 30 per cent discount. 																					s are on for Dali shirts, and discounts are available on linen shirts, Italian silks and Japanese print shirts, too. The casual-wear section offers T-shirts and cotton, blended and handloom trousers.																					For women, there is a pick of mix-and-match kurtas, churidars and dupattas.

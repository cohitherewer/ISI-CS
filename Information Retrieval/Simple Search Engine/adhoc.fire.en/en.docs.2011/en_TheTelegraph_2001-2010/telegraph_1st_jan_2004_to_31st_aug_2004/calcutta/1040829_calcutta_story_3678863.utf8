As the fight for the skies intensifies, should Indian Airlines appeal to sense or sensibility?Shiloo ChattopadhyayBy now you must have seen it on television. A little girl giving her co-passenger a tip or three about how to use the facilities in an aircraft. First how to fasten his seatbelt, then how to recline his seat, and finally  exasperated  how to open his tray table. The student had made a complete fool of himself; all he could do by way of paying a tuition fee was to lend her his shoulder to sleep. This is when the airhostess comes to your rescue and makes it clear that the man is a senior pilot. The captain and the little girl  it is an amusing story told by Indian Airlines that aims to tug at your heartstrings.Competition in the Indian sky is growing fiercer by the day. As if Jet and Sahara were not bad enough, Air Deccan has joined the fray with a no-frills and low-bills offer. Kingfisher is threatening to fly soon at the other end of the spectrum  you want to play, youve got to pay. The new MD of Sahara is also making aggressive noises  every three-tier AC sleeper class passenger of Indian Railways is his target. To make matters even spicier, the price war is on in full swing, garbed as apex fares of various shapes and sizes.How does Indian Airlines fare in this milieu? It is severely handicapped. Being a public sector undertaking is not the best pedigree to have for a no-holds barred fight like this. Competition does not carry the baggage of social responsibility that a state-owned airlines does.From all indications the domestic aviation market is heading for natural segmentation. In prime routes, soon a passenger would have the choice of flying a Concorde, not perhaps in terms of speed but certainly style. Similarly, at the other end of the scale, speedier versions of various Rajdhani Expresses will also be flying.A computer-generated IA image and (top) the Air Deccan fleet: Trying timesWhat does Indian Airlines do? Should it fight on the price platform and be the value-for-money (as opposed to low cost) airline for the average citizen? Should it flaunt its fleet size and usurp the position of the most dependable airline of the Indian sky? Or should it focus on creating an irrational preference?The captain and the little girl story is a definite step in that direction. The signature line in that campaign pleads to your heart and not your head. This usually is a strategy adopted when your offer to the consumer has nothing tangibly different, so you really have nothing else to say.There, of course, is another possibility. A value-for-money airline often tells its consumer: Sir, you are sensible, you should not be taken in by cheap thrills. After all, the whole idea is to get you from one place to another safely and quickly. Why bother about the cutlery? Some others follow a smarter rationalise route. Fly me, not because I am cheap but because I am In this case, it is letting your heart fly!

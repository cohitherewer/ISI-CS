 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Rights panel raises brow at jail death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The West Bengal human rights commission doubts the veracity of statements made by officers of Alipore Central Correctional Home (Alipore Central jail) regarding the death of undertrial prisoner Sheikh Nasiruddin, in the jail hospital on September 3, 2002. 																								The commission recently summoned the jails medical officer, superintendent and the discipline officer in connection with the death.																								Medical officer Jayanta Kumar Das reportedly told the commission officers on December 11 last year that Nasiruddins body bore no mark of injury. But the head of the department of forensic state medicine of Calcutta Medical College, who had conducted the post-mortem, told the commission that the body bore at least eight marks of injuries. 																								Commission officers handling the case have reportedly expressed their displeasure at the jail doctors statements. Chairman Shyamal Kumar Sen said on Thursday the commissions verdict on the death will be announced soon.																								Sheikh Nasiruddin, a resident of Santoshpur Bazaar, under Mahestala police station in South 24-Parganas, was admitted to the jail hospital on August 30, 2002, after he complained of a severe pain in the chest and abdomen. He died in the same hospital on September 3, 2002, at about 5-15 p.m.																								His father, Mafiluddin Ostagar, and others told the commission that they felt Nasiruddins death was mysterious. Mafiluddin and those who moved the commission alleged that Nasiruddins body bore several marks of injuries. 																								The jail authorities had submitted before the commission Nasiruddins death certificate, inquest report, post-mortem report and other relevant papers on September 5, 2002  two days after his death. 																								It is learnt that the jail authorities have failed to offer any suitable explanation of the death. On January 27, the jail superintendent was summoned by the commission and asked to explain how the undertrial was treated at the jail hospital and how he died there. The commission is not satisfied with the superintendents explanation.																								Head of the department of forensic state medicine of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, Laxmikanta Ghosh, who had appeared before the rights panel on February 17, told it that the body bore at least eight marks of injuries. 																								On hearing this, the commission has taken a special interest in the case and is trying to probe it to identify those in the jail hospital who may have been responsible for the death. Nasiruddin had been arrested in connection with power theft.

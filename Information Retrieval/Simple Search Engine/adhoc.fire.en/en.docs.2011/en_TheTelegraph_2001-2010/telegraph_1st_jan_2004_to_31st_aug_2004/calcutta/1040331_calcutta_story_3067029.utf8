The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 									Nafisa ali								Former model, social activist and Lok Sabha poll candidate																																							The moot point is if non-political candidates are to contest, would they be accepted? No one is born a politician but evolves into one. If people out of the political groove but with substance and accountability, like myself, contest the poll, there should not be a problem of acceptance. But those who take the plunge just to grab the spotlight are not worth the voters consideration. If someone says Vote for BJP kyun ki yeh Basanti ki izzat ka sawal hai, and then says I do not know what the BJPs policies are as I am new in politics, then I have a serious objection to such candidates.

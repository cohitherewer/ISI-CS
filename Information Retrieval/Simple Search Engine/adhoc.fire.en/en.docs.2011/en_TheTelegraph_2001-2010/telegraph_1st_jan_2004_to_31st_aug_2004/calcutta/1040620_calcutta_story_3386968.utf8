Pet PassionDogs come when they are called, cats take a message and get back to you later, goes the saying from the pet kingdom. Cats have intrigued humans for thousands of years. Mine continue to amaze me. For the past four years, consistently, Minimow and Mingles wake up at 4.30 am for breakfast (when the entire household is awakened by their incessant meowing). And when the house is buzzing with activity, theyll be sleeping in some obscure corner of the house. Realisation: our dog is in sync with our life, our cats are not. Then why is the domestic cat second only to the dog in popularity as a house pet? Cats are less demanding than most other pets Most cats never need a bath. A cat is naturally fastidiously clean A cat spends about 70 per cent of the day sleeping and 15 per cent of the day grooming.Amongst domestic cats, the short-hair, tiger-striped ones are the most common. In appearance and status, the pure-bred cat scores. Whatever the type, the nature remains the same. To gain the affection of your cat is a matter of great pride (a cat will be your friend if he finds you worthy of friendship!). Cats may not be as demonstrative as dogs but thats not to say they are not affectionate. When you come home after a gruelling day, they wrap their furry bodies around your legs in a cat cuddle.Going by the popularity of cartoon strips, cats reign supreme. Whether its the striped and bulgy-eyed Garfield known for his lazy lifestyle, Pink Panther, the silent animated feline, or Tom the fiendish opportunist at loggerheads with Jerry. TIP: A cat that swallows large amounts of fur while grooming may develop fur balls. These may cause ulcers. Combat this by frequent combing and brushing. If the problem persists, serve a teaspoonful of mineral oil in its food. Nelanjana Bhowmick

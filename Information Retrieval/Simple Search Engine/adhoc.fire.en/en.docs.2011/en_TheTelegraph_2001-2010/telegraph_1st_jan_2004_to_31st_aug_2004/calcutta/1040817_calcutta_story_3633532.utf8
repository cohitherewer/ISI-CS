 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Defence accuses kin in Rajnis case
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Rajnis Patel death case took a dramatic turn on Monday, when the lawyer of Sandip Samanta, one of the accused doctors, tried to shift the responsibility of the death to the Patel family and the hospital.																								During the hour-long proceedings, Samantas counsel Nikhil Nandi cross-examined Rajnis father and prime witness of the case, Manoj Patel. 																								Nandi repeatedly asked Manoj whether the accused doctors had performed their duties satisfactorily. 																								How did you find your son after he was operated on the first time? Did he have plaster or dressing on his leg? Did the doctors visit your son regularly? Who used to ask you to get the medicines required for your sons treatment? Counsel Nandi fired the volley of questions.																								Each time, Manoj made sure that he understood what the defence lawyer was trying to get at before he answered. 																								The doctors would not visit my son even on their regular rounds  in the morning and evening  and would express their annoyance whenever I approached and told them of my sons deteriorating health, Manoj said.																								Whenever the need occurred, I pleaded with them to take care of my son  be it on the outskirts of the hospital, the operating theatre or even while the doctors were walking across the corridor to their offices, Manoj recounted. 																								It was the nurses on duty who would usually instruct us on what we should do. They would hand over the prescription at any odd hour and we had to stay round-the-clock to fetch the medicines, Patel told the court.																								Counsel Nandi pointed out that the presence of Manoj and his wife by their sons side 24 hours a day had contributed to the infection of Rajnis wound after he was operated on. 																								Did you ever care to change into clean clothes or sterilise your clothes when you visited your son? You could have easily passed on the infection to him, Nandi reasoned.																								Manoj replied that he had never been advised to do so. How am I to know if I am not instructed by the doctors? I was often asked to be present in the room where Rajnis wounds were being dressed, he said.																								Defence counsel Nandi observed: Manoj has no knowledge of medical science. His submission is based on what he has learnt from other doctors and what he saw and understood during the treatment of his son.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 09, 2004 Life You cant get through this week without...Catching Kyun! Ho Gaya Na You first heard the rumours. Then you saw him take on Salman Khan  from a safe distance  over her. Then you saw them together in promos. Then you saw them dancing together... And now you can actually catch Vivek Oberoi and Aishwarya Rai cuddling up on screen in their first film together, Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... releasing on Friday the 13th at the three multiplexes, Priya, Paradise, Navina Just in case their on-screen romance turns out to be thanda, theres always the Big B to fall back on.Hogging hilsa The sky rocketing prices are a deterrent all right but how can you possibly romance the rains without the pungent flavours of shorshe ilish or bhapa ilish? Hilsa festivals at city eateries apart, no Bengali worth his/her salt can refrain from striking a bargain, however hard, to wriggle out of the usual rui-katla trap, even if its just for this special weekend.Getting drenched And not just in the Pantaloons sale If grey skies are casting a shadow on your mood, dont bother to carry that boring umbrella along. Instead, sign up for a refresher course this season by plunging headlong into the next smart shower. The monsoons have finally decided to make merry and everybody is invited. But before you let yourself go, heres a sartorial suggestion  while picking the colour of the day, remember Mandakini, shudder, then get it right. Preparing for I-Day The weekend gets a Tricolour tint with the country celebrating its 57th Independence Day on Sunday. If painting the Red Road orange or watching the new Prime Minister hold fort on the telly doesnt arouse your deshbhakti, take the liberty to bunk work on Saturday and head out for a cosy weekend getaway to celebrate freedom in style! Feel-good factor guaranteed.Opening the Olympics The glittering show at Athens is especially recommended for all those keen to wipe out memories of the celebrity-sporty torch tussle in the capital a month ago. Flagging off national pride on the Friday prior to I-Day will be athlete Anju Bobby George. Statutory warning: it could be all downhill for the Indian contingent from there, so watch them while the goings good.

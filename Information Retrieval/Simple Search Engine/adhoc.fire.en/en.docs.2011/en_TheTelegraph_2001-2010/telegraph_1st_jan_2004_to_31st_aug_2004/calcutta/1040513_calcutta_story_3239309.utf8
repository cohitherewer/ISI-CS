 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Home guard trips robber on the run
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Roy Gupta: The colour of courage																								For this home guard, the colours of courage come with the drab khaki uniform he wears with distinction. But not enough to catch the eye of the government and get it to keep its promise to one of its few good men.																								Snehamay Roy Gupta, on duty at the Mahatma Gandhi Road-Mullick Street intersection in north Calcutta, grabbed one of three armed dacoits on the run, after snatching cash and valuables from a shop located near Brabourne Road, at around 8.40 am on Wednesday.																								And this was not the first act of heroism on the job for Roy Gupta. On January 19, 2001, he had intercepted a taxi and apprehended Mohd Shamsher, an arms dealer, and seized 10 firearms and a live bomb from him.																								For this brave act, the authorities had promised him the post of a constable with the traffic police. Roy Gupta remains a home guard, but that did not stop him from flying in to down a dacoit on Wednesday.																								Prabahan Roy, officer-in-charge of Jorabagan Traffic Guard, applauded Roy Gupta: Three dacoits were escaping, and happened to pass the crossing where Roy Gupta was on duty. Showing great presence of mind, he tripped one of the criminals and pinned him down. He was identified as Swaran Das, a resident of Bihar temporarily putting up at Tangra. A loaded pistol was found in his possession and he was handed over to the Burrabazar police station.																								When Roy Gupta took guard at the busy intersection, he had no inkling of the drama in real life lurking around the corner. Suddenly, three youths sprinted out from Mullick Street and dashed past him down Mahatma Gandhi Road.																								At first I was confused, but then I saw some people chasing the youths, crying out that they were thieves, recounted the home guard. Roy Gupta was quick to trip one of the fleeing miscreants and pounce on him. A brief struggle ensued, but the home guard managed to pin down the criminal and prevent him from drawing out the pistol he was carrying.																								Roy Gupta then hauled the goon to Burrabazar police station. He was later taken to meet the police commissioner. He commended me on my act of courage and gave me Rs 2,000 as an award, smiled Roy Gupta, without a grumble about the promised promotion.																								He will be promoted after the electoral process is over, said H.P. Singh, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

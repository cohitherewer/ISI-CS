A HELPING HAND: From your first board exams (file picture, top) to your first crush (Hum Tum) Participants display their creative skills during a summer camp programme organised by The Heritage School				 				 																															The burden of board exams, the pain and joy of young love, the loneliness and angst of adolescence, the confusion of career choice Just a few problems that affect the lives of young adults of today. 				 				 																															And, sometimes its simply a matter of talking to an objective yet sympathetic listener that makes all the difference  someone anonymous of their peer group  one who understands the issues at stake.				 				 																															It was with the aim of helping youngsters help themselves that Thoughtshop Foundation started its tele-counselling training course for youngsters, who, if chosen, then go on to answer calls and talk to those in distress.				 				 																															The first of the 10-week, 20-session workshops is over, and some of the successful participants are ready to take on their new responsibility of manning the telephones. Part of the process included self-evaluation, assessment and reflection, to test our emotional quotient, says Rituparna Mitra, one of the participants.				 				 																															The JU English student was one of those who made the cut after the two-phase intensive workshop, during which the young group was put through a series of exercises to determine how they would deal with distress calls. This involved previous calls that had been recorded.				 				 																															At one point, several emotions were displayed on the board, and we had to talk about how we wanted to react and how we would actually do so, explains Rituparna, who is all set to volunteer with Askline after her exams. I help my friends all the time, so I am rather used to it. Still, I was feeling nervous when I took my first call. But after that, it was easy.				 				 																															No psychotherapy, just providing information and support are the key. The aim is to motivate the callers enough to help them feel positive and find a way out of their distress. 				 				 																															We have to talk to the caller in such a way, that he can think of the options at hand, to help him find a way out, observes Srirupa Sengupta. The queries range from adolescent problems to career counselling, distress calls to board exams, student queries on sexual matters and HIV/AIDS and protection. Some are lonely and want to talk to someone, anyone. We need to talk to share our problems, to feel lighter, adds the 24-year-old. 				 				 																															Shreya Majumdar was one of the peer leaders, who conducted the first stage of the course. Ive gone through it myself before, so I know the high you get when you help people, and how much it helps those who need it, she says. 				 				 																															The interactive session with the volunteers, through games and discussions, was all about straightening attitudes. But, despite the varied backgrounds, rapport-building was remarkably easy with this bunch, because they realised that there was more than what met the eye in this course.				 				 																															Srirupa, who did her MA in sociology from Delhi School of Economics, sums up: It leaves you with a very different orientation in life. You learn to handle yourself better and also think of probable actions and alternatives simultaneously. It helps you to balance your own approach to life.				 				 																
	 Regatta all the way				 				 																															The 3rd BRC Patton inter-school rowing championship was held from May 26-30. Fifty-four teams from 30 schools of Bengal, comprising 275 students, participated in the tournament. 				 				 																															MP Birla Foundation and St Joseph and Marys emerged winners in the junior and senior boys competition, and South Point and St Lawrence were the runners-up. Among the girls, Modern High A and St Thomas were the junior and senior section champions, while Modern High B and Modern High School were the runners-up. 				 				 																															The best-disciplined school award went to Tirthapati Institution. South Point got the best-dressed school award.				 				 																															Governor Viren J. Shah was the chief guest for the finals and gave away prizes worth Rs 80,000. Bengal Rowing Club had also organised an inter-school darts competition. South Point won, followed by Tirthapati Institution and MP Birla.				 				 																															A party had been organised for the students. We are trying to introduce an evening of inter-school regatta competition from this year. We have also given scholarships to some students who have represented the state or the nation, added a club official. 				 				 																															On the theme of rowing, the Bengal sub junior and senior boys and girls teams from four rowing clubs in Rabindra Sarobar left for Tamil Nadu on June 4, to take part in the 7th Sub-junior National Championship and the 4th Challenger Mens Sprint National Rowing Championship.				 				 																															The Bengal team comprises 33 players from Bengal Rowing Club, Calcutta Rowing Club, Lake Club and Calcutta University Rowing Club, who will take part in different contests like scull, double scull, pairs and fours. Organised by the rowing federation of India and hosted by Tamil Nadu Amateur Rowing Association, the championship will be held at Kodaikanal.				 				 																															Coach Goutam Valecha and manager Sandeep Gupta are expecting good results. We won gold in the fours category last year. We expect to do even better this year, the coach said. 				 				 																															Best of luck to Team Bengal! Subhajoy Roy,

programme organised by The Heritage SchoolThe art of learning				 				 																															Aami ekhon nijer naam likhte paari (I can write my name now), said Raja Sarkar, an 11-year-old slum-dweller. 				 				 																															Aami A, B, C, D aar 1, 2, 3 shikhe gechhi (I have learnt A, B, C, D and 1, 2, 3,) said a 10-year-old child labourer, who works in a tea stall. 				 				 																															Many others, too, had grateful words to express, thanks to the commerce department of JD Birla College, which had taken it upon itself to educate 150 illiterate city children. The endeavour was a part of the Each One Teach One project. A month was given to each student to impart basic knowledge to an illiterate child.				 				 																															After the completion of the project, the children were made to take a written test within the college campus. They were also asked to talk about their aims and ambitions, if admitted to school. The effort from the girls could go a long way in creating success stories among these youngsters.  Puja Agarwal

	 Nature rules 				 				 																															For some, June 5 might have been just another Saturday meant for lazing around at home. However, some chose to be different. On the hot Saturday morning, the nature clubs of Ashok Hall, Don Bosco Park Circus, La Martiniere for Girls, La Martiniere for Boys and St James assembled in the Alipore Zoological Garden to celebrate World Environment Day.				 				 																															Under the guidance of People United for Better Living In Calcutta (PUBLIC), saplings were planted at various spots, followed by a brain-racking quiz session on nature. The complimentary breakfast at Taj Bengal was a humble way of appreciating the sincere efforts of these young environmentalists.  Ritika Patni

	 Living it up 				 				 																															The Art of Living (AOL) recently celebrated the birthday of its founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar with a medley of fun and frolic laced with the message of harmony. 				 				 																															The afternoon saw devotees from across the city, with a large turnout from the youth brigade, gather for a function at the Harijan Kalyan Samity, an NGO in Gariahat run with the aid of AOL, where select children from nearby slums danced to the tunes of bhajans and chanted shlokas.				 				 																															The efforts of Shashi Makharia and Shradhha Patel, who run a school and look after the welfare of the NGO, proved to have paid off, as the results of the school examinations were announced. After a satsang and distribution of toys and other goodies to the children, the scene shifted to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir, Alipore. With senior teachers showing the way, the crowd sang in unison.				 				 																															There were stalls selling saplings, ahead of World Environment Day, workshop cassettes, books and herbal products. Funds were collected for the numerous Seva Projects undertaken in the villages of Bengal. A vegetarian, organic dinner rounded up the festivities.

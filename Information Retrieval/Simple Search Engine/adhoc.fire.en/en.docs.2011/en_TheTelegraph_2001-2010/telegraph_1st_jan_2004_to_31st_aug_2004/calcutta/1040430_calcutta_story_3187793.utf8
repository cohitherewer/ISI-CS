 																											- Oil firms, transport dept strategy to highlight switchover benefits A STAFF REPORTER																								The oil companies have decided to organise awareness drives in the city to prod car-owners into switching to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for the sake of both environment and economy. The transport department plans to join hands with the oil firms.																								Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury will meet officials of the oil firms next week to decide on a strategy to draw car-owners, especially those of old vehicles, to the green fuel.																								After the high court order on Bharat Stage II compliance and imposition of central rules on auto emission, there is no compulsion for the vehicle-owners to switch over to LPG from petrol.																								By the central rules, any vehicle, irrespective of make and age, can ply the roads if it maintains an emission standard matching the specification. The high court also went by the rules and modified its judgment.																								The oil firms, which have set up three LPG outlets in the city to make the green fuel available, are in a dilemma now, as LPG fitting is no longer mandatory.																								We have invested crores to set up the LPG outlets, as it was to be made mandatory for old car-owners to use the green fuel, as per the earlier court order. But after modification of the judgment, the switchover to LPG is only optional. As a result, there are few takers. So, we have decided to draw car-owners to the green fuel by altering their mindset, said deputy general manager A.C. De of Indian Oil Company (IOC).																								According to the plan, the IOC will organise workshops, seminars and other campaigns to raise popular awareness on the benefits of the green fuel. We have to convince car-owners that LPG is not only environment-friendly but also costs less. Besides, it keeps the engine of a car in a good condition, reducing the maintenance cost. We are sure that if we can convince the car-owners, they will definitely switch to LPG and take advantage of it, De asserted.																								According to IOC officials, the company is incurring a huge loss after installing the LPG outlets. If we can convince more car-owners to switch over to LPG, we can expect some returns to justify our investment, they said.																								Joint secretary in the transport department H. Mohan said that his officials, too, were planning to convince car-owners on the benefits of LPG over petrol. We will meet the oil companies soon to evolve a strategy, he said.

 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 SSKM dolls up for course nod
 																											- Visiting MCI team given guided tour of renovated hospital campus A STAFF REPORTER																								SSKM Hospital got a facelift on Friday, thanks to a visit by a three-member delegation of the Medical Council of India (MCI). 																								The team, on a two-day visit, will submit an assessment on the introduction of under-graduate medical courses at the hospitals training institute.																								Police teams regulated entry into the hospital since morning, ejecting outsiders and touts from the compound. The outdoor patients department (OPD), too, was spruced up for the visiting team.																								Hospital officials said they were hopeful of a positive response from the Centre, now that the Congress is set to form the government. 																								The OPDs usually open at 9 am. Today, they opened at 8.30 am and the MCI team was given a guided tour before 9 am, when there are few patients, hospital sources said. By 11 am, however, the OPDs were spilling over with patients, like other days. 																								The earlier MCI delegations that had visited SSKM had expressed reservations about the overcrowded OPDs.																								Makeshift special rooms, adjacent to the gynaecology and surgery OPDs  a must if the hospital is to meet the MCIs criteria for starting under-graduate courses  were erected on Friday. As per MCI rules, these special rooms are where teachers will take practical classes. SSKM did not have the facility earlier.																								Prior to the MCI visit, hectic activity ensued to give the SSKM campus a facelift. The earlier MCI teams had raised objections to the central laboratory not functioning round-the-clock. This time, pathology reports were displayed at the laboratory by the staff to impress the delegation, sources said. 																								Last year, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced that the MCI would allow under-graduate courses at SSKM and the setting up of a new medical college at Midnapore. However, the MCI withheld the nod. One major reason was the crammed classrooms at the University College of Medicine, adjacent to SSKM Hospital. 																								This time round, SSKM took no chances and the departments were renovated to give the classrooms a more spacious look. 																								According to the sources, an old building next to the official residence of the hospitals superintendent was renovated and passed it as the boys hostel. 																								Officials said the MCI team met some of the teaching staff on Friday and examined their credentials. Members will visit various departments on Saturday and submit a report to the MCI headquarters. The MCI headquarters will then submit a report to the Union health ministry, which will convey its decision to the state government.

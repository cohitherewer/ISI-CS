 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Each municipal ward in Calcutta will get funds for development of roads, footpaths, water supply and other facilities in direct proportion to its contribution to the civic coffers, mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Wednesday. Generate more revenue in your wards and get more funds for development. This is my advice to all councillors who petition me for funds, he said.																								The message is aimed at areas whose residents pay less property tax but demand development on the same level as localities where the tax is high.																								In future, the revenue from property tax of a particular area and its development funds will be directly proportional, the mayor said. The new system will impose a ceiling on total development expenditure in a particular borough in accordance with the revenue it earns. 																								The ceiling on development funds will be twice or thrice the revenue earned from a particular borough, explained a senior official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 																								Since the generous flow of grants from the state government has started drying up, we need to bring about a certain degree of professionalism in civic governance. The new system will also encourage mobilisation of resources by councillors from their respective areas, said the mayor. People of an area, where the infrastructure is inadequate, or even backward, cannot demand more funds for development because they are paying less in terms of tax, he pointed out.																								With the new system in mind, we have launched an exercise to draw up a borough-wise list of revenue earnings to assess future allotments of development funds among the 15 boroughs in the city, said officer on special duty to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh.																								Civic officials, echoing the mayor, said it was not possible to bring about an overall development of civic infrastructure without generating ones own resources. The concept of abundant funds, irrespective of tax collection, will soon be a thing of the past, they said.																								The CMC is also eyeing loans from financial institutions, issuing bonds and organising lotteries to mobilise funds for development, the officials said. However, they felt the CMC needed to make its accounting process more transparent. The cleaner the accounts, the better the prospects of securing a loan, they said.																								Municipal commissioner Debashis Som said the CMC had already updated its accounts and drawn up lists of its movable and immovable properties.

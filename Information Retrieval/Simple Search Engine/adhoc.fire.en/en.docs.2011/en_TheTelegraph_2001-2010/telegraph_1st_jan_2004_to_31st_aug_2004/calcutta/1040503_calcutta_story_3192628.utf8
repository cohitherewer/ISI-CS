 Pal at the Hyatt laundry room. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Laundering for the whos who has taken on a whole new meaning in the city. It is not money we are talking about here. We are, quite literally, talking about dirty laundry.																								The Hyatt Regency has started an exclusive laundry service for its special clients in the city, to take care of designer tags with the attention they deserve.																								Aimed at Calcuttas cream, the hotels five-star facility, dubbed Hy-FabriCare, is targeted at the labels  Armanis and Versaces  and those treasured heirlooms  pashminas and Persian carpets.																								We launched the service earlier this year and we already have around 50 steady clients, explains laundry manager Debnarayan Pal. Though the names were revealed strictly off the record  dirty linen, after all, should never be washed in public  the service has clearly hit the spot with industrialists and consulates.																								Quality concerns are uppermost for the users. Many of them would travel abroad regularly, and take their expensive garments with them for cleaning, reveals Pal. They know all about the solvents that should be used, and ensured that we meet their criteria before trusting us with their clothes. Expensive sherwanis with embellishments are usually the most delicate articles of ethnic finery.																								The hotel does charge a premium for both washing and dry-cleaning, but it is around 40 per cent less than a hotel resident would pay for the same service.																								A look at infrastructure is both reassuring  top-line facilities are available in our city  as well as disheartening  one is tempted to believe Pal, who has worked with independent city-based cleaning concerns as well, when he says that most neighbourhood cleaners do not have the proper equipment.																								Huge dry-cleaning machines with three kinds of oils are what clothes go into at the Hyatt. After the 45-minute cleaning process is over, clothes are pressed with heated plates curved to suit different shapes like collars and cuffs. Coats and dresses go on to a contraption resembling a mannequin. A blast of steam from within gets rid of wrinkles, while ensuring that there is no shine ruining the finish of garments like heavy irons can do.																								For all those who have been dismayed by the tragic effect on precious garments that dry-cleaners often have, Pal has some handy tips. Smaller dry cleaners could well be using poor quality solvents, like (gasp!) diesel, stresses Pal, so it might be a safer bet washing as many things as you can at home.																								Rule number one may come as a bit of a surprise  dry-cleaning does not work at all on pure cottons. So, wash them, including denims, in your washing machine or by hand, air dry (tumble drying may cause them to shrink) and then iron.																								Water-soluble dyes  like most vegetable dyes  are best dry-cleaned. But silks can quite easily be washed at home, as long as they are pure. Pal suggests a simple test to check whether you can hand-wash a silk sari. Take a thread from the material and hold it to a flame. If it smells like burning hair, it is pure. If it is a rayon blend, it will smell like burning grass. A pure cotton will burn into a powdery ash. A polyester blend, on the other hand, will shrink away from the flame.																								Crepe and georgette are best dry-cleaned. But the falls should be terry-cotton. The same principle applies to silk curtains with cotton lining. The lining will never be as clean as silk if it is cotton, explains the textile engineer.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

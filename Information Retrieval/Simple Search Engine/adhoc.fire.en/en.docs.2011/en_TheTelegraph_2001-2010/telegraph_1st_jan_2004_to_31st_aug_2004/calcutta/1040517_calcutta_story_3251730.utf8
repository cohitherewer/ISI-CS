 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 To live a life
																								There is birth. And there is death. Sandwiched between these two milestones is what we know as life. We spend a lifetime pondering over the miracle of birth and the mystery surrounding death. We ask a number of questions and brood over their possible answers. Yet, ironically, in the midst of all our mindless wanderings, we miss out on Gods biggest gift to mankind; we miss the joy of living a life. It is possible to live life in a fleeting second, to find the essence of living in the smallest of instances, just as it is possible to prolong that one moment into an eternity and translate that eternity into life. Based on a play by Luigi Pirandello and Krishna Sobti, Mrityumukhar Ek/Dui helps us to discover the joy of living, to enable us to live the life of every moment happily, for its own sake. Directed by Saswati Biswas, the play is a celebration of life; life that can be lived or wasted away at will. It brings out the passion that is life, the ecstasy that is life, the obsession that is life, the party that is life  if only we know how to live it.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Mrityumukhar Ek/Dui, produced by Theatron																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

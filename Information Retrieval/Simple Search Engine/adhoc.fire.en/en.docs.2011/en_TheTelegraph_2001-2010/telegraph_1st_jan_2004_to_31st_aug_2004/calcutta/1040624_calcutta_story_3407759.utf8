The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 89, and thats chillax for you
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The name is innocuous, the address on paper almost incongruous. Yet, the structure that stands at 89C, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Sarani is the newest hangout hub in town.																								89 Cinema, adjacent to Swabhumi, on the EM Bypass, opens its box-office doors to the public on Thursday, with viewers having to wait another day for a glimpse inside the citys third multiplex, within a week of INOX II hosting its first-day-first-show.																								The star of the Swabhumi show on Friday will be Auditorium 1, seating 377 and with the largest screen in Calcutta, around 48 ft wide. Screen 3 at INOX City Centre stretches across 39.5 ft.																								Beginning with six films, including Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 89 Cinema is aiming to create a complete entertainment experience, says Harsh Neotia, chairman, Calcutta Cine Pvt Ltd (CCPL). State-of-the-art is the name of the movie game from screen to sound, adds Neotia.																								Sound is, in fact, supreme for the multiplex developed by CCPL, a joint venture between the Bengal Ambuja Group with its associates and Consolidated Entertainment Pvt Ltd (CEPL). At a cost of Rs 14 lakh for each auditorium, the sound system has been put together by sound consulting company Promises Instruments and supervised by acoustics engineer Jal Mistry. Every aspect  from amplifiers to speaker  is PHX certified, the international seal of approval given by Lucas Films.																								The two specialities are the Dolby X Processor with 6.1 channels  as opposed to the standard 5  for more depth and the 3D effect, and the Electro Voice processors in the speakers. They analyse the dips and rises in the frequencies and normalise them at the same volume, for a smoother sound, explains Manoj Bhatia of Promises Instruments.																								The seating arrangements are specially designed to maximise viewing and listening pleasure. A special feature is the executive row at the back of each auditorium, with bigger seats, movable armrests and more leg space. 																								The colour schemes are funkier than the existing multiplexes  blue on the first floor, pink on the second and bright yellow on the third, with spirals and panels on doors and walls.																								And the mood is casual and cool, with plenty of plans afoot to deliver on the Just chillax promise held out by the 89 management. A restaurant and a coffee shop-cum-ice cream parlour are on the menu. And if a stage in the corner of each floor promises live music  by and for the movie-goer  video game machines will give youngsters a chance to just have fun.

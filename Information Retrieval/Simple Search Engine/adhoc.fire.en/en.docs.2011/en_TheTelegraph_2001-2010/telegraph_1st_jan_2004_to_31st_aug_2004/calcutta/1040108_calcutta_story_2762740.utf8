 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Technical twist to defer Bharat-II tryst
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								A committee appointed by the government looked well on course on Wednesday to providing Writers Buildings with a technical escape hatch to beat the April deadline set by the high court for the introduction of Bharat Stage-II (BS-II) norms.																								The clean-air deadline is a dream that, for all technical purposes, cannot be met, stressed the 15-member committee preparing the BS-II rollout roadmap.																								The transport department had formed the committee to find out how the high court deadline for Bharat-II could be met. At a five-hour-long meeting held on Tuesday, members of the committee listed roadblocks that would slow down the drive for Bharat-II. The members were meeting for the first time.																								We have discussed the pros and cons. There are several problems and we are trying to find ways to overcome them. We are again meeting on January 13 and hope to come up with some solutions. We will submit the report, along with our recommendations, on January 15, said committee convener H. Mohan.																								We will implement the recommendations that we can possibly implement and inform the court about what is not possible, and why, Mohan added.																								Other members of the committee include representatives of oil companies, automobile manufacturers, the central pollution control board, environmental engineers, automobile engineers, officials from the Tata Energy Research Institute and the transport department.																								According to transport department sources, automobile engineers made it clear that the upgrade of old engines will not ensure BS-II norms in most cases. 																								Also, switching to LPG may also not automatically mean a car making the BS-II mark. A car will comply with BS-II emission standards only if it has a BS-II engine, the engineers reportedly told the committee.																								Delhi did not face this problem as the Supreme Court categorically directed all commercial vehicles to convert from diesel to CNG. There was no directive for private vehicles and the court order also did not refer to the maintenance of Bharat-II emission standards, said a member of the committee.

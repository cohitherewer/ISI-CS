The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 28-year job battle won
 																											- Teacher wrests appointment, salary and Rs 10-lakh arrears TAPAS GHOSH																								For a resourceless schoolteacher who will retire in two years time, Wednesday came as a boon. It signalled her unexpected victory in an unequal 28-year legal battle, pitting her against the mighty education department.																								A month after the Supreme Court passed a judgment, and a week after a contempt-of-court notice was served on it, the education department on Wednesday fell in line and issued a letter of appointment confirming the services of Sunanda Chakladar as a teacher of Deshagourab Vidyamandir, in Narkeldanga, since 1976. 																								Chakladar, whose unimaginable harassment by the education department was first reported by Metro, will receive an estimated Rs 10 lakh towards dues, as the department had blocked her salaries since 1969.																								The appointment is made on the basis of the directives of Calcutta High Court and the Supreme Court, the department wrote to Chakladar. The teacher will now be able to claim the arrears with an 18 per cent interest since the day of appointment.																								Chakladars is the second case of the education department being forced by the court to formally acknowledge the appointment of a teacher who had been made to work without a proper salary for years.																								Earlier, a primary teacher of Basak Bagan Primary School at Patipukur, Pranab Sengupta, had won a legal battle against the education department. Sengupta joined the school in 1974 but the state had not approved his appointment. 																								He worked for a payment of Rs 21.75 per month. The high court had asked the education department to regularise Senguptas service.																								Chakladar joined Deshagourab Vidyamandir as a teacher in 1969 . But when the state government came to power and turned the institution into a state-aided school, the education department, particularly the district primary school council of Calcutta, refused to approve her appointment.																								To establish her claim as a permanent teacher, Chakladar embarked on a legal battle. A division bench of the high court, in 1992, had asked the education department to approve Chakladars service since she joined the school.																								The school council refused to fall in line even after school education minister Kanti Biswas intervened. The school council chairman challenged the Calcutta High Court directive, but was itself ticked off by the Supreme Court and was asked to issue an appointment letter immediately.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Teachers cry down school sex syllabus 
 MITA MUKHERJEE A state government plan to include sex education in the classroom curriculum has been rocked by cries of outrage from teachers aligned to an organisation that draws sustenance from the ruling party.																								With CPM-affiliate All-Bengal Teachers Association crying foul over the proposed curriculum misleading students, state school education minister Kanti Biswas  a one-time leader of the same organisation  has asked the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education not to implement the course in the current session.																								Biswas admitted that the guideline for the lifestyle education syllabus, slated to be introduced from June, had upset a section of teachers. The guideline has been prepared with a very modern outlook and we do understand the problems the teachers may face in class, he said.																								The minister went on to add that the syllabus had been referred to doctors and social scientists for their suggestions. They will examine the syllabus and submit a report explaining whether it can have adverse effects on students.																								Most boards governing schools in the country have already incorporated details of the human reproductive system in their secondary curriculum. But the CPM-led state government has been steadfast in its refusal to have anything remotely related to sex in the syllabus.The revised curriculum for Classes VIII, IX and X was meant to change things and bring it on a par with that followed by other boards. Officials said the whole point was to make students aware of sex and the harmful consequences of promiscuity and unprotected sex .																								But teachers have protested that it would be very difficult to discuss topics not in consonance with Indian culture and traditions in the classroom. Students might misconstrue and be misled, they claimed.																								ABTA general secretary Amal Banerjee said there were certain topics in the 115-page manual that had been presented in a vulgar manner.																								West Bengal Headmasters Association general secretary Ashok Maiti was even more vehement. This is like asking us to teach pornography, he claimed.

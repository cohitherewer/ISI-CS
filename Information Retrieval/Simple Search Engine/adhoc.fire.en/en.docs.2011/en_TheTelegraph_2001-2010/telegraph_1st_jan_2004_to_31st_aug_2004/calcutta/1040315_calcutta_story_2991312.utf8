 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Health office in chaos
 A STAFF REPORTER																								If the Left Front government thought it would be easier to instil work ethics in its health department employees with a shift in address, it has been proved wrong. The 1,000-plus workforce is up in arms over unfulfilled promises made before being asked to join work at the new office in Salt Lake.																								Trouble started with the governments decision to declare Swasthya Bhavan a protected area, which the CPM-affiliated coordination committee opposed. Now, issues like the central air-conditioning system, water supply and transport to office have taken centre stage. 																								The coordination committee has submitted a memorandum to health secretary Asim Barman, demanding better facilities at the GN Block office.																								Sacks full of files have arrived from Writers Buildings, but the clerical staff couldnt be bothered to open them, as they had been told everything would be computerised.																								We explained that the data from the files had to be fed into the computers, said Smarajit Roy Chowdhury, secretary of the coordination committee, adding that the employees did have genuine grievances. The government had, after all, promised central air-conditioning in the new office. Also, seating arrangements and proper waterlines are not in place.																								Swapan Chakraborty, health services deputy director (administration), admitted that a lot needed to be done, but assured that things will settle down with time.																								The biggest problem, according to the employees, is the lack of transport from Howrah and Sealdah. The government had even promised autorickshaw services from Ultadanga to GN block, claimed Chakraborty. So, the office is quite deserted by late afternoon, with employees facing the daunting task of getting back home.

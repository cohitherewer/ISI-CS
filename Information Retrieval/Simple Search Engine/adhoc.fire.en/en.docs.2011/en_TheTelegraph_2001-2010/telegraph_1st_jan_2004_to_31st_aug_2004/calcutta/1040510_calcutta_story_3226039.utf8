 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Oil firms alter LPG connection system
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Oil companies have introduced from this month a system of shifting domestic LPG supplies from one place to another.																								By the new system, if any consumer shifts residence and intends getting a connection from another company  from Indane to HP or vice versa  he will have to surrender the existing connection and apply afresh for a new connection with the dealer of the new area.																								If any consumer with an Indane connection in a particular area wants to shift residence and wants a new connection from HP, he will have to surrender the existing connection to the Indane dealer by depositing the cylinder and apply with the HP dealer in his new locality, said A.C. Dey, deputy general manager (LPG), Indian Oil.																								However, if the consumer, after shifting, wants to retain the Indane connection, he need not surrender the cylinder. In that case, he needs to apply to the existing dealer for a transfer of his connection to the other dealer, Dey explained.																								Earlier, consumers were allowed to transfer their gas connection from one place to another without surrendering it, and they would take the cylinder along with them while moving to the new address.																								The problem with the old system was that empty cylinders of different companies would get mixed up and it was very difficult to realise the deposit. Loss of cylinders is another reason, Dey said.																								According to IOC officials, earlier, the number of LPG dealers was limited and a particular company, be it IOC, HP or BP, would operate in a particular area. So, transfer of dealer and company was allowed for the benefit of the consumers.																								At present, there is no scarcity of cooking gas and, also, there are sufficient dealers of every oil company operating in the city and other urban areas. So, consumers should face no problem in getting a new connection in any area and from any company. This is why we have introduced the system, the officials said.																								They said the consumers would be benefited from the new system as it will be convenient for them. Nearly 20,000 consumers shift their LPG connection per month.																								A consumer has a choice of companies from which he can get a connection. Besides, a consumer with an Indane connection may shift residence, to find that there is an HP dealer adjacent to his new address. He will, naturally, opt for an HP connection. In that case, he will have to deposit the cylinder, get a refund of the deposited amount and then take a connection in the new area, the officials said.																								The IOC deputy general manager, however, assured consumers that there was no need to panic. Do not feel youll face problems getting a new connection after surrendering the existing one. LPG is now available on demand. Connections will be given immediately in any area and by any company, he said.

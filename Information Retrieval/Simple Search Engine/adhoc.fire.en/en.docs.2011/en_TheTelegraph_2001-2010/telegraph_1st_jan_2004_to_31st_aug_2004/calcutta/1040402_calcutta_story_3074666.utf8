Soma Banerjee and Sangita S. Guha Roy Actress Debina Banerjee checks out the Kasmia range at The Taj Bengal on Thursday. Picture by Rashbehari Das  With heavy gold jewellery leaving the bank vaults less frequently, light and trendy designs are coming into their own.Wearability and style were definitely the focus at the Mehrasons exhibition held at The Taj Bengal on Wednesday and Thursday, where the Delhi-based jeweller displayed its Kasmia collection.On show was jewellery most appropriate for an evening bash. The pieces were all set on white gold. Black diamond sets  perfect with a black crepe sari, or even a formal pant suit  were some of the star attractions. The yellow hues of champagne diamonds and unique concave-shaped pendants with brown coffee diamonds had many scurrying to the counters.Launched six months ago in Delhi, Calcuttas socialites and their keen eye for tasteful designs brought Mehrasons  which is toying with the idea of setting up a store in Calcutta soon  to the city.And the trip paid off. The steep prices, beginning at Rs 20,000, were no deterrents to bookings and spot-buys.Red coral sets stood out with their unconventional designs. Intricately crafted earrings and rings in diamond, ruby and amethyst were the fastest movers. Diamonds in round, marquis and oval shapes shared space with solitaires.Festive fare Poila Baisakh may still be two weeks away, but city eateries have started getting their act together for what looks likely to be a sumptuous celebration of the Bengali New Year. Topping the early bird list is the vegetarian multi-cuisine restaurant Roopanjali, at CF block in Salt Lake.Traditionally targeting the Rajasthani and Gujarati residents of the area, the restaurant is now hoping to rope in Bengali customers as well. Our fare is strictly vegetarian as our existing clientele prefers it this way. So, the Bengali menu will also be vegetarian, says manager Tushar Subhra Basu.Favourites like shorshe machch and kosha mangsho may have to be given a miss, but the menu promises a wholesome deal with a wide variety including luchi, mishti pulao, dhokar dalna, chholar dal, begun bhaja, jhurjhure aloo bhaja, chutney, sweets and fried papad. The menu comes in thali form, at around Rs 100.The 40-seater joint boasts an adjoining hall available on hire for parties and gatherings. The restaurants existing menu includes north Indian, south Indian and Chinese meals and snacks. And the two-and-a-half-year-old eatery already has expansion plans. Its airy interiors have also been the setting for two telefilms.  The Bengali thali at Roopanjali. Picture by Rashbehari Das Trousseau talkGirls getting ready to tie the knot this summer and wishing to steer clear of heavily embroidered Benarasis have reason to rejoice. Weavers Studio at Ballygunge Place has unveiled a new collection of Benarasis for brides who revel in their freedom.Creams, peaches, light greens and sky blues may be unlikely colours for brides, but they will succeed in making a style statement while beating the summer heat.Priced between Rs 8,800 and Rs 20,000, the saris are sourced from weavers in Varanasi. Gadwals and Dhakais, part of every Calcutta brides trousseau, also find place at the 3,000 sq ft showroom. Though these are priced a little steeply at Rs 7,000 upwards, the zari motifs are refreshingly different. There is also a range of vegetable-dyed ikkats priced around Rs 16,000.As part of its Poila Baisakh collection, Weavers Studio has brought in exclusive saris from boutiques all over the country. Block-printed cottons, chikankari, kota and georgette from Kilol in Jaipur, hand-woven zari Uppada saris from Creative Bee in Hyderabad, Maheshwari block print saris from Khoj in Madhya Pradesh, hand-woven saris from Prasiddhi and reproductions of Kalakshetra saris from Vimor in south India stand out.Specially-woven Bhagalpuri cottons and white Maheshwari cottons are also a guaranteed way to beat the heat.Block prints in south cottons are favourites with middle-aged women, while the younger lot can usually be seen picking up zari-bordered south cottons in different shades of red and mustard yellows, said Amita Mitra, store manager.Kantha salwar-suit lengths, ranging from Rs 3,000 onwards, take in interesting motifs in squares and diamonds. Also part of the Poila Baisakh collection are vegetable-dye suit lengths, comb cotton and khadi salwar-kameezes with bandhej and light embroidery.Encouraged by the response to its Poila Baisakh collection, Weavers Studio plans to hold a stock clearance sale at Identity Gallery.

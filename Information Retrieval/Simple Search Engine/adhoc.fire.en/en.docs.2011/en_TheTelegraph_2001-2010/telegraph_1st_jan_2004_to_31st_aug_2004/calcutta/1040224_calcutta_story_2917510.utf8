The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Tuesday, February 24, 2004  Star Spot
 SARAH EZDANISARAH EZDANI																									She may be called, for the amount she loves to sleep (up to 15 hours, if she is left to her own devices), but that never stopped Sarah from filling all of her days with activity of some kind.																									Is what she considers herself. Having taken to water at an early age, she is raking in the medals now, in breaststroke, freestyle, backstroke, butterfly and medleys. The gal who heads the throwball and basketball school teams also holds the under-16 cup for all-round performance at Dalhousie Institute.																									Than she swims, as the 18-year-old proves at debates and elocution contests across the city. She was named best debater at the inter-school debate competition organised by the Institute of Company Secretaries as well as school fests like Josephstyna and in category I stage I of the Frank Anthony Memorial All India Debate Competition, though she had to pass up on the finals because of exams. The gab gift came in handy when she went to Pakistan as part of The Telegraph in Schools peace mission, days before the ISC exams. The school editorial board member delivered a monologue called Invocations in front of a huge audience. 																									Is where this Virgo finds herself, with more hats than one. After Our Lady Queen of the Missions, Park Circus, she shifted to Frank Anthony Public School in Class XI, where she was given the post of head girl in May last year and is also secretary of the school Interact Club. That aside, she regularly tops her class, as she just did in the board rehearsals, despite her cross-border escapade.																									Has this international law aspirant aplenty, to fill the rest of her time. She has worked with CINI Asha on various projects for underprivileged kids, knows the basics of piano, walks the ramp in school fashion shows, made it to the top 10 finalists at the Teen Of The Year competition, was named runner-up at the Dalhousie Institute May Queen pageant, has dabbled in theatre and is now playing the lead in a yet-to-be-released digital film called The Cashbook.

 																											- Service providers cry foul over three-month CAS deferment A STAFF REPORTER																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) decision to push back conditional access system (CAS) implementation by at least three more months has not taken the local cable industry by surprise. Reactions range from resignation to rage.																								Both operators and broadcasters felt that Mondays announcement merely put an official stamp on the buzz that CAS would not be implemented before the parliamentary elections. 																								But the multi-system operators (MSOs) were far from amused. Whos looking at the huge hit were taking every month on the investment we had made on CAS? demanded a senior official of RPG Netcom, the citys largest MSO.																								If CAS is continuously delayed like this, the business model becomes completely unviable for us, he added. Losses per month, from investment on set-top boxes to payment to broadcasters, are running into lakhs.																								Rather than saying that CAS is deferred for three more months, Trai should have mentioned a date when implementation may actually take place, which would have had a positive reaction from the industry, said an official of Manthan, another city MSO. These points were raised when Trai asked MSOs for suggestions, he added, but to little avail, it seems.																								Added to the deferment is the imminent subscriber-base hike by pay channels that has raised serious concern among operators and MSOs.																								With the telecast rights of the Indo-Pak series exclusively with Ten Sports, it is the strongest contender for initiating the subscriber-base hike, expected to be followed by STAR and other broadcasters.																								There will be major chaos if broadcasters ask for a hike and we are unable to raise the money from the subscribers, said Mrinal Chatterjee, a cable operator.																								The possibility of another round of channel switch-offs  with Ten Sports a must till Team India returns  cannot be ruled out either.																								But as of now, it is a wait-and-watch situation, with no channel officially communicating anything to MSOs on the issue.																								Trai, last week, clarified that while subscription rates remain frozen, broadcasters are free to ask operators for more numbers from the ground.

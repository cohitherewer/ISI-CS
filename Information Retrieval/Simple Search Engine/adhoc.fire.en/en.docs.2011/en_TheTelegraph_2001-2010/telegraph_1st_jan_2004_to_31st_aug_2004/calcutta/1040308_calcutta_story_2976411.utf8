The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Tight rein on flying thieves
 Dhiraj Banerjee				 	 Dhiraj Banerjee, officer-in-charge, Kasba police station, met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included Sanat Dey, Subimal Sen, Dulal Banerjee, Atanu Pandit, Sourindranath Bose and Panna Roychowdhury				 																																																																																																																																																																																																													

Sanat Dey: Petty theft is on the rise in the area.																																																			Yes, I admit that theft is rampant in several pockets of Kasba. However, most of the cases are of a petty nature, like stealing of car stereos, bicycles and so on. Unlike in our adjoining police station areas, there are no hideouts here. Most of the thieves come from Entally, Tiljala and Metiabruz. We call them flying thieves, and it is difficult to catch them because they do not have any local links. However, in the past two years, we have arrested about 500 of them. We conduct joint raids with Tiljala police station to track down these thieves.																																																									

Dulal Banerjee: Many arrive on the last trains from Jadavpur and Dhakuria. They steal stuff and flee on the first trains.																																																			That was true till a few months ago. Now, we are organising joint raids with the government railway police to ward off these criminals. Their number has dwindled. If we fail to conduct a thorough search of all the trains arriving at those stations late at night, we strictly check out the last trains entering the stations and the first trains leaving them.																																																									

Sanat Dey: We see some satta joints near Haltu petrol pump, as also at Kabarkhana and Ballygunge Kayasthapara. 																																																			These are stray cases, in which a few people get together to play a hand. In most cases, they gamble, rather than play typical satta. This kind of gambling is called playing a board.																																																									

Panna Roychowdhury: I have been running a factory in Kasba for 10 years now. I had a bitter experience at the police station eight years ago and opted to engage private security guards for my factory. Recently, however, a few local hoodlums entered the factory and erected a makeshift temple while I was away. I duly informed your officials and they demolished the structure. Now those hoodlums are trying to foment trouble over damage to the temple.																																																			If it is an unauthorised structure, we men in uniform are not bothered about what the building is. In your case, that temple was illegally erected on your land without your permission. You sought our help, and we sent over men to help your guards flush out the hoodlums. If they try to create any further trouble, they will be tackled within the legal purview. 																																																									

Subimal Sen: Road mishaps are on the rise at the Rashbehari connector to the EM Bypass and on Bijon Setu.																																																			The problem is that traffic movement in those areas falls under the jurisdiction of Calcutta Police. And we do not have any traffic officials, except for a few home-guards, to man these areas. We are trying our best to keep the road clear by shifting some minibus and auto stands. 																																																									

Dulal Banerjee: We have formed a Puja Samannay Committee in the area. How can we further help police?																																																			You had organised a blood donation camp and we provided all possible help for it. Moreover, we had organised a traffic safety week recently, in which your organisation, too, had played a positive role. These activities are important in developing a police-public realtionship that is mutually beneficial. 																																																									

Atanu Pandit: In Jadavpur and Dhakuria, sale of illicit liquor is on the rise. Officials of Kasba, East Jadavpur and Dhakuria thana simply pass the jurisdiction buck.																																																			That is not true. Often, officials of all three police stations organise joint raids. For example in Panchanantala, there are some hooch shops. But thats railway police jurisdiction. So, to organise a raid there, we need their help. They, too, try and help as much as they can.																																																									

Dulal Banerjee: But how is the illicit liquor coming into the area when police are so active and conducting regular raids?																																																			You are not aware of the number of people involved in the trade. Ballygunge railway station is a hub of the trade. Often, to evade us, the vendors carry the liquor in pouches that they smuggle in in vegetable baskets. These are then passed on to the selling centres. It is impossible for us to check every basket of vegetables entering the market. But whenever we get specific information, we conduct a raid and seize the baskets. The vendors often stock these pouches in a hideout near Lake police station, off Dhakuria bridge. 																																																											Last year, 2,880 persons were arrested for dealing in illicit liquor and 2,726 litres of the stuff were seized from them. But we saw many of them back in business after getting a bail from court. The cases against them are still pending.

 															- Three-star hotel for saltLec techhies A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sixty rooms for touring professionals in the states IT hub. Picture by Pabitra Das																								With the IT industry back on the growth path, the volume of business travellers at the Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec) has moved northwards. And, recognising the need for a hotel at the heart of the IT hub, city-based International Group is setting up a three-star hotel in Sector V.																								To be inaugurated on March 1, the budget business hotel, with room-rents in the range of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,800, will have all that a touring techhie will want, promises Subarno Bose, chairman of the group, which is also into offering professional courses in management, IT and hotel management. 																								Webel, the governments nodal IT agency, wants us to inaugurate the hotel as early as possible, as the infotech industry wants a hotel in the area for the accommodation of professionals, said Bose, explaining the need of a hotel in the area.																								Keeping in mind the requirements of the travellers, all 60 rooms will be Internet-equipped, and the hotel will have provisions to offer laptops on hire. Besides, guests will also have the option of using the 120-seater computer centre. For high-speed connectivity, the hotel has already taken a lease-line connectivity.																								Spread over 35,000 sq ft, the hotel will cover four floors of the 10-storeyed International Towers, next to IBMs building in Sector V. 																								The remaining floors serve as the campus of the International Institute of Hotel Management, one of the oldest hotel management institutes in this part of the country. Students will have the opportunity of an on-the-job training because of a hotel on the same campus, Bose added.																								Not just laying down an enabling business infrastructure, the hotel  built with an investment of around Rs 15 crore  will have other add-ons to suit IT professionals.																								Since their schedule here is 24-by-7, we will have a multi-cuisine, 24-hour coffee shop and a restaurant serving Italian, Mexican and Continental food, adds Bose. The restaurants and banquet facilities will open their doors from January 31.																								For the health-conscious techhie, there will be a multi-gym and a swimming pool, to be added in the second phase of construction. We have plans to scale up and add some facilities in the second phase, which will involve another Rs 5 crore, said Bose, outlining the future plans.																								Senior officials from IBM, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Wipro have seen the facilities and promised permanent bookings throughout the year. And, given the growth in the industry, we expect around 100 per cent occupancy, added Bose, who is convinced that the payback period for his investments will not be more than four years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Rule rein for killer cars
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Days: 18. Death toll: 23. The cold statistics mirror the blood on the city streets in the New Year.																								Police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty on Monday voiced grave concern over the spiralling fatality count in road accidents this January. The police-driven road safety week itself witnessed six traffic deaths, as opposed to four in January 2003 and four in January 2002.																								Get cracking Stop reckless driving at any cost, was the message from the commissioners chamber. Under pressure from Writers Buildings to curb road accidents, the Lalbazar brass scurried to get its traffic act together.																								At the review meeting attended by deputy commissioner (traffic) Peeyush Pandey and joint commissioner Banibrata Basu, the police commissioner also expressed displeasure over the mishaps that claimed 12 lives between January 11 and 18.																								Reckless driving seems to have been responsible for most of the accidents. Take measures against such drivers. If necessary, cancel their licences. And do it now, said Chakraborty.																								Some of the commissioners commandments: Apply Section 184 of Motor  Vehicles Act (action against rash driving) as much as possible Revoke driving licences  if anyone is found guilty of repeated offences Suspend licence even if  it is the first offence Make sure that traffic  sergeants patrol the streets constantly, instead of keeping  a watch from the sidelines.																								And the onus was placed on Pandey. We have been told to round up rogue drivers and present them before the deputy commissioner from Tuesday, said an official of the traffic department. From Tuesday, we will start booking drivers under Section 184 and slap fines as high as Rs 2,000, warned joint commissioner Banibrata Basu.																								And the drive against jaywalkers will continue. We have been collecting a token fine of Rs 2 to Rs 5 from pedestrians at five crossings. At least 150 people are being penalised every day, said Basu.

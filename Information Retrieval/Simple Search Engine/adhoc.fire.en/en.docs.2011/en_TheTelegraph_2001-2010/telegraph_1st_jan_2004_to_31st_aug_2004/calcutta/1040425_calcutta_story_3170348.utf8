 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Lawyers stick to boycott guns
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Senior members of the Calcutta High Courts Bar Association said on Saturday that the lawyers decision to boycott the chief justices court from Tuesday will not be revoked till more division benches are set up to hear writ appeals.																								At present, almost all the writ appeals are being heard by a lone division bench presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur. As a result, new writ appeals are piling up, said one of the lawyers. 																								The association is also protesting the lack of amenities on the high court premises. The chief justice has promised to take steps to provide proper amenities to the lawyers, litigants and clerks in the high court building by the first week of May. But he has not made any commitment to meet our other grievances, a senior Bar Association official said. 																								Association president Sardar Amjad Ali said the chief justice had agreed to shift some of the offices from the high court building to its premises at 5, Council House Street.																								According to sources, the chief justices office has also contacted the public works department for the construction of more rooms in the high court building. Water coolers on each of the three floors and a face-lift for the toilets are also on the cards.																								Mathur has convened a meeting at his residence on Sunday with representatives of the Bar Association, Bar Library Club and the Incorporate Law Society.																								We will attend Sundays meeting, but our decision to boycott the chief justices court will stand till the Bar Association adopts a different resolution, Ali said on Saturday.																								Accidents kill two																								Two people were killed and one was critically injured in separate road accidents in the city on Saturday.																								An unidentified elderly man was run over by a tram at the Kidderpore Road-Catherine Avenue intersection at around 5 am, police said. The second accident occurred at the NSC Bose Road-Ranikuthi crossing. Kumkum Mitra, 34, a resident of Netaji Nagar, slipped and fell off a cycle-rickshaw. The rear wheels of an oil tanker, overtaking the rickshaw, killed her instantly. The driver of the tanker was beaten up by local residents. He was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital later by the police.																								A 36-year-old constable with the Traffic Guard headquarters, Harekrishna Mandal, was admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital after a private car hit him at the Chittaranjan Avenue-Eden Hospital Road intersection.

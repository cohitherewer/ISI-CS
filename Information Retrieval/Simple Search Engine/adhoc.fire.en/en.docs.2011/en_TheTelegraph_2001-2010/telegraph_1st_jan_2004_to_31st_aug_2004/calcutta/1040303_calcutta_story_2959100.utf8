 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Poll saves maidan from Mamata
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 																								The Election Commission has done Calcutta a major service without realising it. 																								It has saved a major patch of green from getting misappropriated by Trinamul Congress chief and minister for coal and mines Mamata Banerjee. She had drawn up plans for an indoor stadium on Park Circus Maidan, usurping more than half of the citys largest park.																								Mamata was to lay the foundation stone of the Rs 30-crore project in early March but the announcement last Sunday of the Lok Sabha elections forced her to shelve the project, to avoid a violation of the poll code of conduct. The green has been saved, at least for the time being. 																								Coal India was to construct the 12,000-seat stadium with land from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), and Mamata had accompanied mayor Subrata Mukherjee and Coal India officials to Park Circus Maidan last Thursday for a survey.																								Her decision to construct the stadium comes at a time when the CMC has already announced a rule that in case of big parks  like Park Circus Maidan  not more than 10 per cent of the green can be encroached upon. The rule was framed as part of a frantic effort to save the existing green patches in the city.																								Civic officials said Park Circus Maidan is the citys most heavily-encroached park. More than 40 per cent of it has been taken over, they said. 																								A puja committee, a club, a gym, a water supply booster station and a CMC junkyard have eaten up more than half the park. The last major encroachment took place in December 2003, when a badminton stadium was constructed there for a club with funds from local MP Ajit Panja. 																								Local Congress councillor Shammi Jahan said an indoor stadium would have ruined whatever green the park has left.																								The park is the lung of the area. The CMC should spend time and energy beautifying it instead of cluttering it up more, she said.																								Minister for youth welfare services and local CPM legislator Mohd Salim said: It is our misfortune that Mamata never does what the people need. She could have okayed a football field on the Maidan, instead.

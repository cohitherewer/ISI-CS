 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Pregnant housewife set ablaze
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Housewife Tabassum Begum, 23 and five months pregnant, suffered serious burns on Tuesday evening at her Phoolbagan Road residence, in the Beniapukur police station area, when her husband, Mohd Asif, doused her with kerosene and set her ablaze.																								Asif was rounded up from his home on Wednesday morning on a complaint lodged by Tabassums father, Mohammad Shafiullah. On Tuesday evening, Asifs mother Rehana Begum and sister Shabana ordered Tabassum to opt for an abortion. Six months ago, her in-laws had forced her to terminate a three-month-old pregnancy. A case had been registered then, as Tabassum had lodged a complaint with us after her in-laws attempted to immolate her. Her left hand had been badly burnt, said a Beniapukur thana official.																								According to deputy commissioner (headquarters) H.P. Singh, Asif was arrested but Shabana and Rehana, named in the FIR, are absconding. Tabassum was married in December 2001. Since then, her father was asked to send over tidy sums at regular intervals by Asif and his mother. A talaq was on the cards, and a child could spoil things for Asif, police reasoned. 																								Asifs family tried to pass off the incident as a suicide attempt and admitted Tabassum to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. Shafiullah was informed on the telephone. Tabassum, with 80 per cent burns, told police briefly that her husband had set her ablaze.

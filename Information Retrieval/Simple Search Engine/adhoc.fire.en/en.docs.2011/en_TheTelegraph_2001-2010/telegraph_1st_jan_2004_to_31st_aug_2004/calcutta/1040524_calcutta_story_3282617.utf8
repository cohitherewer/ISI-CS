The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Fruit-sellers, eateries and tea-stalls have eaten up platforms 1 and 2 of Ballygunge Junction railway station. It seems the encroachers enjoy the patronage of local politicians and therefore, the authorities find it difficult to evict them. Bold steps should be taken against these vendors.
	 Mohan Lal Sarkar, Budge Budge. 
	Few people know that Ganja Parks real name is D.N. Mitra Square. The park has long been rid of the drug rackets that had plagued it in the past. The Corporation should maintain the park and prominently display that the park has been named after Dwarika Nath Mitra. 
	Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row.

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								After spending a crore to buy 10 automotive sprinklers for washing the streets of Calcutta, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to spend another Rs 5 lakh to deploy water-jet tankers to wash the roadside trees.																								Simply washing the roads doesnt make the city look cleaner. The trees alongside need to be cleansed of their dust and dirt. They need to be washed, too, reasoned Mukherjee on Monday.																								Besides, a wash is healthy for the trees. It helps them breathe easy, and ensures release of more oxygen in the air during photosynthesis, echoed mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Hridayanand Gupta.																								There are over three lakh trees lining the pavements and in the parks of the city.																								The former Left Front board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had decided in 1998 to take up a scheme to wash roads and roadside trees, but scrapped the scheme for technical reasons. The hydrants of unfiltered water had valves of brass, and most of them were stolen. Besides, the water pressure was not adequate for washing roads. 																								The Trinamul Congress-BJP successor, led by mayor Mukherjee, when it decided to wash the roads with filtered water, was stopped short in its tracks by party leader Mamata Banerjee. 																								After a wait of about two years, former mayoral council member (conservancy) Mala Roy procured a fleet of vehicles fitted with sprinklers and the street-washing resumed, though unceremoniously, after a gap of over 35 years. Each vehicle cost Rs 8 lakh. 																								On the mayors advice, I have asked chief engineer Arun Sarkar to prepare a scheme for water jets in the existing sprinkler vehicles, said Roys successor Rajib Deb. According to Sarkar, a sprinkler vehicle carries 6,000 litres of water and for washing the trees, they are to be fitted with car-washers. Each car-washer will cost Rs 50,000 and so, the bill works out to Rs 5 lakh for car-washing facilities in all 10 sprinkler vehicles.																								The civic authorities believe that a regular wash will help reduce the death rate of trees in the city. According to civic horticulturists, 40 per cent of the saplings planted along the roads have died. Also, some on major thoroughfares like CIT Road, Alipore Road, Gariahat Road, Rashbehari Avenue and SP Mukherjee Road have started drying up.

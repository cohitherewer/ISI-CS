 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Calcutta mould in Iraq matrix
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 A building in the Iraqi presidential compound in Baghdad catches fire after being hit by a missile during a US strike early on March 22, 2003. (AFP)																								Calcutta will have a role to play in the reconstruction plan for Iraq. And the line of thinking the city will be taking to a special talks table in Bahrain this autumn is: war-torn Iraqs people and civilisation run the risk of losing their identity in the melting pot of reconstruction unless the world is sensitive to the countrys past.																								This is what Centre for Built Environment (CBE), a city-based, non-profit society of architects, planners and environmental engineers, will have the opportunity to put forth as it has been invited to attend an international conclave, Iraq Reconstruction  petroleum, power, water, fire safety, telecom. The cross-sector conference, to be held at the Bahrain International Exhibition Centre, Manama, from September 13 to 15, will focus on the worlds largest reconstruction project since the end of the World War II.																								Its a huge honour for us to contribute to the Iraq matrix. Our role would be to provide critical inputs on how to best protect and preserve the cultural heritage of what is a unique receptacle of ancient civilisations. We would also raise points to ponder about the wars fallout on Iraqs built as well as natural environment, says CBE president Santosh Ghosh, architect and urban designer.																								Understanding the essential grain of Iraqs civilisation is crucial for the rebuilding exercise, feels architect-planner Unmesh Kirtikar, part of the CBE think-tank, which sent representatives to 16 global forums last year. Globalisation has a sad fallout; with inputs coming in from all corners of the world, the individuality of cities reduced to rubble is often lost, he laments.																								CBEs research for the conference-exhibition will revolve around studying the urban character of the region, its people and lifestyle and the adaptation of the timeline in relation to the traditional and the modern. Their urban planning is more organic than a rigid Roman grid, quite akin to Istanbuls Grand Bazaar layout, which is not monotonous. So, care must be taken to ensure this organic character sustains itself, and the essential urban form remains, stresses Kirtikar.																								The International Commission of Monuments and Sites (Icomos) and other agencies had urged the US State Department to spare the heritage sites in the carpet-bombing, but a lot of priceless structures were hit since the documentation with Icomos was not updated and digitised, points out Ghosh.																								CBE will also bring to Bahrain its domain knowledge on water resources management. Water is really their mainstay and we must remember the Mesopotamians were the first irrigation-oriented civilisation in the world, says the CBE president.

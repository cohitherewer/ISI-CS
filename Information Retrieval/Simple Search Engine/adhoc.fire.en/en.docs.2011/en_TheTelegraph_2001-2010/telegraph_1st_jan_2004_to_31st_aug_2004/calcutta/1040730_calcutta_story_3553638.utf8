 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 When error becomes grace
																								Ever since man became a member of society, he has very conveniently set parameters for people and manners. He, along with his brotherhood of social beings, decides on what are the accepted codes of conduct so that anyone who does not fit the bill may be treated as a misfit. Bhuto is one such misfit. He is the epitome of timidity and submissiveness; his life the source of laughter for those who know him. Bhuto is the ordinary man leading an inconsequential life except that his hapless antics provide for a comic relief to his acquaintances and colleagues alike. Bhitu Bhutor Bhul is about a comic turn of events that come to pass after Bhuto commits the grave error of putting a stop in the wrong place while taking a dictation from his boss.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Bhitu Bhutor Bhul, produced by Howrah Dakshinayan																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

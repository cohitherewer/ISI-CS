The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Phone bills just a dial away
				 	 Salil Kumar Bhaduri, general manager (customer service), Calcutta Telephones, met readers of The Telegraph at his office last week. Participants included G.C. Laha, R.A. Mundra, Chandrashekhar Basu Majumder, Atanu Pandit, Juthika Bhattacharjee, Anirban Roy and Srinjoy Basu				 																																																																																																																																																																		

G.C. Laha: Telephone bills are either received late or not at all. But the line is invariably disconnected if the bill is not paid.																																																			The best way to avoid this is to avail of our interactive 1501 service. If you are not getting your bill in time, call up this number and you will be told your bill amount. Proceed to any of our cash counters and take a duplicate bill by showing a previous bill and deposit the amount. Now, we are making the process simpler. The customer just needs to go to any of our cash collection centres and fill up a pay-in slip to deposit the money. That apart, those with Internet facilities can get their bill through e-mail. You simply take out a printout and pay it.																																																									

R.A. Mundra: It would help if, like the power bill, the phone bill told us about the number of units consumed.																																																			The system already exists in our ISDN services. For general telephones, we had tested the procedure of declaring the metered units through an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Actually, like changed number information or billing information, we are trying to introduce a single number to announce the metered calls. However, particulars of calls can be got from our website, www.calcuttatelephones.com. Theres a new system ahead by which you can find out the number of your metered calls and the bill amount by IVRS.																																																									

Juthika Bhattacharjee: I had applied for a change of name at the Dum Dum exchange nine months ago. All the formalities were completed but the bill is still being sent in my name.																																																			For a change of name, some legal criteria have to be fulfilled. The subscriber enjoying the facility has to file an affidavit explaining the reasons for the proposed change of name. The person in whose name the connection is to be transferred will also have to file an affidavit expressing his wish to take over the connection. It takes about two months to complete the process. 																																																									

Srinjoy Basu: I use the BSNL Internet facility. Logging in at night or in the evening takes abnormally long and downloading is very slow. I use the latest software and hardware versions.																																																			The number of Internet users increases from the evening. As more and more users log in, the download speed  which is an indicator of the Net speed  decreases. BSNL uses two bandwidth connections, each of 34 megabytes per second (Mbps). This bandwidth is fixed and is our Internet gateway for international connections. When more and more people are using this gateway at a time to access the foreign websites, the speed of the entire network decreases. You cannot increase the speed simply by upgrading your computer hardware. However, the bandwidth for national connections is wider and accessing domestic websites is swifter.																																																									

Srinjoy Basu: Is there a cheap Internet package for students?																																																			There is a special package in which students are charged only Rs 6 per hour for using our network. The service is available only to a bona fide student of Class X and above. To get the subsidised connection, a student has to submit a document substantiating his/her claim, attach it to a single-page application form and submit it at the customer service counter.																																																									

R.A. Mundra: Why do rates for landline-to-landline calls and landline-to-mobile calls differ?																																																			Because when a customer is using our network, we allow him some facilities. But when the caller is using two networks, we have to pay the network provider for it. This is fixed and revised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. We have to abide by its guidelines. Concluded

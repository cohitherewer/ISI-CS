		 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Toll charged for services not rendered
 Eateries carry on a flourishing trade at the Beltala office of the PVD. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySandip Banerjee: Several flyovers and bridges are being constructed in and around the city. Many of them charge a toll from users. But the road conditions are not up to the mark. Why should the user pay for a service not rendered?																																																													The toll is levied on vehicles that use the infrastructure. The traffic department takes care of these roads but we, too, have to keep an eye on it. For example, Vidyasagar Setu is used by nearly 35,000 vehicles a day. But the bridge has the capacity to bear 80,000 vehicles a day. Thus, the infrastructure remains under-utilised. But we are noticing a gradual increase of traffic on the route. This shows that people are ready to pay for smooth passage. Though this is not our main job, we try to draw the attention of the police to keep the roads free to ensure smooth vehicular movement.

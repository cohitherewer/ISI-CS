 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Realtors seek tax revision
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government has assured city developers it would look into the dated laws and irrational taxes hindering growth in the city and driving away prospective investors.																								State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who met a delegation of Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India)  Bengal on Wednesday, was extremely receptive to the three-point proposal of the realtors.																								We have sought modification to the Urban Land Ceiling Act, which impedes large-format projects, besides reduction in sanction fees. The minister promised us he would place the matter before Cabinet to pave the way for necessary alteration, with provisions for middle and low-income groups, said Sushil Mohta, vice-president, Credai  Bengal.																								The minister also expressed concern at the high rate of municipal taxes in the city, driving away ITES and BPO units to cities offering more competitive rentals. 																								At 53 per cent for commercial properties, municipal taxes here are the highest in the world and we are glad the minister appreciates the need to rationalise the tax structure, observed confederation secretary Pradip Chopra.

  Gift of blood: Quality should not be sacrificed in rush for quantity The report Panels four, chaos to the fore, June 11, really puts the state transport ministry to shame. The government had constituted as many as four committees within a span of four years to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. Instead, things have simply turned from bad to worse over the years.  The recommendations made by the committees are rotting in files as there seems to be no honest intention on the part of the government to implement them. The utterly lackadaisical attitude of the transport authorities has given rise to more indiscipline and chaos on the roads. Apart from an uncontrollable number of autorickshaws clogging the streets, unplanned construction of bus stops and allotting of parking zones have become a menace. Public vehicles also stop just about anywhere to pick up and drop passengers, without a care for the passengers safety. Most tram stops are located at the same place as the designated bus stops. With trams blocking a major stretch of the road, passengers have no option but to stand on the carriageway to catch the buses. Perhaps, there is no way out of the present traffic mess. Whatever Subhas Chakraborty might say, Calcutta is undoubtedly the worst in comparison to other metros in the country. His transport department has been a passive spectator for such a long time, giving more and more licences to autorickshaws and not checking the ones plying illegally, that now it finds the citys traffic unmanageable. The authorities are unable to cancel the licences for fear of resistance from the unions supported by its own partys labour wing. Sunil Banerjee,
VIP Road Sometimes the representatives of government blood banks fail to turn up at the blood donation camps to check the collection procedure and verify the credentials of the donors (Bad blood blame at govt door, June 10). A certificate must be given with every unit of blood bought from blood banks guaranteeing that it is safe. A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,
Hooghly A foolproof method of detecting HIV-contaminated blood, collected at voluntary camps, will not be possible in our country. P24 antigen test, used in the West, costs around Rs 1,500 and people in our country cannot afford it. Strict donor screening is the only way to prevent the virus from passing on through blood transfusion. Govinda Bakshi,
Budge Budge Thank you for highlighting the true-face of our nature-loving government (Failure foul in clean-up class, June 5). Can we question the chief minister when the civic body mercilessly chops down greenery in the name of development or when poachers hold sway in the Sunderbans? Perhaps then he dozes. Or may be he is busy hosting a wildlife film festival. Bikram Sarkar,
Santoshpur Avenue The tragic end of five members of an expedition team came as a shock, more so because the mishap occurred in a year when the first Bengali set foot on the peak of Everest (Kasba mourns its felled constable, June 12). Prahlad Agarwala,
NadiaKudos to traffic sergeant Partha Chatterjee for booking the car of a superior police officer which was parked in a no-parking zone (Sergeant reaps the kudos, June 12). If the top brass encourages sergeants like Chatterjee, the morale of the ranks would get a boost. Kajal Chatterjee,
Sodepur Mayor Subrata Mukherjees philosophy of less tax and wider coverage is commendable (Civic tax slash with eye on poll, June 8). If more areas are brought under the tax net, the CMCs revenue will definitely increase. A light tax burden will also motivate people to pay. But the civic body should stress on realisation of taxes that are due. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
BehalaApropos Students cry foul over fees, June 10, the schools and the government should take steps so that tuition fees are not hiked at will. Anil Kumar Sen,
Ram Chandra Chatterjee StreetA closer look at the picture of skipper Saurav Ganguly with his daughter on June 12 would reveal an insignificant figure in the background  that of a child labourer working on the construction of the swimming pool. The sheer irony of it was shocking. Aishee Sengupta,

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Switch-off over cable arrears
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Almost 1.5 lakh cable homes went without the STAR and Sony channels on Wednesday evening. The channels were switched off by the broadcasters on the network of multi-system-operator (MSO) CableComm for reasons including huge outstanding payment to other MSOs and sheltering defaulting operators.																								The areas affected include Gol Park, New Alipore, Gariahat, Kasba, Kalyani and Chakdah.																								Though RPG Netcom officials  the distributor for both STAR and Sony packages  refused to comment on the issue, it was learnt that CableComm owes other MSOs Rs 2.17 crore. 																								Of this, RPG Netcoms share is Rs 1.5 crore, Manthans Rs 51 lakh and SitiCables Rs 16 lakh.																								Recent meetings to resolve the issues proved futile, and matters came to a head when, during a meeting at CableComms office on Tuesday, Manthan and RPG Netcom staged a walkout.																								A code of conduct was drawn up by broadcasters and MSOs last month, on setting a time-limit that operators would be allowed for clearing their dues before moving on to another MSO. 																								It was also agreed that in case either signatory to the agreement did not adhere to the rules, boycott through switch-offs would also come into play. 																								Steps taken by the two broadcasters on Wednesday could be the first step to impose the code. 																								CableComm officials expressed surprise at this arbitrary and highhanded move. 																								Director Raj Singh said the MSO would seek a clarification from RPG Netcom and appraise its viewers, operators and administration.

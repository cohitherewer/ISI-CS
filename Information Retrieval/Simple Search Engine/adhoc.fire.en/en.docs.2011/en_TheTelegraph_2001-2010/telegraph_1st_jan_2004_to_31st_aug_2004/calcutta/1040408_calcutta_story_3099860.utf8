 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Head of the house found dead in bed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Kanjilal Saha, 60, was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his Barrackpore residence on Wednesday morning. His body bore a deep gash on the forehead.																								We received a call from the house that a man was lying dead in his house. We found him lying dead in his bed. Someone appears to have struck him with a sharp weapon on his forehead, which could have caused his death, said Supratim Sarkar, additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore.																								Saha had a publishing business and had recently entered the transport business.																								It is curious that though Saha was found dead in his bedroom, none of his other family members was aware of the assault. Even the pet dog of the house had not behaved abnormally last night, said an investigating officer.																								Saha is survived by his wife and two sons. They later told the police that they knew nothing of the incident till Wednesday morning.																								We had not heard any sound in the night to suspect that something was amiss on the ground floor, admitted Sahas elder son.																								Neighbours, however, alleged that Saha had recently found himself in the midst of a family dispute. Some even hinted at the possibility of foul play.																								We often heard loud quarrels in the house between family members. Even Saha and his wife could be heard arguing, said T. Gupta, a neighbour.																								Saha had told us that he was being threatened by some unknown persons over a property dispute, added Gupta.

And now Aryan Vaid , the man who has in his kitty amongst other films Makrand Deshpandes Danav and Vinita Nandas White Noise, is all set to capture the imagination of the audience with three very diverse roles. 																								In fact, with sex looking like the only sellable formula in Bollywood after success stories like Murder and Julie, Aryan has decided to turn up the heat.																								I play everything from a husband who swaps his wife for fun to a gigolo in my next few roles, he says, in town for the graduating fashion show of National Institute of Fashion Design (NiFD), Salt Lake.																								So, its sexy Aryan shedding inhibitions and slipping under sheets as lover, husband or just gigolo.																								While hes already doing Chahat Ek Nasha with ex-flame Manisha Koirala, he begins shooting in Goa for Sanjay Zaveris Fun from Saturday.																								The story is actually about husband-swapping, so it has very strong sexual intonations. But since my wife in the film gets murdered, I seek revenge and the story takes a turn towards a thriller, says Aryan, who has Siddharth Koirala (Manishas younger brother) working with him as the other protagonist in the film. 																								So is he still hooked to the Koirala clan even after his break-up with the Nepalese beauty? We are cool with each other on the sets of Chahat Ek Nasha. She even sends me text messages on my mobile phone; I just got one from her last night from New York, smile the hunk eager to separate his personal and professional lives.																								While the Manisha-starrer sees Aryan caught in a love triangle, complete with steamy scenes with Preeti Jhangiani, Mr 100%, which is also in the pipeline, sees him as gigolo. The film has Mahima Chaudhury opposite me, says Aryan not ready to reveal more about the role just as yet. 																								With ex-flame Keerti Reddy getting married to Tamil film hero Sumanth in less than a weeks time and Manisha having gone back to her foreign connection, relationships are rocky for this model-turned-actor.																								But with a chance to sizzle with his ex-lady loves on screen (Manisha in Chahat and Keerti in the Bin Tere Sanam remix), Aryan isnt complaining. 						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

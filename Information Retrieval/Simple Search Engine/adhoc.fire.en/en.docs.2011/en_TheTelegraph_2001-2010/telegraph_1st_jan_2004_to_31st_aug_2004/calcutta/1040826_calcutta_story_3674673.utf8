 Thursday, August 26, 2004 Life A century spent keeping timeMADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA (Top) Dumonts aircraft circles the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th Century and (above) Patrick Normand in the city on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															One hundred years ago, a pioneer in aviation inspired a path-breaking wristwatch designed by a premier European jeweller. 																					The friendship between Alberto Santos-Dumont and Louis Cartier gave birth to the Santos de Cartier watch. The global luxury jewellery and watch icon has revived the historic timepiece in the new Santos 100 collection, to commemorate its centenary. 																					e the products have been available at select retail outlets for a few months now, Patrick Normand, managing director, Cartier, Middle East, visited Calcutta on Wednesday to talk about the very first watch and its successors created by the legendary French label.																					The watch was originally created for a dandy, for a man with extremely refined taste, explains the Dubai-based Normand. Dumont had, apparently complained to Cartier that he had difficulty keeping track of time while flying, back in the day when fob watches were the fashion.																					So Cartier got to work, creating a classic piece which dared to introduce a leather strap, with external screws, to capture Santos spirit of adventure. It also took the risk of mixing steel and gold. Before this, the jeweller had stuck strictly to bracelet wristwatches, in gold and diamonds.																					The new line keeps alive this essence. Two Santos 100s have been launched, one in steel, the other in solid gold. The oversized automatic watches symbolise elegance, refinement, daring and style, adds the Frenchman. The three Santos Dumont watches are far sleeker, with a clean classical look, in yellow, white and pink gold.																					The cheapest of the lot is the steel Santos 100, at Rs 1,95,000, while the most expensive is the gold version at Rs 7,61,000. The slimmer line comes between Rs 4,40,000 and Rs 4,70,000. A Santos Demoiselle collection has also been unveiled for women, starting at Rs 1,20,000 for the most basic steel model, going up till Rs 13,90,000 for the most lavish, diamond encrusted variety.																					If that doesnt thrust the Cartier collection into the aspiration-only section, head for Exclusive Lines on Camac Street, the only authorised dealer in the city.																					early, these are luxury pieces meant for a select few. The prohibitive price points are not at all helped by the even more prohibitive taxes levied on such products in India, and the company has had to cut profits to keep Indian prices as close as possible to the global rates. Otherwise, it would have discouraged purchase in India altogether, reveals Normand.																					l, he sees India as following China and Russia as a market with the potential for the group, which has not yet launched its jewellery in India. There is a growing number of wealthy people in the country, which makes it an ideal market for our products, he smiles.																					Some consolation, that.

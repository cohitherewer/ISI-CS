 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 B-school boosts local base
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the count of aspirants for management degrees going up in the city and its periphery, leading B-school IMT Ghaziabad has decided to focus more on the region and set up its first regional headquarters in Calcutta. 																								Till now, we were offering only our distance learning programme with eight study centres in the region. But we have decided to set up 20 more study centres. Well also kick off full-time and part-time courses, said Saroj Datta, head, eastern region, IMT Ghaziabad, during the inauguration of the regional headquarters. 																								Ashoke Ranjan Thakur, vice-chancellor, West Bengal University of Technology, and H.S. Ghosh, registrar, Vidyasagar University, were present. 																								The institute is scouting for a suitable plot, not less than five to 10 acres, to set up a campus that conforms to the high standards of the institute. Though any time-line is yet to be firmed up, the institute wants to roll out the full-time and part-time courses as early as possible. 																								Our distance learning programme has seen a steady increase of applications from this part of the country and more than 20 per cent of our students are from here. Thats why we are keen to expand in this region, explained Datta. 																								As part of the distance learning programme, with affiliation from Vidyasagar University, the institute runs different-duration courses on various functional areas of management. The teaching methodology is a mix of classroom sessions at the study centres and self-learning through home assignments, projects and case studies.

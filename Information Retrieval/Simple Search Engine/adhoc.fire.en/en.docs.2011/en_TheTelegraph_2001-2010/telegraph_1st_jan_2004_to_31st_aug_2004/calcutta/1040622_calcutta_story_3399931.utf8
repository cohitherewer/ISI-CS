 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Transparency prod for HS council
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday asked the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary (HS) Education to file an affidavit within a week, listing the steps it had taken to bring more transparency in the publication of results and to minimise the anxiety of examinees, in accordance with an earlier observation of the same court.																								In its previous order, the division bench of the high court, presided over by former Chief Justice A.K. Mathur, while disposing of a petition by at least 300 aggrieved students, observed that the council should bring more transparency in its publication of results.																								Four years have passed and the council was yet to take any action with regard to the order of the court. In 2003, a petition was moved before the court, alleging that the council had violated the courts order by bringing no change in the method of publication of results.																								The petition also alleged that as the court order was not carried out, thousands of candidates of the Higher Secondary examination were dissatisfied with their results.																								The petition was rejected by Justice Pratap Roy of the high court, who held that it was at the discretion of the council whether or not it would change the method on the basis of the courts observations.																								Another judge, Justice Indira Banerjee of the same court, after hearing a similar plea by another petitioner, held that the observations of the court were equivalent to its order. The judge said the council would have to change the method of publication of results in accordance with the courts desire.																								Seeing the two disparate orders of two different judges, housewife Dipti Chakraborty, moved a petition before Calcutta High Court and asked the court to clarify which order was to be followed by the council.																								Petitioners counsel Supradip Roy told the court that general students are confused with the two different orders given by two judges of the same court. So, my client wants to know from the division bench its opinion on the matter.																								Lawyer Roy told the court that every year, after the publication of the HS and Madhyamik results, a good numbers of students, frustrated with their results, commit suicide. 																								The students had moved the court in 2000 demanding a photocopy of the answer-scripts along with the marksheet. The then division bench did not want to interfere with the policy of the HS council, but had observed that the council should take certain measures to bring transparency in the publication of results, Roy pointed out.																								On Monday, the division bench of Justice A.K. Kabir and Justice A.K. Bishi asked HS council lawyer R. Chatterjee to tell the court what steps his client had taken in accordance with the order of the court. 																								The lawyer told the court that the council had taken certain measures to make the publication of HS results more methodical. The court asked the lawyer to file an affidavit in this regard.

 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Shock, relief over verdict
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								One, based in the US, was driven by the memory of his wife to carry on a six-year-long legal campaign to avenge the death. 																								The other, in Calcutta, remembered his late mother in an expression of relief at the latest development in the Anuradha Saha case.																								Adversaries for six years, Kunal Saha and Sukumar Mukherjee, doctors based in Ohio and Calcutta, reacted emotionally to Fridays Calcutta High Court judgment that went in favour of Mukherjee and two other leading doctors of the city. 																								Shocked was Sahas first reaction on Friday, though he went on to claim that he had not lost faith in the judiciary. I am confident that justice will prevail at the end, when the Supreme Court, where I would move immediately, will again find the doctors guilty, said Anuradhas widower.																								Saha, a former student of Mukherjee, cited the instance in 1999 when the apex court had overturned a Calcutta High Court judgment that had quashed all charges against Abani Roychoudhury, one of the doctors accused in the case.																								It is the power of my love for Anuradha and the love I receive everyday from so many common people, that drives me forward, Saha informed The Telegraph in a message faxed from Ohio after the judgment .																								This is a vindication of my commitment to my profession. I am grateful to Almighty, and I remember my mother who passed away only two months ago Her blessings enable me to fight falsehood, was what Sukumar Mukherjee had to say.																								The Indian Medical Association, Calcutta, said the judgment would help doctors carry out their jobs more freely.																								R.D. Dubey, joint secretary of the All India Medical Council, added: Truth has prevailed. Kunal Sahas charges against the doctors had created confusion. The judgment will help doctors regain confidence.																								A member of the People for Better Treatment, who did not want to be named, alleged, however, that the judgment of the high court was biased.

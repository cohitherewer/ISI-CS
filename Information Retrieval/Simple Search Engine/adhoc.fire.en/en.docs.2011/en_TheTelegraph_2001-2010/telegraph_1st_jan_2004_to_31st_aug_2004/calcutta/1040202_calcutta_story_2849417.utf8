The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, February 02, 2004 				 Sabotage whiff in routine fire
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a rare case of an accidental fire proving to be otherwise, police have reopened the files pertaining to a blaze that broke out last November at Shree Shyam Diagnostics, in New Alipore. 																								On the evening of November 16, 2003, a fire gutted the popular diagnostic centre, which opened its doors in 2001 after buying sophisticated equipment with a loan of Rs 5 crore from the Park Street branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB). A routine diary was lodged at New Alipore police station. Routine investigations were carried out and the case was all but shut, until Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division), sought a detailed report on the blaze.																								Also, the bank wanted back the money and was eyeing the insurance claim. During inquiry, it was revealed that most employees had left the centre by 4.30 pm on November 16, while two officials of the company spent time scrutinising some documents and carrying them away.																								A few days ago, the Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL) report arrived and Sharmas hunch was proved right. The report clearly says the source of the fire was different on two floors and the blaze was not continuous, as should be in an accidental blaze, Sharma told Metro. The report also hinted at sabotage. 																								Sharma directed New Alipore police station to register a specific case of sabotage against two directors of the company and a general manager. 																								Santosh Poddar, one of the directors, said he did not know the contents of the FSL report and the subsequent police case. The fire was accidental. We spent a fortune on the building and would never allow anyone to set it alight. We have approached the insurance company with our claim and, hopefully, we can rebuild the centre with the money, Poddar said. 																								The police have told the insurance firm to withhold the claim until the investigation is over.

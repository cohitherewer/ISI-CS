 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Special court at Alipore jail due in March 
 DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY 																								The government is giving finishing touches to its special court building in Alipore Central jail for the trial of high-risk prisoners like Aftab Ansari, prime accused in the attack on the American Center. Ansari had also masterminded the abduction of Khadims vice-chairman Parthapratim Roy Burman. 																								Officials said on Sunday that Ansaris trial would begin in the special court as soon as it is ready. At present, Ansaris trial is being carried out in a makeshift court in the adjoining Presidency jail. A jailer had to shift to make room for the court. 																								We shall complete the construction of the proposed special court within a week. If everything goes on time, we are confident of opening the court by early next month, said Ramapada Bhattacharjee, superintendent of Alipore Central jail. Work on the new court started last December.																								An official of the public works department said the estimated cost of the proposed court will be around Rs 20 lakh. 																								Deputy inspector-general of prisons Anup Tripathi said that in future, all high-risk prisoners  who are capable of escaping from ordinary courts  will be tried in the special court at Alipore Central jail.																								We thought it essential to have such a heavily-guarded court, surrounded by high walls, when we had in hand prisoners like Ansari, Tripathi said. The surrounding walls of the proposed special court will be higher by four feet from the existing 16 feet. We are constructing the court on the roof of the two-storey Alipore jail. The court will be heavily guarded and no one without proper credentials will be allowed inside, he added. 																								Security is being tightened in all five central jails where high-risk prisoners are lodged. We have to intensify vigil, as criminals like Gabbar and Fatman, arrested in connection with the murder of Bunty on the Bypass, have been lodged in Alipore Central jail, Tripathi added. 																								Close-circuit cameras are being installed in all the central jails located in Calcutta, Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri and West Midnapore districts. Moreover, video records of convicts entry into the cells and release will be maintained.

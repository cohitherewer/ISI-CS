 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 CBI cuffs tax officer taking a bribe for refund job
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Criminal Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday arrested senior income-tax officer S. Bhattacharya on charges of corruption. Bhattacharya was rounded up from his office in Poddar Court.																								Acting on a complaint lodged by a person, whose identity has been kept a secret, the anti-corruption wing of the CBI set a trap at Bhattacharyas office around noon. 																								The CBI sleuths had recorded the complaints against him, but the agency had been waiting to catch him red-handed. 																								The officer had volunteered to push through an income-tax refund of Rs 1.5 lakh in a few days time, against a bribe of Rs 5,000, disclosed a senior CBI officer. 																								Bhattacharya had been pestering his client to hand over the bribe so he could start the refund process. The client, however, approached us and lodged a complaint against Bhattacharya, the officer added .																								On the basis of the complaint, the CBI sleuths lay in wait outside Bhattacharyas office in Poddar Court. The client walked in and offered Bhattacharya the promised sum. 																								Seconds after Bhattacharya accepted the money and rose from his chair to put it away in a locker, the sleuths closed in on him. The notes, bearing his fingerprints, were seized from Bhattacharya and he was immediately taken into custody.																								We are interrogating Bhattacharya to find out more details and the names of his other clients whom he may have fleeced or who may have paid him money to push through income-tax refunds, the CBI officer said. 																								In the past few months, the CBI has arrested several income-tax and customs officials on charges of corruption.																								Heading the list is a senior Airports Authority of India official, arrested by the anti-corruption wing of the CBI late in 2003. 																								The officer, N.K. Puri, was caught while accepting a bribe of Rs 5,000.																								Investigations revealed that Puri had asked for the money from a contractor for getting him the job of constructing a boundary wall. The contractor had then lodged a complaint with the CBI.																								In another case, a Bureau of Civil Aviation Security officer was arrested during the same period while accepting a laptop as a bribe.																								Earlier this year, three senior customs officials and two Railway Protection Force inspectors were arrested by the CBI. 																								During overnight raids conducted at the customs officials residences, unaccounted cash to the tune of several lakhs was seized by the CBI sleuths.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Dues dispute axe on sports channels
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the India-Pakistan show-stealer over, bickering in the local cable industry has started once again. And as always, at the receiving end are the viewers.																								Around 400,000 households in the city and suburbs went without sports channels ESPN and Star Sports on Monday evening on the Manthan network.																								Manthan blacked out the channels at 8.30 pm on Monday following scrolls run by ESPN Star Sports (ESS) informing viewers that Manthan owes huge outstanding to the channel.																								A spokesperson for the broadcaster said from Delhi: It is an outstanding amount issue and there is a significant amount that Manthan owes us. But as far as we are concerned, our channels are on since we havent switched them off. But if Manthan fails to pay up by Wednesday, we will switch them off ourselves.																								Manthan officials, however, claimed that there was no question of any outstanding amount and payments had been cleared up to March 2004. 																								We also wrote to ESS to clarify any outstanding amount, but they have not replied, a spokesperson said.																								Instead, Manthan officials claimed that the issue was a revamp that ESS is seeking. 																								The broadcaster had sought a price increase of Rs 7.70 from city multi-system operators (MSOs) in December 2003, taking its rate up from Rs 32 to Rs 39.70 per month per subscriber.																								As negotiations were on, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) issued a rate freeze directive prohibiting cable television prices from being increased at any of the tiers  consumer to last-mile operator, operator to MSO or MSO to broadcaster. ESS subsequently demanded a rise in subscriber base declaration from operators, instead of a price hike.																								In case of Manthan, it was a 25 per cent hike in sub-base declaration. But the operators feel its difficult to raise the money from the ground, said the Manthan spokesperson.																								Also, after what happened to Ten Sports, they feel that in case of an important match, particularly involving India, the government will step in anyway and resolve the situation, the spokesperson added.																								Neither Manthan nor ESS could confirm when the channels  beaming the Champions League semis  would be back on air.																								Other city MSOs have either agreed to the revamp, like SitiCable and CableComm, or are waiting for their operators to make their move like RPG Netcom.

 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Computer spree at hospital, life-saver defunct
 SANJAY MANDAL 																								Sushmita Gharami lies gasping at the paediatric medicine ward of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children. The seven-year-old, a polyneuropathy patient suffering from respiratory muscle paralysis, desperately needs a paediatric ventilator. But the only ventilator at the hospital, installed in 2002, lies defunct.																								Sushmita, of Sulagna Guri village, in Rajarhat, North 24-Parganas, was admitted to the hospital on March 22. Her condition worsened on Sunday.																								BC Roy Hospital authorities on Monday sent an SOS to SSKM Hospital through the central control room. 																								But we were told that there were no spare ventilator there. We then contacted the respiratory care unit of SSKM, but there was no bed available, added a BC Roy official.																								Doctors at the Narkeldanga hospital then requested Sushmitas parents to remove her to any private hospital. Not being able to afford treatment at a private clinic, her parents have left the life of their child to fate.																								Even as the government is busy installing 40-odd computers  the cost of which would add up to around Rs 26 lakh  it seems strangely reluctant to spend Rs 6 lakh for an essential piece of equipment to make the life-saving ventilator operative.																								We are waiting to make the ventilator work, as there is need to set up some allied infrastructure. Once that is set up, we can make it operative, said Mrinal Chatterjee, medical superintendent of BC Roy Hospital.																								The ventilator was installed on September 1, 2002, at a cost of Rs 6 lakh. However, the most essential equipment for operating the ventilator, the arterial blood gas analyser, is yet to be handed over to the hospital.																								According to officials at Salt Lakes Swashtha Bhavan, the arterial blood gas analyser will cost around Rs 6 lakh. Also required are trained personnel for operating the ventilator.																								Hospital sources said on Monday that on an average, five children suffering from respiratory muscle paralysis are admitted to the hospital every month.																								Some of these patients, of the Acute Flaccid Paralysis group, often die, while a few are shifted to private hospitals, one of the doctors revealed, on condition of anonymity.																								But indifferent to the vital needs of the hospital, the state health department is busy installing 40 computers, as part of the hospital management information service project.																								According to project officials at Swastha Bhavan, the installation cost would require around Rs 10 lakh, including electrical wires, and another Rs 16 lakh would be required to cover other costs.																								So many computers are not essential. It would have been better if we got more funds for other basic infrastructure, a doctor at BC Roy Hospital said.																								The neo-natal intensive care unit and the paediatric intensive care unit should also be set up immediately, but lack of funds is proving to be the stumbling block, an official said.																								Medical superintendent Chatterjee said the hospital was planning vertical expansion. We have plans to set up 10 more wards, accommodating 150 beds, he said. But there is no sign of the Rs 1.82 crore required for the growth plan.

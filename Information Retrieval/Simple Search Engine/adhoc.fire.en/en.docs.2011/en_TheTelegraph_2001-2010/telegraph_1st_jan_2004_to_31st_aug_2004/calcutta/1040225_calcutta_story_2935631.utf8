The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Fare falls foul of pocket
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should taxis charge 50 per cent extra from midnight to six in the morning? More letters will be printed next week				 Free for all: Late-night cab chaos at Howrah stationChandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna.																																																														I dont approve of the idea. Fifty per cent extra fare would be too much of a burden on the common man. Those who take cabs from railways stations do so because they dont have a private car at their disposal.									

Kamalika Nandy, 
																		Sodepur.																																																														Taxis have become an expensive means of transport. People might need a cab from midnight to 6 am for an emergency like hospitalising a patient or catching a flight. But charging an exorbitant amount is quite unreasonable.									

Patish Chandra Dey, 
																		Bediapara.																																																														Taxis are the only conveyance available after midnight. An extra Rs 10 or Rs 20 may be spared but they cant be allowed to charge 50 per cent more. The government should exercise more control over taxi services in the city and make cabbies provide passengers with bills carrying the licence numbers. 									

Neera Fogla, 
																		Rabindra Sarani.																																																														The proposition can be justified only if taxi drivers execute their services throughout the night. People will stop worrying if they can be assured of transport even at odd hours.									

Diptimoy Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														Why should taxis charge 50 per cent extra when they cant forgo even a small percentage of the fare in the afternoons when they are usually idle? Are commuters to suffer so that the cabbies can meet the demands of touts, corrupt policemen and political leaders? Absolutely not. People dont hire cabs from midnight to six in the morning to roam around the city. During the day, many drivers bluntly refuse passengers, while others tamper with the meters. There is no guarantee that they will not misbehave even if they are paid 50 per cent extra. A 20 per cent hike is still agreeable.									

Santanu Naskar, 
																		New Ballygunge Road.																																																														Why the extra money? Are they not charging enough already? Cabbies can at best request passengers to pay them more at night.									

Madhabi Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														I dont think a 50 per cent extra charge can be justified. Taxi drivers already make a lot of extra money every day by keeping the change that is supposed to be refunded to passengers. Unlike in other metropolitan cities, taxis here are not so disciplined which is why they bribe touts and policemen. The state administration should wake up from its slumber and take action against errant taxis. Only if cabbies mend their ways can we consider a 10-20 per cent hike in the fare at night.									

Piyal Mukherjee, 
																		Lake Town.																																																														The extra fare at night may not ensure that passengers will not be harassed by cab drivers. What if the latter demands a sum higher than that? The implementation of such a proposal is entirely uncalled for. The authorities should, instead, pull up the guilty taxi drivers.									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane.																																																														I approve of the idea only to a certain extent. If the rule is implemented, the authorities concerned should also ensure that passengers dont face further harassment. The present fare rates are more than enough for cabbies but they still resort to unfair means like doctoring the meters. Authorities should see that people can travel without fear at any time of the day.									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,
																		Entally.																																																														Taxi fares are always on the steeper side, with a hike every time the prices of petrol and diesel go up. The present fare rates are such that cabs can be counted in the list of luxury commodities. 									

Anirban Mandal, 
																		Hooghly.																																																														Yes, taxis should charge extra from midnight to six in the morning because they dont get too many passengers at night. 									

Sunil Banerjee, 
																		VIP Road.																																																														There is no logical ground as to why taxis should charge 50 per cent extra from midnight to 6 am. They are supposed to charge a uniform rate round-the-clock. I have seen cabbies behaving in the most bizarre manner when passengers are desperately in need of them. One might consider paying them something extra on humanitarian grounds.									

P. Pramanik, 
																		Santoshpur.																																																														The proposal is not at all unfair, as taxi drivers usually dont get more passengers on their return journey after dropping someone off.									

Manasi Chakraborti, 
																		Behala.																																																														Taxis can charge the extra money from passengers as they ply even at odd hours.									

Bhupen Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park. 																																																														Passengers of long-distance trains are easy prey for taxi drivers and allowing a 50 per cent extra fare at midnight is not at all justified. The drivers may instead take Rs 25 more than the normal fare. If this is not acceptable, then the taxi drivers association and the transport department should fix an amount that will be reasonable for both drivers and passengers.									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Nadia.																																																														It is a very practical idea. Most cabbies will be willing to ferry passengers even at odd hours for the extra money.									

Anik Guha,
																		Chetla.																																																														A handful of cabbies roaming the streets at night are the only means of conveyance, when no bus or autorickshaw is available. If the drivers are not allowed to charge a little extra at that odd hour, we will be robbed of this facility as well.

 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Count the calories, watch the pounds 
 															- Lifestyle shift, metabolic disorder trigger obesity, warn doctors and dieticians A STAFF REPORTER																								If the couch-potato kid is gaining inches and pounds and is breathless after negotiating a solitary flight of stairs, dont just blame it on the hormones. Chances are he is yet another victim of the messed-up lifestyle and dietary imbalance so endemic to GeNext.																								As more and more Calcuttans, not the least youngsters, fall prey to the curse of obesity, with its attendant morbidity and disease load, doctors have sounded the alarm. The first and foremost factor contributing to obesity is the ever-changing lifestyle. The changes in the way we eat and live have not been subtle, but far too abrupt and gross, almost bizarre, it would seem. And now, our young are paying the price, says cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar.																								Dieticians, endocrinologists and cardiac specialists concur that the crux of the problem lies in the intake-output mismatch, or the rate of burning what we consume. Intake of calories should be compensated by adequate physical activity and so, exercising is a must, says Rituparna Banerjee of Ruby General Hospital, who laments that less than 20 per cent of the obese visit professional dieticians for advice. The general propensity is to skip meals and shed weight, which is dangerous, she adds.																								A cut in calorie intake is not the only way to lose weight, agrees dietician Dev Mukherjee. He maintains that metabolic disorder sometimes plays a crucial role in increasing body weight. 																								Not mere intake of excess calories, but a particular metabolic disorder that is food-sensitive is often responsible for the propensity to gain weight, Mukherjee explains. Recommending a regimented diet, he advises it must be a diet that provides adequate nutrition and that one can live with for any length of time.																								S. Kumar, ex-president of the Endocrine Society of India, agrees metabolic defects could be the trigger to obesity at times. For instance, there is a special hormone called leptin, the function of which is to depress the appetite centre in the brain once the individual has had enough to eat and fat has accumulated. But for some reason, its action could be blocked and the person could go on eating even though his bodys needs are satisfied, quot; he says.																								Some feel calories make the real difference. Obesity depends on how much and what kind of calories are consumed. There has to be a proper balance, observes Anu Jhunjhunwala of the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre.																								With new concepts coming up, doctors advise obese individuals to seek professional advice. Commercial agents to reduce obesity must be taken after consulting professionals and drastic reduction of weight is dangerous, a city-based obesity expert warns. Milk products, like skimmed milk, help in reducing body weight, which few know.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 19, 2004 Of role models, young n old
Eye on Calcutta Barry O'BrienIt was an evening tinged with emotion as figures of eminence from the city and the Centre gathered to doff their hats to an elder statesman crowned at the Lok SabhaWe live in an age when men are busy keeping people apart  dividing houses and breaking homes. This is the story of two men who are busy bringing people together  uniting the House and building homes. They are men who stand out in a crowd because they are tall and well-built. They are men who stand out in a crowd of achievers because they are tall in stature and high in success rate, leading people, fulfilling dreams. Born 32 years apart, the older man belongs to my fathers generation and the younger to mine. Both are role models and deeply respected by all generations  at the Centre and in the city. So City Centre was indeed the perfect venue for the younger role model to invite other role models from the city and the Centre, to felicitate the older role model. Both young and old, bureaucrats, businessmen and busy Calcuttans around whom the city centres, came together for a memorable evening. Allow me to walk you through an evening of character and camaraderie. Allow me to introduce you to the younger role model and the older role model, a generation apart, striving so successfully, each in his own way, to help build a nation.  Somnath Chatterjee walks up to accept the felicitation as the others on the dais applaud. Picture by Pabitra Das The older role model, Somnath Chatterjee, dignified and outspoken, was overcome with emotion when it was his turn to speak at a felicitation for him last Sunday at Royal Bengal Room, City Centre. The younger role model, host Harsh Neotia, dutiful and soft-spoken, was overcome with emotion when he introduced the honourable Speaker of the 14th Lok Sabha, as someone who had advised him and inspired him - as a barrister, as the chairman of WBIDC and as a father figure. Both men were at their humorous best. Somnath babu referred to the bandh-gala he wore on his first day as Speaker and how it reminded him that he would now have to keep his gala bandh. Harsh referred to the Speakers great love for football and how he had to now, in his new role as referee, stop all fouls and allow fair play without extra time. We looked on with deep admiration and respect as one role model praised the other for being the unanimous choice for the Speakers chair, cutting across party lines, and the other applauded his host for bringing together like and unlike minded people at this party, just as he does in all his lines of work. As I stood like a proud Lilliputian between two other giants of Bengal, Soumitra Chatterjee and Chuni Goswami, I wanted to clap real loud and even cheer. I didnt. Instead, I applauded ever so gently, as a gentleman should. The two giants, one on either side, looked at me; then at each other. They bent down, placed their glasses on the floor in front of them and clapped and cheered loud and long. I joined in too. So did Jagmohan Dalmiya, Yogi Deveshwar, Sanjiv Goenka and many other giants, who later mentioned to me that they too felt Lilliputian and humbled that evening. As Somnath babu applauded Harsh for the superb 8,000-square foot hall we were in and for City Centre itself, every giant and Lilliputian marvelled at the latest Neotia-gift to Calcutta. A work of Charles Correa, it is a love-at-first-sight site. One that will grow on you, start a romance and end up in a life-long affair. There is so much to do, yet you could be there all day doing nothing; you could buy anything under the sun or go there only to get away from it. You could go there to catch a movie, catch a bite or simply catch up with the latest at an adda on the steps. Salt Lake wont be the same again. It now has one of the citys centre of attractions. If Swabhumi and Ffort Radisson are feathers in Harshs cap, City Centre and Udayan, a brilliant experiment of housing for all incomes, are the colourful plumes that stand out.As he stood on stage besides giants, not of his generation, we, of his generation, saluted him for showing the way. Alongside were giants who give the state and country direction  left, right and centre. There was Union minister Arjun Singh, governor of West Bengal Viren J. Shah, the Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, Hashim Abdul Halim, and, most significantly, Indias eldest statesman, Jyoti Basu. I say most significantly, because Somnath babu regards him as his political mentor. The story goes back to 1950 when Jyoti babu was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act. It was Somnath babus father Nirmal Chandra, also a lawyer, who took up the cudgels for the young Communist. Jyoti babu was released and a relationship began  of mutual respect and trust. Then, in 1963, it was the late Snehangshu Acharya, former advocate-general of West Bengal, who persuaded Nirmal babu to stand for a Lok Sabha by-election from Burdwan. The senior Chatterjee won on debut with the backing of the CPI. Then, in 1967, he was re-elected, this time with the support of the CPM. Finally, on Jyoti Basus advice, the younger Chatterjee agreed to contest as an independent from Burdwan in 1971. He joined the party two years later. The rest is history. Incredibly, between them, father and son, have been in 12 of the 14 Lok Sabhas that have been constituted, Somnath babu himself sitting in 10. Incredibly, the outstanding Parliamentarian, a passionate Mohun Bagan supporter and Rabindra Sangeet connoisseur, remains a down-to-earth person, who tolerates no nonsense yet loves a good laugh. The night we joined the younger role model to felicitate the older role model, there was laughter, good cheer and a great sense of pride in the air. Both have done much; both have much to do. We wish them health and happiness as one keeps the countrys highest House united, and the other invites money and minds to fulfill many dreams.

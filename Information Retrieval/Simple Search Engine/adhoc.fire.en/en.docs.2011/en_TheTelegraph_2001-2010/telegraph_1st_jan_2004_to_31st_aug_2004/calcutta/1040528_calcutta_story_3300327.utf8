 															- Mumbai touch for drama enthusiasts HIMIKA CHAUDHURI				 	 Aryan Ray trains a batch at his summer workshop. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Summer workshops are hot this season. Hot enough for workshop coordinators from way beyond city limits to come in and conduct summer activities with young Calcutta.																								Take Infinity, a Mumbai-based theatre company. The organisation has been camping in Calcutta for half a month, hosting theatre workshops for drama enthusiasts.																								We keep hearing that Calcutta has a very discerning audience for the arts, but its equally important to keep nurturing this habit so that the city continues to have a strong theatre audience, says Aryan Ray, director, Infinity, explaining why Calcutta was the venue of choice.																								Infinity has already roped in 25-odd participants, starting from age 12 and ending at 40-plus, for its 10-day workshop. We even have a 20-year old-daughter and her mother taking part in the same workshop, adds Aryan.																								But is the Mumbai tag making a difference to those who are queuing up outside the Lake Gardens workshop door?																								Not necessarily, feels the young director, adding: Its just about people wanting to learn about theatre, considering that not too many English theatre workshops happen in this city.																								That is probably why quite a few colleges in Calcutta  and Jadavpur University  have shown interest in these English theatre workshops involving their students.																								The curriculum containing the basics of method acting, script-writing, as also methods of appreciating good theatre, is keeping the students hooked for four hours every day.																								The part we love best is, of course, the play-acting bit, when we are given a situation and a character and asked to act it out, says Anasuya Sengupta, a first-timer in a theatre workshop, who is enjoying the experience immensely.																								Three batches a day and 12-hour classes on the trot later, Aryan is a man quite content.																								And why not? The curtains going up for him in culture-conscious Calcutta is no mean task.

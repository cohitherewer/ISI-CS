The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Strike cry over fresh levy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Private bus operators on Tuesday raised the banner of a state-wide strike immediately after the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations if the government refused to okay their charter of demands, including withdrawal of all enhanced taxes.																								Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said the operators were not looking at a hike in fares. But we demand withdrawal of all taxes imposed by the state government recently, he added.																								The syndicate plies around 7,000 vehicles every day in Calcutta and its adjoining districts. We will hold a protest demonstration in front of Metro cinema on March 20 to oppose the governments decision to impose new taxes. The strike could have followed, but we deferred the dates in view of the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations, Saha said.																								The syndicate had earlier submitted a memorandum to the state government, urging it to reconsider the tax imposition. Saha said: There was to have been a meeting this month to discuss the levies. But to date, we have not received any invitation to the talks table. So, we have drawn up an agenda of agitation.

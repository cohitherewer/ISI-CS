 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Suicide reply to fathers rebuke
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mother, I have given you so much pain. Still, I would like to have you as my mother in my next birth as well. But dont let father touch my dead body.																								The suicide note of a final-year student of a college in central Calcutta, who hanged herself on Wednesday night, reflected all her resentment at being scolded by her father for coming home late from tuition.																								Aparna Nath, who had lost her brother to thalassaemia not so long ago, had promised mother Gouri that she would do well in the upcoming B. Com (Honours) examination in April. She made it a point to stay back at a friends place to study after special classes in college.																								Like many fathers, Gopal Nath often ticked her off for coming home late, neighbours at Jorabagans Darpanarayan Tagore Street said . For the past few days, Aparna was repeatedly scolded for staying out late, even if it was for studies. She was a quiet and studious girl. Perhaps, she just could not take those scoldings any more, said Ranajit Roy, a next-door neighbour. 																								No one from the family was available for comment.																								The family, residing at Jorabagan for several years, was quite friendly according to neighbours, until Gopal Nath, who owns a cosmetics-manufacturing unit in the city, lost his younger son to thalassaemia.																								Earlier, Nath was employed as a chemist, but a few years ago , he decided to start his own manufacturing unit, which is said to be doing fairly well.																								The Naths could not get over their sons death, but Aparna would try to keep both parents happy, said another neighbour, who did not wish to be named.																								On Wednesday evening, Aparna left home around 6 pm, promising mother Gouri that she would try to get back early after coaching classes.																								But Aparna returned around 11 pm and was confronted by her worried father. Aparna, according to neighbours, tried to explain why she was late, but her furious father refused to listen. 																								We could hear arguments which continued till late in the night. Gopal Nath could be heard shouting at his daughter, recounted Roy.																								Finally, it was left to Gouri to come to Aparnas rescue and escort her to her room. After a hurried dinner, Aparna bid her mother good night and retired to her room.																								When she did not open the door till 8 am on Thursday, Gouri raised an alarm. The door was broken down and Aparna was found hanging from the ceiling fan. The suicide note was found on the table by her books.

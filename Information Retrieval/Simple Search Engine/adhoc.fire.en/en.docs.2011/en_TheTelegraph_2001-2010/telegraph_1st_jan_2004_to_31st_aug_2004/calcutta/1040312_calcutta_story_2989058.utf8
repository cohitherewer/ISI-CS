The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Fake gun-paper chase takes cops to Barasat 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The four arrests made by Calcutta Police, and the haul of forged gun licences, is only the tip of the iceberg, considering that all the false documents were acquired from Barasat and bore the forged signature of Barasats district magistrate (DM).																								Hot on the trail of the tout, who had approached and sold the false documents and guns to the four guards rounded up on Tuesday, Calcutta cops are headed for Barasat to track down the real offenders.																								This kind of racket cannot flourish without the support of government officials. We suspect that someone from the Barasat DMs office is in league with the tout from whom the documents and guns were procured. A thorough investigation will be conducted, said Asish Sengupta, officer-in-charge of Maidan police station. None of the four guards seemed to be aware that the documents were forged, and that they were carrying guns illegally.																								Sakshi Gopal Halder, the security guard caught first with a forged gun licence, was rounded up on Red Road by constables on the basis of suspicion. He was placed under arrest under the Arms Act and taken to Maidan police station. There, the licence was scrutinised by senior officers. 																								However, if the cops had taken a closer look, they would have realised that a Barasat licence is not valid in Calcutta any way. The papers, even if they were genuine, would be valid only in Barasat.																								The gun licence is issued by the DM, and is valid in that district only. If the owner wishes to go out of the district with the gun, he needs to take the express permission of the police of that district, and a letter from the DM stating such allowance, a gun dealer told Metro.																								Any person seeking to own a gun must first apply for a licence from the district magistrate by filling out a form available from the DMs office. 																								Particulars like permanent address, number of family members, statement of income, whether any other family member owns a gun or not, and the nature of requirement must be specified.																								The DMs office then verifies all the information provided, confirms that the person is a permanent resident of that particular district, and assesses the requirement mentioned. 																								The licence is issued to the person only after all the details are scrutinised. 																								The entire process is time-consuming, to say the least. The system is not foolproof, however, as was proved by the arrests. 																								Like other government-run institution, this system, too, has its share of parasitic employees in a nexus with touts, out to make a fast buck. The four security guards arrested were the victims of such a nexus.																								Speeding up the process with their insider influence, touts can easily get licences for their customers, for a price. The police are aiming at this shady part of the system to bring the real culprits to book.

 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 Cine soiree in birthday bash 
				 	 The brother-sister duo of Prosenjit and Pallavi rehearses with the troupe to perform on Kishore Kumars birthday at Nazrul Mancha. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Its the melody kings birthday and all of Tollywood is set to rock. Leading his team from the front, tinsel towns Hero No. 1 Prosenjit is dishing out a medley of song and dance for all Kishore Kumar fans on August 4.																								Presented by Sahara India Pariwar, the show is a mega tribute to the evergreen singer on his 75th birth anniversary. Actor Soumitra Chatterjee will be felicitated on the occasion.																								The list of those tipped to take Nazrul Mancha by storm on Wednesday evening includes Prosenjit and his wife Arpita Pal, Pallavi Chatterjee, Rupa Ganguly, Ranjit Mullick, Arjun Chakraborty, Koneenica Banerjee, June, Locket Chatterjee and Badshah.																								With only two days to go for the big day, the Monday bandh turned out to be quite handy for the bunch. Most stayed back home or dropped into their friends places to perfect the dance steps or rehearse the soundtracks.																								At Padatik in the evening, Prosenjit teamed up with sister Pallavi to fine-tune a couple of dance numbers. We have chosen Jai jai shiv shankar and Lekar hum deewana dil. My brother will also be singing a few tracks along with his wife. Both have very good voices, chirped Pallabi. The siblings will be matching steps together on stage after around 20 years. 																								Koneenica, too, was busy matching her moves to a medley of Hindi and Bengali tracks. The petite actress will be seen gyrating to Bachke rehna re baba and also the popular Shingh nei tobu naam tar shingho. Among the other movers and shakers is June, ready to groove to Kehdu tumhein.																								If the young brigade is eager to shake a leg on stage, the senior lot is keen to lend its voice to some evergreen melodies.																								Rupa Ganguly will belt out two solos  Dil kya kare and Yeh jo mohabbat hai  and a duet with Ranjit Mullick. Probably Eito hetha kunjochhayay. But I will get to practise it with Ranjitda only tomorrow. So, its subject to change, she said, betraying a trace of excitement.																								Arjun Chakraborty, a tad apprehensive about the crowd, wants to sing a few off-beat tracks composed by S.D. and R.D. Burman.Singer Goutam Ghose, who has conceptualised the programme with support from Artistes Forum, will pep up the show with a string of popular Kishore numbers.Curtain call																								Thats a smile only sweet success can bring. As Sunday rolled on, the curtains came down on the 2nd Bangla Telefilm festival at Nandan. 																								The film fare was fine; viewers went home happy. After 10 days of frenetic cine activity, Sunday night was reserved for the faces behind the show to gather for a quiet dinner at Rotary Sadan. Dhanwantary, the medical store chain, handed out insurance schemes to 50 needy artistes of Tollywood on the occasion. With Koneenica Banerjee by her side, Artistes Forum secretary Rupa Ganguly certainly had some real reason to cheer. 						RESHMI SENGUPTA

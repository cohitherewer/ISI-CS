The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 North Wind blocked, due back in a few days
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The weather office said on Tuesday that winter is yet to bid adieu to the city, at least for some time.																								Officials at the regional meteorological centre at Alipore said the North Wind had been blocked by an upper-air circulation over the Bay of Bengal, that had brought in moisture and warmth into the city and its adjoining areas. This had resulted in both the minimum and maximum temperatures rising over the past few days, they added.																								Today, we find that the upper-air circulation is shifting position and moving gradually north-east. So, we think that the North Wind will blow again and well feel the winter chill for a few more days from Wednesday, an official said.																								Tuesdays minimum temperature recorded at Alipore was 17.5 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. The maximum temperature was pegged at 27.4 degrees, which is normal.																								The winter, it appeared, had been on its way out over the past few days, with both the maximum and minimum temperatures climbing steadily.																								The position of the upper-air circulation had led to a change in the wind pattern. Warm air was blowing in from the sea, effecting a rise in temperature. But as the system is now moving in a north-eastern direction, we can expect the cold to return, said an official.																								A biting spell of cold gripped the city two weeks ago. On January 6, the minimum temperature plummeted to 9.4 degrees. 																								In the middle of last week, the temperature rose, after the formation of the upper-air circulation.

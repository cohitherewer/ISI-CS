The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Just a fad for time pass, but fairly brisk for sale of books
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								There are two kinds of people in the world, those who read books and those who dont. It is far more difficult to classify readers, though. There are those who buy books and read; there are others who acquire books but do not necessarily read them. There are also those who read only the jackets and contents and can yet dwell for hours on them. 																								There are also people who simply read the reviews, obviously because it takes less time and provides more value for money. It helps you comment knowledgeably on books most people do not know exist, conceded an avid reader of reviews.																								The apocryphal tale of Abdul Kassem Ismael, a vizier from Persia, maintains that he never left home without his library of books. The awe-struck reader is informed that his personal librarians would travel with 400 camels laden with books and that the camels would move in alphabetical order. 																								Contemporary bibliophiles, of course, have no need to travel with books and, in any case, it is not just the bibliophile who made a beeline for the 29th version of the Calcutta Book Fair, that concluded earlier this month. 																								It has come a long way since 1975, when 35,000 titles were displayed by less than 100 publishers. It now boasts of displaying over 2.5 million titles by nearly 800 publishers. The Publishers and Booksellers Guild claims that on an average, a hundred thousand people visited the fair every day, which would place visitors at 1.2 million. Assuming that at least 20 per cent of them visited the fair more than once, the number of visitors would be in the region of 9.6 lakh. 																								There is, of course, no way of knowing how many of them were children below 10 or how many were students or teenagers. Graded or variable entry tickets could, however, easily provide such data, which would be useful to plan future fairs and also facilitate research. Yet, there is this nagging feeling that alls not quite right with the fair.																								The World Book Fair, which also started in the Capital this month, boasted six publishers from Pakistan  apt, considering the thaw in Indo-Pak relations and a renewed interest in each other. But at Calcutta Book Fair, the last three focal themes have been Cuba, Chile and the European Union. Nobody has questioned the rationale and no explanation has been offered. It is also doubtful if the fair has promoted awareness and understanding of books in Indian languages. It has been reduced to a fad, complains a librarian of standing, pointing out the steady stream of visitors who walked past books with a glazed look in their eyes, as if they were offering a guard of honour.																								A substantial section, it would appear, visited the fair merely as time pass or because it helped them meet long-lost acquaintances, even relatives. 																								It is good fun, explained a visitor, because stalls increasingly are hosting quiz, music and other events, celebrities, discussions. You can always stand at a safe distance and watch others make an ass of themselves, squirm in embarassment as they fail the test, he explained. Moreover, chances are that you will bump into a batch mate, a neighbour or an old flame you have not met for years. Both the anonymity that the fair provides and the unpredictability that it offers are seductive.																								There are many bibliophiles and readers who have not bothered to visit the fair. If you are a regular buyer of books, publishers are usually more than happy to extend the usual 25 per cent commission they offer to distributors. The 10 per cent discount offered at the fair is not incentive enough to such people. 																								There are others who hate the book fair because it does not offer them the remotest chance to browse. Standing in a queue and jostling for space are not conducive for leisurely browsing. One such gentleman, who has not visited the fair even once after 1980, explained that every time he lingered over a book, he could feel suspicious eyes boring into him. 																								Another erstwhile visitor said he stopped visiting the fair because he did not find any method in the madness. The fair, he felt, needed to be organised better, with more thought given to the needs of book lovers and buyers.																								The media have been quiet on the mayors threat to impose entertainment tax on the book fair. He certainly has a point. Notwithstanding the lofty objectives, the fair does generate a lot of business and entertainment. Even if half the visitors (4.8 lakh) spend, on an average, Rs 200 each on books alone, sales should be in the region of Rs 10 crore. The CMC, it would appear, has a strong case to collect tax, which, hopefully, it can use in maintaining the Maidan better.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 14, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Most slum-dwellers in the city still cook on earthen coke ovens or chullahs that emit a lot of smoke. And with the increase in the population in slums, air pollution is also on the rise. Authorities should educate the slum-dwellers about the hazards of using chullahs and suggest the use of an alternative fuel for cooking.

	I had put in a request for a computerised railway booking office at Budge Budge which appeared in this column recently. My plea seems to have been heeded. Indian Railways has opened a counter at Budge Budge station recently. On behalf of the residents of Budge Budge, I thank Metro for the service it renders us thrice a week.

	Many destitutes spend their last days on city pavements. Can voluntary organisations help them?

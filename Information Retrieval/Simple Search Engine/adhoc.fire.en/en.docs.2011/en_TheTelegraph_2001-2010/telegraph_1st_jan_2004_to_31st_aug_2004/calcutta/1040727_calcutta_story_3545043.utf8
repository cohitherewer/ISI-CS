 A STAFF REPORTER																								A guava, not an apple, keeps the doctor away, and long-term use of antacids and paracetemol are common causes of osteoporosis. 																								While the Asian population is more prone to bone problems because of a wheat-based diet, sunshine is the key to reduce osteoporosis. 																								And any allopathic drug taken without consulting a physician, even calcium, can lead to bone diseases.																								These were a few facts revealed at a seminar on osteoporosis, arthritis and pain management, organised by the Ladies Study Group on Monday. 																								The speakers were orthopaedic and spinal surgeon Shaikh Hassan Iqbal and consultant in pain management and neuropsychiatry Chandra Shekhar Mukherji.																								Although osteoporosis and arthritis are both primarily age-related diseases, there are plenty of preventive measures one can take from childhood to reduce risks of complications. Like regular exercise and a nutritious diet, conducive to a healthy lifestyle. 																								Treatment can begin even before the disease strikes  exposure to sunlight (a good source of vitamin D), walking as opposed to gym exercising and taking two glasses of milk and two guavas a day.																								Menopause is the biggest cause of osteoporosis. Normal loss of bone tissue is about 0.3 per cent. After 40, it increases to three per cent, explained Iqbal. 																								Genetic factors, and even the use of some drugs, can increase risks. 																								Popular osteoporosis points are the spine, hip and wrist. The cartilage degenerates and the bone matrix disintegrates. 																								The effects can be found in loss of height (due to a hunched back), bow legs or vice versa. 																								Cases of osteoporosis are increasing in Calcutta, because people are aware, so there is more diagnosis. The disease has always been around, Iqbal said.																								Arthritis is a wear-and-tear disease, and in this case, too, there is no cure, just treatment. 																								The most common in India is spinal (spondilosis) and knee (osteoarthritis). The blood-related variety, like rheumatoid arthritis, is more crippling. 																								Pain is a vicious circle  to get rid of it, you need to exercise, but because you are in pain, you cant, added Mukherji.																								Talking about pain management, he said that of the three kinds  transient, acute and chronic  acute pain when not treated properly becomes chronic, which is useless. Acute pain serves a purpose  to tell the body that something is wrong. But at his centre for pain relief, Pacific Point, on Ballygunge Circular Road, he observed that most people come to see him when there is no alternative. 																								Pain management has come a long way. We can now help a lot, from chronic neck and head pain to cancer-related ailments, with a combination of methods, like new painkillers, acupuncture, counselling, diet and physiotherapy, Mukherji added.

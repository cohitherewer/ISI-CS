				 April poll shadow on major exams

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The move to hold Lok Sabha elections in April may upset a number of major school and college examinations in the state, including Higher Secondary and Calcutta Universitys BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II, which are scheduled for the same month.
																								Nearly 500,000 students registered to appear in these exams will be inconvenienced if the elections are held in April. As of now, the 2004 Higher Secondary exams are scheduled to begin on April 1 and will continue till the beginning of May. More than 400,000 examinees are expected to appear in these examinations.
																								The B.Sc and B.Com Part II exams are to commence on April 16 and continue through the month. Nearly 100,000 students are to take these exams.
																								The authorities of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education and Calcutta University have approached the state government to persuade the Centre to defer the poll date. But there has been no word from the government yet.
																								We had announced the date (April 1) of commencement of the current years Higher Secondary exam several months ago and students are almost ready. Rescheduling the exams at this stage will be difficult for us and inconvenient for examinees. As of now, the April 1 date still stands. But we may have to change this, if asked to do so by the Election Commission, said Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, council president. There has not yet been any formal notification from the Election Commission.
																								Nearly 200,000 undergraduate examinees of Calcutta University will be equally inconvenienced if the elections are held in April. Controller of examinations Onkar Sadhan Chakraborty feels that the exams will have to be deferred if the elections are held in April. 
																								And this will effect a delay in all exams to be held subsequently. The BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I (honours) and BA, B.Sc and B.Com (general) tests, slated for May and June, will also have to be pushed back if the Part II exams are postponed.
																								Most campuses of schools and colleges are taken over to conduct polls for over a week. So, we will have no choice but to push back exams if there is any overlap, said Adhikari.
																								But the Part II candidates are expected to be the worst sufferers. These exams usually end in April as students need their results by end-July to apply for post-graduate courses in other states, as well as to appear for other competitive examinations. 
																								We will not be able to issue provisional marksheets to the students if we cant complete the exams in April, said controller of examinations Adhikari.

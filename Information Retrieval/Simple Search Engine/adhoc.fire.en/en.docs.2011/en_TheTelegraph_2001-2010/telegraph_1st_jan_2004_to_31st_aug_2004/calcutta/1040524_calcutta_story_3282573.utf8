The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Bob Dylan. Spend more time in the appreciation of music and art, and with family and friends. Curb that strong ego. Health no cause for concern. Your strong memory is a great asset. You make a good spouse. Try and save money, though you may not want to. Youll do well as an interior designer.  Kusum Bhandari

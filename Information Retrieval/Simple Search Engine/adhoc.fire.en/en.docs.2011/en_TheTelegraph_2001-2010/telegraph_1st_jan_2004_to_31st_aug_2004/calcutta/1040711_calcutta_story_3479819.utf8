The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, July 11, 2004 Bye the letter
Make Calcutta Better / Spell checkTaking the Bypass is like bidding the city bye-bye. That, one would assume, is the logic behind the giant billboard greeting all those going from Park Street to Park Circus No. 4 bridge. It screams out E.M. BYE-PASS and shows you exactly how to head out.In a classic case of three many cooks spoiling the alphabet soup, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Calcutta Police have joined hands to script the Bypass boo-boo at the Park Circus multiple-point crossing.And to think that this is the VIP corridor of Calcutta that sees ministers and their mile-long convoys zipping past with eyes wide shut.Just behind it, there was yet another eyesore in store for the finicky few  a promotional board for the Government of West Bengal, a symbol of secular India, that proudly upheld the ideals of Harmony, Peace and Solidaity (sic).When contacted last week, information director Sukhen Das said: We are not aware of any such errors. If it exists, immediate action will be taken. Das was true to his word. Solidaity (!) was overnight reinforced with an r in the right place.Wanted: a little bit of care when it comes to spelling it out.

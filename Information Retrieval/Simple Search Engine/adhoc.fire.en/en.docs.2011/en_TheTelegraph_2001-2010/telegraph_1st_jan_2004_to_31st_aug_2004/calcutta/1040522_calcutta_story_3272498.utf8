The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Lights out, Celsius up, trade down
 															- CESC parrots look-into line while Burrabazar counts its midsummer losses A STAFF REPORTER																								Burrabazar has broken out into a sweat, with severe power cuts  sometimes stretching beyond 10 hours  causing a slump in business. With the mercury crossing the 40 degree Celsius mark and CESC officials allegedly turning a blind eye to the business hub, theres no respite in sight.																								Be it the traders of Sonapatti (gold market) or the plastic toy-sellers in and around Bagri Market  everyone is complaining of financial losses due to the power cuts, which have, predictably, aggravated after the Lok Sabha elections.																								Frequent power cuts in the area started on May 11 and, on an average, we are spending six to eight hours every day without electricity, grumbles Umed Choraria, a businessman dealing in plastics.																								According to Choraria, footfall  and, in turn, volume of business  has dropped drastically at his Canning Street office, while operating costs, due to generators, have gone up. This is more or less true for businessmen around Canning Street, Amartolla Street, Portuguese Church Street, he adds.																								On the other side of Burrabazar, north of MG Road, the scene is as dismal. More than a thousand shops and trading units on Ram Kumar Rakshit Lane, Digambar Jain Temple Road, Nalini Sett Road and Burtolla Street are suffering due to lengthy power cuts.																								The owners of photocopier shops, PCOs and cyber cafes are the worst sufferers, while the traders are spending sleepless nights with the electronic security locks, installed to curb frequent theft and dacoity, having stopped functioning.																								The situation has become unbearable due to the excessive heat and power cuts. We can hardly do business, says Goutam Pal, a wholesaler of sugar. Trade and commerce is dependent on computers, Internet banking and fax, which cannot be operated due to power cuts, adds the member of the Calcutta Sugar Association. 																								According to M.P. Jain, secretary of the association, the failure in communicating with out-station clients has resulted in loss of contracts. He also blames the CESC for the power utilitys inaction. Echoing Jains views, Choraria says: CESC officials are giving various excuses, like cable fault or phase problem and, at times, putting the blame on us. There are numerous traders associations in the area, but nothing has been done as we are not united under one banner.																								CESC officials take the looking into the matter line. I have received the complaints and asked our central district office to look into the causes, explains S.S. Sinha, chief engineer of CESC. I do not think there is a problem of load-shedding, there must be some local problems.																								The nightmare for the small trader, meanwhile, refuses to end. Only some of the big units can afford generators and small units like ours have to wait for hours, missing delivery deadlines in the process, laments Uttam Santra, a goldsmith.

 															- Seven-day fair of leading nurseries to popularise green agenda  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 PLANT PLATFORM: The Horticultural Gardens, that will host the seven-day plant mela. A Telegraph picture																								Fell them outdoors, let them flower indoors. With the go-green policy shifting out of the streets and into drawing rooms or boardrooms, the Agri Horticultural Society of India (AHSI) has decided to give city-dwellers a chance to pick up plants that suit their taste and can fit into their homes or offices. 																								Come September 3, leading nurseries from across the state  and some other parts of the country  will set up stalls on the Alipore greens and sell seeds, saplings, household and ornamental plants, and fruit trees.																								The timing of the seven-day Plant Mela, organised for the first time by the 184-year-old Society, has been finalised keeping in mind the sowing period. This is the season to sow seeds and we are receiving a lot of inquiries on where to buy plants from. Since people dont know where they can get plants, we have decided to bring the nurseries under one roof to help both the buyer and seller, said Deepak Erasmus, secretary-cum-chief executive officer, AHSI. 																								According to Erasmus, over 100 invitations have already been dashed off to nurseries and horticulture companies in and around Calcutta and in some other cities like Bangalore. 																								The list includes the likes of Imperial Nursery, Avoya Nursery, Karmakar Nursery, Protima Nursery, Goodwill Nursery and companies like Leibigs Agro Chemical and Indo American Hybrid Seeds.																								We are targeting a spread of over 1,000 varieties of plants at the fair, which we would like to make an annual affair on our calendar of events, explained Erasmus, adding that no entry fee would be charged at the meet.																								This is an initiative to raise awareness about horticulture and plants. Recent years have seen tremendous advancements in tissue culture and the varieties have exploded. We think people should know about the developments and put a lot of green around them for a better living environment, explained Erasmus. 																								The entire range of gardening accessories and a host of equipment will also be up for sale during the seven-day show.																								To track the international trend, the society is also inviting the consulates in Calcutta and distributing brochures, booklets and journals on plants available in their countries.

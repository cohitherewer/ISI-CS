Pink is the colour of the season internationally and is reinforcing its presence in womens make-up kits.While it remains the primary colour in any makeover, a touch of blue to the eyes for contrast could just be right look for a dressy evening do, says make-up artiste Prabir Kr De. This look is all the rage on ramps right now, but can also be flaunted for a special evening party, when teamed with gorgeous clothes and an attitude to match. The expert tells The Good Life how to perfect the look:The base																								Gone are the days when a makeover meant caking up the face. Today, the base should match the skin tone. The foundation should be the colour of your skin and not lighter. During the monsoons, De recommends stick foundation for an evening party, as it lasts longer. It must be blended in well for a smooth, natural effect, and followed up with a compact or translucent powder. Prabir De dusts the powder from her cheeks after applying the eye shadow																								Shadow zone																								The first step while doing up the eyes is applying shadow, in this case, in two shades. De recommends the use of cake shadows instead of powder ones. Apply blue shadow first on the outer corner of the upper lid in an almond shape. Then apply the pink shadow on the inner corner of the upper lid. Touch up the highlight zone (the area just below the eyebrow) with a little bit of yellow shadow. Blend all the shadows with a blender brush. After this, apply some blue shimmer powder on the blue corner and silver powder on the highlight zone with a brush and blend very lightly.Line up																								Once you are done with the shadows, apply kohl inside the lower lid. Take a blue pencil liner and apply it just below the kohl and the mix the two properly. Apply black cake liner on the upper lid in the shape of the eye. Thicken your lashes with two or three coats of mascara, to be applied very heavily to go with the bright shadows. You can even go for a pair of false eyelashes, pasted with eyelash glue. But if you find that too troublesome, a few coats of thick mascara would bring about the same effect. The final look. 																								Finish off																								Since the eyes look really stark, avoid using a dark colour on your lips. Go for nude pink with a touch of pink gloss. For those with darker skin, a mauvish pink would be best. The blush should also be pink and blended well. De advises a simple hairdo with this look since the eyes should be in focus.SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

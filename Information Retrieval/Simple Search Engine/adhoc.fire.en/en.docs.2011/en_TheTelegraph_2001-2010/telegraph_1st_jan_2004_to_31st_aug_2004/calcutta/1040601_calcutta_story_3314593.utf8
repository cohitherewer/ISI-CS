 																											- Frequent, prolonged power cuts send cancer patients back home A STAFF REPORTER																								For the past two weeks, hundreds of patients queuing up at the radiotherapy department of Medical College and Hospital have gone back without being treated.																								This time, the blame is not on the lack of doctors or medical facilities, but on perennial power cuts. Both the hospital authorities and CESC officials were groping for solutions till Monday.																								The oldest radiotherapy department in Asia treats nearly 275 cancer patients at its recently-modified unit. But frequent power cuts, three to five hours long on an average, have left doctors with no alternative but to turn back patients.																								It is strange that a hospital falling under the essential services category is being treated like this. For the past week, we have lodged many complaints with the CESC, but nothing has happened. Today was the worst, Subir Gangopadhyay, head of department (radiotherapy), complained on Monday.																								On Monday, the high-power cobalt machine could not be switched on at all due to the power cuts.																								A total of 175 patients turn up at the indoor unit of the department, while another 100 queue up at the outdoor department for check-ups and subsequent treatment every day. 																								And these days, despair and darkness await them.																								Sahela Banu, 50, from Behrampore, waited for three hours on Monday for a routine radio-therapy session, but with the power cuts continuing till 5 pm, she had to head back to her relatives home in the city.																								This was an important therapy session for her. But, unfortunately, we could not do anything, said a radiotherapy technician. Banu will be back on Tuesday to try her luck.																								Another patient, 72-year-old Arup Choudhury, from Bongaon, too, had to head back home on Monday.																								The 35-40 medical staff members of the department are struggling to cope with the power cuts. We have lodged several complaints with the CESC, but they had nothing to say, added Gangopadhyay.																								The matter was brought to the notice of the PWDs electrical wing on Monday evening. The onus is on the CESC; we have even lodged several complaints with them. As a result of the fault, work at the radiotherapy department has been seriously affected, said A. Biswas, deputy superintendent of the hospital.																								CESC officials said they had temporarily managed to restore power supply. Our team is now coordinating with the PWDs electrical department. This cannot be load-shedding, as it has not affected any other area, added a CESC spokesperson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Full-house bargains at tourism fair
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Into its 15th year, the fanfare has only increased. 																								The Travel and Tourism Fair (TTF) is back at Netaji Indoor Stadium from August 19 to 22, and its a full house, with over 200 stalls, on-the-spot booking facilities, and, of course, lots of discounts to attract the Puja shopper. 																								On the heels of the Singapore Tourism Board presentation in the city last week to draw in travel agents and customers, the organisers of TTF are hoping for an even better response than last year.																								There are a few additions and subtractions, the most notable being Indonesia and Norway joining the ranks, but Thailand deciding to give Calcutta a miss. 																								But, the number of stalls remains one of the largest here. And there is still a Rs-25 entry ticket, although its Rs 20 in Mumbai and free elsewhere.																								Although the volume of money involved is more in Mumbai and Delhi, the numbers are more in Calcutta, says Sanjiv Agarwal, chairman and managing director, Fairfest Media Limited, organiser of TTF. So, weve got to regulate the crowds.																								While Mumbai and Delhi receive 10,000 to 15,000 visitors, the Calcutta footfall stands at around 20,000 to 25,000. 																								And although China and Sri Lanka will not feature in the city fair, most of the old favourites will, Malaysia being the most aggressive, second only to Rajasthan (which saw Rs 40 lakh in Calcutta sales last year) and fairly new entrant Uttaranchal.																								Although a bad time for the travel and tourism industry  terrorism is still playing havoc, be it Olympics enthusiasts skipping a trip to Athens or the regular sojourn to the US postponed  its good news for customers. The prices are lower and the discounts better. The options are aplenty and affordable.																								The industry is trying to keep its head above water,  explains Agarwal. But an interesting side-effect is that it is encouraging intra-regional travel, be it domestic or in South Asia. So, there is some aggressive marketing.																								Another plus, adds Agarwal, is that inbound travel to Calcutta, from other parts of the country, is slowly increasing. 																								Reason: The city is spruced up, there are more five-star hotels and the Pujas are being sold in a big way.																								But, he cautions, the state tourism department doesnt have the vision or the marketing savvy required to sell the city as a hub and a gateway to the region, nor to accept tourism as a viable economic activity.

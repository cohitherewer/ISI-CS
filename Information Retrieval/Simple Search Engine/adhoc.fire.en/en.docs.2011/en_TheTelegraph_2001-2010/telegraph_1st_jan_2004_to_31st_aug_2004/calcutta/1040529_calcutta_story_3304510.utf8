 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 UK B-school in Bengal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Pursue premier British business education from the comfort of your own city, and at one-seventh the tuition cost you would pay in Britain.																								Oxford Brookes University (OBU) has now come to West Bengal to offer its BBA degree with the promise of delivering the same quality of education that students get at the OBU campus in Britain. 																								OBU is collaborating with the Institute for International Management Technology (IIMT), Bengal, and will hold classes on the institutes Raichak campus from July-end. 																								With approvals from the state government and the British Council, the university is now waiting AICTE registration.																								After a positive response in Gurgaon, where OBU set up its first Indian campus, the varsity turned to Bengal after being approached by Bengal Ambuja, the group behind IIMT. We, however, do not have any say in the course curriculum and are only the infrastructure providers, said Bengal Ambuja managing director Harsh Neotia on Friday. 																								The facilities, including classrooms, accommodation and resources are, apparently, being duplicated from the OBU campus in UK.																								A team of experts from OBU has already visited the Calcutta campus thrice and approved of the standards, said Grant Clendining from OBU Business School. 																								To ensure that evaluation of Indian students is on a par with their counterparts in Britain, the same set of external examiners who evaluate British students will be flown down to Calcutta during the annual examinations. 																								Of the 40 students who have graduated this year from Gurgaon, 26 have found international placements, said Vinee Johri, head of the business school in Gurgaon. 																								The Calcutta campus has just 35 seats, and students will be admitted through a process of written examination, group discussion and interviews. The course fee is Rs 75,000 per year.

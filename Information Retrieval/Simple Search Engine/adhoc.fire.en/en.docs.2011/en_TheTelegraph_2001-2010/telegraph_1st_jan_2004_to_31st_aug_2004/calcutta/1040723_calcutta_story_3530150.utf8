The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 CU deflects slap doctor rap onus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government may be trying to pass the buck by not punishing Supratik Basu, the intern who slapped a woman to induce her into labour, but Calcutta University (CU) isnt taking the lead.																								On Tuesday, the state government said it could do little to punish the post-graduate trainee doctor for his actions, as he is a university student. 																								On Thursday, however, CU made it clear that the government had every right to discipline Basu, who, on July 5, slapped Sandhya Mondal to speed up labour, leading to partial deafness in her right ear.																								A post-graduate trainee is a registered doctor and if he commits an offence while discharging his clinical duties, he can be taken to task by the medical college authorities, stressed Manoj Bhattacharya, head of CUs medical faculty. They will have to send us a report, but no law bars them from taking disciplinary action, he added.																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra has said that Basu, a student of gynaecology at Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital, could not be punished because the government had earlier been forced to withdraw action taken against three doctors of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.																								However, according to Bhattacharya, the three doctors in question were interns and had only temporary registration numbers, while Basu was a registered doctor with the Medical Council of India and, therefore, could be punished.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maiti has asked the NRS authorities to bring the Mondals to Swasthya Bhavan for a hearing. I will listen to their grievances before taking a decision. Then, if necessary, we will take action, he said. 																								CU is yet to receive the governments case report.																								Sandhya Mondal was admitted to NRS on July 3. Two days later, around 1 am, nurses rushed into the labour room, hearing her cries, and found the pregnant woman holding her right ear, writhing in pain. Her lip was injured as well.																								I cant forget how my daughter was slapped by the doctor. She still cant hear properly and is receiving treatment, said her mother, Kali Mondol.																								Sandhya gave birth to a low birth-weight (1.6 kg) baby boy, who was in an incubator till Wednesday. The baby is doing well and was removed from the incubator. His mother was also able to feed him, said a senior hospital official on Thursday.

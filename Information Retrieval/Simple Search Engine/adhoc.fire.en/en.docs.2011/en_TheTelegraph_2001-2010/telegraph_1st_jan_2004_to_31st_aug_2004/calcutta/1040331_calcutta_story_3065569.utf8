 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 A little soul searching
																								Ever since man recognised the significance of his microcosmic position in relation with the macrocosm, he has been entangled in a longdrawn battle to ensure his survival as the highest and, therefore, the fittest of all living beings. In the process he has thwarted the growth of his own fellow beings. Man has created a society and with it he has set the norms which are deemed acceptable to be part of this social family. In order to find cognisance in this world it is necessary that one conforms to the rules decided upon by the larger family. An inability or unwillingness to adhere by the conventions can ominously lead to social ostracism. Khunje Nao is the story of such a misfit, Satyabati, in a vindictive society. It is this ruthless society that labels Satyabati as mentally unfit and punishes her by snatching her freedom and confining her within the four walls of an asylum. The play is a poignant reflection on the lives of the Satyabatis of society who are forced to live borrowed lives and die miserable deaths. Khunje Nao makes a subtle attempt to awaken social beings from their stupor and redefine the very essence of acceptance and nonacceptance.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Khunje Nao, by Rangroop																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Joy for one, home for other
 OUR BUREAU Sundari lies in her Medical College and Hospital bed in December 2003For Tandra Guha, the world had come to an end after she lost her husband and only son within a span of three years. 																								On Monday, she found a reason to live again  a four-month-old abandoned girl who, in turn, found home and hope.																								Lying on an iron cot in the paediatric ward of Medical College and Hospital, little Sundari was oblivious to the happy twist being scripted to her lifes tale that had started on a tragic note.																								Sundari had been found abandoned beside a garbage vat in the Bowbazar area early on November 20, 2003.																								After months of uncertainty and a legal battle, Sundari found a mother and Guha a daughter. The principal judge of the family court, Arup Kumar Das, granted Guhas prayer to adopt the abandoned girl.																								In his order, the judge allowed the babys interim custody to Tandra and fixed the matter for hearing on May 5.																								According to Supradip Ray, Guhas counsel, a voluntary organisation has been asked to conduct an inquiry into how the baby was adapting to her surroundings at the petitioners residence during this period.																								I cannot express my happiness. I always wanted to adopt a girl child. But I am very tense as well, and I cannot sleep till I take her home, said Guha, at her Ashwini Nagar home in Baguiati.																								Her husband, Tapas Kumar Guha, died of a cerebral attack on March 14, 2000. Her 16-year-old son died on May 5, 2003.																								Please pray for our happiness, pleaded Guha, waiting to bring her daughter home.																								Sundari had been brought to Medical College and Hospital by a sub-inspector of Bowbazar police station. The baby girl was suffering from cold and other related complications, as doctors confirmed that she had been abandoned an hour after birth, said Pranab Mukherjee, social welfare officer with the hospital.																								The hospital staff affectionately called her Sundari. 																								Initially, Kajal Saha, an employee with the hospitals ENT department, submitted an application for her custody before the family court. The court later rejected Kajals appeal on financial grounds.																								On November 21, 2003, Guha came to know of Sundaris plight and visited her in hospital. I went back again two days later and showed all the documents in support of the adoption to the hospital authorities, recalled Guha. After Kajals appeal was rejected, the hospital authorities petitioned Guha.

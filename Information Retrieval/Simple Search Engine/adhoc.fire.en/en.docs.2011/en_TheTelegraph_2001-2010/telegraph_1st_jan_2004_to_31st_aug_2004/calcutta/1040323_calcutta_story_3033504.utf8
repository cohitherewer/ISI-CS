The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 Life - In Focus				 First stop for movie magic 
				 	 Aishwarya Rai in Chokher Bali, just one of the films edited at SolarisA yellow building past its prime, off AJC Bose Road, seems like an unlikely destination for dream merchants and celluloid magic. But this is where most of the action is  from dubbing of dialogue to chopping and trimming raw film into a cogent, coherent narrative.																								Solaris studio, a sister concern of Black Magic production company, has emerged as the first choice for makers of both parallel and mainstream movies. Heres breezing through the crowded edit rooms.																								Its the best																								Because it is technologically sound and brings a professional workforce to the table. With three edit suites (two for films and one for video) and a well-equipped sound room, Solaris (a touch of Tarkovsky, there!) stands out as the sole studio in town offering digital set-ups for both video and film. Handling non-linear machines and other hi-tech equipment are four film editors and two sound editors. Some Black Magic productions are also done here, but the prime focus is on outside clientele.																								The studio list																								Boasts the best and biggest of Tollywood. Almost all films worth their while stop over at Solaris before going on to bag awards and accolades in India and abroad. Rituparno Ghosh (Chokher Bali), Aparna Sen (Mr amp; Mrs Iyer), Buddhadeb Dasgupta (Mondo Meyer Upakhyan), Urmi Chakraborty (Hemanter Pakhi) name them and theyve been here.																								Toss in the two Black Magic home productions Patalghar and Teen Ekke Teen, add some masala with Paribar, Champion and Aakrosh and top it off with the steady stream of commercials to know what it means when we say Solaris is never sitting idle.																								Busy with																								Aditya Bhattacharyas Dubai Return, Subrata Sens Hothat Neerar Jonye and Anjan Dutts Bow Barracks Forever.																								Tomorrows fare...																								Ranges from Anjan Das Ebong Srikanta to Tollywoods first six-in-one cinematic experiment Chhoy, Gulbahar Singhs yet-untitled film to Anup Senguptas Protishodh.																								Voice from within																								I would like to believe Solaris is the best studio in town, says FTII Pune graduate and Solaris managing director Arjun Gourisaria. We try to provide a conducive and comfortable atmosphere to film-makers. Things are done in a more professional way and we have good sound and film editors. The problem in Calcutta is that film-makers are reluctant to adapt to new technology, but more such studios will soon come up.																								Loyalist line																								I have always chosen to work in the Black Magic studio as it is technically up to the mark and its almost like working out of home, says Rituparno Ghosh, whose recent films have all been stitched together at Solaris.

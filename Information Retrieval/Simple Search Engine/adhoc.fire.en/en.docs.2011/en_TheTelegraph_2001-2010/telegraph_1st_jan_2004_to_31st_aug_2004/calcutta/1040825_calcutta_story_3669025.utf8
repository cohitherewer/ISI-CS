																								Music is the child of Nature; its notes express a depth of feelings and emotions that spoken words fail to articulate. Lyrics are born of our impassioned thoughts; they convey the profound intensity of our feelings when sung to the tunes of a song. This evening of Tagore songs provides an excellent illustration of how these two facets of a composition complement each other magnificently to produce a whole that gives pure pleasure to our aesthetic senses. Featuring a trio of young exponents, Rahul Mukherjee, and siblings Manisha Murali Nair and Manoj Murali Nair, the event offers connoisseurs of Rabindrasangeet yet another opportunity to listen to some of Tagores most popular numbers that allow for fresh interpretation each time they are heard. The evening will also witness the cassette and CD release of a compilation of 10 Tagore songs sung by Rahul Mukherjee, titled Tabo Jiboner Aalotey.

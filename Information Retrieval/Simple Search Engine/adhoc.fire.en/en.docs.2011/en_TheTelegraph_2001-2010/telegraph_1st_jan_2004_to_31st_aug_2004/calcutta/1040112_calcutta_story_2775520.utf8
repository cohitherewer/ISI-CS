 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Law blind ally at crime station
 PRONAB MONDAL AND SANJAY MANDAL																								Take I: Touhit Sheikh is caught with 80 packets of heroin just as he is emerging from an open-air drug den in the western corner of the parking lot adjoining Sealdah station.																								Take II: Anil Mukhopadhyay, a resident of Belghoria, loses his monthly pay at Sealdah station just as he is about to board a local train back home. Chances are, the cash is spent at the same drug mart.																								Sealdah railway station, cleaned up less than two years ago, is now in the grip of a vice syndicate. Drugs, gambling and prostitution, name it and you will find it under the Sealdah flyover and the noses of the railway police authorities.																								Joining the long list of illegal money-making endeavours at the bustling station is the auctioning of car parking bays  allegedly with the patronage of local policemen.																								Around 6 pm on Sunday, about 50 persons were seen huddled in a corner of the parking lot, busy doing drugs. A bottles throw away, on the western side of the parking lot, one group was gulping down country liquor, while another was rapt in a gambling session.																								The one game the authorities seem to be playing is passing the buck. The railways are quick to lay the blame at the door of the local police, as all those activities are taking place beyond the station gates.																								We have informed the government railway police (GRP) of the problem and requested them to take action This is a huge station with so many commuters using it, says Radheyshyam, divisional railway manager, Sealdah. A total of 688 trains and nearly 12 lakh commuters use the station every day.																								The circle of vice is not limited to the station alone. It spills out on to neighbouring Muchipara, Entally, Narkeldanga, Maniktala and Phoolbagan.																								Last week, police sent in a request to the chief ministers office that special attention be paid to the situation at Sealdah and its adjoining areas. We had no option left, as all our efforts to draw the GRPs attention to the problem have proved futile. We even sat with them in a meeting, but there has been no follow-up from their end, said a senior police official at Lalbazar.																								Ninety per cent of crimes take place in and around Sealdah station because of the drug racket. Snatching and pickpocketing have become a real menace, but no action is being taken to clean up the station surroundings, added an officer in Narkeldanga police station.																								Police have identified 26-year-old Bhola Samui, alias Kele Bhola, as the crime kingpin, along with other ringleaders like Nimai, Shamshul and Prakash.																								We conduct joint operations with Calcutta Police against these criminals. A major drive is being planned soon to clear the station area, said superintendent of railway police Gangeshwar Prasad Singh.

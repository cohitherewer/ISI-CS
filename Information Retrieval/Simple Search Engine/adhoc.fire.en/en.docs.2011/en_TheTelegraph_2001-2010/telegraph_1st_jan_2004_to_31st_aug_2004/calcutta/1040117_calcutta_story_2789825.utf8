 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Tagore tunes on local trains
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Let the sound of music soothe you on a local train from Howrah. Eastern Railway is set to instal music systems on all local trains to Burdwan, Katwa, Bandel, Tarakeswar and Pandua.																								The system has made its debut successfully on one train and we plan to extend the service, said Swapan Kumar Chaudhuri, divisional railway manager, Howrah. The railway has recorded a few Tagore songs on an audio cassette, which will be played on the trains.																								Chaudhuri said Rs 1 lakh will be required to extend the service. The cassette, played from the guards cabin, will be switched on as soon as the train leaves Howrah and till it reaches its destination. The railway is interspersing the recorded songs with announcements on the risks of journeying without a valid ticket and smoking in the compartment, apart from the need to buy a ticket to enter the platforms.																								Chaudhuri spoke of plans to run the service commercially. We are looking for sponsors because we do not have a budgetary allocation for maintaining the service on local trains, he said. The recorded music service made its debut on the Howrah-Ranchi Shatabdi Express on Wednesday.

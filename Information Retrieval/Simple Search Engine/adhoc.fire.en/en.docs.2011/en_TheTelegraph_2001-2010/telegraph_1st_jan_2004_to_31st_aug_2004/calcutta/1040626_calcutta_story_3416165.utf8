The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Caution is the key in CD trade
 A STAFF REPORTER																								As anybody who has walked its pavements is aware, Chandni Chowk is one spot in the city that has escaped the eagle eye of the police and continues to supply pirated compact discs (CDs)  both audio and video  to the rest of the city and beyond.																								Two months after Metro ripped the veil off Chandni Approach and Chandni Chowk Street, the young vendors of pirated CDs have become more cautious and innovative, but carry on with their trade in spurious CDs. 																								Both roads remain havens for the vendors, who pace up and down the stretch, looking out for prospective customers. The line CD chahiye kya, CD?, muttered under the breath, has not changed, but the modus operandi has. 																								We have to keep shifting because there is the ever-present risk of a police raid, said Sajid, a vendor, his eyes sweeping the crowded road. They know that bulk stocks of CDs are kept in Chandni Chowk, but are unable to pinpoint the exact location, he added with a smile. 																								Unreleased and new films, as well as soundtracks, both Hindi and Bengali, are easily available, as are soft and hardcore pornography. The more common CDs are handed to customers on Chandni Chowk Street itself. If the customer has a more specific demand, like an unreleased film, he is taken to the bigger fish  the supplier  after a walk through the narrow serpentine lanes of Chandni Chowk market. 																								Most of the time, a copy of the master print is brought into the city from outside, and we make copies from it, a supplier said. Sometimes, the supply is delayed and sometimes seized by the police. Since the demand is great, we have to get copies of current films by hook or by crook. We sneak digital video cameras into cinemas and record the movie, then make copies right here in Chandni Chowk, he signed off.

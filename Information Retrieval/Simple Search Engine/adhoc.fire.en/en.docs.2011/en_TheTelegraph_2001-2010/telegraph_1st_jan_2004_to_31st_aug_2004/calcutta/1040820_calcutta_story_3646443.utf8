																								Photographs are the truest expressions of the world as seen with the human eye. But the beauty of a photograph is enhanced by the sensitivity of the eye behind the lens that captures the image and filters it. Wera Saether is one such photographer who, being abundantly alive, has an acute sense of observation that has stood her in good stead as she traveled the world while freezing images with her camera. The ongoing show is a door through which Calcuttans will be allowed a glimpse into a Calcutta as seen through the eyes of a foreigner. Saethers Calcutta is familiar, yet strange, by virtue of the lens having captured the city in nuances that a city-dweller seldom notices.The exhibition is a rare opportunity for Calcuttans to take cognizance of their city with its subtleties that often go unnoticed. 																								Event: An exhibition of photographs on Calcutta by Wera Saether																								When: Till August 24; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

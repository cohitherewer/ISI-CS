The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Cashing in on sequel success
 A still from Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid and (top) a still from Spider-Man 2 																								Come Friday and you can choose from not one, not two but four Hollywood sequels. Little wonder that trade pundits are calling 2004 the year of sequels for Hollywood in India.																								Spider-Man 2 was already spinning its web around Calcutta when, last Friday, two celluloid extremes, the oh-my-god Kill Bill 2 and the oh-so-sweet Shrek 2 hopped on to the two-means-company bandwagon.																								And on August 27, youll have Anaconda 2 titled Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid releasing at the multiplexes and adding to the sequel sequence.																								Whats striking, though, is the success rate of these sequels and the kind of marketing machinery that swings into action prior to its release in India. Spider-Man 2, for example, has been the biggest film of the year and the second biggest ever for Hollywood in India.																								In its first three weeks, the Sam Raimi film collected a cool Rs 28.5 crore in India, more than what Spider-Man did in its entire run in the country. The film, which released with a record 306 prints on July 23, is projected to rake in Rs 35 crore while it keeps swinging in the theatres.																								If Spider-Man 2 was a well-made sequel, the marketing that went into its roll out was also a big plus in pushing up ticket sales. The television action kicked off with the screening of the original on HBO with Spidey-branded Sony Ericsson cell phones given away as contest prizes. Then Sony Entertainment Television stepped into the picture by having the character of Nandu in the ever-popular serial Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin drawn to the Spider-Man web. Then the Spider-Man bug bit the SET Max and AXN channel logos. Mirinda, Kellogs, Sony World joined the marketing blitz in their own way. And a special Hindi track sung by Strings was incorporated in the Hindi version.CLOSER HOME Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee, who featured in the Apu trilogy, the Feluda series and both the Aranye journeys, says: While making a sequel, one has to visualise what the characters would do after the time gap. The continuity needs to be maintained.Apart from Spider-Man 2, the two other sequels to feature in the top foreign films in India include The Lost World: Jurassic Park 2 and Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines. Another film tipped to join this exclusive list is Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid and if the marketing tactics are anything to go by, heres another winner sequel in the making  that too without Jennifer Lopez.																								To be released with as many as 250 prints in the country, Anaconda 2 has a partner in the form of Canada Dry. The film is being promoted through puzzles that resemble the snakes eyes. Getting the solution right would not only win you film tickets but also give-aways from Canada Dry. Huge cutouts of a 10-ft coiled snake will be present at most key theatres across the country, including the multiplexes here in Calcutta.																								There would be ground promos too in the form of put your hand in the Anacondas mouth and win lucky prizes. This comes just within a week of the Shrek 2 marketing fare where children could participate in similar contests and win exciting prizes and memorabilia from the animated movie.																								Marketing managers of big film studios believe that it is easier and more profitable to market sequels. Says Vikramjit Roy, head of publicity and acquisitions, Columbia TriStar Films of India Ltd, A sequel gives birth to a franchise, which in turn is built on the huge success of the original film. Franchises have huge potential from a host of revenue streams like merchandising, promotions, spin-offs into publishing and games. One can play around with the familiar bunch of characters, the story line that cuts across demographics and the general hype surrounding the movie itself.																								So get ready for more sequels coming your way in the months ahead. Theres Bourne Supremacy, the second part of the Matt Damon-starrer Bourne Identity. There is also Resident Evil: Apocalypse Now  releasing in end November and Princess Diaries 2, slated for a December release.																								With the Tamil and Telugu versions also being lapped up, you might be in for a Bengali version too in the near future. So, if Tarantino decides to give his Bride some new lines on screen, would we have something like Bill Ke Marbo, Abar?						PRATIM D. GUPTA

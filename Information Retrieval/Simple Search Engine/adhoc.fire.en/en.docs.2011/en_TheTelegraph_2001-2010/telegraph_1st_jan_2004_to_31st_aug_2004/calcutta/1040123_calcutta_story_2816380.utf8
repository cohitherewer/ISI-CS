The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 How the telly can colour their vision
 															- Staying glued to the TV can incite violence, lack of values in kids, warn doctors A STAFF REPORTER																								Five-year old Soumen had developed a strange habit. He would insist on watching his favourite cartoons, and if his parents refused to oblige, he would refuse to eat. Father Alok Basu decided not to switch on the TV one evening; Soumen went to bed in tears and without dinner. When Soumen was taken to see south Calcutta psychiatrist R. Ghosh Rai, the doctor recommended a fixed time for the child to watch television. Gradually, Soumen got used to this viewing regimen and his tantrums tapered off.																								Eight-year-old Malabi was hooked on to advertisements on TV. When the commercials stopped, she stopped munching. Mother Rama Ghosh took Malabi for counselling, and was told that her daughter was suffering from behavioural disorder.																								Television has changed the way children behave and think. Seven out of every 10 children in the three-15 years age group with behavioural problems suffer because of excessive TV time, say child psychiatrists and psychologists in town. The effects of being glued to the small screen for long, they warn, can be seen in: Violent streak or aggressive  behaviour: Cartoons and wrestling can make children and  adolescents violent and volatile. Demanding child: Advertisements  and serials depicting the good life can cause a craving  for expensive products and trigger conspicuous consumption. Moral degradation and  a lack of values: Some movie, music and fashion channels  can influence adolescents to adopt ways alien to his or  her immediate social environment.																								On spotting these symptoms, doctors recommend: Fixed timings for TV watching,  supervised by parents. Parents picking and choosing  programmes for their children. Parents cutting down on  their own television time. Counselling for children  suffering from behavioural problems due to excessive time  spent in front of the TV.																								The cartoon, clearly, is no longer harmless fun. The animated violence of Batman, The Powerpuff Girls, GI Joe and Samurai Jack can have a huge impact on young minds. Sunil Srivastav, studying in a KG school in south Calcutta, had been handed a transfer certificate because he would beat up his classmates all the time. Physician Probir Pal told his parents he was suffering from an overdose of violent cartoons. Sunil would pretend to be Batman, beating up the bad men, said the doctor.																								Ravi Kumar, a resident of Triangular Park, was spending sleepless nights worrying about what his teenaged son was watching alone on TV. He tried using the child-lock facility to ensure that the Class VIII student did not watch the fashion channels. But his son managed to crack the code and catch the ramp shows. Ravi then turned to child psychologist Srikumar Mukherjee, who put it down to the boy being denied legitimate TV time by his parents, who would hog it all evening.

																																																		Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has decided to develop and beautify the ghats of Nimtala and Baghbazar, on the Hooghly riverfront. Union minister for ports and shipping Shatrughan Sinha said the two ghats should become major tourist attractions. This is the first time CPT is going ahead with beautification projects for the Calcutta ghats, many of which have great heritage value but are now in a state of disrepair. According to D.T. Joseph, secretary in the ministry of shipping, an investment of Rs 50 lakh would be needed for the development of Nimtala and Bagbazar ghats. CPT has control over 15 ghats from a total of 41. 																																																		In yet another show of honesty, a taxi driver has returned a bag a Bangladeshi tourist had left behind in his vehicle. Jasmin Akhtar had hailed the taxi from Sealdah and travelled to Shyampukur. Soon after she got off, Shibananda Yadav, the taxi-driver, noticed a bag on the rear seat. The photograph in the passport found in the bag confirmed that it was Akhtars. Yadav drove straight to Shyampukur police station and deposited the bag there. Police found a contact number in the bag and later handed it over to the tourist.

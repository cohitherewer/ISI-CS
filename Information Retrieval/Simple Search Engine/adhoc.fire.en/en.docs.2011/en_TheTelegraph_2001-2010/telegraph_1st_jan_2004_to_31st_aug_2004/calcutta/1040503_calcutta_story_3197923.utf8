The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Teachers too few for private health school
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 																								After paving the way for the first private medical college and hospital at Jadavpur, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is in a sweat. It fears the college may not take off in time, for want of quality teachers.																								Inspectors from the Medical Council of India (MCI) are to visit Calcutta early next year to vet the teaching hospital that a US-based doctor has been permitted by the government to set up on 47 acres on the campus of KS Roy TB Hospital, Asias oldest. A number of hurdles have already sprung up in the path to its timely commissioning.																								Two factors are bothering us, C.R. Maity, director of medical education, told Metro on Sunday. There is a definite lack of medical teachers in several disciplines. Besides, the building will have to come up fast. Setting up a medical college is one thing, but getting it on stream is a different matter. 																								The governments concern is rooted in the fact that its plans, drawn up last year, of starting an under-graduate medical course at the state-run SSKM Hospital have not been approved yet by the MCI, which found facilities, staff strength, equipment and infrastructure inadequate.																								The government has 2,009 registered medical teachers, 491 short of its estimated total required to impart medical education. The statistics are no better in the private sector, where almost all the centres are short of teachers, says Samir Dasgupta, joint secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors.																								The government is facing a shortage of medical teachers mainly in the disciplines of pre-clinical anatomy, physiology, bio-chemistry, pharmacology and also in orthopaedics, paediatric medicine, anaesthesiology and forensic science. Other disciplines at the post-doctoral level, like cardio-thoracic and radiology, have the same problem, health department officials added.																								Forget getting medical teachers from Bengal, the scenario is as bad all over the country. Getting retired people to come out and teach students new ideas may be the only option left, said Anshuman Mitra, Calcutta district committee secretary of the Medical Service Centre (MSC).																								Moloy Patra, secretary of the Bengal branch of the Indian Medical Association, said the government had been asked to consider immediate recruitment. The government has not given any thought to providing incentives to doctors joining medical education service. So, you hardly find any good doctors joining the service, he reasoned.																								The project had hit a roadblock in 2003, after bodies like the MSC objected to the governments initial plans of closing down the 746-bed referral hospital. Not many people are aware that this was the first hospital set up by an Indian in 1928. It was also the first TB hospital in all of Asia, with which personalities like Nil Ratan Sircar and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das were associated, said Mitra.																								So, the government decided to retain 350 beds exclusively for TB patients and hand over the rest of the building, as well as the land, to the private group to set up the college.																								The group could not be contacted.

 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Pillow to smuggle bombs
 																											- Airport security warned of new ploy adopted by terrorists A STAFF REPORTER																								Carrying a pillow into the aircraft may no longer be an innocent thing to do, if the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security is to be believed. 																								In a recent letter, the bureau has claimed that terrorists are switching over from the traditional RDX to the equally-deadly nitro-cellulose, and are smuggling the new variant in pillows to fox security officers manning the airports.																								The additional commissioner of security (civil aviation) has issued the letter to, anmong others, the commissioner of Calcutta Police, since an increasing number of terrorists are said to be using the city as their transit stopover. 																								Copies of the directive have been sent to the director of Calcutta airport and the chiefs of all major airlines.																								The letter says: It has been brought to the notice of this bureau that terrorist outfits are being trained to smuggle chemicals like nitro-cellulose in pillows to turn them into bombs. The security personnel, engaged in performing pre-embarkation checks, must be briefed properly to pre-empt any possibility of such bombs being carried on board.																								Security experts say nitro-cellulose (a complex compound of nitrogen) is in the form of a gel, like the ones used in gun and rocket propellants. Since it doesnt weigh much, the compound can easily be carried inside pillows. What makes it difficult to detect is its low vapour pressure. 																								Security officers at Calcutta airport confirmed that explosive materials are detected by their vapour pressure. An explosive material with high vapour pressure produces a hazy, unclear image on the X-ray plate, prompting sleuths to go in for physical verification. Objects that dont have explosive properties produce images with sharp contours. 																								Nitro-cellulose is an exception. Despite being an explosive, its X-ray image is clear and sharp, said a senior security officer at the airport.

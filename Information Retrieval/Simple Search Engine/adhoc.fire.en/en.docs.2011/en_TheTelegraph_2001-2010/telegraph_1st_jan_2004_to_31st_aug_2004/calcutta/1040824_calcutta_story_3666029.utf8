 A STAFF REPORTER																								To catch a thief, be coached by one. Turning a Lalbazar chamber into a crime-bust classroom, sleuths recently tuned into the video clip of a two-wheeler thief showing off his skills. He cracked a motorcycles in-built locking system in 15 seconds, gasped an officer after the presentation.																								This tutorial in two-wheeler theft comes in the wake of a rap from Writers Buildings over a rash of motorcycles going missing.																								All divisional deputy commissioners and sleuths of the detective department have been directed by police commissioner Sujoy Chakaborty to step on it and arrest the trend.																								Chakraborty, during a crime conference, even distributed a pamphlet that displays in graphic detail how the in-built locking system of a motorcycle can be broken in 30 seconds.																								A sleuth from the motor theft section later said: It just takes two to steal a two-wheeler. One sits on the vehicle with the side-stand down. The other grabs the handlebar and yanks it in the direction opposite to which the front wheel rests. This jerk breaks the lock. Then, two particular wires are pulled out from under the speedometer and cut. The two ends are finally brought together to start it up.																								On the basis of this, a list of things to do was included in the police pamphlet:The moment you see someone sitting on a motorcycle and another holding its front wheel (often pretending to be a mechanic), move in Ask motorcyclists to park their vehicles in a parking lot, not a deserted spot Keep a strict vigil on soft targets like hospitals and nursing home premises Urge motorcyclists to instal an additional lock.																								In the past six months, police have recovered nearly 200 motorcycles stolen from the city. Most of the culprits have a link with Bangladeshi criminals. They smuggle two-wheelers into Bangladesh through different frontier points in North 24-Parganas, Nadia and Murshidabad districts. Several raids have been carried out in the border areas of Bongaon and Basirhat, said a sleuth.

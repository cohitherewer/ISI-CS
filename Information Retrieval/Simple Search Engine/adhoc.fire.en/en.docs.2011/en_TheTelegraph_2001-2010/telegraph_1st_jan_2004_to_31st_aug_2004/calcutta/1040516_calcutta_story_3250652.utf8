The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 16, 2004 Turf tussle with five-man army
Club SandwichYes, its time again for the corporate crowd across Calcutta to switch to soccer mode. Its time to sharpen the spikes and flaunt those trapping and shooting skills. The Merchants Cup five-a-side soccer meet at the CC amp;FC is here.What kicked off with just 20 teams way back in 1975, now boasts a field of 64, and the club has to actually refuse entries to keep the three-week format manageable.The genesis of the five-a-side cups, including soccer, can be traced back to the success with cycle polo the club had in 1973. Soccer has proved to be the most enduring brand among the mercantile meets, and was a runaway hit from the day it kicked off in 1974 with an 11-a-side showdown.As companies struggled to stitch together a squad of 11, the five-a-side format was born the next year, essentially the brainchild of Rai Copland of Ludlow Jute, a football fanatic. Ludlow Jute beat Carritt Moran to the inaugural cup.The first Merchants Cup committee had Tublu Dutt, Ronobir Sen, Ashoke Dutt, Joysheel Mitter, Arunava Chaki Chakravorty, Subrata Roy, Ravi Thapa and Vece Paes, all synonymous with the club and the tourney. Sports committees since have shared the passion for a meet that has grown in stature and style.It was born out of a time constraint, since everyone wanted to play some sport after work. We actually pioneered instant cricket, too, even before (Kerry) Packer, quips club president Arabinda Bose, who has captained CC amp;FC in both cricket and football.Ravi Kidwai of Carritt Moran, a Merchants Cup stalwart, remembers how the early predominance of tea companies has gradually evaporated. But the standard of soccer on display in the 80s was surely a notch above todays fare, with the likes of Eugene Jennings, Ransdale Deane, Vece Paes, Arabinda Bose and Ravi Thapa ruling the turf, says Kidwai.With crack outfits like Warren Tea, Harrison amp; Crossfield, Magors and Carritt Moran measuring months by Merchants Cup, soccer skills would often land one a mercantile job. Yes, it was a significant plus on your CV if you could kick a football well, recalls Arunava Chakravorty, who, along with Vivek Crishna, played in the first 25 tourneys on the trot.As the show gets bigger, the club management keeps adding value. We have brought the dates forward from the monsoons and introduced floodlights, to draw the family crowd. Surplus sponsorship funds are ploughed back to the meet, along with our cricket and football academies, declares the club president. Subhro Saha

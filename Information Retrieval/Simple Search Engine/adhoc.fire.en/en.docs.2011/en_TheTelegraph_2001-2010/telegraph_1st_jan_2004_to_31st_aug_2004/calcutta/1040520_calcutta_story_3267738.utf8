The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Ahead, twirl time again atop Victoria 
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 The Angel of Victory, on Victoria Memorial, is being repaired to rotate again in two months time. A Telegraph picture																								The Angel of Victory, atop the Victoria Memorial dome, will twirl once again, after all.																								As part of an elaborate plan to make the 83-year-old Memorial more attractive, the authorities have roped in 222-year-old Jessop to get things going.																								For the joint-sector company, the mandate is to give a new lease of life to the bugle-blowing bronze angel, on the 184-ft white marble building, amidst the most popular 64 acres on the Maidan.																								Weighing around three tonnes, the 16-ft angel last twirled in the wind briefly in the early 1990s. Ever since, it has stood still, bugle to its lips, come storm or calm. This, according to the Jessop team working on project angel, has exposed the famous figurine to the risk of toppling of his proud pedestal.																								Commonly referred to as the fairy, it is mounted on a four-tonne shaft, fitted with three bearings to give it a rotatory motion. A layer of mercury under the bearing serves as a lightning conductor.																								The revolving angel has always been a major attraction at the Victoria Memorial, since it used to rotate with the wind. It started creating problems since the 80s and despite several attempts, the problem never found a permanent solution, Chittaranjan Panda, curator, Victoria Memorial, said on Wednesday.																								According to the plans drawn up by Jessop engineers  which officials claim first assembled and installed the angel on the dome during the construction of the historic city landmark  the companys main job will be to clean up the bearings and get the shafts alignment right.																								With the project cost pegged at around Rs 1.5 lakh, Jessop is ready to start work in a weeks time. The repair work will be done on-site and company engineers expect it to be over in less than two months.																								The beleaguered public sector unit, that was divested amidst a lot of controversies last year, is all too happy to be back on the Memorial grounds.																								We are really proud and honoured to be associated with the project, as it is linked with the citys heritage, and we will try our best to fix it once and for all and bring back the charm of the Memorials figurine, said P. K. Ruia, chairman of Jessop.																								Besides, we will instal handles under the structure to make rotation possible even manually. The stability of the structure requires it to twirl with the wind. The statue is not revolving for several years and so, repairing of the angel is a must to save it, he added.																								Memorial officials are also hopeful that Jessop will be able to make the angel move and this, in turn, will push up the footfall at one of Calcuttas most favoured destinations.																								We have taken a number of new initiatives, ranging from laying concrete roads to improving the garden and embankment of the waterbodies. We think all these initiatives and the revolving angel will add to the appeal of the Memorial and raise the interest of the people, said Panda.

And first means first. Ray didnt even have the luxury of making home videos, like the Shyamalans, or assisting high-profile directors, like the Shyams. But the Song of the Road rose so sweet and so significant that the debutant director became a legend.																								Well, even though the priorities of todays aspiring film-makers may be altogether different, everyone wants to do a Ray, at first go. So, with the huge number of directors bursting into Bollywood in the coming weeks, the hopes of the entire film industry are pinned on fresh blood drawing first blood.																								The list is long and the stakes are high. Failed actor Atul Agnihotri directs brother-in-law Salman Khan, Preity Zinta and Bhoomika Chawla in Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa. Another debutant director Tanveer Khan hopes that the John Abraham-Bipasha Basu combo will do the Jism trick again in Madhoshi. 																								A veteran on the small screen, Shashi Ranjan hopes for a mature response to his Jackie Shroff-Raveena Tandon-Mahima Chaudhury-starrer Dobara. Actor Kabir Sadanand hopes he has got the fun-munch formula right for his teenybopper romance Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao starring Tannisha and newcomers Akshay Kapoor and Rashmi Nigam. 																								Independent short film-maker Siddharth Srinivas hopes to make the audience shiver with the ensemble cast and sinister air of Amavas involving Konkona Sen Sharma, Mahesh Manjrekar and Victor Banerjee.																								Apart from bringing bundles of enthusiasm to the table, this bunch of first-timers has enough ammunition to chase away those butterflies in the stomach and calm their producers nerves. 																								The recent success stories of Farhan Akhtar (Dil Chahta Hai), Shaad Ali (Saathiya), Rajkumar Hirani (Munnabhai MBBS), Nikhil Advani (Kal Ho Naa Ho), Ken Ghosh (Ishq Vishk), Revathy (Mitr: My Friend) have indeed scripted a new belief in budding film-makers  to go out there and sell their dreams.																								Their success has instilled in me the hope that I too can succeed, admits Sadanand. Even producers have now started to take more risks by trying new directors for their mega projects. They also know that by getting new people to direct their films, they will not only have fresh ideas but also a more professional approach, which means finishing films on time.																								Srinivas feels the multiplex boom has a role in the rising of the new breed: There were always aspiring film-makers but earlier it was not so easy to make a film and recover costs with only single screen theatres. Now, demand is outstripping supply and so its easy for producers to provide a bouquet of small low-budget films. New directors obviously bring with them a new sense of urgency, a new temperament and a new sensibility.																								The man behind Madhoshi stresses the novelty factor. With new film-makers like us, at least the producers are assured that they will get something truly different, says Tanveer. That has been my foremost concern --- to make something that no one has seen before on the Indian screen. I have tried to use 9/11 as the backdrop and weave the story of Madhoshi around it.																								Slamming the doors on cliches is priority number one for Shashi Ranjan. You cannot keep telling the same story to the same people and hope that they will lap it up. You have to go off the beaten track and give your audiences something truly new. With Dobara, I have tried to give everyone a taste of a mature love story, that has been conspicuously missing in Bollywood.																								Ken Ghosh, now a veteran of two films, feels that a director has a lot more free space the first time around. There are no expectations to meet and you can make whatever is inside you. Critics believe that a persons second film is the real test. I choose to dismiss that  I feel every film from the first one is equally important.																								First-film success should not weigh down subsequent projects, feels Shaad Ali. As I set out to make Bunty Aur Babli, I have no mental baggage named Saathiya with me. I do want the film to do well but I wouldnt like to be weighed down by the soaring expectations around.																								So taking it one step at a time is the name of the number game.

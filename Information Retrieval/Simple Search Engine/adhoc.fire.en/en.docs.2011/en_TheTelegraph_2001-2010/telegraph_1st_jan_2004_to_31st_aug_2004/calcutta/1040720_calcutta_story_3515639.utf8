 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Test bar shuts college 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bengal Tailoring College, on Bidhan Sarani, in north Calcutta, has shut down after threats from students barred by the West Bengal School Service Commission from taking the 2004 teachers recruitment test held on Sunday.																								A total of 390 students with two-year diplomas from the college had applied to the commission for posts of work education teachers. But they were not allowed to take the examinations on the grounds that the college was not recognised. 																								We have lodged a complaint with Girish Park police station on July 15, complaining that some of our students were demanding refund of tuition fees. We have also stopped admissions after the commission held back our candidates from the tests, said principal Manatosh Dasgupta on Monday.																								The college claimed it was recognised by the director of industry of the state government. But the director of industry informed commission officials to the contrary. Principal Dasgupta said admissions had been stopped till matters were sorted out.

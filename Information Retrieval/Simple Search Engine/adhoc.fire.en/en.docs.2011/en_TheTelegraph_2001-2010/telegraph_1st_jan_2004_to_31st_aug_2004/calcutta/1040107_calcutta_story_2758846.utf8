 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 From Lhasa with love, its a long trek
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Paris-based Priscilla Telmon tries her hand at pulling a rickshaw on the streets of Calcutta: Living like them, knowing them better. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Priscilla Telmons exotic looks match her taste for the exotic. This 28-year-old Paris-based travel writer has arrived in Calcutta after a six-month-long, 5,000 km trek that began in Hanoi. She followed the Red River and the Mekong, that are born in Tibet, walked through the jungles and mountains of Yunan, in China, crossed Tibet, reached Lhasa, from there to Darjeeling, and finally to this city. 																								Like her friend, travel writer Sylvain Tesson, who left Calcutta for Varanasi a few days ago, Telmon wants to know people better. She feels there is no better way of knowing them than living and eating like them over a period of time and have the experience in the body.																								Her taste for the exotic extends to her deep interest in medical ethnology (politely known as alternative medicine), which she studied in Paris. She admits there is scepticism about traditional medicine but in France, doctors are changing their mind about it. 																								Telmon started writing at 18 to sustain herself while she studied. She writes travelogues, for it has been a passion since childhood. Besides, she wants to divide my experience. Her other mission in life is to save whales and dolphins. She is also fond of climbing. 																								With two books and several articles to her credit, her first trip was across central Asia at the age of 23. She has been on humanitarian missions to the Philippines, Thailand and Kenya. Last July, she decided to retrace the journey of Alexandre David-Neel, the first European woman to visit Lhasa in 1924. With a gift of tongues, she could speak fluently in Tibetan and Indian languages, including Sanskrit, and she pretended to be a pilgrim. Eighty years later, Telmon embarked on this arduous journey in honour of this remarkable Frenchwoman who had spent years in India.																								Telmon carried a light tent, a change of clothes, cameras, writing implements, and a sleeping bag. In Vietnam and China, she ate rice and vegetables, while in Tibet, her staple was noodle soup and the nomads offered her dried yak meat (rotten in many cases), yak milk and a bread similar to the chapati. People shared their food with her. But as a woman all by herself, occasionally people would try to steal her belongings, under-estimating her physical strength.																								Like millions of pilgrims, she visited Kawa Kharpo, the holiest of holy mountains in Tibet, when its birth anniversary was being celebrated. In Lhasa, she could feel the undercurrent of unease. Police were present everywhere and they harassed and grilled her to find out if she carried any photograph of the Dalai Lama. From Lhasa to Darjeeling, she was accompanied by Sylvain Tesson, with whom she has also done central Asia. Her journey, partially recorded on celluloid, will be turned into a film for French television.																								Telmons odyssey has provided her with enough material for two more books. She has already planned her next trip in two years time to the rainforests of the Amazon. Telmon wants to find out how traditional medicines have fared in a generation that wants to abandon the forest and settle down in the city.

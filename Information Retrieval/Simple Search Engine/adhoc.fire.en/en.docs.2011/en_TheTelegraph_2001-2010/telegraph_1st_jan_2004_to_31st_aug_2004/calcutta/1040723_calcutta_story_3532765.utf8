The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Daniel Radcliffe You are affectionate, sensitive and gentle. Pride wont allow you to remain obliged to others. A little more patience, and youll make excellent company. A gift of the gab endears you to the opposite sex. As a partner, youre liberal but possessive. You have the acumen for making money.  Kusum Bhandari

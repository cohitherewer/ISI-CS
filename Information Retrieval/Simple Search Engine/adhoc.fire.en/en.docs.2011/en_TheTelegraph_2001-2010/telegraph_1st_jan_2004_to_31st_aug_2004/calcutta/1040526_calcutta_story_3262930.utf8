A Thought for Food Items from the Mexican buffet at The Hyatt. Picture by Rashbehari Das Pizza freaks in town, who received a blow with the closure of Don Giovannis on Park Street, have reason to rejoice. Favourite Quattros, Napolis and Riveras are being served up once again at the plush new restaurant, China Bistro. Owned by the Don Giovannis group, the Chinese and Italian eatery with a sprinkling of Thai, opened on M.A. Ahmed Street (off Free School Street) last week.But it is the dcor, more than the food, that steals the show. No Chinese lanterns and red tables here. China Bistro has an international look with black leather, steel and matte wood ruling the interiors. The futuristic furniture is from Malaysia, says owner Ricky Dewan. There are Versace candle stands and champagne glasses thrown around to classy effect. The restaurant can seat 126, and the mezzanine floor for 20 can be hired for parties as well.The menu, in both categories, is quite varied. The Italian section offers all-time favourites from the Don Giovannis kitty like Chefs Special, Chicken Supremo, Pepperoni Pizza, Rodeo Special Pizza and many more. Plus, it includes a wide variety of Italian soups, salads, pastas and bakes. Most of the soups are vegetarian and can be combined with starters like Cocktail di Gamberetti (traditional prawn cocktail) or the Tuna Pate or Chicken Pate.The salad variety is interesting, with options like Insalata Caesar which is a chicken, iceberg lettuce and crunchy bread salad, or the Insalata di Tonno, a mixture of tuna fish and olives, while the chicken, ham and sausage salad called Insalata Calabrese also looks exciting.There is a decent range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian pastas. The Mediterranean, Napolitana and Al Aglio, Olio e Peperoncino are some of the veg varieties, while in the non-veg section, one can find Bolognaise, Spaghetti with Tuna and Olives, and pasta tossed with chicken, ham, sausages and mushrooms in different sauces. Bakes like Lasagne Grande, Spaghetti Marina, Con Cipolla and Spaghetti Cardinale are also served up.The Chinese menu comprises the predictable as well as the exotic. So, while there are the usual starters like Drums of Heaven and Chicken Pepper Salt, there are some unusual ones like the Lamb Spring Rolls, Dragon Chicken, and Crispy Betki in Sweet Chilli Sauce. These can be paired with soups like Hansi Lamb and Noodle Soup, Broccoli Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Meatball Soup and the likes. The main course has a vast selection of chicken, seafood and lamb dishes, which can be mixed with some interesting rice and noodle options like the Triple Szechwan Rice, Veg Malacca Fried Rice and Shanghai Noodle with Mushroom. The China Bistro. Picture by Aranya Sen Chilli nights Mexicans like it as hot as Indians do, when it comes to their grub, that is. So the newly-introduced Mexican buffet at the Waterside Caf of Hyatt Regency should go down smooth.The spread will be available every Thursday night through June and July.The buffet includes three salads, two soups (vegetarian and non-vegetarian), two non-vegetarian and three vegetarian dishes in the main course and the winner of them all  three exotic desserts  at Rs 550 plus taxes.Mexican cuisine is popular with Indians because it suits our taste, says executive sous chef S. Malhotra, the man creating the Mexican magic in the open kitchen at the caf. It is a feast for the eyes as well, to watch the red-orange flamb leap out of the frying pan as he cooks up irresistible prawns with herb butter.Sipping the spicy tortilla soup with diced avocado could be the easiest way to spice up your life.For those fish addicts, the Grilled Fish Yucatan is a must taste. The Mexican Chicken, rich in tomato gravy and not too spicy, is right for those who dont have a penchant for chillies. The Mexican diet is usually heavy in protein, but most of their non-veg items are cooked in beef, which we translate into chicken or fish for the base, explains Malhotra. But it is the desserts that take the cake. Try the Tequila Fruit Cake or the Drunken Bananas.HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Kiran Uttam GhoshDESIGNER KIRAN UTTAM GHOSH RECOUNTS HER SONAR BANGLA EXPERIENCE AT THE BANGLADESH FASHION WEEKENDWhats the grass like on the other side of the border? Greener, I thought, since rainfall counts. If, as friends misinformed me, the veil is de rigeur on the streets of Dhaka, then what was Prasad Bidappa talking about when he invited me to participate in the first Bangladesh fashion week? Curiosity inspired me to juggle a hectic schedule and push back a much-needed break in London to fit in what could, more aptly, be dubbed the first Bangladesh Fashion Weekend over Saturday and Sunday (July 3 and 4). The thing that struck me first was the Bangladeshis bhadrota. This side of Petrapol, we could learn a thing or two from their legendary politeness and hospitality. Their immigration must rank as one of the most congenial, and right along, from the doorman to the friends friends secretary who took the trouble to mail back an assurance of hospitality should I need it, it was all decidedly sonar Bangla. The Fashion Weekend was a result of a chance meeting between Shobhaa De and Bibi Russell. Shobhaa was so impressed with Bibis work that she felt it had to lead to an effort to showcase the countrys vibrant design talent.  Models flaunt Bibi Russells soft cotton weaves at the first Bangladesh Fashion Weekend. The show, held in Dhaka last month, was a result of a chance meeting between Russell and Shobhaa De. The writer was so impressed with the Bangladeshi designers work that she felt it had to lead to an effort to showcase the countrys vibrant design talent We began with fittings and I was overwhelmed by a sense of dj vu. This could have been a fitting session at home, not an entirely different country, with frantic assistants scurrying around with clothes on hangers for 27 models from both countries, including our Jesse Randhawa, Tupur Chatterjee, Zulfi Syed and Nayanika Chatterjee Singh, stunning in spite of being mother of one-and-a-half year old Tara. And some really elegant Bangladeshi models like the very chic Tupa and Asif who could give our guys a complex. It was much the same chaos, that distinct buzz of an impending show. Through all of this, the most recognised Bangladeshi designer and once a Vogue cover model Bibi Russell, was as Bohemian, welcoming and warm as she always is, standing apart with her unique sense of chic, keeping us in splits through our fittings. The highlight of my weekend was some amazing Dhakai Jaamdani saris, brilliant Petit Point embroidery by Rina Latif and the finest kantha I have ever seen by Kumudini. Bibi did an outstanding layered look in soft cotton weaves.In keeping with the sentiments of the host country, there was certainly no bikini brigade. In the midst of all this we had a 12-hour hartal which made me feel quite at home. It didnt stop the 500 or 600-strong crowd from turning up at the show. Shobhaa and Dilip De and the Indian High Commissioner Veena Sikri added to the glam quotient. I did hear there were those who werent too enthused by a fashion showing which explained why we were virtually led in through the back door of the Pan Pacific Sonar Gaon when we arrived. Or how strangely we werent allowed to step out of the hotel on the first day. Yet, all I met was enthusiasm for the event. In fact, one gentleman at the airport told me a little ruefully, when I was leaving, with no trace of disapproval that hed never been to a fashion show. A bout of flu felled me and I had to decline the offer from the Bangladeshi models to check out their city that night. But Zulfi, who did, told me he had a blast. On my last day there, we went out shopping to a mall. The roads dominated by cycle rickshaws made Calcuttas streets look a little tame. I chose to wear a till-the-toes skirt and a top. But wherever we went we could feel people turning, something were certainly not used to back home. The next time I walk into Forum or City Centre in cut-offs, I certainly wont take my liberty to dress as I wish, for granted.

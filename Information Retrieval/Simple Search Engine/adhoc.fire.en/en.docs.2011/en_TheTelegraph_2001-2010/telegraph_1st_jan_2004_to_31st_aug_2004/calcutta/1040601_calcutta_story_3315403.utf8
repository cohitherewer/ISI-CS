The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Singapore visa office shut, trade in a tizzy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Singapore High Commission has decided to down shutters on the visa office in Calcutta, with effect from Tuesday. 																								While the decision came as a blow to the citys business community, high commission officials said it was an administrative decision and had nothing to do with trade ties with Bengal. 																								We are re-organising our operations and its just an administrative decision to bring in more efficiency, said a Singapore High Commission spokesperson from Delhi. Ruling out fears of impact on trade ties between the countries, he said the increase in the number of flights linking Calcutta and Singapore was an indication of the governments interest in the region. 																								But the move has surprised many in the citys industry circles. According to Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, Indian Chamber of Commerce, the closure will create significant inconvenience to those having business relations with Singapore. 																								The past few years have seen an increase in both business linkages and flow of passengers between Singapore and this part of the country. At a time when we were expecting the city office to be upgraded into a full-fledged consulate, this decision to shut down the office will portray a negative picture about the state, feared Arif.																								The Singapore High Commission has consular offices in Chennai and Mumbai, but the city office was a visa-processing centre. 																								The flow of visa applications was high from the city and we think the closure will imply a rise in transaction costs for those applying for a visa from Calcutta. It will also have a negative impact on the citys image, added Arif, seeking intervention from the state government on the closure. 																								Sources in Writers Buildings confirmed that the state government was aware of the decision. But we are yet to receive any formal intimation from the high commission, they added.

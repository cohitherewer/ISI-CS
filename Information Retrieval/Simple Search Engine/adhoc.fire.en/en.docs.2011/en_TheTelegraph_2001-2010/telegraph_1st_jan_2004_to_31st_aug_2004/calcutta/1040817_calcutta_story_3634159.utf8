 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Twist in missing girl case 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is on the brink of breakthrough in the Sushmita Dhar disappearance case, sleuths said.																								The optimism stems from sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Alipore Manjit Singhs decision to include fresh charges on the basis of new-found evidence in the case, dating back to May 16, 1995, when the then Jadavpur University student went missing from Chandipur while on a holiday with batchmates.																								Investigations have now revealed that after Sushmita went missing that morning, her clothes were neatly packed in her suitcase. These included the wet salwar kameez she had last been seen in, her watch and a lipstick, said a senior CID officer.																								During the proceedings last week, the defence team of Prasanta Chakraborty and Tamal Mukherjee had pleaded with the judge to release Suparna and her 70-year-old father Sachindra Banerjee, who has been in judicial custody since his arrest last month.																								Biman Banerjee, counsel on behalf of the Dhars, argued that Banerjee was guilty of tampering with evidence and so the bail plea be rejected.																								Judge Singh, on hearing both sides, had refused bail and set the next date of hearing on August 26.																								The new charges of disappearance of evidence have been accepted by the court, the judge had observed.

 Death in droplet? Piped water to quench a parched throat No one is safe in todays world, in India or anywhere else (Oasis of peace, station of terror, April 21). But in West Bengal, the situation seems to be deteriorating day by day.  What took place on the railway platform at Hridaypur in front of scores of spectators can happen anywhere to anyone. It is sad that the chief minister feels proud in equating us to a lawless place like Bihar. His assurance that people here are living in better condition than our neighbours in Bihar is actually a lame acceptance of the fact that we are far worse off than people in other states.  It is true that our police force is not working to the best of its ability. Criminals are freely going about their business on the streets.  But I have a question. Is it only the duty of the police force to prevent crime? Do we also not have the same duty as citizens of free India? We cannot afford a police force large enough to fight goons in every alley. What were the on-lookers doing when the goons were trying to molest the woman? Why did they turn the other way and enter the scene only after the attackers had left the scene? It is not right to always blame the politicians and the police while remaining mute and inactive ourselves. It is only after we do our own duty that we can have the right to blame others for not doing theirs. Shameek Bose,
Address not givenThe report Gastro grip tightens hepatitis hazard hold (April 17) puts the South Dum Dum Municipality authorities to shame. The piped water samples given for tests by the municipality contains faecal contamination. The water that we drink is getting mixed with water from the sewer lines! How long will we have to drink water with fear in our hearts? Sunil Banerjee, 
VIP Road.  This legal wrangle between a political leader and a wealthy clinic had more to do with their inflated egos than getting justice against medical negligence (Ministers victory by whisker in sugar suit, April 24). The minister was on fire because the clinic probably did not give the extra attention that political leaders in India consider their birthright. On the other hand, the hospital refused to pay the paltry compensation, a peanut by their standards, because they wanted to maintain their flawless scorecard. The hapless patient has little to lose or gain from this battle of the giants. Kunal Saha,
Ohio, USA. The article Subrata blind to Behala blisters (April 16) was praiseworthy. There seems to be no reason to keep Behala within the jurisdiction of Calcutta Municipal Corporation when the development done in the area is 10 per cent of that in the city proper. The mosquito menace is a threat to the local residents. There is no proper drainage system for waste water. When will the mayor look our way? Chandan Ray,
Sarsuna. Apropos the report Back to pavement with passbook (April 20), it is heartening to note that there are still people who can resist the temptation of material wealth. Pavement-dweller Soni Begum is an example of how honesty and integrity outweigh a hefty bank balance. While many affluent people stoop to earn easy money, this woman proved that economic compulsions cannot nudge one off the track of righteousness. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town The report Cops rain mercy on intruder, April 20, shows that we sometimes mull over the darker shades in other peoples characters and in the process miss out on the brighter aspects. The same cops, whom we consider to be rough and bereft of human sentiments, are providing medical assistance to a minor intruder from Bangladesh. This case will improve the image of the men in uniform. Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
Nayapatty Road. The article Goods haul: fakes with foreign tag published on April 14, mentions Shoppers Stop as one of the markets which had been raided, which is complete misrepresentation of facts. Somnath Sarkar, 
Customer Care Associate amp; Manager-operations,
Shoppers Stop

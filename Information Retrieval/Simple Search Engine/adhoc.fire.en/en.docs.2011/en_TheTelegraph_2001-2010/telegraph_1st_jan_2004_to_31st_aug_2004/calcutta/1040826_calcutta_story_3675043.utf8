 Thursday, August 26, 2004 Life Chocolate cheer A model sips a new concoction at Cafe Aqua Java. Picture by Rashbehari Das												 Its the most reliable gift you can give someone. Its the safest anti-depressant for women. Nowadays, its even rubbed on the skin to give it a healthy glow. Chocolate has achieved true universality. 																					Now it is being put to more uses than ever at Aqua Java, the first coffee shop in the city, which has come up with a range of new beverages using chocolate at their new Wood Street outlet.We wanted to give somethingdifferent to our guests and we thought that hot and cold coffees with chocolate as a base would be a good idea, said Saket Agarwal of Aqua Java. 																					So Kit Kats, Toblerones and yummy brownies have lent themselves to different cold shakes now available on the menu. Try the Crackle Shake that blends in the crispy chocolate or the Bounty Shake, in which the Bounty candy bar is used. You can even sip an Apple Pie Shake, with cream and cinnamon sauce.  quot;Along with the cold shakes we also have freezers in refreshing flavours like lime and aam panna, added Saket. For those on a calorie check, these clear drinks that can help beat the heat could be a good idea. Lemon Ginger Freezer, Black Current Freezer and Masala Sikhanji are the other choices that have made it to the menu. Sugar-free versions of three popular drinks have also been added to the list keeping in mind the demands of the slim-trim brigade.																					Things are heating up in the hot coffee section as well, with with names like Caf B 52, which is coffee with the flavour of the popular alcoholic drink. Caf Tiramisu, Caf Caramel Latte and Caf Butterscotch are the other options. While this might sound like great news for the coffee crazed, patrons stand to loose out on their favourite coffee flavours unless they cast their vote by ordering it regularly over the next two months. 																					We will finally incorporate in the main menu only those drinks that do well over the next two months, said Saket.																					Cosy at one																					 Around the Corner, the cosy food station (or resto-caf as the owner calls it) at the crossing of Shakespeare Sarani and Outram Street is turning one on the last day of the month.																					To celebrate the occasion, a new menu and loads of discounts for food and confectionery buffs have been announced. We have included prawn and fish on the menu based on the feedback that we have got from our regular guests over the last year, said Tanuja Prasad, the proprietress who has single-handedly run the show for past year. 																					With a large office crowd dropping in for lunch and the evenings patronised mainly by families who live around the area, its not without a reason that Tanuja decided to add 25 new Chinese, Continental and Mexican items to the menu. Bakes, salads and soups had always been on the menu. 																					For the office crowd, we have a power lunch pack at just Rs 75, on for a fortnight starting August 31 to celebrate the anniversary, said Tanuja. This is besides a 15 per cent discount on bills of Rs 500 and above and a 10 per cent discount on bills worth Rs 250 and above. A happy hour for those shopping for bakes and confectioneries will begin from 8 pm to 10 pm everyday through the fortnight with a straight 25 per cent discount on all purchases. 																					Open from 10 am to 10 pm, the effort is obviously to cater to a gamut of guests, from college-goers to families. But the quality of food is possibly the biggest asset of this place. And the name could not be more appropriate. The cosy shop makes you feel right at home. The anniversary spread at Around the Corner. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												India of old																					Kalash, the speciality Indian restaurant at The HHI, is all set to play host to an evening of celebration on August 27 with an event revisiting the spirit of freedom and promising to rekindle the essence of India as it was. 																					Conceived by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, this is the young event managers next venture after Women on the Edge, a play featuring Renu Roy and Lee Alison Sibley. Sujoy has roped in experts from various fields of creative arts to perform on the occasion. 																					The idea is to evoke the spirit of this country that we believe is now almost dead, said Sujoy. 																					Being supported by a Sketch, a creative agency, the show has been thrown together in about a week. We associated with the event because the city craves intellectually challenging evenings that can provide some food for thought, said Sanghamitra, on behalf of Sketch. 																					With actresses like Deboleena Dutta squeezing out time for rehearsals in between her packed shooting schedule, and thespian Dolly Basu sitting through brain-storming sessions to pick a piece just right for the occasion, culture is at the core of the evening. 																					Dance is a form that I feel best expresses ones feelings. I have chosen Nazrul Islams Sristhi Sukher Ullashey recited by Kaji Sabyasachi to perform to, shared Deboleena, whos dancing talent has been so far kept secret.English compositions of Rabindranaths poetry will be recited by Barun Das. Ditipriya Lahiri will sing Imagine by John Lennon. Stories of Partition will be heard through diaries of women as Aparajita Addho reads out a short story. 																					Others who are slated to participate include actress June, Alakananda Roy and Bijoylakshmi Burman.

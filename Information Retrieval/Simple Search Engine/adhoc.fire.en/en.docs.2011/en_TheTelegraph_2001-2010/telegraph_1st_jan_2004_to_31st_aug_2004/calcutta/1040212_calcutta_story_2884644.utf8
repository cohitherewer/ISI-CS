																								Directed by Bilwadal Chatterjee, Kalindi Natyasrijans new play Nonaraater Gaan tells the story of Moyna, a young woman belonging to the weaker sections of our society. Moyna struggles on her own to overcome the cruel twists of fate in her life and through her experiences learns that it is the social class we belong to rather than our birth ties that determine human relationships. Enacted by Piuli Banerjee as Moyna, and supported by Bhaskar Basu, Chaitali Roy, Chandan Maiti, Sharmila Basu, Bilwadal Chatterjee and others, this play, written by Anup Chakravarti, exposes the social hypocrisies of our times.

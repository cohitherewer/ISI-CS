 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Concrete chaos keeps birds out
 OUR BUREAU																								Where have all the guests that Calcutta and Howrah play host to every winter disappeared? 																								This season, few, if any, migratory birds have arrived in the city. Officials, directed by the government to revive nature, are perplexed by the unusual drop that sanctuaries have reported in the arrival of pintails, teals and gadwalls.																								The three main migratory bird sanctuaries  Alipore zoo, the Santragachhi lake in Howrah and the Baruipur lake  have fewer guests. 																								Every winter, flocks of birds of 55 to 60 different species migrate from Siberia, Northern Eurasia and the Himalayan ranges and stay in Calcutta from December to March, before flying back.																								The zoo authorities wondered why only 1,000 birds of different varieties, like the lesser whistling teal, pintail duck, comb duck, shoveller and the garganey have made it to the zoo, against thrice the number earlier.																								Highrises and the lack of greenery seem to have forced the birds to opt for lonelier regions in the sub-continent, says S.K. Chowdhury, director of Alipore Zoological Gardens. 																								Bird-lovers, who had come to see their feathered friends on Sunday afternoon at the Alipore zoo, were disappointed. How can you expect birds to come here when they hardly clean the waters in the canal? said a group of students from a city school.																								At the Santragachhi jheel, however, over 6,000 birds have homed in. The figure is much less than last year, when over 8,000 birds had come to Santragachhi by the first week of January, says Sujan Chatterjee of Prakriti Samsad, a bird-lovers association which carries out such surveys every year.																								The thick cover of water hyacinth is keeping the birds away from the waterbody, spread over 50 bighas, says Chatterjee. These birds love clear and clean waters. But, the authorities seemed to be in some hurry and forgot to clean the lake. We have noticed that many birds have disappeared from here in the past few days. Maybe they did not like the place, he added. 																								Admitting the low turnout, V.K. Yadav, deputy wildlife warden, department of forests in West Bengal, says increasing pollution, in the form of plastic bags and domestic waste dumped into the water, is acting as a deterrent. 																								Despite stringent rules, people pollute the waters, says G.B.Thapliyal, principal and chief conservator of forest.

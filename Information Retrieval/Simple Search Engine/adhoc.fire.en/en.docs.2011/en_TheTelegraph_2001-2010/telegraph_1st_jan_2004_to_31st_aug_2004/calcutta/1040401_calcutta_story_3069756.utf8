 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Safety scan at CU museum
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Wiser after the Visva-Bharati theft, Calcutta University (CU) has beefed up security at its Ashutosh Museum and drawn up a comprehensive plan to upgrade the existing system to guard the art objects.																								The museum has a rich collection of priceless paintings, manuscripts, sculptures, coins and terracota exhibits. It draws research scholars and students of history from across the country.																								The artefacts in our museum are valuable. We contacted Calcutta Police immediately after the Visva-Bharati theft. We have asked for the deployment of more plainclothes policemen in and outside the museum during and after visiting hours, said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic).																								CU has decided to instal a closed-circuit camera immediately at the museum. We hope to instal the device this week. Later, senior officials will draw up a comprehensive plan to instal modern fire and burglary detection devices, pro vice-chairman Das said.																								The CU authorities will also prepare a report on the sum of money needed to upgrade the security and other arrangements for preserving the art objects. The report will be sent to the government for approval.																								The museum was set up in 1937 and shifted to its present site at CUs Centenary Building on the College Street campus, in the late 60s. It is guarded manually. There are no sophisticated devices to detect burglars or fires.																								The Kalighat patas are the most significant collection of the museum. Besides, the terracota gallery is also unique. No other museum in the country has this kind of a collection, asserted Saumitra Sarkar, CU librarian in charge of the museum at present.																								Ashutosh Museum has a separate section to house numerous objects collected by the university when it used to conduct excavations. These objects have immense historic value and draw many researchers to the museum, officials said.																								On an average, 20 scholars, local and foreign, carry out research at the museum every day. There are scholars from Japan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka now.																								However, the curators post has been vacant for nearly two years. The authorities were unable to fill up the post after the former curator retired in the wake of a court case.

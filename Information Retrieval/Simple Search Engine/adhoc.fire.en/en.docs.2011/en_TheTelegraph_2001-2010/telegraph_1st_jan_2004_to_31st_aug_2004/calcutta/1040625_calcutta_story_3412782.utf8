 SUDESHNA BANERJEESujoy: Mapping microwaves. Picture by Pabitra Das. An aeroplane and microwave ovens: On Sujoys technological map 																								Making waves with microwaves. Sujoy Mukherjee has set out to do just that. The 22-year-old is on a flight to the UK to participate in a conference that will draw the best in the world of electronics.																								Sujoy, a final-year student of Heritage Institute of Technology (HIT), is one of the nine students chosen from across the world to make a poster presentation in the seminar that is being organised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), an umbrella body of electrical professionals, headquartered in New Jersey, USA, and spread across 42 societies across the world. 																								It is a significant achievement as Sujoy is one of the two co-winners in IEEEs Region 10 (the other being a boy from Bangladesh), which includes electronics giants as China and Japan, as well as Australia, says Sivaji Chakravorti, chairperson for IEEEs Calcutta chapter and professor of electrical engineering, Jadavpur University.																								If the organisers are special, so is the occasion  100 years of the invention of the Fleming diode, a landmark event in the history of electronics. 																								And more special is the venue where the conference will be held. Bletchley Park, on the outskirts of London, is the main site of British code-breaking during World War II. 																								Says Sujoy, completely clued in on his destination on the eve of his journey: This is where some 12,000 men and women worked to break the German Enigma and Lorenz codes, as well as the Italian and Japanese ones. These achievements greatly shortened the war. Also, this is where the epoch-making transition was made to fully electronic computing with the design and construction of the Colossus computer.																								As the theme of the conference is the history of electronics, all presentations look back at the past and connect to the future of a variety of applications of the wonder invention  space communications to television to computers to electronic music.																								Sujoy has chosen to trace the journey of microwaves from Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, father of microwave analog optics, through J.A. Fleming and Marconi, and enter our kitchen with Percy Spencers oven. The oven and the landing techniques of flights are among the most advanced areas of the use of microwaves today, says Sujoy. 																								The soft-spoken ex-South Pointer, whose favourite subject in school was mathematics, had submitted the paper in February. I had no expectations, he says. So when the congratulatory e-mail came on April 1 from Frederik Nebeker, senior research historian at the IEEE History Center at New Jersey, he was elated. No, I did not think it was an All Fools Day joke, he protests.																								The ripples of excitement have spread across his institute as well. In a new college like ours (in its third year now), such achievements motivate not just other students but the teachers as well, said principal B.B. Paira, adding that HIT was financing part of Sujoys journey.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Drains under water claim victims
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The death of the six-year-old Kaynath Salim, who fell into an open drain in Howrah on Tuesday evening, is not a one-off mishap. Several other people have either been injured or have fractured their limbs the same way this monsoon. 																								Within 24 hours of the death of little Salim, four others were badly injured while walking through waterlogged streets in different parts of the town. 																								Akhtar Ahmed, of Bellilious Lane, is recuperating in a nursing home after his leg bone broke into pieces while walking down a flooded street. 																								He said all the drains in his neighbourhood are open, and after a smart shower, it becomes very difficult to locate a drain under water. The street gets flooded with drain water, which stands for days together during the monsoon, Ahmed said, in the nursing home, with his feet in a plaster cast. 																								Sandipan Ghose, 30, in K Road, and Ayesha Khatun, 35, of Bellilious Lane, and Mira Das, 48, of Natabar Pal Road, faced similar situations. All of them received injuries after they fell into open drains. 																								Among the three casualties, Ayesha Khatuns injury was not so serious. Her right hand was bandaged as she had a narrow escape from the open drain. The other two  Sandipan Ghosh and Mira Das  broke their chin and right hand, respectively. 																								They had to be rushed to private nursing homes for medical treatment. 																								The entire drainage system of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) has collapsed and the inspectors seldom visit the area to check it, complained Ghose, with eight stitches on his chin. 																								Local residents complained that after a heavy shower, the streets go under knee-deep stinking water and thats the way it stays for days. 																								Admitting that surveys are not conducted properly, HMC officials said that when councillors of different wards sent a notice for requisition for an inspection, then only did the officials visit those areas. 																								Otherwise they never bother to do so. 																								Since 1984, when the municipality was transformed into a corporation, no proper check-up of the drainage lines has been undertaken by the authorities. We have a map of the sewerage line of the HMC area but no one has tried to find out where the main problem lies, said the official. 																								Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said conservancy work for the monsoon has started. The two main arteries have been cleared. The main drains are being inspected.

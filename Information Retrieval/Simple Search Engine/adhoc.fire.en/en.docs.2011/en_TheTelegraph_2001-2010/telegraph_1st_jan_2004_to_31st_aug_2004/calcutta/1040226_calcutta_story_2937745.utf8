 Surf strife: A family before the TV; (Above) Jassi: Not everyones favourite The report April poll shadow on major exams (Jan. 24) dwelt on a matter of undoubtedly serious concern. A number of major examinations  Calcutta Universitys BA, B.Sc and B.Com part II and the Higher Secondary examinations  are scheduled to be held in April. If the Parliamentary election does take place in the same month, five lakh HS and one lakh BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II examinees will be seriously affected. The state education authorities would be in great difficulty to re-schedule all these examinations, which would undoubtedly create a terrible impasse. With the election bandwagon on a roll  the dates may be announced any day  the political leaders should come forward to request the election commission to defer the poll dates in the interests of the six lakh examinees, whose careers would be jeopardised.  This move will win the parties more brownie points on the ballot paper than hour-long speeches. Sunil Banerjee,
Dum Dum. Apropos the report Small screen, big trouble (Jan 26), it is alarming to note the conflict among members of a family over TV-viewing. The sad death of a couple objecting to the TV-viewing of their college-going daughter, reported on January 23, is a sharp pointer to this unfortunate trend. TV with its irresistible attractions has robbed students of much time which they would devote to studies otherwise. Guardians and their wards should reach an understanding so that conflicts do not occur. Piyal Mukherjee,
Lake Town. Having been present at the Book Fair on the day when Taslima Nasreen and Jassi made an appearance there, I have witnessed the madness of people who scrambled for a glimpse of or a hand shake with the celebrities (Fair bonus with twin icons, Jan. 29). Though Taslimas presence sparked debates, it was because of Jassi, the increasingly popular character from Sonys Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, that she almost went unnoticed. Kunal Roy,
Santragachhi. The opinion of Albrecht Klenk, the German expert in urban development and land-use planning, about the importance of the protection of the Hooghly riverfront and the wetlands and preservation of trams clearly shows how the ideas of our planners and political leaders on such issues are immature (Hope trio: Hooghly wetlands and trams, Jan. 28). Since Klenk is an expert, we should not take his views lightly. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
Behala.  It was a pleasant surprise to read the City Diary report Dial a number for hospital information (Jan. 28) The proposed medical control room at Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital will be a huge help for patients. Anil Kumar Sen,
Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. I do not quite agree with the report on wine being good for health as India is a temperate region (Its just fine when its wine, Jan. 24). B.H. Raval,
Prince Anwar Shah Road. How can a glass of wine be a status symbol? Should Bengalis now drown themselves in alcohol to live it up, like the 19th century babus?Anirban Mandal,
Chinsurah.  Apropos the report Rivalry raises casualty count (Jan. 23), it is distressing how road accidents and resultant deaths are on the rise in and around Calcutta. Rash driving, bad condition of roads and jaywalking are the three main reasons for most accidents. Prahlad Agarwala,
Nadia. Though Dhananjoy Chatterjees crime is very serious, a death sentence cannot be the answer (Rapist on death row moves apex court, Jan. 29). Many countries have abolished the death penalty as it is a barbaric measure. Where the penalty exists, there is no sign of a lower rate of crime. Sachindra Nath Mitra,
Beleghata.

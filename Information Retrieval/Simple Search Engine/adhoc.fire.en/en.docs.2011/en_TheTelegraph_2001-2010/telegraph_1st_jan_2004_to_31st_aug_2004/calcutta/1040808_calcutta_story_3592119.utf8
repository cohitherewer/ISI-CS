The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 First night ride
																								The word nightclub instantly conjures up a few distinct images  smoky interiors, loud music, jam-packed dance floor and lots of fun. But for the first-timer to a disco, trekking into uncharted territory amidst a gang of know-all cool cats can be uncomfortable, if not unnerving.																								So, heres a quick guide to how you could beat the first-night fear and be footloose on your maiden trip to the other side of midnight.Pick your spot																								At the outset, all night-clubs look and feel the same, but regulars will tell you that each of these places have a distinct character. The pitch you choose for your debut should depend on the kind of person you are. If you want to go full-blast on the very first night, then Tantra or Dublin, big and bustling, beckons. If you want to start slow, then look at smaller places like Shisha, the hookah bar at Grain of Salt, Cloud 9, the resto-bar at Astor, or Big Ben, the English-styled pub at The Kenilworth. To keep things casual (especially if its a boy band), walk into Winning Streak.Time it right																								The nightclubs are open all through the week, but its only on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays that the crowd swells. Avoid weekdays except Wednesday when the party people take over the drink-and-dance hotspots for a mid-week break. Friday and Saturday are the big nights with the regulars dropping in to have a blast. Next, fix the time. All nightclubs are open 9 pm onwards, but that doesnt mean that you report for fun at 8.45. The cool time to walk in would be 11 pm. Style watch																								You might be all excited about flaunting that backless top of yours, but its not a great sartorial selection for the first trip to a nightclub. A pair of jeans and a nice kurti should be the order of Day I. For guys, a T-shirt or shirt and a pair of denims sit just right.																								Caution: Open footwear is a strict no-no for men and most discs dont allow guys in shorts or cut-sleeves either.Look, then leap																								Go in a group, watch whats happening around you and make your moves accordingly  dance floor or bar. It could, after all, be the beginning of many a night to remember. 						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

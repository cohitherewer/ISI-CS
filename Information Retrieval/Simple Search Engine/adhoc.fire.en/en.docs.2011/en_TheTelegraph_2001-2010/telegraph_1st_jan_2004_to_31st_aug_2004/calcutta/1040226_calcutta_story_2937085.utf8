					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Tanvir and Bindu show off outfits from Root at Metro Plaza															How does the trendy young man of today like to dress? Trying to get to the bottom of this is Root, a clothing store for men in Metro Plaza, which believes that comfort, cut and yes, colour, are key. Having opened its shutters just last year, Root was recently renovated to expand its base, and now boasts of a brand new collection of casual and hip formalwear. 																					 Owned by young businessman Kishan Dhanuka, Root stocks an impressive variety of the humble T-shirt, be it the half-sleeved version, the sleeker long-sleeved look, tight and regular fits or even deep-necked ones a la Enrique Iglesias. Also very popular with the young-at-heart are the ripped styles in kaleidoscopic hues and the printed, long-sleeved T-shirts that turn the tables on the regulation blacks and blues for menswear. Also ideal for staying cool as the temperature rises, is the range of cotton T-shirts in different denim washes while for a slightly more formal yet with-it look, check out Roots collection of shirts (fitted and regular) in wispy fabrics, smart stripes and zany prints. 																					Bottoms at the store come by way of track-pants in bright red and purple, formal flat-fronts and of course, good old jeans. The latter (from such brands as Notch, Diesel and Neon) come in a number of different avatars such as the baggy hip-hop style, super-flares, the used, deconstructed look complete with corduroy patches and even the tapered leg, which is slowly making its way back onto the ramps. 																					e Root is essentially a menswear store, it also has a range of jeans for girls thats worth a browse. Funky sneakers, sandals and other accessories are also to be found here. For details, call: 2288 1709. Some of the jewellery from the ongoing Imagem exhibition at The Taj Bengal 												Image-building																					Flashing gold jewellery is one thing. Flashing designer gold jewellery is quite another  something that the newly-launched brand Imagem is banking on for the success of its three-day exhibition in the city. A venture of Silverline Jewellers (SLJ) of Mumbai, the Imagem exposition at the Mandarin in The Taj Bengal will continue till tomorrow and is showcasing exquisite, one-of-a-kind pieces that are chic, contemporary and sure to make a striking statement. 																					A special preview of the new line was held recently at the hotel itself and was attended by managing director, SLJ, Hitesh Lohia, directors Neeraj Kayathwal and Sameet Neb and business development manager, Sweta Sonthalia among others. Said Hitesh Lohia, This is the kind of jewellery that should be worn every day and not stacked away in the locker. The pieces are versatile enough to take you from a day at the office to a night on the town. Another plus is that each piece is an original design and comes with a buy-back policy. 																					 A fusion of 18-carat gold, dazzling diamonds and an array of precious and semi-precious gems including emeralds, rubies, sapphires, peridots, iolites and tanzanites, the Imagem collection wows one with a variety of necklaces, pendants, rings, earrings and bracelets in stunning designs. On display are gorgeous rings complete with colourful clusters of precious stones, lavish necklaces studded with diamonds and grey pearls, thick diamond bracelets and much more to get any jewellery-lover in a tizzy. Having a fat bank balance to splurge on such adornments is a given, of course, considering that prices vary between Rs 12,000 and Rs 5,00,000. 																					ong with the Imagem collection, Silverline Jewellers is also showcasing a breath- taking range of Italian jewellery. Especially eye-catching are the scarf-like chains fashioned from silk and gold, mesh bracelets and hoop chains in a variety of textures and polishes. Price tags here start from about Rs 800 and go up to a couple of lakhs. You could also land yourself some of this jewellery free of cost, if you buy something from the Imagem diamond range.

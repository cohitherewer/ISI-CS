 															- Experts rue loss of communicative skills among humans, despite new-age SMS, e-mail A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A packed house listens to a talk on Bridging the Communication Gap on Monday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Communication is mans glory. No other organism has this privilege. From the way the body is structured  nose, ears, lungs, mouth, tongue, voice box  its all about communication. That is the way we are built. For a child to be articulate, he/she has to be exposed to a wide variety of sounds from a very young age. But, sadly, we are losing that ability, despite new methods like e-mails and SMS. Because we cannot listen.																								And so began a lesson on communication, or the lack thereof, in this age of technology and in a culture that prides itself on its literary works. But the existence of the Vedas and Upanishads is not enough, was the cautionary advice from Vasantha R. Patri, chairperson of the Indian Institute of Counselling, New Delhi, during a programme organised by the Ladies Study Group on Monday, aptly titled Bridging the Communication Gap. Although communication is just transfer of information, the how and what of the message, as well as the intention behind, is important, so be watchful.																								During the presentation, the packed audience listened in agreement as the former teacher of psychology at Lady Shri Ram College explained that from marital breakdown to unrest between countries, it all boils down to communication trouble  either not enough or inadequately conveyed, rendering it ineffective. There are many different forms of communication, verbal and non-verbal, explained Patri. 																								The best way is from neutral to passive, where the information and advice are provided, but the person is allowed to make up his/her own mind. Touch is a very powerful form of communication, particularly with children. When its good touch, its the best way to communicate. But we are losing it slowly, said the psychologist and professional counsellor.																								Be open and sensitive, control your emotions, dont convey contradictory signals, listen carefully without distractions, get the semantics and culture-specific details right, dont avoid tough topics, dont judge or evaluate the speaker, dont put across your prejudices The list was for effective communication is long. The barriers, too, are endless, from standards of living to education levels. The key is to be sensitive and focused, added Patri, as everyone nodded in understanding.

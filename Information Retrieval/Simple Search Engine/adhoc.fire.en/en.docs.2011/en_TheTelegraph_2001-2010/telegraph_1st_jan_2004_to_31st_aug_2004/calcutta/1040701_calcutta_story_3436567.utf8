 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Peoples hero cause of ruin, wail accused kin
 A STAFF REPORTER One of the killer quintet being produced in court on Wednesday. Picture by Amit DattaWhen he was alive, Bapi Sen had made a name for himself as a dutiful policeman who never forgot his responsibilities even after hours. In death, he became a peoples hero. 																								But not for all. On the day of the judgment, when his assailants were held guilty of doing sergeant Bapi Sen to death, he was seen as the man responsible for the doom of five poor families.																								On Wednesday, when Sens family felt relieved to hear judge Basudeb Majumdar of the 12th bench of the city sessions court hold guilty the five Calcutta Police constables  Madhusudan Chakraborty, Pijush Goswami, Sridam Bauri, Mujibur Rehman and Shekhar Mitra  the family and friends of the accused considered the judgment biased and Bapi the cause of the ruin of five young men who are actually innocent. 																								Everyone knew that Bapi Sen was a bully. Today, he is a hero at the cost of these five young men, including my brother, Shekhar. It appears that a section of the police and judiciary were biased on the issue and without a proper trial, these men have been held guilty. We are prepared to go to any length to prove their innocence, said Debasish Mitra.																								Mujiburs father, Keramat Ali, who crouched on the floor behind the courtroom and prayed for his sons well-being during the proceedings, echoed similar sentiments when the judgment was pronounced and was confused when he tried to say that his son had nothing to do with Bapis death.																								I am amazed that Bapi Sens friends could take down the number of the taxi during the scuffle that ensued after he intercepted the vehicle, but could not manage to note down the number of the two-wheeler. I feel the allegation of eve-teasing is baseless, Ali said. 																								According to Ali, the two local security guards, who were present at the court as prime witnesses, said they had tried to blow their whistles on seeing the men fight to draw the attention of the policemen on duty. 																								But the judge did not pay heed when their supervisor mentioned that they were only carrying a lathi. From where did they get a whistle? he asked. 																								Again, why did the taxi driver and his help disappear after the incident, only to reappear after 12 days? Were they scared to bring the charges against these men? Ali wondered.																								The families of the accused, who had come all the way from Behrampore, Balichawk and other corners of Bengal, were worried about their future. 																								Without informing my mother, who has been bedridden since my brothers arrest, I sold off 10 cottahs of farmland to fight the case, said Sheikh Montu Rehman, Mujiburs brother.

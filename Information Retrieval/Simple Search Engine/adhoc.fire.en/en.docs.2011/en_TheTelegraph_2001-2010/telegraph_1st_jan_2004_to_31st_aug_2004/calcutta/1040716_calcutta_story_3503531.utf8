The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Bhajan, tension, cars amp; Lodhas
 OUR BUREAU				 	 A priest leaves Birla Park after the 13th day rituals to mark the passing away of Priyamvada Birla on Thursday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								A studied pause, a quick glance, a hasty salaam and then, the wheels they were a-turning																								As car after car after car rolled in through the imposing gates of Birla Park, a bhajan sandhya on Gurusaday Dutta Road struck a very different chord on Thursday evening.																								If the death of Priyamvada Birla on July 3 had brought a mourning clan together, the ceremony that brought family and friends together, after 13 days, mirrored a mixed mood.																								Though no one was talking about the will, the mood was tense, said a member of the citys business community, who attended the evenings function.																								The man in the middle of it all was, ironically, a non-Birla. Till R.S. Lodha drove into Birla Park, accompanied by son Harsh Vardhan and his wife, the unasked question on every lip was will he come here?																								And after the chartered accountant, to whom Priyamvada Birla has bequeathed the assets of the MP Birla group, entered the Birla home, all eyes were on him.																								All three members of the Lodha family were seen touching the feet of the elders at the gathering, recounted one of the guests.																								With Nandini Nopany  daughter of K.K. Birla playing the real host  the Kanorias, the Bajorias, the Nopanys, the Dagas, the Poddars and the Rungtas turned up in full strength.																								Such functions are attended by all our family members and friends, asserted S.K. Birla, from Birla Park.																								The south Calcutta address has been playing host to most of the strategy meetings over the past 72 hours, attended by even the daughters and sons-in-law of the Birla clan.																								Earlier in the day, employees of all Birla units were handed out prasad specially cooked in the respective offices, offered a man on duty outside the house (along with a host of security guards in khaki and cops in white).																								By the time the clock hands had inched towards 6 pm, the Birla residence appeared  from the outside  to be enveloped in sounds of silence, despite six loudspeakers hanging on the light peach walls.																								Inside, P.D. Jalota was singing passages from the Ramayana to those gathered to pay their respects.																								The nine-ft walls and the tall trees adding another few feet were enough to ward off the world, as the queue of cars stretched from Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) to way beyond the Birla mansion.																								Jalan house ka car andar layen, please. The announcements requesting the cars parked outside to roll back in blared out, justifying the presence of the till-then mute loudspeakers.																								Then, one by one, the cars with their drivers would disappear down the long, winding driveway, only to emerge with family, friends  and the Lodhas.

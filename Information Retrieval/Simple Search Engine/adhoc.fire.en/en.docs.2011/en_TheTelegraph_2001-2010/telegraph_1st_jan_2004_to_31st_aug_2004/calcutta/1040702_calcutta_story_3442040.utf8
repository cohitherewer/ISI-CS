The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 02, 2004 On the wings of a fancy
Having fanned a hobby for 25 years, artist Jatin Das now wants to preserve his 5,000-plus pankhas for posterity, reports Reshmi Sengupta Das shows chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee around at Victoria Memorial. Pictures by Aranya SenSomeone had gifted him an unusual pankha (hand fan) a long time ago. It caught his fancy and fanned in him a deep desire to preserve the remnants of a dying craft. This obsession has been a way of life with Jatin Das for 25 years now.The collection of hand fans has swelled out of the painters hands  and purse  to more than 5,000. From the confines of the trunks (in which the fans are piled over layers of neem leaves) that have hopped from one address to another, the collection made its way to Crafts Museum, Delhi, this May drawing a record number of 4,000 visitors.The treasure trove has now come down to Calcutta, on an invitation from the chief minister, for a month-long display at Victoria Memorial. From here, the exhibition travels to Hyderabad and then London.I would like to hold an exhibition of my paintings in Calcutta next year. I havent shown here for a long time, says Das. A brush with Calcutta is nothing new for this artist who was born in Mayurbhanj, spent his youth in Mumbai and is now settled in New Delhi. The city has helped shape his sensibility, since 1957 when he was a young artist and knew Kinkarda (Ramkinkar Baij) very well. Since when he used to visit Santiniketan every summer where his sister was a student and later a teacher.The city invariably brings with it a whiff of the old haunts, the long addas and the faces that are no more. Shubho Thakur, for instance, who was a close friend and had an exquisite collection of handicrafts, or Shakti Chattopadhyay with whom I have spent many evenings in addas. Or Olympia Bar, where we would often drop in for a drink Das trails off, surrounded by sheaves of papers and last-minute paraphernalia in a spacious room at Great Eastern Hotel.The next moment, he springs to his feet to inquire if the invitation cards for the exhibition have been sent to friends Nabaneeta (Dev Sen) and Chidananda (Dasgupta).Reassured, the talk turns back to the fans. I want to preserve the pankhas for posterity, so that they develop a sense of historicity. Conservation of antiquity is important; it gives an individual his identity, says Das, who has culled his collection from across the Indian sub-continent.The hand fans come in various sizes and shapes, designs and shades, texture and weave with material ranging from leather, cloth, cardboard, feathers and silver to bamboo, grass, roots and palm leaves. The handles are either made of bamboo or light wood. If mirror work, bead work, crochet and embroidery are the specialities of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, eastern India boasts a wide variety of woven bamboo and plaited palm leaves. Several other varieties have been sourced from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Iran and even Africa. If some are meant for domestic use, others adorn temples and ceremonies.Though Das does not have any personal favourites from this large assortment, he is particularly fond of the one made from the bark of a betelnut tree. This fan is from Majuli in Assam.Diplomat Lalit Mansingh brought me a ceremonial leather fan from South Africa, he recollects. The colourful embroidered ones are very eye-catching, but I like the simple ones. Sometimes a Rs-2 fan looks so beautiful.Even the roomy interiors of Victoria Memorial could comfortably hold no more than 611 fans  just a glimpse of what Das has painstakingly gathered over the decades, travelling to remote pockets of the country and digging out indigenous pankhas. I have often knocked on the doors of mud houses and asked the residents to gift me a fan. On several occasions, I have come across rare hospitality, he smiles through his beard.Most of the hand fans are so tattered and fragile that conserving them is a real problem. The imposing Central Hall and the two flanks leading deep into Victoria Memorial are now hot and humid. A few portable fans have been put in place to air the pankhas, which absorb the moisture and tend to crumble quicker. Das is visibly worried about dragging his precious collection across the country and globe. The concern is understandable. For the past four years or so, Das has been researching and documenting the pankhas with a dedicated team. Space has been one persistent problem. The trunks were initially stashed in the artists studio, but with the rising number of fans, he shifted them to a friends garage and now to a rented place.Once through with the world tour, the entire collection will be permanently put up at the Art Centre that is coming up in Bhubaneswar. Building the Art Centre is frankly an indulgence, which gives me a lot of stress. But I am doing this because I am concerned about conservation. I would be happy if 10 more people come forward and build up their own collections, he adds.Das has decided to donate all his collectibles, from pankhas to paintings and books, to the Art Centre Trust.The constant tending to his prized possessions is a drain, financially and emotionally. I have already spent around Rs 30 lakh on it I am tired now, sighs the man with a curious mission.

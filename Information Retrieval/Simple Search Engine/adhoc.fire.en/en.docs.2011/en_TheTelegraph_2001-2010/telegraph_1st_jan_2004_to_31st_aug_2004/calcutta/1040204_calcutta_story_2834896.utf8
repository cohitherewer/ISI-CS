The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Hospitals scurry for holistic healing touch
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sunita Sharma, 42, was suffering from fluctuating blood pressure and asthma for over three years and had tried many modes of medication, without much success. Then she saw Archana Lakhotia, a former Bangalore-based expert in Egyptian healing and spiritual counsellor at her newly-set-up Calcutta centre, where after two months of treatment, Sunita is quot;much better quot;.																								With more and more Calcuttans being drawn towards ayurveda and herbal treatment, big hospitals are queuing up to board the alternative therapy train. AMRI Hospitals, in Dhakuria, has planned a special lifestyle clinic based on the secret therapies of ayurveda. Patients can be treated at the clinic for various chronic ailments, like diabetes, infertility, asthma, cardiac problems and stress, through alternative medicine.																								The special clinic, which will have a cure for all chronic ailments, will start functioning within a month. We decided to incorporate this clinic in our hospital on growing public demand, says Saraj Purokayastha, AMRI director.																								The biggest foray into holistic healthcare has been made by Apollo Gleneagles, with plans of setting up a lifestyle management unit based on ayurveda and herbal treatment. Designed on the lines of a similar unit in Chennai, the healthcare giant plans to tie up with a major hotel group in the city to spread holistic treatment and a health restaurant package.																								Our emphasis will be on improving the quality of life of people suffering from various diseases. The new clinic, which should be ready in a few months, will, hopefully, shed more light on herbal treatment, said Apollo Gleneagles CEO V. Satyanarayana Reddy.																								Alternative medicine expert Pavan Sharma believes the non-toxicity of herbal medicines is one of the main reasons behind the recent leaning towards alternative medicine. 																								From skin problems to cancer and cardiac conditions, herbal treatment has all the answers. It is only now that people are willing to learn more about it, says Sharma, a specialist in ayurveda, who sees 50 patients a day at his private clinic.																								When Archana Lakhotia set up Prithvi with partner Kavita Poddar, she was quite apprehensive. When I left Bangalore and came back to the city of my roots eight months ago, I was unsure how the concept of holistic healing will be accepted in the city. But from five patients a day six months ago to over 20 a day is fairly good progress, says Lakhotia. Patients suffering from depression, asthma and anxiety disorders are the ones heading towards Prithvi.																								Belle Vue Clinic, another private hospital in the city, has also decided to venture into holistic healing by roping in a special instructor all the way from Brunei. K.R.I. Jagdish will be heading a special unit dedicated to yoga, herbal medicine and physiotherapy.																								We will have our own experts to run the show in Calcutta, with Jagdish overseeing the entire programme, says P. Tandon of Belle Vue.																								Another expert, Ashok Jain, says most patients disappointed with conventional medicine turn to alternative forms of treatment. They seek improvement in the quality of life in an established branch of science (ayurveda), he adds.

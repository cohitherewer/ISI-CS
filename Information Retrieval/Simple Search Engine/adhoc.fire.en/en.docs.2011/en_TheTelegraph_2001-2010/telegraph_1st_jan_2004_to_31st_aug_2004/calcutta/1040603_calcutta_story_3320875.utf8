The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 French model for music carnival
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 A brightly lit up Eiffel tower during the Fete de la musique in Paris. 																								Strains of guitar and piano bars interspersed with lilting sax and thumping drums. Jazz and blues to rock n roll, salsa to hip-hop and techno-trance From the streets of Paris to pubs and coffee shops of Calcutta, its one grand carnival, and everyone is invited.																								Alliance Francaise de Calcutta, in association with Calcutta School of Music, The Park and Royal Challenge, is tuning up to unleash World Music Day on the city.																								The kaleidoscope of diverse forms lined up is a take-off on the Fete de la musique, launched in 1982 by the French ministry for culture, with the concept subsequently spreading to other major European cities like Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Istanbul, Liverpool and Rome.																								The date picked was June 21, summer solstice on the Northern Hemisphere. The carnival is traditionally a showcase for new musical trends, which it introduces and expresses. It is a free popular fete, open to any participant (amateur or professional) who wants to perform.																								Calcutta is very much the cultural capital of India and people here are receptive to new ideas. So, we thought rolling out a multi-genre music festival to celebrate World Music Day would be appropriate for the city, says Emmanuelle De Decker, deputy director, cultural affairs, Alliance Francaise de Calcutta.																								So, for music buffs in town, June 21 will unveil itself in a riot of live performances all day long, spilling over to the early hours of the next day. While young rock outfit Cassinis Division kicks off the action at the Atrium during lunchtime, Krosswindz, The Violin Brothers, Anjan Dutt, Orient Express and New Illusion will keep the music flowing till late in the evening.																								The high point of the carnival comes when Ronald Tual, alias DJ Rom, from Paris, takes over the turntables at the Tantra from 10 pm, jamming with Bikram Ghosh on the tabla. 																								The French sultan of electro is an improviser, musician on stage or in the studio and likes to play with sounds under different aesthetics, either solo or accompanied.																								The Fete de la musique provides a common platform for all styles of music and targets the entire population, giving the opportunity to the people to communicate with each other through the music. The musicians perform for free in concert halls, on the streets, in cafes, parks and other public places, explains Decker, who arrived from Paris just two months ago.																								In the Calcutta version of World Music Day, which now involves 120 countries and 250 cities, French students at the Alliance will sing French songs to add to the myriad menu of music. 																								Paresh Sengupta and his group will try their hand at a fusion of Bengali and western jazz sounds, while Abraham Mazumder will conduct a session of western classical and popular songs at La Martinieres Lawrence Hall.																								If Calcuttans really warm up to the concept, we will surely make it an annual affair, and maybe, try and involve other embassies and cultural units, like Max Mueller Bhavan, to add inputs and greater variety to the carnival, assures Decker.

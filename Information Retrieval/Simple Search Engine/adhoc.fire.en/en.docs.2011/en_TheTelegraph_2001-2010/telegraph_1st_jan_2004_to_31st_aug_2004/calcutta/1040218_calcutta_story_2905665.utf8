The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 18, 2004  Calcutta Column

	With elections round the corner, owners of houses located on thoroughfares are concerned over their boundary walls being defaced with graffiti. For most political parties, campaigning begins with sticking posters or writing slogans on walls of residential and commercial establishments. Though strictures have been issued against defacing walls, political parties seem to be most reluctant to go by the rulebook. The party chiefs must impose a code of conduct on their men.

	The authorities concerned did a commendable job by lighting up the stretch connecting the Mayo Road crossing with Chowringhee, near the Press Club. The shortcut route is taken by thousands of people daily after dark. Some unwanted elements frequent the area and the uneven path was proving to be risky for pedestrians. Now that there are streetlights, the path has become a lot safer. We will benefit if the authorities repair the road in front of Press Club as well. 
	Govind Das Dujari, Behala.

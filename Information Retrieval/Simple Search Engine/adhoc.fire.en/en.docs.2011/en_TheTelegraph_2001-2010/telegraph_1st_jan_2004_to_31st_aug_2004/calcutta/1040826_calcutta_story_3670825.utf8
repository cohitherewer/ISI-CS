 Thursday, August 26, 2004 LifeA treat for the tresses The spa, offered by premium salons around town, is the latest luxury for those locks. Smita Roy Chowdhury finds out whyShip ShapeRapunzel never really needed to follow a strict hair-care regimen to maintain her never-ending tresses. Locked up in her tower for years, her hair was never exposed to the dirt and grime that are the primary threats facing the lustrous locks of todays Rapunzels (with far less to let down than the fairytale heroine).Taking proper care of the hair is therefore a necessity now and the salons around town have an active role to play when it comes to pampering the tresses. Almost all premium parlours not only offer solutions to age-old problems like dandruff and hair loss, they even take care of hair that has been damaged due to chemical exposure like colouring and perming. With the range of treatments available now, there are solutions for all hair conditions. In fact, its quite easy to have beautiful shiny hair these days, says Bridgette Jones, hair stylist at June Tomkyns.e hair packs and massages have been around for a while, the latest offering from these beauty clinics is the hair spa. It does to your hair what the regular spa does to the body, with rejuvenation being the password.The hair spa has already become very popular in Calcutta. Though it is quite an expensive treatment, there are women who dont mind splurging on their hair, feels Sabina Yah of Sunflower.The Good Life brings a sample of some of the treatments and therapies that could make bad hair days a thing of the past.Hair spaJune Tomkyns on Ballygunge Circular Road has a Systems Professional spa that can go to your head. It offers five kinds of treatments  for dry hair, stressed-out hair, thin hair, hair loss and dandruff. l the treatments are in-salon and are followed up by home care through the products provided. The client is given six intensive sessions initially, each lasting an hour and 15 minutes, and then the sittings are spaced out depending on the hair scare.When a client comes in with a problem, our expert first diagnoses the condition and recommends the care needed. She is then given a relaxing shampoo massage which is followed by the wellness treatment through special products and steam, says Bridgette.The treatments, she adds, are customised according to the needs of each person. For instance, some women may have combination hair  very oily scalp and dry ends. In such cases, we intermix the products to make suitable potions, she explains.The products used at the spa come in nine different fragrances. One can start feeling the difference right after a single sitting. Your hair gets back the bounce and the shine that get lost due to everyday exposure to the sun and pollution, says Bridgette. Cost: Ranges from Rs 450 to Rs 750, depending on the problem and the length of the hair.The other popular one is the Oreal spa, available at many of the parlours that have tie-ups with the company, like Tressbay in Alipore, Rapunzel in Ballygunge and Sunflower on Russell Street. This one promises to repair sensitised hair that has been streaked, coloured, permed or frequently ironed. It also treats extra dry hair, dandruff problems and hair loss.In this, an ampule of the required serum is mixed with the treatment cream and applied all over the scalp and the hair with a brush. The hair is then steamed for a while, after which it is rinsed off with water. Unlike other packs, the hair is shampooed before the treatment and not after. The process takes between 45 minutes and an hour. This is recommended once a week till the results are satisfactory, after which it is followed up by using the products at home. Cost: Around Rs 500 per sitting. A special monsoon scheme at Sunflower, on till mid-September, offers four sittings for Rs 1,200.Aroma magicThe healing power of fragrance is used to treat ailments like limp and thinning hair, retarded hair growth and dandruff. At Tressbay, the treatment is done through a range of products that are developed in-house. In this, the hair is massaged with serums containing hibiscus gel. It is steamed and given high frequency treatment on the scalp, if required, then washed with hibiscus shampoo and followed up with a similar conditioner.This comes in a package of 10 sittings as the results dont show before that. Says Darshini Sanghvi, aroma therapist at Tressbay, In Calcutta, the bathing water at some places is so bad that it damages the hair. For people living in such areas, it takes around 15 sittings for the aroma treatment to work. Otherwise, it works in eight to 10 sessions. The products, apart from the serum, are given to the clients for home use too. Cost: Rs 5,500 for 10 sittingsHerbal healingThe age-old magic of kitchen ingredients can never be ignored when it comes to looking after the locks. And the salons in the city make full use of them while dealing with hair problems. From eggs, curd and honey to bananas and onions, all these are used in various doses to make packs to treat dandruff, hair loss and thin hair. Other ayurvedic packs like bhringraj and henna are also quite common. Cost: Rs 150 upwards

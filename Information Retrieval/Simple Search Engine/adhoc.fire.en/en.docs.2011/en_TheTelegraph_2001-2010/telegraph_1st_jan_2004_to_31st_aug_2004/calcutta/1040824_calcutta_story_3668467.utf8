The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 On amp; OffScreen On amp; Off

	Bengali girls havent had that much of a representation when it comes to steaming up a music video. The Shefalis and the Deepalis have had a free run. But not anymore. Kamalika Basak (left) has taken it upon herself to make the Bengali brigade go bonkers over whats on display on the small screen. The song in question is Miss Oyi Oyi, a remix of a long-lost Biddu number. 
	The video has been directed by Shashank Dabral, who was a little-known actor on TV. I have written scripts for a lot of films before like Jigar, Ishq and Rishtey. I wanted to go behind the camera and so decided to make music videos. Kamalika and Reva Pujari (the other girl in the video) were chosen after an elaborate screen test.
	 Mumbai-based Kamalika, on her part, is more content with her modelling assignments (she is walking the ramp for the past five years) and does music videos purely out of fun, and with no boundaries in mind. The first video I did was Euphorias Mantra, where I played a Christian girl. Then I did a video for a South Indian band named Seven, where I played a Southern belle. A video a year is fine but thats it. I dont want to make a career out of it and definitely not get into the filmi flow.
	 So this mathematics graduate, whose family lives here in Park Circus, is planning to get into teaching after her modelling career. I have recently done a course on Special Educator and thats what I want to be, announces Kamalika. Tara Sharma: Koko callingShe is a London School of Economics graduate. She worked for one year with Accenture (then called Andersen Consulting). Now, she is in Page 3 and awaiting Amavas. The new face of Garnier, Tara Sharma, is certainly enjoying her sweet little stint in Bollywood. For someone who started out as a dead wife (remember Saaya?), to become the on-screen live wire is certainly a leap forward. And Taras doing that with emphatic elan.Till date, I have mostly played what I choose to call baby roles. Saaya, Om Jai Jagadish, Masti, Bardaasht  but in this industry even a minuscule role can do wonders for you. I had a whole lot more to do in Bardaasht but I have become synonymous with Masti because of its success. However, I wouldnt like to play the just a girlfriend role anymore. Thankfully, the substance and the length of my roles are growing.As is her Calcutta connection. In both her upcoming releases, Tara plays on-screen pal of Konkona Sen Sharma and the bonding has grown far beyond the cut call. Koko and me have become so close in real life, too. Along with Sandy (Sandhya Mridul, the third angle of Page 3), we three had a blast during the shoot and then by sheer coincidence me and Koko played flatmates again in Amavas.Tara is not perturbed with her Page 3 maker making it to page one for the wrong reasons. Madhur is a very good director and is an absolute professional. And he was very decent with all of us, she insists, before going ga-ga over her Amavas director. Debutant Siddharth Srinivas was the most organised of all the directors I have come across till now. The script was in its eighth draft before it got made.The film that Tara is most excited about, though, is Khosla Ka Ghosla. It is a fairly international project and is so different from the typical Bollywood fare. I am the leading lady in the ensemble cast that features Anupam Kher, Boman Irani and Parvin Dabbas. I play Parvins girlfriend, a real chilled-out pushy chick, laughs Tara.Having Konkona as a friend also means that Tara can look forward to a trip to Calcutta soon. I had been there when I was really small  to my uncle and aunts place. Now I have another reason to go there, signs off the rising star. If its not on the cricket or the hockey field, then its on the sets of a reality show. AXN Xtreme: India vs Pakistan Challenge will pit contestants from the subcontinent in a series of challenges that will test the body, mind, spirit and their desire to win. That includes feats like tightening a nut and a bolt inside a box filled with over 1,000 cockroaches!Selections got underway in Mumbai on August 21 (where contestants actually had to pull off the cockroach stunt), followed by New Delhi on August 22.Calcutta and Bangalore selections will be held simultaneously on August 28. A winner from each city in India will make it to the final team. Around 125 aspirants turned up for their shot at fame in Mumbai. Calcutta is expected to have around 200.For Pakistan, though, Karachi will be the sole venue on August 29 and all four finalists from Pakistan. The show is slated to go on air towards the end of this year on AXN.Stage one of the elimination rounds comprises a basic physical challenge where participants perform simple but physically demanding tasks. Stage two is a multi discipline hi-impact challenge where they are tested under more trying conditions  scaling walls, crawling under a 30-inch net and more. Over five hours, they must display diverse skills, shed inhibitions and yet keep their cool.The third and final stage  mental agility and screen friendliness  involves tests by psychoanalysts and a screen test to determine how camera-friendly the contestant is. The ultimate face-off will take place in Taiwan later this year.Kyun! Ho Gaya Na...: Rhyme and reasonThe music industry has formulated a new way to fight piracy. They tried copy-controlled CDs (remember Joggers Park?) but it obviously didnt work. Then they gave away a lot of free CDs to lure the buyers. That also didnt find favour. And so the latest tactic is to attract the Bollywood loyalist by offering special coloured booklets with the CDs.Tips music company has gone ahead and floated this special offer for both their new films Fida and Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... Not only do you get this special booklet with not-seen-before stills from the film, you also get to choose a free CD (from a select Tips CDs, of course) with your buy. But the real draw remains the booklet that even has songs penned on the pages inside. Film-maker Sanjay Gupta is also planning to offer a colourful 48-page booklet with the music CD of his new film Musafir.

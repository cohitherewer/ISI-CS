		 Laura Mishra Laura Mishra																									Is this 20-year-old. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step is the motto Laura lives by, as she inches closer to her goal. Dancing, debating and making music, classical and western, traditional and modern, and, of course, acting  the Loreto College student is a woman of many talents. The aim: graduate with film-making and acting from Film and Television Institute, Pune and build an acting career.																									Has learnt the salsa, cha cha cha, jive, Odissi, and is still strumming her Spanish guitar. A few years of each were enough to earn her multiple laurels at numerous competitions. From Sri Shikshayatan to Frank Anthony, Chinky has been at the fore at inter-school fests, intra-school programmes and other shows, picking up prizes for performances and participation. Not to forget debating and elocution. Came third in a Lions Club district debating convention in 2000, where Laura represented Calcutta.																									From A Midsummer Nights Dream in Class VII to best supporting actress for Cinderella Story in college, the second-year political science student has come a long way -- not by fluke, but a grand design. Sharing the stage with Amrish Puri as part of a Padatik production, Adhe Adhure, in Delhi, was a memorable moment. The former president of the school dramatics club and director of the creative club has gone from the fests stage to the British Council One Act Play contest, from a Proscenium production to groups like Reflections and Theatrecian.																									And busy bee is the Amitabh Bachchan fan, who has also tried her hand at playwriting. Mousetrap, Apollo of Bellac, Harol Pinters Betrayal  some productions the Salt Lake girl has played a part in. The member of the college drama club, however, has not compromised on academics. Came first in Class XI and XII, getting 95 per cent in politics in ISC, and winning several prizes for English. Next up are roles in the Raveena Tandon-starrer Sahib, Biwi, Ghulam and a Hindi serial on Doordarshan.

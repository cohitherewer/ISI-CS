	The fleet of state buses is gradually shrinking, especially in Salt Lake where buses on the routes S-14 and S-16 have become scarce. Commuters have to suffer, thanks to the apathy of the state administration. The transport department should pay more attention to the existing modes of transport instead of day-dreaming about introducing mono-rail and sky rail in the city. Salt Lake residents are disgusted with the state bus service. Will the authorities take serious note of the commmuters woes? 
	Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake. 
	The only fax machine at the Sodepur post office is out of order for the past six months because of which I have been unable to use the Union Money Transfer System. I have not been able to get any cash transferred from my NRI relatives. The only computer at the post office has been rendered useless because of the absence of a computer operator. Authorities should immediately repair the fax machine. 
	S. Guha Roy, Sodepur

 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Removal order for mud on Memorial ground
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Victoria Memorial: Dumped with inundation problem																								Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, which is to give the city flyovers to cross the traffic chaos beneath, is looking at a voluminous problem  all of 3.5 lakh cubic feet  to overcome. 																								The implementing agency for the flyover project has been asked by the high court to remove that quantity of mud which has accumulated near Victoria Memorial since it is upsetting the natural gravitational flow of the storm water channels that drain out rainwater from the monument premises.																								The order from a division bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and S.K. Mitra, follows a petition filed sometime ago by Subhas Datta on behalf of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti. The Memorial authorities were made respondents to the petition. Datta could not be contacted as he was out of station.																								HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee said: We have directed the contractor Larsen amp; Toubro to start removing earth from both sides of the Memorials south gate. About 10,000 truckloads of earth would have to be removed, he pointed out. 																								According to Banerjee, the HRBC had appointed Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) as contractor to build the Rs 171-crore AJC Bose Road flyover. During the construction, a plot of land at the south gate owned by the Memorial, outside its core area, was utilised as a temporary stackyard and dumping site by L amp;T. A huge quantity of earth, removed during excavation, was dumped there.																								The area was also used to stock iron and steel rods, sand, stone-chips, vehicles and machines. We will remove everything from the area, said Banerjee.																								Allowing the dumped earth to stay for years at the site has changed the topographical alignment of the area, resulting in inundation of the Memorial campus after a shower, pointed out curator Chittaranjan Panda.																								Admitting Pandas allegation, Banerjee said as the piling of earth had brought the hall campus and the roads at the same level, run-off water on the Memorial campus failed to flow out. Often pumps had to be pressed into operation.																								The accumulation of water has also turned the campus into a breeding ground for mosquitoes, said employees living there.																								The HRBC, however, would not have to shell out anything extra for the removal of the earth as the charge for clearing debris had been included in the project cost.

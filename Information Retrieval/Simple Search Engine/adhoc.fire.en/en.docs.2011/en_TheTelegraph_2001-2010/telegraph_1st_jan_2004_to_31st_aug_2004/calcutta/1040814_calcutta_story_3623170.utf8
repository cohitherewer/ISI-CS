The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 And the mantle rests on grandson
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY				 	 Nata Mullick: Bow-out after 25th. A Telegraph picture																								When the two men in their twenties entered Alipore Central jail on Friday afternoon, they became part of a family tradition that dates back to pre-Independence. 																								Prakash and Prabhat, two grandsons of 84-year-old Nata Mullick, will not only witness a hanging, but will for the first time assist their grandfather in hanging. 																								The octogenarian hangman, who has pulled the lever at least 24 times in the past, has decided to pass the mantle to his grandson, Prabhat, who has been promised a sweepers job at Alipore Central jail by the government, in exchange of being the hangman.																								I have become old and have very little strength left in me now to pull the lever. So, I have decided that someone from my family must take over my duties. If it has to be my grandson, so be it, Nata Mullick said, minutes before leaving for Alipore jail on Thursday evening.																								For the past year, Nata had been telling the government that he would retire, but with no successor in sight, the government had no choice but to persuade him to execute his duties.																								I always wanted my son Mahadeb to keep the family tradition alive, but he was preoccupied with his job in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Moreover, I found my elder grandson Prabhat very interested in taking up the job, Nata said.																								He taught Prabhat how to tie a knot with the jute rope and he tried out mock hangings with gunny bags. 																								For the past few days, Prabhat had been tense and told his brother Prakash about a strange feeling.																								Grandfather Nata had given Prabhat a pep talk, which seemed to have worked. We only hang somebody who has been proved guilty in a court of law. Hum kabhi kisi nirdosh ko phansi nahi dete hain (We never hang an innocent person), said Prabhat.																								Before leaving for Alipore Central jail on Thursday, Nata gave last-minute tips to Prabhat. At least 20 hours later, Prabhat, along with younger brother Prakash, and other members of the hangmans family  Mahadeb (son) and Raju (nephew)  were moving about Alipore Central jail.																								For the past seven hours, the four family members have been working hard, making last-minute preparations to ensure that nothing goes wrong when Dhananjoy is led to the gallows.																								After visiting the site, the hangmans team began practising at the gallows with sandbags. 																								Prabhat, a keen student, knows exactly what he has to do. Also at hand will be father Mahadeb, who himself took part in the twin hangings in 1991 in the same jail.

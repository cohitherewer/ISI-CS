 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Rating agency for tech institutes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Quantity is one thing, quality quite another. Taking this line a significant step forward, the industry-academia platform on Friday decided to put in place a rating system to assess the private tech institutes mushrooming across the state.																								We are in the process of setting up a task force that will, within three months, prepare an action plan and develop a framework for an independent rating body (along the lines of Crisil), said Roopen Roy, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers.																								This agency will rank engineering colleges and institutes based on the quality of education and infrastructure facilities, added Roy, a member of the CII-Nasscom-steered industry-academia initiative.																								There are 39 private engineering colleges in the state. While industry representatives acknowledged the need for such institutions, they expressed apprehension about the quality of education offered here. This puts a question mark on the job opportunities for students, they warned.																								Such ratings will not only help students assess the viability of enrolling in an institution but also promote competitiveness between institutes, observed Kiran Karnik, president of Nasscom, before clarifying that the apex IT body would not be directly involved in the ranking process. 																								The government, too, should not be involved in the process, the industry felt.																								Stressing the need for quality tech education, Ganesh Natarajan, deputy chairman and managing director of Pune-based Zensar Technologies, said: It is necessary to move on to developing domain skills and not just churning out programmers. This can be achieved only by creating a learning model aligned with the requirements of the industry.																								Zensar already has arrangements with three Pune institutes where students follow the course prescribed by the company.																								Anup Singh, chairman, ITC Infotech, said 260,000 jobs are created through the industry-academia collaboration in the US and that is the way forward for IT and ITES industries.

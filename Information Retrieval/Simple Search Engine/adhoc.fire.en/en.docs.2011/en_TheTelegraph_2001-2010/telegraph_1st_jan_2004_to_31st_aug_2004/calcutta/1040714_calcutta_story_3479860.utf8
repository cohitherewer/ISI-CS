 PATHIK GUHA				 	 Bikash Sinha: Plain-speaking																								Who fits the bill of an intellectual in Bengal today? A boy or a girl in designerwear, sporting unkempt hair, with a jhola slung on the shoulder and waxing eloquent on, well almost, everything under the sun. Postmodernism is pass for him or her, and so is magic realism. Those know-alls, interestingly, have one thing in common. He or she thinks anything but science.																								This cryptic comment became the refrain of the 12th Meghnad Saha Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr Bikash Sinha, director of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), to mark the 70th anniversary of the Indian Science New Association (ISNA) at Rajabazar Science College on Friday.																								Bengal Renaissance in Early 20th Century and Now What and Why? was the title of Sinhas address, and he seemed agitated at times while charting the decline in science and technology in Bengal from those glorious days of Jagadish Chandra Bose, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanabis, Prafulla Chandra Ray, Satyendranath Bose and Meghnad Saha.																								When Albert Einstein completed his General Theory of Relativity in 1916, Sinha said, Satyendranath and Meghnad taught themselves German to read his papers in original. Within four years Meghnad came out with his famous Saha Equation and within another four, Satyendranath his Bose-Einstein Statistics, he commented. While the former deserved one Nobel Prize, the latter, two.																								The British rulers did not encourage scientific studies in India in the early part of the 20th century, for they needed only clerks, and not rational thinkers who would be prone to challenge authority, Sinha said, asking, then how come the Sahas and Boses attained such feats? 																								The answer, he said, lay in the fact that to them, science was an integral part of culture or anything that the Bengal renaissance had to offer. That conviction is simply dead today.																								When did the rot set in? Sinha offered a time-frame of the decline. It was the 1950s and 60s when science got evicted from the arena of culture in Bengal, he said.																								Only singers or litterateurs qualified to be intellectuals. This is not what the Sahas and Boses had bargained for.																								According to Sinha, this was also the time when the elitism inculcated by Lord Cornwalis finally gave way to an abject mediocrity. 																								Blaming others for all our failures became a virtue. And, as a corollary, the nothing-happens-here syndrome set in.																								That syndrome, Sinha argued, still dominates the psyche of a majority of Bengalis who do not realise individual scientific brilliance is still there in ample measure and, collectively, that can again bear dazzling fruits. 																								Lets get over that debilitating syndrome, said Sinha. Its time we got back our lost pride. Renaissance is dead. Long live renaissance.

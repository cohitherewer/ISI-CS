 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Student forced to quit room in hostel
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state leadership of the SFI, the CPM students wing, on Monday met health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra to complain about how Suman Mandal, a fourth-year student at Medical College and Hospital, was forced to vacate his room at BC Roy Hostel by the Chhatra Parishad-controlled students union of the college.																								SFI state president Sudip Sengupta on Monday told a press conference that Suman had refused to work for the Congress-dominated students wing.																								The college authorities, too, had asked his elder brother, Santanu, a fifth-year MBBS student, to move out of his room at BC Roy Hostel, reportedly under pressure from the Chhatra Parishad.																								Suman, present at the press conference, held at the SFI headquarters, said he had lodged an FIR at Bowbazar police station on May 29 as Chhatra Parishad leaders at the college threatened to throw me from the second-floor roof of the hostel. 																								Mandal alleged that Chhatra Parishad leaders had asked him to pay a fine of Rs 500 to the students organisation for his refusal to work for it.																								Sengupta demanded the removal of the offending Chhatra Parishad leaders. 																								The health minister assured us he will look into our allegations and initiate measures against the errant Chhatra Parishad leaders, he added. 																								The Mandal brothers live in remote Chaksrikrishnapur, under Sankrail police station, in Howrah district. Suman on Monday alleged that Chhatra Parishad leaders had phoned his parents on May 28 and had threatened them with dire consequences. They, too, lodged an FIR with the local police station.																								Suman was nominated by Chhatra Parishad to contest the students union poll at the medical college and also got elected. 																								He alleged he had been forced to contest the poll and had recently protested some of his seniors misdeeds. Medical College principal Jayasree Mitra said she was getting the matter probed.

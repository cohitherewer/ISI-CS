 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE																								If a scroll on your cable channel requests you to cooperate with a market survey, you know that its finally time for a murky trade to get transparent. Or so the local cable industry would have you believe.																								In a first, city multi-system operators (MSOs) are conducting market surveys to measure connectivity numbers. The objective is three-fold: streamlining efforts, restoring credibility and consumer trust and boosting declaration.																								Door-to-door or otherwise, the surveys intend to keep it simple, finding out only whether a household has a cable connection and which operator is providing it.																								Whats in it for the consumer? In the short run, maybe not much. But in the longer run, it could help clean up an industry invading every home (case in point: RPG Netcom recently shortlisted 26 operators, asking them to raise their declarations by as much as 600 per cent in some cases) and bring about a uniformity of tariff and treatment.																								For market leader RPG Netcom  with around 60 per cent share in the CMDA area  its a continuation of its efforts towards streamlining the market. The MSO has conducted test projects in Behala, Madhyamgram and Lake Gardens and plans to cover other areas, including Salt Lake.																								SitiCable, too, is drawing up plans for a survey in its streets of strength. We have approached some reputed private agencies and would shortly be finalising one, said a joint-venture partner of SitiCable. The project is supposed to start by August and will take at least three months to complete for the MSO, with around seven per cent share of the CMDA area.																								RPG Netcom is using a combination of CESC bill, voter list and Calcutta Telephones subscriber list to determine figures. In cases where numbers dont tally, we are conducting door-to-door surveys by agencies, said a spokesperson for the MSO. We are also asking operators to voluntarily disclose and most of them have been very cooperative.																								Another MSO, CableComm, however, feels a market survey isnt the solution and a more realistic view with greater grassroots operator involvement must be taken.																								Broadcasters arent opposed to the idea either. If it benefits the industry and means better numbers for us, wed gladly share the cost, said the city representative of an entertainment bouquet. If its a success, other metros will follow Calcuttas model, he added.

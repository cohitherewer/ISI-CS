				 	ANGANA ROY CHOWDHURY																									Angana Roy Chowdhury																									Is the motto of this 19-year-old. Trekking is part of her Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme (now known as the International Award for Young People, IAYP), but its the passion for adventure that keeps her seeking higher peaks to scale. The finance student of Shivanath Shastri College has trekked far and wide, from West Bengal to the UK.																									And enthusiasm in her spirit has Mam, as she is known to her family. Starting from Class VIII, Angy  to her friends  has been trekking to Susunia, Ayodhya, Lava Lolegaon, Sandakphu and more. In 2002, she was part of the IAYP exchange trip to the UK, where she did canoeing, rafting, rock climbing and, of course, trekking. 																									Might still be some distance away, but the ex-South Point student was part of the school team that trekked to the base camp in Nepal as part of the golden jubilee celebrations. Her highest achievements till date remain Kalapathar 5,550 m and Everest Base Camp 5,364 m, but plans are to go higher.																									Angana is a pro in both. Rock climbing is another activity that gets the Scorpios adrenaline going, and she has done courses at Matha Buru organised by the Institute of Climbers and Nature Lovers. She was also in the school rowing team, and took part in the inter-school regatta competition organised by Lake Club in 2001. 																									The Rabindrasangeet fan is, too. Having started learning kathak at age four in a neighbourhood dance school, she has now reached level four. In 1999, she took it up as a serious pursuit, and is now a student of Madhumita Roy, who is herself a disciple of Pt Birju Maharaj. Angana was a regular on the school stage during cultural programmes, and plans to continue with kathak.																									Are what all her hobbies give her. But the career girl wants to be a chartered accountant soon. The bookworm and movie buffs favourite subject is accountancy, so shes on the right track to her future.

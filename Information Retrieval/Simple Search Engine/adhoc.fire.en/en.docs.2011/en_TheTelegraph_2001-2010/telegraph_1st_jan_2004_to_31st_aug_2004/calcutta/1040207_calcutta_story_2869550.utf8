 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Motive mystery baffles cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It was a murder with a twist, one that remains hidden from the policemens probing eyes even 24 hours after blood splattered the Santro seats late on Thursday.																								From the information gleaned by investigators so far, the murder of 25-year-old Shambhu Choudhury was not a simple case of extortion killing. Nor was it, at least apparently, one of vendetta.																								There was talk of money exchanging hands, yet it was not a case of a pay-off gone wrong. The killers seemed to be professionals, yet some of their actions showed a lack of professionalism.																								At the end of the day, police pronounced their preliminary verdict: this was a case camouflaged in serious contradictions.																								For starters, police  according to what the driver of the car had narrated  said the killers were demanding money from Choudhury. They did snatch a gold chain, the cellphone, cash from his wallet and a gold ring. But there was never any talk of Choudhury having failed to make a promised payment.																								If that was the case, what was the need to kill Choudhury after having robbed him?																								Apparently, Choudhury had promised them that if they set him free, he would pay them a hefty sum. That should have been enough inducement for the killers to let him off, in the hope of receiving a large sum of money from him.																								The killers could even have abducted Choudhury, in which case the ransom money would, in all probability, have been theirs for the asking.																								Instead, after taking a few valuables from Choudhury they not only shot him through the head from point-blank range, killing him instantly, but also slit his throat, as if they had an old score to settle with the victim.																								But this was not the case, at least if what the driver has told the cops is true. At no point during the drive from Rabindra Sarani to Canal West Road did the assailants mention anything about any old dispute or business rivalry. The only thing they asked for was money.																								What has left police even more puzzled is why the driver was not touched. Apparently, they were professional killers, quite used to wielding the gun and the knives. But in not harming the driver, they have left behind a witness who can easily identify them. This, police say, is not the way professional killers operate. They ensure that the trail runs dry for investigators.																								On the other hand, the presence of a .9mm cartridge at the site of the murder suggests a professional strike. Police feel the only way the strange behaviour of the killers can be explained is that they were from outside the state and were confident that they could get away before the cops got on their trail.																								From what we have gathered so far, it does not seem to be a killing linked to extortion, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) H.P. Singh. The motive seems quite intriguing.

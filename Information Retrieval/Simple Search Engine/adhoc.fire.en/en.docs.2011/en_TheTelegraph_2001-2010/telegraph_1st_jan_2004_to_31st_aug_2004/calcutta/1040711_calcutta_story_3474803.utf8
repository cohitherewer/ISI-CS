The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Club SandwitchSixty-seven per cent of CEOs from Fortune 500 companies feel they should play golf to become good CEOs. British doctors are prescribing golf as definitive stress-buster therapy. Even the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regime now acknowledges the fairways potential to foster friendship that could translate into investment on the ground.But are todays Calcutta corporates clued in? Innovations must be the order of the day to keep the countrys oldest merchants golf meet going. From a clinic and a putting event for the ladies to prizes for being closest to the pin and the longest drive. Lucky dips in the evening to Krosswindz at the prize gala  the Merchants Cup golf competition is keen to reinvent to reach out to a wider audience.There was a time in the Seventies when the tournament really rocked. Putting together six golfers was easy for all the teams and till 10-15 years back, there would be 90-100 teams in the fray, says Brandon DSouza, president, Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), and tournament director. By contrast, companies today struggle to field even four golfers.The tournament provides a great opportunity for corporate networking. However, unlike in some other cities like Delhi and Bangalore, golf is not as popular here anymore. Besides, many corporate firms have shifted their headquarters out of town, laments Ashit Luthra, captain of Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the cradle of the event for over 100 years.So, course colossuses like five-time national champion Vikramjit Singh, Ashok Malik and Manjit Singh dont stride the greens in their numbers these days, while Hindustan Lever and Assam Company, diehards at the merchants meet for years, are conspicuous by their absence. Even ITC could stitch together just one outfit for the four rounds of open-format scratch strokeplay competition.Bunny Lakshman Singh, one of the remaining titans of the tournament along with Alan Singh and a few others, agrees that corporate participation has dwindled since offices have shrunk in the city. Singh feels it is essential to try and get more people to play by creating more interest and making the tourney more fun, without diluting the norms of Merchants Cup.DSouza agrees novelty should complement norms and is working on a new format for next year in conjunction with the club and the tournament committee. Its critical to get non-golfers interested and so we could have two genuine golfers as the main merchants and invite four non-golfers to come along. We can hold some clinics during the course of the meet to give them a basic feel of hitting, chipping and putting, suggests DSouza.TSMs top line: Todays execs need to know that golf is not an old mans game, not as easy as it looks and provides great exercise in 45 minutes.

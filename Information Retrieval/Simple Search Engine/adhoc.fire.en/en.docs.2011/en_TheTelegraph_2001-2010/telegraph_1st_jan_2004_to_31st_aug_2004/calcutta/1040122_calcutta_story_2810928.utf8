																								The very mention of South India conjures images of brightly-clad ladies with lovely gajras of fragnant flowers, the aroma of freshly-ground coffee beans, rasam, idlis and vadaas. The list could just go on. The culture and literary heritage of the Deccan region comprising the four states  Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala  are very rich and enviable indeed. Swabhumi hosts a six-day South Indian Festival to acquaint the people of the eastern region with the flavours of the South. The festival explores and showcases every aspect of the southern region including its textile, craft, cuisine, ayurvedic medicines and cultural performances. The textiles on display include natural fibre products, sarees from different parts of the South including Ikkat, Gadwal, Mangalgiri, Venkatagiri, Pochampalli, Kanjeevaram, Narayanpet and many more. Crafts like Tanjore paintings, silver filigree and the likes share space with authentic cuisine, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The festival will be inaugurated by the Indian National Army (INA) stalwart, Captain Laxmi Sehgal, and social activist Subhashini Ali, today at 4 pm.

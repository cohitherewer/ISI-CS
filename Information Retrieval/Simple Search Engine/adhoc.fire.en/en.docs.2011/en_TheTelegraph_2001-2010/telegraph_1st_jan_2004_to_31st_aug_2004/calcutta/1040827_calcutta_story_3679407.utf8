 Friday, August 27, 2004 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... You are fiercely independent and possess incredible will-power. Good luck marks your money matters. You have a creative bent of mind. Children and animals are close to your heart. You are magnanimous by nature. You are witty and a clever conversationalist. Avoid making enemies.  Kusum Bhandari

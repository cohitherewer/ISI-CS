The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Food link in canine deaths
 																											- Carcinogen in dog diet blamed for 12 fatalities, suit slapped SANJAY MANDAL																								Watch before you feed your precious pet dog food off the rack.																								An animal welfare organisation has taken the multinational manufacturer of a popular brand of dog food to the consumer court, after 12 canines under its care died, allegedly after consuming it.																								Pugmarks Society for Conservation of Natural Heritage, an animal welfare organisation, has filed a case with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, South 24-Parganas, against Effem India Ltd, manufacturers of Pedigree Dry Food, and its agency here. Pugmarks has claimed a compensation of Rs 19 lakh.																								Effem India officials refused comment. We are yet to get any details of the case. We cannot comment unless we see what the issue is, Vikas Mittal, head, corporate affairs, Effem India, told Metro from Hyderabad.																								In her petition, Pugmarks secretary Urmila Ganguly said the 12 dogs  five Dobermans, three Labradors, two Bassets and a couple of strays  died at the societys Calcutta and Santiniketan centres between January 8 and March 12.																								If the food is not properly preserved, it can cause bacteria to form in the food. This, in turn, can lead to bacterial infection that can even cause death, said veterinary expert Deepak De. I would suggest that the food be first put into boiling milk before being fed to the dog, he added.																								According to a society spokesperson, the dogs had been consuming Pedigree Dry Food for the past two-and-a-half years without a health hitch. The first whiff of something going wrong came when Momo, a three-year-old female Labrador, came down with a choking cough, started passing yellow urine and black stool, lost her appetite and suffered convulsions. Soon, the other dogs, too, started showing symptoms of liver damage.																								Following the string of deaths, Pugmarks members traced one common factor between the kennels in Calcutta and Santiniketan  the dog food.																								Initially, we could not understand the cause of the deaths. Later, we suspected that the source could be the Pedigree dog food, said secretary Ganguly.																								The society then sent the dry food for analysis to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Mycotoxin and Proximate Analysis Laboratory, in Belgachhia.																								The tests revealed the presence of a dangerously high level of Aflatoxin B, Ganguly said in the petition. Aflatoxin B has been classified as a Group 1 human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Its presence in foodstuff can raise the risk of liver cancer in humans.

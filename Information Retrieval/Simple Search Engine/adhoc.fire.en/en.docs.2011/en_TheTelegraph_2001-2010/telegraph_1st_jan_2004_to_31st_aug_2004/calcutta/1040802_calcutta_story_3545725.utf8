Picture by Amit Datta																								 The Atrium Caf, the 24-hour coffee shop at The Park (that seems to be more popular these days for its girlie band in the evenings rather than the fare), has rolled out a new menu. Revamped once every quarter, some of the popular items are usually retained, and new additions are also rustled up by executive chef Shaun Kenworthy.																								The new spread takes in a range of culinary styles, from Continental to American, tandoori to Bengali, and also throws in a taste of street food from various parts of India.																								To begin with, the range of soups, appetisers and salads is pretty wide, of which the Greek Salad and Golden Fried Butterfly Prawns with Sweet Chilli Dip are the pick. You can also sample the Fried Corn Tortillas filled with Asparagus, Jack Cheese and Jalapeno, Portuguese Seafood Uttapam with Piri Piri Peppers.																								In the soups, the Mexican-style Lamb Minestrone Soup and the Spicy Chicken Broth with Mushrooms, Lemon Grass, Galangal and Cilantro are recommended.																								Theres an entire section devoted to pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, wraps and hotdogs. The pizzas come with a variety of toppings such as corn, capers, olives, asparagus, pepperoni, jalapeno, ham, tuna and chicken tikka. The obvious picks in the burger section would be the Crumbed Chicken Burger in toasted bun with shredded lettuce and mayo and the Spicy Veg Burger with green salsa, spicy potato skins and salad. 																								The pasta section spoils for choice, including Pasta in Sardinian Style with Smoked Sausage and Tomato, Pasta with Shredded Duck, Artichokes, Red Chilli and Lemon and the Pasta with Morel and Porcini Mushrooms, Spinach and Ricotta. Bengali and tandoori fare also feature on the new menu, with the favourites among them being The Atrium 5 Spice Oriental Tikka and the Spicy Beef Pasanda Kebab.																								For the first time, a separate section of snacks will be available between 3.30 pm and 6.30 pm everyday. This includes treats like chaats and other street snacks like Jhal Muri, Aloo Kabli and Hot Spicy Sam-osa Chaat. This apart, snacks available through the day are options like Chicken Tikka Chaat and Pizza Chips.																								The desserts at Atrium are always special and the chef now offers some innovative sinful delights like the Atrium Dessert Pizza, the New York Style Cookies and Cream Cheesecake. For those in search of a desi ending, pop picks are Mishti Doi with Fresh Mango and the popular Mutka Coolfi.																								 Here is the perfect itinerary for a lazy, laid-back Sunday afternoon. If Saturday-night partying forces you to laze around in bed till noon, try out La Terrasse, the cosy coffee shop at The Oberoi Grand. A Sunday brunch is on offer, sure to wake anyone up, keeping them busy hopping between table and buffet.																								A breakfast and lunch spread pampers every palate. It might be murder for those whose eyes are bigger than their tummies: there are 25 kinds of desserts alone.																								The breakfast spread includes cereal, fruit, breads, ham, bacon and the works. Move onto the range of starters, sipping a glass of sparkling white wine, which comes with the brunch. Head then for soup, and a whole range of cold and fresh salad.																								The guests can choose their own breakfast, starters and salads from the buffet counter, but when it comes to the main course, one will have to order from a long list of dishes, explained executive chef George K. George. And though one helping of a main course is enough for an adult, the finicky can try two or three options before settling for a dish of their choice. 																								The buffet has been priced at Rs 675, inclusive of taxes.																								lBack to basics is the name of the game at Indus Valley, the multi-cuisine restaurant near Park Circus. The restaurant which had stopped cooking up south Indian fare has returned to one of its mainstays.																								We had to stop due to our heavy work load, but we have been flooded with inquiries about when we will start off one of the most sought after sections again, explains Neerja Nopany, who started the place in November 2002.																								Making their way back are items like Onion Rava Dosa, Cheese Dosa and the standard idlis and vadas. For an innovative touch, try out their customised dosas instead. We came up with this concept to cater to individual preferences. You can choose different toppings like tomato, cheese, onion, corn or chillies, all for Rs 50, adds the owner.																								Also a hit are the special thalis for busy executives. The power meals include quite a spread, like the Shahi Non-veg Thali, which has rice, butter naan, Chicken Tikka, Daal Indus, Matar Paneer, salad, Raita, a soft drink and ice cream. School students get a discount of 10 per cent on producing their identity cards. 																								lThe idea of Sunday lunch with platefuls of hilsa while cruising down the Hooghly is what drew 100-odd guests, among whom was Gopal Mukherjee, mayor of the Howrah Municipal Corporation, to the opening day of Ilish Utsav on Bhojtori, a 200-seater launch, on Sunday afternoon.																								This water vessel will, from now on, take Calcuttans on Sunday getaways with maach, music, and masti. Sailing out of the Fairley jetty at noon, the four-hour trip promises to keep you occupied not just with a great ilish buffet, but also live music by a Bangla band. 																								On the inaugural trip, the menu, tossed up by speciality Bengali chef Chakradhar Panigrahi took off with Ilish Maach Bhaja and Ilisher Tel and went on to Ilish Matha Diye Chhechra, Ilish Paturi and Ilisher Malaikari. Plain rice and dal seemed only incidental. Chatni and mishti doi, both integral to a Sunday lunch, rounded off the sumptuous meal.																								With a band of young Bengali musicians who call themselves Jajabar belting out a mix of hit Bangla numbers and their self-composed pieces, the mood aboard grew lighter as the launch inched away from the jetty. By the time the vessel waved goodbye to Howrah bridge, the mood had become one of unstoppable camaraderie.																								With peppy numbers like Jibone Ki Pabo Na renting the air, the unused space on the launch doubled as a dance floor.																								We have kept Bangla music for the afternoon do in keeping with the Bengali theme, but we have also organised for DJ music and Mughlai food for the evenings, said Pulak Bardhan, the man behind the event. The second trip starts at 6 pm and ends at 10 pm and is essentially targeted at the younger crowd. The cost per person for both the trips inclusive of the food is Rs 300.																								 Hilsa is indeed the prime offering of the season, what with almost all leading restaurants dishing out hilsa delicacies at the drop of a hat, notwithstanding the poor catch this year. The latest to fall in line is Kalash, the Indian restaurant at The HHI, hosting Ilshegurir Ilish.																								The idea was to keep well-known preparations on the menu so even those who havent tasted hilsa before would get a fair idea of how the fish is cooked and eaten, said executive chef Utpal Mondal, who has included traditional favourites like Sorshe Ilish and Ilish Maach Bhaaja. 																								For the more adventurous there is the Smoked Hilsa Marinated in Lime Juice and Black Pepper, cooked in a smoke chamber on a bed of sawdust. But the taste of this dish is truly Indian and does not have a Continental flavour, stressed the chef.																								A helping priced at Rs 225 comes with plain rice and two pieces of the fish. Other specials to savour are Ilish Maacher Paturi and Bhapa Ilish. Both of these options are boneless and are perfect for the first-time eater scared of negotiating the small bones, said Mondal. The hilsa shower will continue till the rains last at Kalash.

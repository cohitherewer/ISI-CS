The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 Life - Passing Through				 Always a bahu 
Raveena on the sets with a child artiste. Picture by Aranya Sen 																								Its hard to catch Raveena Tandon in casuals these days. The chhoti bahu in Sri Bimal Mitras Sahib Biwi Ghulam spends the better part of her time draped in flashy cotton saris, true Bengali-style, at the Tollygunge studios.																								And post-marriage, the girl they love to call Ravs has become even more mast.																								Marriage has given me a different sense of security. I am much more happy and content now, as if half my tensions have vanished, gushes the recently-wed, fresh after a month-long break from work, with a honeymoon in the Maldives, Malaysia and Indonesia thrown in.																								The March schedule for the Sahara Manoranjan TV serial being shot in Calcutta will hold Raveena back for a fortnight from husband Anil Thadani and her in-laws.																								I hate to be away from home for a long time. Fifteen years in the film industry have passed in a flash and I would like to slow down on signing films now. I could not attend my friends weddings; I could not give as much time as I wanted to my family. Now I would like to do all that, reveals Raveena.																								Besides, family has always topped my priority list. The bond has become even stronger after marriage, ever since I started living with Anils parents. Many people cringe at the thought, but for me it was a natural choice, she adds.																								The tight shooting roster has left the star with little time for sight-seeing or shopping in Calcutta. During her earlier stay in January, Raveena had only managed to squeeze in a trip to jewellers Satram Das  from where she picked up some stuff for her bridal trousseau  and designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who too contributed to her long pre-wedding pick-up list.																								This time, though, Raveena is planning a trip to Kalighat and Dakshineswar. In her hotel room, a pile of childrens films is also vying for the attention of the Childrens Film Society of India chairperson, a role that Raveena is all too happy to play.																								Adding to that is a bunch of VCDs of Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak classics, which she wants to watch in her free time.																								Ghataks Ajantrik is just outstanding. I personally like experimental films, and not always the feel-good ones, says the actress who rates Aks, Daman and Shool among her best.																								Back in Bollywood, Raveena has to catch up with the dubbing of Kundan Shahs comedy, then shoot for Aan. But no hip-swinging roles for this shahar ki ladki anymore. Theres a time and an age for everything. I want to do what suits my personality, is her assertion, draped most appropriately in a thick red-bordered cream cotton sari.																								For the time being, Raveena Tandon Thadani is happy playing chhoti bahu at the Technicians Studio and the lead role in the daily soap at her new home.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

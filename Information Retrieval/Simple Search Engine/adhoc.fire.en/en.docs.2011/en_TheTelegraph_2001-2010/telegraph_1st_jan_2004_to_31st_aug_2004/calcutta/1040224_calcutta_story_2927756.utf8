 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Sensuousness in art
Chittrovanu Mazumdar is hailed as one of the most enterprising painters India has nurtured over the last couple of decades. In him we have an artist who interprets artistic licence to best suit his temperament as a painter. His work is characterised by an inimitable sense of quest and is steeped in an intense sensuality which has an endearing appeal that is hard to ignore. Mazumdars paintings are expressions of the pulsating world, screened through a sensitive sieve that reproduces images caught in the minds eye but refrains from schoolish elucidation. And therein lies the mystery that surrounds his work. Here is an artist who refuses to offer any clarifications, thus probing into the deepest abyss of the human heart and urging it to feel his art.																								Event: Chittrovanu Mazumdars new work																								When: Till February 29; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: UMA, 2/4A Sarat Bose Road

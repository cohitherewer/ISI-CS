The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Wrong to rob right of access
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should public access to sites housing heritage artefacts be restricted to once a week?				 In hand... but not the real thing: A replica of the Nobel Sayan Banerjee, 
																		Belgachhia																																																														The idea is absurd. Of course visitors are not burglars. Neither are they a hindrance to the imposition of security measures at the site. It is true that some burglars come in the guise of visitors. Therefore security measures should be taken. 									

Tanmoy Ghosh, 
																		S.M. Nagar Housing Estate																																																														Prevention is better than cure. Its unfair to restrict people from seeing heritage artefacts by lessening the visiting days. It will be better if we try to create an atmosphere which will invite more visitors. Tourists are not a matter of concern, security is. 									

Arijit Ghosh, 
																		Shyamnagar																																																														I dont think it would be justifiable to restrict visitors who are really interested in seeing our national treasures. Why should all suffer due to the mischief done by some miscreants? Instead, security should be tightened with closed-circuit cameras installed for a strict vigil. 									

Gunjeet S. Wadhwa, 
																		Rai Bahadur Road																																																														The sites housing heritage artefacts should be accessible to the public through the week. Such restrictions should not be encouraged as it would affect the tourism industry. Opening such sites only once a week would clearly mean that the state is not equipped to protect its treasures. Instead, private security agencies should be deployed to keep an eye round-the-clock. 									

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 
																		Arabinda Nagar 																																																														Heritage artefacts are public property and the public  be they rich or poor  have the right of access to them. These should be open to view on all days with a reasonable entry fee, which is necessary for proper maintenance. However, for the benefit of the poor, a day of the week may be set aside for subsidised tickets. 									

Satyen Biswas,
																		Behala																																																														We should have taken precautions to pre-empt the Santiniketan incident long back. Security should be increased everywhere and a stock book should be maintained after weekly checking.									

Naren Sen, 
																		Ramrajatola																																																														The very purpose of displaying historical objects would be defeated if the artefacts are kept under lock and key for fear of theft. Closed-circuit cameras and metal detectors should be installed instead. Security personnel should also man all the gates. People do not want a repeat of the Santiniketan episode.									

Kanai Saha, 
																		Gauri Bari Lane																																																														Ridiculous. Sites housing heritage artefacts should be kept open on all days. These sites are sources of revenue for the government. At least a part of the maintenance cost can be recovered through the entry fees. But stringent security checks must be ensured to prevent theft. 									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge																																																														Tourists flock to museums and heritage sites to quench their thirst for knowledge about our past. The Mona Lisa was stolen and recovered later. Security has since been beefed up at the Louvre museum in Paris but visitors are not restricted to particular days of the week. In Frankfurts leather museum, visitors are monitored by closed-circuit cameras. Therefore, modern devices can be used to protect rare and valuable artefacts. 									

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 
																		Hooghly																																																														Places of tourist interest such as museums, mausoleums, temples and zoological gardens should remain open on all days. As it is, the Centres decision of hiking entry fees to the Taj Mahal for foreigners has compelled us to hang our heads in shame. On one hand, we mint money in this manner and on the other, we talk of restricting access to the heritage sites!									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane 																																																														I do not approve of the idea. It is not possible for visitors from other states to wait for a particular day to visit heritage sites. As an alternative, the government can introduce special security schemes for structures of national importance to ensure that thefts do not take place. The existing security arrangements at museums, even at the privately-owned ones, should be scrutinised from time to time. 									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park 																																																														No. The cure for a headache is not beheading the patient. Why should the public be deprived of viewing the artefacts just to prevent burglaries? Reducing public access to archives cannot stop a determined goon from carrying out his misdeed. Rather, it is the security arrangement that should be made foolproof. 									

Biman Saha,
																		Lake Town 																																																														Restriction of access to heritage sites is not a solution to the problem. This will only disappoint those who wish to visit the sites. The move would also result in a loss of revenue for the authorities. The employees and the security personnel at the heritage sites should be held accountable for the maintenance of the assets. Thefts at such sites are usually not possible without the aid of insiders. 									

Saadia Sitwat, 
																		Linton Street																																																														Absolutely. The recent theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal was a shock. What is the guarantee that such incidents will not recur? Perhaps, more stringent security measures are needed. 									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 
																		Entally																																																														Public access to sites should not be restricted. Instead, security should be tightened to eliminate chances of any untoward incident. Restrictions can be justified immediately after a theft at a site, but it should not be a long-standing arrangement. Security should be improved instead.									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
																		Behala																																																														Why should people be denied the opportunity to see heritage artefacts? If the site is open only once a week, there is bound to be a rush which the authorities would find difficult to manage. However, some restrictions should be imposed. Entry tickets is an option as is ensuring a safe distance of the visitors from the artefacts. 									

ronita dutta, 
																		Jadavpur																																																														Sufficient vigil is the answer, not restriction of entry.									

H.M. Jain, 
																		Lake Town																																																														Such a restriction would create more opportunities for miscreants to do away with the mementoes. Moreover, tourists would lose interest in sight-seeing. If the guards had not failed in their duty, these assets would never been harmed in any way.

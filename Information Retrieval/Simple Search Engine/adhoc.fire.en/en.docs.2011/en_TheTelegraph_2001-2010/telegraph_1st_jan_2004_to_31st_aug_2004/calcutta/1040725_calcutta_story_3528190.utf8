Victor BanerjeeAtal Bihari Vajpayee may have taaloed in his parsimonious approach towards Gujarat, his apostolic association in Goa, of violence with Muslims, his sophistic announcement to renounce active politics and all the other flip-flops that the Press and the nation have grown weary of. The fact remains, however, that there were two issues he remained atal over. Dtente with Pakistan and Angelone Robertas Il Forno. He was a visionary.Subconsciously, Atalji read the menu on the wall and saw the Italian coming. Not to be caught completely off-guard, as the rest of the nation was, he privately worked hard to remould his appetite to accept spaghetti bolegnesa, chicken and mushroom lasagna and pizzas while reluctantly spurning rotis for Italian bread. Thats where Angelone comes in. That reminds me.Years ago, waiting for bombs to fall on our heads, St. Edmunds, my school, had been evacuated of all but 16 of us senior Cambridge examinees. India was under siege and Assam had to find a solution, and fast. Heres what we were confidentially told, actually happened. In a strategic move that still stands as an outstanding example of innovative advertising, marketing and business management, the Chinese had turned back from Bomdila, near Tezpur, when the government of Assam hurriedly put up billboards all along its borders. The billboards pro- claimed a simple slogan: Yat ahiley bhaat khabo lagibo ! It was Assams last line of defence against the droves of yellow-skinned invaders. Translated loosely, the slogan said, If you come here, you will be forced to eat more rice. It worked. The Chinese had no intention of invading a land where they would be forced to eat the same stuff they were sick of eating all their lives. The Peoples Army turned back. No one believed Krishna Menon when he claimed to have thought up the rice slogan. He was sacked.Vajpayee: slice of ItalyLets get back to Ataljis tryst with Angelone. He knew from history that Hitler wasnt German, Napoleon wasnt French and Sonia wasnt Indian. Boy, did 2+2 add up to changes in history books! Our then Prime Minister shot off to Manali. His security men giggled and stumbled through clouds of marijuana smoke exhaled by young Israelis who had fled to bliss from their wars with Palestine and surrounded a little Italian restaurant that everyone of political and celluloid repute and taint had visited, and made famous. Angelone Robertas Il Forno.Here is a summary of what Atalji and his entire family ate, while black cats frisked waiters, chefs, customers and passersby and the security staff gobbled everything on the menu to test if it might be laced with arsenic or cyanide. While those who had tasted the parmesanaic eggplants puked, our dear chiantified and wobbly leader gorged on pizzas, pastas, lasagnas, salads, roast potatoes, Italian bread and chocolate cake. All of them. Age and Italian food can often combine to cause dementia. As he stepped out into the Himachali chill, all our Prime Minister remembered was the chocolate cake. As he left the restaurant he mumbled, characteristically, reeking of garlic over the heads of his starving bodyguards: Chocolate cake ka jawaab nahin.Now I, unfortunately, still havent had a chance to join the list of notables who have visited Il Forno. But I had a wily mother-in-law who pinched the worlds best recipe for chocolate cake from her innocent granddaughter, Priya, and shoved it into her book of recipes that I inherited and whose rights I am fighting over with my wife and sister-in-law, Jyoti. By the way, Sonia hasnt been to the restaurant either.She has, however, heard about my chocolate cake and also my Spaghetti Vongole, made from the clams and mussels of Bengals shaowlafied pukurs. It rivals anything she could eat under the smokescreen of Vesuvio, in Napoli. Frankly, if it werent for the tight security on the street where I live, Sonia would have been gormandising on my swadeshi Bisque and my Bangla clam sauce, long before she made it to the top of the charts last month.By the way, Atalji, if you ever read this column, as Soniaji undoubtedly will, this plagiarised recipe of my mum-in-laws chocolate cake, is just for you. And, May the force be with you  remember the other popular Star Wars sir?Ingredients: Refined flour 1  cups, cocoa 2  tbsp, baking soda 1  tsp, sugar 1 cup, butter (softened) 1 cup, eggs (at room temp) 2, milk 1 cup, vinegar 1 tbspMethod: Pre-heat oven to 350 F. Grease the baking tray with a little butter and dust with flour. Set aside. Combine refined flour, cocoa and baking soda. Sieve three times. Heat the milk to lukewarm. Add the vinegar and stir till curdled. In a mixing bowl combine the sugar and butter. Whisk well till mixture is light and creamy. Stir the eggs in one by one. Add the vanilla essence. Add the flour mixture and the curdled milk a little at a time and continue stirring to a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the baking tray and cook in the oven for 45 minutes. To check if the cake is done, insert a fork in the centre, it should come out clean. Turn the cake out onto a plate or wire rack and cool before icing. Bon Apetito !

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Relay sprint duo with Olympic flame aloft
 NISHA LAHIRIAnkita Sancheti: Dream come true Sangeet Shirodkar: Connecting people																								Theyre young, theyre talented and they have what it takes to be the torchbearers. Literally. For, this June, the two Calcutta school kids will be running across Delhi, Olympic torch in hand, as part of the worldwide torchbearers relay, before the flame arrives in Athens for the opening ceremony of the XXVIII Olympic Games.																								The torch, lit at the destination of the 2004 Games, will travel around the world, before arriving back at its point of origin. And for the first time in the history of the Games, India is part of the Torch Relay.																								Two of the 42 runners  and seven escorts  from the country are Sangeet Shirodkar and Ankita Sancheti, both Class XII students from city schools. On June 10, they will each run 200 m with the torch, as it journeys for 35 days, through 33 cities in 26 countries, on foot, car, aeroplane, train, ship, bicycle and other more unconventional modes of transport, like a camels back.																								Its the Mount Everest of sporting events, so its a dream come true for me, smiles Ankita, a budding athlete. The student of Modern High School is an ace runner, apart from trying her hand at other track-and-field events like long jump and hurdles. The house captain is thrilled at the prospect of being a part of the momentous event.																								The 12 city students chosen after a series of preliminaries  essay and drawing competitions as well as school nominations  held by Coca-Cola, were put through rigorous interview sessions by a panel of six judges, including theatre personality Sohag Sen, top cop Soumen Mitra and corporate leaders.																								It wasnt really difficult, but there were some pretty tough questions on topical issues and obscure facts, says Sangeet. They just wanted to find out what kind of people we are, and what we do. What the Apeejay School student  a key member of TTIS and a regular contributor to Young Metro  finds cool is the fact that they will get a formal appointment letter, signed and sealed by the president of the International Olympics Committee.																								Of course, being one of 10,000 torchbearers from around the world does have its appeal, adds the youth representative of ECPAT International and Unicef. Its about connecting people, adds Sangeet.																								Although neither youngster is a stranger to being in the spotlight  if Ankita met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in February, Sangeet is a multiple-winner at The Telegraph School Awards  this one is special. And theyll both be watching the lighting of the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium in Athens, on August 13, from their south Calcutta homes, knowing they did their 400 m bit to get the flame there.

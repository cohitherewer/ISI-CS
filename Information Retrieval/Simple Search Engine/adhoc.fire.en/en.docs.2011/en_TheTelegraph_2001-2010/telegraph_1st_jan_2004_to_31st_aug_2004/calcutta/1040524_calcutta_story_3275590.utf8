The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Its cooler now to make trips on Metro
 SANJAY MANDAL																								As the mercury shoots up, more and more commuters are going underground and the Metro Railway authorities are gearing up to raise comfort levels.																								There is a significant rise in the number of passengers and this is mainly due to the rising temperature, a senior Metro Rail officer said on Friday. 																								Gruelling heat apart, the Metro authorities attempt to overhaul air-conditioning systems at various platforms and installation of state-of-the art air ventilation techniques have succeeded in attracting passengers. 																								We have replaced old air-conditioning plants at Esplanade, Park Street and Maidan stations and there are plans to replace plants in other stations, too, said Vinod Kumar, general manager of Metro Railway. 																								In the past four days, the hottest so far, more than 1.1 million people travelled by the Metro, against 776,000 in the same period last year. The average number of passengers this week is 275,000 per day, more than the average 247,000 per day for the year 2003-2004. 																								On May 17 this year, the number of passengers was recorded at 313,000. On the same date last year, the figure was 207,000 lakh. On May 18, there were 267,000 passengers travelling by the Metro, compared to a mere 39,000 on this date last year. However, that being a Sunday, the figure was significantly low. On May 19 and 20, 264,000 and 260,000 passengers travelled by the tube.																								To make travelling more comfortable, major projects, worth more than Rs 18 crore, are being implemented to replace air-conditioning plants at various stations. Apart from Esplanade, Park Street and Maidan, where temperatures have been brought down considerably, cooling plants are scheduled to be replaced at Rabindra Sadan and Netaji Bhavan stations. 																								All these plants are more than 10 years old. They were not functioning properly. So, they need to be replaced, a Metro official explained. 																								In a Rs 1.14-crore project, the air-conditioning plants at Jatin Das Park, Kalighat and Rabindra Sarobar are undergoing major repairs. By June, these platforms will be cooler than before, the official said. The air- cooling plants between Chandni Chowk and Belgachhia being new, need not be replaced, he added.

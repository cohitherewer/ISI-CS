The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Sweat it out, scorchers ahead
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTA scorching sun, accompanied by a dry, hot wind blowing in from the west, singed the city on Friday.																								And there is little respite in sight, with weather officials warning that the sweltering heat will continue for at least the next two days. The satellite pictures at the Alipore weather office on Friday showed not a trace of cloud cover.																								There is absolutely no wind coming in from the sea. The wind we are receiving is from the land and so, it is dry and hot. We dont find any immediate indication of relief, in terms of a Norwester or rain, in the next couple of days, said K.K. Chakraborty, director of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore.																								The city recorded a maximum temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, a degree above normal. The minimum temperature, too, recorded early in the morning was two degrees above normal, at 27.2 degrees.																								Officials said a dry hot wind has been sweeping the city at 18 kph to 20 kph over the past few days. In the coastal areas, the wind speed is higher  45 kph to 50 kph  leading the Met office to send out a warning for fishermen in the high seas.																								We would have received a Norwester, or at least a thunderstorm, had this wind changed course and blown into the city from the sea, bringing in moisture and clouds, said an official.																								According to Chakraborty, there are at least a dozen Norwesters, on an average, between March and May. The present hot condition is not unusual at this time of the year. We just need the conditions that will bring in a Norwester We have several Norwesters to come, he said.																								If the maximum temperature in Calcutta has been hovering between 35 degrees and 37 degrees over the past few days, in Midnapore, Burdwan, Behrampore, Bankura and Santiniketan, the maximum temperature has crossed the 40 degrees Celsius mark and is steadily creeping up.

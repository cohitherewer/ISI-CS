The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Mercury plumbs the minuses
 																											- Fog cover blocks sun rays, wind at 10 kph gives city the shivers OUR BUREAU																								Sunday gave Calcutta the shivers. The maximum temperature plummeted to 18.2 degrees Celsius, a full nine degrees below normal. 																								And the minimum temperature got into the act, dipping to 11.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, making it the coldest day of the season so far. At Dum Dum, the minimum temperature was pegged at 10.7 degrees.																								The cold wave  by city standards  claimed a life, that of an unidentified man in his late sixties, near Dhakuria bridge, police said.																								According to the Alipore Meteorological Office, two factors contributed to the freezing cold felt throughout the day. The haze in the sky created by the fog rose in the morning, not allowing much sunlight to penetrate. As a result, the maximum temperature dropped dramatically.																								With virtually no strong sunshine hitting the land in Calcutta and its adjoining areas, the day temperature could not rise. Also, the wind was blowing in at a speed of five to 10 kph from the north. The combined effect was felt by the city, an official said.																								In the morning, the Met office thought the weather conditions would leave an official mark as a cold day. Had the maximum temperature dipped two degrees further, Sunday would have been declared a cold day, said an official.																								In meteorological parlance, if during winter the maximum temperature dips to 16 degrees or below, the day is officially declared cold. We are not ruling out such a condition occurring in the next few days, he added.																								As for the minimum temperature, Sundays recording was a good three degrees below that of January 4, 2003. On this day last year, the minimum temperature was 14.4 degrees Celsius. This year, we are facing a more severe winter because of the prevailing cold wave in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, said an official.																								The North Wind was blowing in unhindered on Sunday. The satellite picture showed a clear sky over Calcutta, Bihar and Jharkhand, allowing the North Wind to blow swifter than in the past few days, pointed out the weathermen.																								Officials at Alipore predicted cold and foggy conditions prevailing for at least the next two days, with the minimum temperature around 10 degrees Celsius.																								At the airport, the Jet Airways flight to Delhi was delayed by about two hours and the Indian Airlines flight from Delhi arrived an hour late.  At Howrah station, the Geetanjali  Express (seven hours), Poorva (five hours), Kalka Mail (two-and-a-half  hours) and Amritsar Mail (11 hours) led the list of trains  running late, while at Sealdah, the New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani  Express was three-and-a-half hours behind schedule.

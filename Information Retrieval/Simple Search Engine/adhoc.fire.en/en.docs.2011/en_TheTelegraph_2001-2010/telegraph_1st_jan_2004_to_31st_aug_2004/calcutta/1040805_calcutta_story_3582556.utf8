 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Law may not play avenger 
 A STAFF REPORTERAparna Sen																								The Presidents rejection of Dhananjoy Chatterjees mercy plea has drawn flak from a section of intellectuals and rights organisations.I feel bad, not for Dhananjoy, but for the punishment he has been accorded, said filmmaker Aparna Sen. The death penaltys eye-for-an-eye justice can never solve problems. Punishment should be beneficial, not vengeful in spirit, she added.																								Writer-activist Mahasveta Devi opposes capital punishment in principle, as it erases all scope for reformation.																								Social activist Maitreyee Chatterjee expressed shock at the verdict. But it would have been difficult for the President to ignore pressure from the Union and state governments, she added.																								Rights organisations were more vocal in their protest on Wednesday. This ends the virtual moratorium on execution. It opens the floodgates, with 40 people on death row in the country, said a spokesperson for the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights. The association is also exploring legal options.																								Kiriti Ray of Masoom (Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha) felt the chief minister sent the wrong message with his pro-death penalty campaign. With the highest number of lynch cases in Bengal, the state shouldnt advocate reciprocation of one violent act with another, he said.

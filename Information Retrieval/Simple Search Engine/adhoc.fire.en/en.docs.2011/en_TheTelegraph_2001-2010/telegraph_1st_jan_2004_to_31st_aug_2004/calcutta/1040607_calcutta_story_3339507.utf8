The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 07, 2004 Rack razzmatazz, catchment key
First Day First Show Shoppers Stop abuzz at the inauguration of City Centre on Sunday. Picture by Aranya SenThe Calcutta customer is modern and in sync with global benchmarks, yet has a firm grounding in ethnic and cultural roots quintessentially Bengal. The learning curve at Forum over the past 15 months has instilled a quiet confidence in Shoppers Stop as Indias premier retail chain rolls out its second anchor outlet in town.This is the first time we are venturing into an out-and-out residential catchment, and there is an obvious element of risk. But, at the same time, we are optimistic about our City Centre store, where the shopping experience will be very different from Elgin Road, observes B.S. Nagesh, customer care associate, managing director and CEO, Shoppers Stop Ltd.Better customer connect is the fulcrum on which the Rs 4-billion chain is hoping to swing business at its 15th outlet. The feedback from Forum is significant, but Shoppers is keen to look ahead. Yes, we believe in heeding lessons from the past, but at the same time, it is important to prepare the customer for the future, and we have set out to do just that at City Centre and our next store at South City, Nagesh stresses.The 52,000-sq-ft shopping stadium (coined to convey the size as well as the proximity to the Salt Lake stadium) with its extensive use of metal and the bright interiors by Royal Sporting House of Singapore, exudes a truly international feel. Shoppers is the only Indian member of IGDS (Intercontinental Group of Department Stores) alongside major world players like Selfridges and Karstadt.Not just looks, Shoppers II also promises to pack a brand punch to match the Lamcy Plazas (Dubai) and the Takashimayas (Tokyo) in rack razzmatazz. And the focus is not just on apparel.Clothes alone dont drive international fashion anymore. So, we will have a greater thrust on accessories and add-ons in the Salt Lake store, points out Sanjay Badhe, customer care associate and director, operations.Designer sunglasses from Dolce amp; Gabbana and Gucci and international skincare and cosmetics from the houses of Clarins and Shiseido for the first time in Calcutta will be just some of the exclusive options.With more than 250 brands across apparel, colour cosmetics, fragrances, footwear and leather, personal accessories, fashion and fine jewellery, home collection, kitchenware and accessories, the store hopes to offer something for every basket.Included in the product-mix are Shoppers in-house brands Stop (an umbrella label with apparel, accessories and home products), Life (a casual youth brand), Kashish (premium ethnicwear), Vettorio Fratini (premium mens apparel) and DIY (ready-to-stitch salwar-kameez for women). The Salt Lake store also has an exclusive First Citizen Lounge for members, a Javed Habib salon, an infants corner and a childrens playpen.Internationally, a mall of this size needs around 50,000 households within a 5 km radius to sustain itself. We are looking at the captive catchment to make things happen. In City Centre, the developers and architect Charles Correa have created a magical mixed-use property. We all have a role to play to ensure it becomes the special destination it is meant to, says Nagesh.SUBHRO SAHA

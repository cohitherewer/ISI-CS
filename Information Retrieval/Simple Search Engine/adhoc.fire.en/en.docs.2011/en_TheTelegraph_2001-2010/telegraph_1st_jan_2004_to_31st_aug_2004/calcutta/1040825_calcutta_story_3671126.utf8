 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Stomach ache saves fit Avtar
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After headaches and chest pain, it was acute abdominal pain that saved the day for Avtar Singh at SSKM Hospital on Tuesday evening.																								In hospital for the past week for suspected neurological ailments, Singh, husband of athlete-turned-MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, has been complaining of one ailment after the other.																								About to be released from hospital after a medical board found him fit during the day, Singh clutched on to his stomach and said he could not bear the pain. 																								You cant release me in this condition, he implored the doctors around 7 pm. The documents pertaining to his release were ready and a police team had already arrived to take the high-profile prisoner back for interrogation to Barrackpore sub-jail. But, with Singh writhing in pain the SSKM authorities decided not to let him go. 																								There was no way we could release him without finding out what was wrong. If anything happens to the undertrial in police custody, we will eventually be held responsible. We will keep him under observation and release him on Wednesday, said a doctor. 																								Subsequently, the police team left and Singh was back in his cabin. 																								Ever since Singh was referred to SSKM, the government has been drawing flak from all quarters. Complaints about favouring an undertrial just because he happens to be an MPs husband, and questions on the reasons for keeping him in Woodburn ward, usually reserved for VIPs, had prompted the authorities to shift him to a secluded ward of the hospital on Sunday night. 																								Even on Sunday evening, while Singh was being shifted, he complained of illnesses and requested the hospital staff to allow him to stay on in Woodburn ward itself. 																								But with Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss scheduled visit to the hospital, the state government did not take any chances.																								On Tuesday, a medical board constituted by the hospital went through his test reports and found Singh more or less fit to be released. 																								But with Singh refusing to cooperate, the SSKM authorities had no choice but to keep Singh in the hospital.

 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Soilful etchings
																								In her current exhibition of paintings, Mausumi Mutsuddi explores the variety that can be etched out of the essential simplicity of the soil that nurtures life forms on earth. It is this selfsame simplicity, that characterises Mother Earth, that is conceptualised as a young woman with an immeasurable richness about her being. This female figure, born out of the soil, with the elementary characteristics of nature wedded harmoniously into her very essence, is Bishuna. Mutsuddi has chosen to glorify this aspect of the woman, an aspect which may be apparently invisible but is an indispensable fraction of every woman irrespective of how modern or sophisticated she may be. Mati or the soil is likened in Mutsuddis art to the quintessential woman, more so when she is alone, helpless, stripped of her finesse and hence closest to the elements.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings by Dr Mausumi Mutsuddi																								When: Till March 15 (except Sunday); 10 am - 7 pm (weekdays) amp; 10 am - 3 pm (Saturday)																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 12F Park Street

 															- Computers for local children, literacy for young married women SUBHRO SAHA																								A world-ready education aimed at moulding students into future leaders to computer literacy-cum-spoken/basic English courses for the neighbourhood. The Cambridge School (TCS), near the Hazra intersection, the first in Calcutta affiliated to the University of Cambridge, has stepped into its second year of existence with some fresh initiatives and new goals.																								While we are obviously excited about the new scholarships we have introduced and the adult literacy programme planned, the computer education classes for students of the locality will be a significant addition to our bouquet, observes principal Nonda Chatterjee. The aim of the courses, to be started along with other extra-curricular activities, is to provide hands-on experience and inculcate basic keyboard and Word skills. 																								Since this requires some knowledge of English, we will work in both areas simultaneously and ensure that computers form an essential component of the basic English course, Chatterjee adds.																								The six-week course will kick off with 20 students (aged 10-12) to whom these services are not available in their schools. The tutors will be students of TCS at AS/A2 levels. Materials for the course, including computers, will be provided by TCS.																								The institutions adult literacy programme has been designed to educate young married women, not only in basic English and mathematics, but also in hygiene, childcare, nutrition and family planning. The idea is to inculcate social and environmental awareness, develop a sense of self-worth and suggest avenues of employment, explains Sarojesh C. Mukerjee, managing trustee.																								The Churchill Scholarship in humanities, the Keynes Scholarship in business studies and the Nehru Scholarship in sciences were all introduced during the first year and each winner will have his/her academic fees waived for a year.																								The schools science lab was recognised by the British Council Library (BCL) as an examination centre for all Cambridge students. TCS also got a plaque from Cambridge University through BCL, certifying it has met all norms. Delegations from Tadworth School and Warwick University visited the city school to offer tips to TCS students on university lifestyle in the UK.																								Its a most fulfilling experience for us all to create something like this from scratch, and we are glad to see that students are really enjoying the analytical method of learning we profess, Chatterjee smiles. While French has been incorporated as part of the school curriculum, psychology is being mulled as a subject for grades XI and XII.																								The computer classes will be held at a nearby address (6, Andul Raj Road), and the management is scouting for a second campus, preferably with a play area before the session commencing June 2005. Till now, we have been able to keep all our promises. Now, we would like to expand the school downwards, may be till Class V, since it would give us more time to better orient the students towards our special method, which encourages a questioning spirit, says Mukerjee.

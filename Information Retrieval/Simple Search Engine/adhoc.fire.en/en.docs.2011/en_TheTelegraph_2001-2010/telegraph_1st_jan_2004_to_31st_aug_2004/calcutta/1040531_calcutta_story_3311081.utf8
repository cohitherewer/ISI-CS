 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Snag windfall for ATM cards
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE				 	 At an SBI ATM on Sunday evening: Balancing act. Picture by Amit Datta																								Case I: Hiren Sarkar, a retired employee of the postal department, went to withdraw money from an SBI ATM in Baguiati on May 16. He punched the buttons to know his balance, and bingo, his balance showed Rs 20, 550 (Rs 18,550 more than what he had anticipated). He withdrew Rs 4,000  Rs 2,000 more than the balance going by his books  and informed his branch accordingly.																								Case II: S.Bhattacharya, a state government employee, went to an SBI ATM on Biplabi Anukul Chandra Street, last Thursday, at 3.05 pm, to withdraw Rs 400, and was shocked to be told that he did not have the requisite fund. He tried again and the screen flashed a balance of Rs 2,674.44, but withdrawing Rs 400 proved a no-no, again. Back home in Baguiati, at 10.52 pm, he tried his luck at an ATM. Balance, Rs 4,950.56; withdrawal of Rs 400, allowed!																								Sarkar and Bhattacharya are two among an average of 50 to 60 customers, according to SBI sources, complaining about bank balance problems cropping up while using their ATM cards.																								A.K. Pattanayek, assistant general manager, ATM, at the SBI head office for the Bengal Circle on Kiron Shankar Roy Road, admitted: We have received complaints from our customers about anomalies in their bank balances. We cannot explain the phenomenon immediately but we are carrying out an inquiry into the complaints.																								Pattanayek added that he had contacted the SBI switch centre (the office that controls the entire ATM operations in the country) in Gurgaon for a possible solution to the problem.																								Our switch centre told me that such a problem may have arisen out of an anomaly in the positive balance file (PBF), he suggested, before going on to explain how the computerised file coordinates the actual balance of the customer with the ATM transactions.																								SBI officials, however, pointed out that even if there is an unexplained additional fund in someones bank account  going by whats flashing on the ATM screen  withdrawal beyond the actual balance limit would still amount to fraud.																								Early this year, a customer of SBIs Ramrajatala branch in Howrah, while checking his balance at an ATM in the same area, found that he had Rs 60,000 more than expected in his account. He withdrew the money from the machine, only to fall foul of the bank.																								The matter is with police, but the customer is yet to return the additional money withdrawn.

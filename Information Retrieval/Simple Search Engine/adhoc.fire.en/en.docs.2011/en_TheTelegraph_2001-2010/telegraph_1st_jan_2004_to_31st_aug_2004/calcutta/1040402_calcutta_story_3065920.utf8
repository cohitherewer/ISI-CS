 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Stamp paper racket
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The Howrah district court complex has turned into a hotbed of black-marketeers selling stamp papers at a premium.																								Senior government officials claim that to date, no specific allegation has been recorded. But a visit to the spot will reveal the real picture: stamp papers worth Rs 10 each are sold here for Rs 15 and sometimes, even Rs 20.																								Animesh Bhattacharya visited the court last week for an affidavit. He alleged he had to pay Rs 5 more for a Rs-10 stamp paper. 																								When I approached a vendor, he told me first that stamp papers of that denomination were not in stock. Later, when he realised the urgency of my need and that I was ready to pay a little extra, he whipped out the stamp paper. Such things are happening daily and the authorities cannot deny their awareness of it, Bhattacharya said. 																								Admitting that a racket prevails, some lawyers of the court said a nexus exists between the vendors and officials of the district collectorate, who get a heavy amount from the vendors as commission for bulk purchases.																								Lawyer Tafzil Ahmed, however, alleged that only vendors have the licence to sell stamp papers on the court premises and taking advantage of that, they often create an artificial scarcity to earn a little extra.																								Another lawyer, Sujit Kumar Chatterjee, said: There is always a heavy demand for stamp papers of Rs-10 denomination. It is required for affidavits, declarations, agreements and other legal procedures. So, vendors sell them at a higher price to the litigants in need.																								When contacted, additional district magistrate (judicial) Amal Das said no formal complaint had been received against the registered stamp vendors of Howrah court. We will investigate the matter, but the victims must also lodge a complaint in writing, he said.

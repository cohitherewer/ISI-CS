The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Ravi Shastri. You are dogmatic and precise, and uncompromising at times. You may turn a leisure interest into a full-time job. For you, all shades of red, white, grey and purple. You devote a lot of attention to personal needs, goals and wishes. This year gives you time for introspection, as also for examining where you have come so far and where you want to go.  Kusum Bhandari

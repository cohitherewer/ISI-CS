The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Admission scurry at campus gates
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A day after the Higher Secondary (HS) 2004 results were declared, campuses in Calcutta shifted into admission overdrive.																								The rush started from Wednesday morning, and continued till afternoon, with anxious students and guardians queuing up to collect forms and clear doubts.																								At Lady Brabourne College, the guard outside seemed exhausted even before the gates opened, repeating requests to candidates to come later, when the college would open.																								As the day progressed, most institutions had to deal with serpentine queues. The steady stream of students dwindled only late in the afternoon, and the sales counters wound up services around 5 pm.																								Day I form-sale estimates from various colleges are: Presidency College: 2,400 Lady Brabourne College: 2,000 Asutosh College: 3,200 Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society: 5,300																								Park Street was without its usual admission bustle, with St Xaviers College having gone online with its paperwork. 																								Hopeful CBSE and ISC students have been able to access forms online (at www.sxccal.edu) for some time, even as other city colleges waited for the HS results to be announced to decide their admission criteria.																								The last date for online application at St Xaviers is August 7. Students without Internet access can use the colleges cyber facilities to download forms between July 30 and August 7, excluding July 31.																								Loreto College had a notice posted near the main gate that disappointed prospective candidates for the time being, declaring that forms would be available from Thursday, the last date for submission being August 5.																								Students who thronged the campuses were mostly from non-HS boards, like the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the Central Board of Secondary Education. A number of candidates from the Northeast were also doing the rounds.																								It has been a long wait for us. Most of our friends, who did not study in HS schools, chose to seek admission in colleges in other cities, like Delhi and Bangalore, where the admissions were over a month ago, said Dichen Lama, from Vidya Vikas Academy, Darjeeling. 																								Apart from the wide range of subjects on offer, availability of hostel accommodation was also a major concern for the outstation students.Forms are being sold at roughly between Rs 15 and Rs 50. They are available against original marksheets, to ensure that the candidates meet cut-off requirement, and HS admit cards, for proof of age.

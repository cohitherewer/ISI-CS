The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 A sultan plays Good Samaritan at girls school he attended
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								In the Hindi heartland, every Bengali-speaking man is hailed as Dada , which of course stands for elder brother in Bengali. The word has an entirely different connotation in Hindi language though, in which a Dada stands for the local tough . 																								Whatever be the connotation, however, Subroto Roy Sahara, the unusual chairman of an even more unusual Sahara Group of companies, is undoubtedly the dada of dadas  to cricketers, film stars, chief ministers and industrialists. 																								Tough he is and not new to controversy, either. He has also raised the hackles of environmentalists in Bangladesh and West Bengal with his promise to transform the Sunderbans into a global tourist destination. 																								But given his success in having his way in Amby Valley, near Mumbai, it may not be presumptuous to think that he will find a way here, too.																								Reputation of his deep pockets has preceded his visits to the city. Every time he comes calling, therefore, various organisations and people pay court to him, hoping against hope that they would be able to sell their ideas or projects to the man. More often than not, he refuses to loosen his purse strings, though. To a city-based organisation which wanted him to finance the construction of a building on five acres of land, he had bluntly replied that the plot was too small for him to bother! 																								In this backdrop, a quiet brotherly act of his in the city deserves mention. The man remains such an enigma that half the people are sure to hail it as typical of the man while the other half will emphatically declare that the act is totally out of character!																								Manishankar Mukhopadhyay, the writer, was not surprised though. Arguably Shankar, whose book on Roy has sold a staggering 17 thousand copies, knows the man better, having spent several days talking to him. 																								It was Shankars quest for the most successful Bengali entrepreneur that had taken him to Roy, who claims to preside over a Rs 32-thousand-crore empire and employ more than seven lakh people. 																								On the last day of my stay, in fact, when I was about to step into the car, recalls Shankar, in desperation I asked him if he ever had even the faintest connection with Calcutta. Roy, a little amused, shrugged and informed that he and his elder sister had studied in a Calcutta school for a few months. It was a girls school but boys, too, were then admitted to preparatory classes. He remembered the name of the school and the address. The information found a place in Shankars writing. The school on Beadon Street found no trace of records half a century old but got in touch with the writer and, subsequently, with Roy himself. 																								The school did not want a donation. They just wanted details. Roy not only wrote back with the details but promised to visit the school on his next visit to the city. He kept his word. Shankar, who was present, recalls that the tycoon, in his brief address to the students, declared that although the school had not asked him for anything, he on his own was handing over a cheque for Rs 21 lakh so that necessary repairs could be carried out in the building. Whats more, for the next 10 years, he offered to pay Rs 1,000 each every month to 20 girls, selected not only on the basis of their academic records but also on their liveliness and extra-curricular activities.																								Somewhat uncharacteristically, Roy did not seek or arrange any publicity of his largesse  possibly because that would have prompted a chain reaction of phuchka-wallahs and others claiming to have nursed or fed him here. 																								Shankar, a perceptive writer, sees shades of both Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and characters of Sarat Chandra in Roy. There are others who see shades of Chengiz Khan. An intriguing mix of power, pelf, paternalism and patriotism is how a contemporary had described the man a few years ago. Its possibly time for experts at IIM-C to undertake a serious study of his management style and HRD philosophy. Is he the good Samaritan or is he the Sultan ?

 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Fast after assault rerun in NRS 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Junior doctors of Nilratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital went on an indefinite hunger strike after a section of the group-D staff assaulted a few doctors in front of the hospital superintendents office on Monday morning (picture on P19).																								The incident was a sequel to Sundays fracas, when a group attacked the new house-staff quarters of the hospital, following a protest by doctors against liquor sales from the hostel.																								At around 10 am, a house-staff member, Sourav Dutta, was about to enter the hospital premises when some group-D staff members abused him. I entered the phone booth inside the hospital and they pulled me out and threatened me, Dutta said.																								He alleged that around 40 people, most of them outsiders, dared him to protest against the sale of liquor in the hostel mess. 																								Dutta and some other house-staff members then went to the superintendents office to brief him about the incident. But the goons followed them and assaulted and abused them in front of the office.																								There was a scuffle outside my office, but I am not sure who assaulted whom, said Basanta Khan, NRS superintendent.																								Later, around noon, the junior doctors staged a partial ceasework and commenced the indefinite hunger strike, demanding arrest of the culprits. 																								We complained to the police on Sunday evening after we were attacked but no action was taken, said one of the house-staff members.																								The college council of NRS held an emergency meeting on Monday to resolve the issue. After the meeting, the doctors withdrew their ceasework but decided to continue with the hunger strike. Chittaranjan Maity, director of medical education, said a team has been formed to keep a check on the physical condition of these doctors.																								The college council has asked the police to ensure that there is no untoward incident on the hospital premises, said NRS deputy superintendent Dilip Kumar Jha.																								The Junior Doctors Council has submitted a memorandum to the NRS authorities to stop illegal sale of liquor on the hospital campus. And the Medical Service Centre has demanded that the culprits be punished immediately. State-run hospitals have become dens of vice but the authorities are doing nothing, claimed state secretary Bijnan Bera.

 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Chase nets gang of nine
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A group of nine armed dacoits, sitting in a playground in the Patharghata area of Rajarhat new township, possibly working out the details of their next burglary, was caught by surprise when the police arrived. 																								The dacoits, between 20 and 25 years, were arrested. 																								Gang leaders Uttam Naskar and Aminuddin Gazi, police said, are wanted in several cases, while the others were new in the gang. 																								Officials of Rajarhat police station, on a tip-off, went to the playground to find the armed men. No one would suspect that they were planning out their next burglary. They seemed to be having a quiet chat, said Ananda Sarkar, officer-in-charge (OC) of Rajarhat thana. 																								When challenged by the police, all the miscreants tried to flee. A chase followed, in which all nine were netted. Most of the miscreants were armed.																								The gang has been operating in Rajarhat and the adjoining areas, like Habra, Patharghata and Jatragachhi, for the past few years, OC Sarkar said. 																								Their targets were the construction sites, from where they made off with huge quantities of building materials. 																								A country-made pistol, 12 bombs, 14 daggers, four swords and some .303 bullets were recovered from them.

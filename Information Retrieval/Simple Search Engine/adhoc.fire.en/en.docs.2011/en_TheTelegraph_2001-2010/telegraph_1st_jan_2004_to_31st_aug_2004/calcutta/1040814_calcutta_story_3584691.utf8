 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 Sagar Hazra and Chandan Paik at work. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Sagar Hazra is in Class XI, in Sanat RoyChowdhury Institution, a school in Tangra. 																								A first division pass in Madhyamik 2004 was not an uncommon feat, but for Sagar, it was truly an achievement. He lives in a one-room house in a slum in Tangra, along with three sisters and his parents. His father is a sweeper and his mother a housewife. 																								For this student, 536 was the reward of hours of hard work, perseverance and concentration  the family doesnt have electricity, and the morning begins with fetching water from a nearby pump.																								Help came in the form of Hriday Akash, an NGO in the area begun by a teacher of the school, Bashab Chatterjee.																								With support from a few others like Shankar Sarkar and Pannalal Chakraborty, Sagar hopes to become a mathematics teacher some day. After school, I go to Hriday Akash or Pannalal Chakrabortys home later in the evening to study, he says. I prefer to work at night rather than in the morning, so light is a problem.																								Although he is no stranger to hard work, Sagar has his parents assistance, and in fact, their insistence. My father is a cleaner in the Tangra branch of a bank. But he makes my mother stay at home to make sure my sisters study properly, he adds.																								Another student of the Sanat RoyChowdhury Institution who has prospects of a bright future with help from Hriday Akash is Chandan Paik. His father is a daily labourer and mother a part-time domestic worker. There is also a sister at home.																								He lives next door to Sagar, and although he isnt particularly good in studies, his forte is theatre and mime. His talent has won him a national scholarship from Delhi. He gets Rs 200 a month, which will continue as long as he wishes to pursue academics.																								Apart from the Hriday Akash programmes, Chandan also practises and performs with Indian Mime Theatre, which is associated with the NGO. He has also been around West Bengal, taking the stage for a variety of productions. Three days a week is dedicated to theatre and mime.																								I love doing it, the Class X student says with a shy grin. With his Madhyamik exams coming up, he acknowledges that the stage will have to take a backseat to books, but hopes that his passion will blossom into a profession.																								Bashabda approached me one day, asking for help in his endeavours to make a better life for these youngsters. This is what makes it all worthwhile, sums up Sarkar.

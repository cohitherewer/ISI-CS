 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Doctors at exam centres
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The examination season has set in and the education department is scrambling to smoothen the rough edges.																								Officials announced on Tuesday that the centres for Madhyamik 2004, slated to commence on March 5, would be equipped with doctors and emergency treatment facilities.																								This comes in the wake of several students falling sick in the examination hall during last years Madhyamik due to nervousness. The board of secondary education plans to have at least one doctor at each examination centre. The exams will be conducted at 1,852 centres.																								We have decided to keep doctors standing by in view of what happened last year, said board president Dibyendu Hota. A record number of candidates will sit for the exams over the next couple of weeks and we cannot take any chances. Local health centres and nearby hospitals will also be kept on alert.																								Around 40,000 students will appear for the ICSE and ISC exams that get underway from Wednesday. 																								Madhyamik starts on Friday and ends on March 16. Officials said 608,823 students will appear for Madhyamik 2004, against 592,034 students last year.																								Photocopy centres will be kept shut between 12 noon to 3 pm on all examination days; additional police force will be deployed in the trouble-prone areas; playing loudspeakers and organising fairs near exam centres will be prohibited.																								The state government will ply special buses and ensure uninterrupted power supply on examination days.

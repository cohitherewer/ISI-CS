The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 15, 2004  Stitched for success HIMIKA CHAUDHURI A model showcases one of the creations by NIFT designers at Resham. Picture by Pabitra Das 															The Class of 2004 NIFT is already tasting commercial success, having showcased their designer prowess in a dazzling graduating show just two days ago. 																					One can catch this years best garment construction by Sudhir Singh, along with the colourful thread work on white flowing skirts by Vivek Kumar at an exhibition at Resham boutique in Poddar Court. 																					Indrajit Des rather outlandish creations might appeal to those with a taste for the unusual. Sham Priyas black flowing dress with Rajasthani motifs of peacock feathers deserves special mention as well. 																					We are providing a platform to the designers so that they learn to interact with customers and deal with client queries in a professional manner, says a magnanimous Manju Agarwal of Resham. The exhibition aims at providing the young guns with much-needed exposure, while the year-old shop in turn benefits from the talent pool. The collections that move fast will be displayed on a permanent basis at the boutique, stresses Manju. 																					The professors at NIFT of course are thrilled to bits by the break. This kind of exposure helps the students make more commercially viable creations, says Swaroop Dutta, a faculty member, who dropped by to lend moral support to the fresh graduates. 												New brew																					After a six month coffee break Aqua Java is back with a piping brew. The brand that introduced the city to the coffee bar culture four years ago, reinvented itself on Friday evening with Caf Aqua Java, a cosy coffee shop-cum-lounge on 10 Wood Street. 																					The new address will hopefully do better than the Elgin Road outlet that lost out in the race for all-in-one fun destinations. With Forum becoming the new destination for the entertainment seeker in that area, we had no choice but to relocate, says proprietor Saket Agarwal. 																					Aiming to catch them young, the look of the 35-seater coffee shop is essentially vibrant and peppy. The wall-to-wall white sofa with colourful back cushions, low tables and bean bags strewn all over the place makes for a perfect place to catch up on the latest over steaming cuppas. We intend to live up to our punchline  Lifes little pleasures served here, shares the 24-year-old owner. Targeting the Xaviers breakfast crowd next door, the caf has warmed up to the early bird act, opening shop at 7.30 am sharp.																					The innovative use of jute and splashes of red on the first floor dotted with round tables and small chairs looks set to lure young professionals in the mood to unwind in the evenings. There are plenty of wraps, pastas and pizzas to go with old favourites like Crunch-in-Java, Iced Rocky Road Cappuccino and Brownie Java. One does need more than just coffee after a hard days grind, feels Saket. 																																													Thai thali																					You are sure to have had a South Indian, a Gujarati, a North Indian or a Bengali thali. But ever tried the Thai version of it? Baan Thai, the speciality Thai restaurant at The Oberoi Grand, has introduced just that in the form of a set menu. All one needs to do is spell out their little preferences in terms of gravies and spices on a pre-decided menu, making it easy for those new to the cuisine. 																					The exercise also makes way for greater variety. Many people find it inconvenient to order one whole plate of a dish as the portions are often very large. Thus we decided on a menu that cuts down on the quantity but allows the person to sample a number of dishes, says chef Suprakash Tripathi, offering a platter that throws up an interesting assortment of soup, noodles, steamed rice, two non-vegetarian dishes, one vegetarian dish and a dessert. 																					Eight different menus rolled over the week ensure that the guest does not get the same mix of dishes if he comes back for a second time during the week. Priced at Rs 381 per person inclusive of taxes, the portions are quite enough for even a big eater. We, however, give refills if a guest needs another helping of any item, says Suprakash. The food, neither too bland nor spicy, is dished out by speciality Thai chef Thida. I come from the south of Thailand where they eat very spicy food, but the food we serve here is moderate in taste, explains Thida who likes to use lemon grass, takrai and galangal to flavour the dishes. Available only for lunch, the set menu is being tried at Baan Thai for the first time ever. 																					On the cards: a set British menu, to be included in the regular menu of the hotel bar.

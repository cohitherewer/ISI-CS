The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Exposed, a Mumbai angle 
 																											- Police net button trader for links with city hawala scam A STAFF REPORTER																								The hawala racket that Ali Bhai, alias Firoz, had fallen back upon to receive his payments  Rs 10,000 in cash from an operator in Bowbazar  extends well beyond Calcutta. 																								Days after his arrest along with city-based hawala operator Muzaffarul Islam, the Mumbai police picked up a 66-year-old businessman, Bhogilal Zaveri, in connection with the racket. Investigations revealed that he had sent the amount that Islam had handed over to Ali Bhai.																								A dealer in metallic buttons, Zaveri was arrested on Narayan Dhrub Street, in Mumbai, on the basis of Islams confession about his trading with different partners across India. Sleuths said Zaveris button trade was a faade to hoodwink the police. 																								This is the second combined operation of sorts in recent times by Calcutta and Mumbai police. Earlier in July, Mumbai police had arrested Majid, following confessions of one Md. Ayub, who was arrested in the city for circulating fake notes across the country.																								A day after the arrest of the duo on August 26, police had sniffed a larger racket that was funding ISI operatives across India. Accordingly, the city-based hawala operator was grilled for hours by a team from the anti-rowdy section of the detective department of the city police. 																								It was then that sleuths learnt about the Mumbai connection. Islam reportedly admitted that Zaveri was one of the major operators with whom he worked closely. 																								An SOS was sent immediately to Mumbai police. On August 27, Zaveri was arrested and the next day, a two-member team from the detective department was packed off to Mumbai. The team has already appealed for a transit remand and is expected to return within a day or two.																								We expect more once Zaveri is brought here. It appears he was part of the ISI module in India and we need to know more about the extent of the network and the funding process, said Peeyush Pandey, city chief of sleuths.

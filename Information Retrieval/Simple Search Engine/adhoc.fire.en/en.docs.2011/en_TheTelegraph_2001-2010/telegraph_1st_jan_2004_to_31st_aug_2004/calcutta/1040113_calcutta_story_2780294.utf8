The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Life term for murder, set free for TB
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								In a significant order, a division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday freed a lifer because he was a tuberculosis (TB) patient. 																								In 1996, Saif Ali Midda, a resident of Midnapore, was arrested on charges of killing his wife. He was produced before a lower court in Midnapore, where several witnesses identified Midda as the killer. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was soon transferred to Alipore jail, where he was been for the past few years. 																								Middas lawyer on Monday moved high court, saying his client was suffering from TB and should be released on humanitarian grounds. Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Aloke Bose directed the jail authorities to release Midda immediately. 																								Legal experts believe this case could act as a precedent and many prisoners suffering from TB would be able to approach the court with mercy petitions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004  Calcutta Column

	The Dhakuria Lake area is a haven for all kinds of illegal and immoral activities in the evening. Couples occupy most of the seats and their behaviour causes much embarrassment to visitors to the nearby park. Besides, the place is also a hotbed for prostitution and drug peddling. Middle-aged women can be seen after 7 pm standing next to the fence encircling the park and soliciting customers with impunity. It is disgusting to catch the policemen openly collecting their share of money from the offenders. Action must be taken.

	Hawkers illegally occupy the footpath and a few feet of road space near the Brabourne Road-Burrabazar crossing. They cause a lot of inconvenience to the pedestrians. I regularly pass through the area and have often spotted the hawkers using abusive language and making indecent gestures at the pedestrians. They display their wares in such a manner that the sharp edges of the items damage our clothes. 
	Pramod Purohit, Rishra

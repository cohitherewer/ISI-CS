The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Ten back with football fiasco
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ten Sports returned to over 250,000 households across the city on the network of multi-system operator Manthan on Wednesday afternoon.																								The channel had been switched off by the broadcaster last Saturday following a dispute over Manthans dues, amounting to several lakhs.																								The issue was mutually resolved, said Gurmit Singh, a director of Manthan. He, however, refused to divulge details.																								The differences have been sorted out amicably and Manthan has made the required payments, said Asish Ghosh of Modi Entertainment Network, distributor for Ten Sports in India.																								The World Cup football qualifiers are currently being beamed on Ten. The Wednesday showpiece was the critical India-Japan tie (in which India got thrashed 0-7).																								With the channel coming back on air at around 4 pm, Manthan viewers were just in time to tune into Ten Sports for the action, but found a scroll instead of the soccer.																								The scroll read: Ten Sports apologises, due to a dispute between the Japanese broadcaster and Japan Football Association, no live coverage of Japan vs India is possible. Arrangements were being made, added the scroll, to show a delayed feed of the match but till late on Wednesday, nothing had been worked out.																								The Japanese broadcaster was scheduled to provide the feed to Ten Sports. It was very frustrating, said a Ten Sports spokesperson from Mumbai, since even though we were told we could go ahead and show the game, there was a problem between the two sales agents involved  the football association and the broadcaster.																								He also claimed that Ten was informed of the disagreement only at the last minute and left in the lurch with no pictures arriving on the satellite.																								But the return to the sporting arena may only be temporary for Manthan, which faces a switchoff threat from big players ESPN Star Sports (ESS).																								Though ESS officials refused comment and Manthan officials were not aware of any such problem, it was learnt that a blackout of both Star Sports and ESPN was narrowly averted on Wednesday evening. But the threat looms large on Thursday, with the network allegedly owing the broadcaster several lakhs.																								ESPN is beaming the clash of the European giants in Euro 2004, starting June 12. 																								If Ten had used the French Open to arm-twist Manthan, ESS could well play its Euro card. The victim, of course, will be the viewer.

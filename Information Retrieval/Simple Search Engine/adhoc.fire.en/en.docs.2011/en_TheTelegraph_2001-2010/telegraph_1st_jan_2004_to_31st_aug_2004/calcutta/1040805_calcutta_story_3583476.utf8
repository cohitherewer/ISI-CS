 A LEGAL REPORTER																								Despite the Presidents nod for his execution, the family of Dhananjoy Chatterjee has not given up hope, and a battery of about 20 top-notch lawyers will move the Supreme Court, urging it to appoint a medical team to assess his mental condition. 																								The Chatterjees and the legal team that has rushed to Dhananjoys aid are pinning their hopes on establishing that he is mentally ill and, therefore, cannot be hanged.																								Dhananjoy can move the apex court under Section 32 of the Constitution for extraordinary delay in execution of the capital sentence. The judiciary will have to find out who are responsible for the delay, said lawyer Sekhar Basu of Calcutta High Court. He said there was enough ground for the Supreme Court to consider the petition.																								According to the existing rules, a convict suffering from diseases and in mental agony cannot be hanged until he is fully fit. 																								Citing two cases where the court did not permit the administration to execute the capital sentences, Subroto Mookherjee, lawyer of Calcutta High Court, said: It is to be proved first that Dhananjoy, who has been in the condemned cell of the jail for the past 10 years, is physically fit. We have information that the jail authorities are not allowing his family members to visit him. So, the demand for setting up a medical team to check his health is justified.																								Lawyer Jaymalya Bagchi said: For 13 years, the man has suffered a lot, specially after he was condemned to death in 1994. The dilly-dally over the legal battles and also the lethargic attitude of the government in pursuing the court to vacate the stay order on the hanging has caused immense harm to his health. Dhananjoy should get an opportunity to move the apex court.																								Bikash, Dhananjoys brother, is the petitioner in the fresh case that will be moved by Colin Gonzalves, a Delhi-based lawyer appointed by a human rights organisation to fight the case. 																								The Association for Protection of Democratic Right (APDR), a Calcutta-based organisation fighting for human rights, is helping Bikash fight the case in the Supreme Court. Our suspicion is that the state government is trying to cover up the convicts mental illness, Sujato Bhadra, APDR president, said.

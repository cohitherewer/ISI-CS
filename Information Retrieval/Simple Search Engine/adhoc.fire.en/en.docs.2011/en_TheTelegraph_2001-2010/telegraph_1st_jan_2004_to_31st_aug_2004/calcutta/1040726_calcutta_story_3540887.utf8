 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Civic chief crushed under train wheels
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The chairman of Barrackpore Municipality was run over and killed by an express train on Sunday morning.																								Salil Banerjee, 60, died on the spot after the Sealdah-bound Gour Express crushed him under its wheels near a level crossing at Barrackpore station, on the citys northern fringes.																								Parveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said Banerjee was on his way to a local gymnasium when the accident occurred at Gate no. 1.																								The government railway police, in its report to the district police, said the gate was closed but Banerjee attempted to cross the railway tracks at around 5.30 am. His blood-splattered body was retrieved and sent for post-mortem, officials said.																								Banerjee, a CPM councillor from ward IV of Barrackpore Municipality, was chairman of the civic body for the third consecutive term. He had been chairman for the past 10 years, a local CPM leader said. 																								A resident of Barrackpores Old Calcutta Lane, Banerjee is survived by wife Debjani. The couple was childless.																								Family members were shocked by Banerjees death. Elder brother Sisir said: Salil retired last August and was a regular at the gym in the morning.																								On Sunday, like every other day, Banerjee set off for the gym, but he was a bit late. Maybe that was the reason for his hurry and he failed to notice the speeding train, a family member said.																								Witnesses said Banerjees body was thrown several yards away from the track by the impact.																								Railway officials stressed that people should be more careful at the level crossings. We organise awareness campaigns to underline the safety measures. We do not want commuters walking on the tracks, they added.

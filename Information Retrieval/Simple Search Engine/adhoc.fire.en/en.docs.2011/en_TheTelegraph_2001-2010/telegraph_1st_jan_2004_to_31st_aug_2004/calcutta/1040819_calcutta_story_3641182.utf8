The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Power asset in memory game 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Is it possible for one to remember all the 80,000-odd words listed in the 2,000-page Oxford Dictionary or the pages in which each is mentioned?																								Absurd though the proposition is for most, for Biswaroop Roychowdhury, however, this is a piece of cake. 																								This 30-year-old production engineer-turned-memory trainer and his team are convinced of the enormous potential of the human brain. 																								Roychowdhury, originally from Calcutta, had begun his career as memory trainer from Chandigarh, after completing his engineering degree from Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh.																								Roychowdhury got placed in the Limca Book of Records in 1998 for clearing the standard memory test of memorising a shuffled pack of 52 playing cards in just three minutes and 54 seconds. His next goal is to get a slot in the Guinness Book of World Records.																								Roychowdhury and his team, who have opened a number of memory schools in different parts of India, will be visiting Calcutta on Thursday to display his techniques before academicians, teachers, students and other professionals.																								I believe a human brain has the capacity to store information of 40 libraries with 80,000 books, Roychowdhury told Metro over telephone. 																								In this age of cut-throat competition, memory is an asset. Our analytical faculties come into play while learning, thereby the potential of the imaginative brain is rarely explored, he said, adding that his team was planning to open a memory school in the city to help students and candidates of competitive examinations.

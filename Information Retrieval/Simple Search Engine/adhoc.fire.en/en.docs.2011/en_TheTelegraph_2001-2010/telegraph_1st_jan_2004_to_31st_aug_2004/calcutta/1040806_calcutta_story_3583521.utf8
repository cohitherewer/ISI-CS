The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 06, 2004  Caution: better not dare to bareHIMIKA CHAUDHURI, SANGITA S. GUHA ROY, ZEESHAN JAWED One of the models at the citys first ever lingerie show at The Park on Wednesday															With the first ever lingerie show hitting the city ramp, it was no surprise that the hordes had turned up to watch the bods rather than the bodices.																					As predictable was Calcuttas model squad turning down the assignment, preferring to leave a little more to the imagination.																					The crowd thronged the The Park hotel banquets, trying to make inroads into the venue, which could, unfortunately, only accommodate around 500 viewers (or voyeurs, if you will).																					The first All India Bodywear Meet took off at The HHI from Wednesday morning. It was organised by Niksan Infomedia in a bid to get those in the business of selling delicates under one roof, but as the evening rolled on, it was clear that Calcutta had other things in mind.																					The citys own model brigade had apparently balked at the idea of stripping down to the bare essentials.																					Are you crazy? We would never take part in a lingerie show in our own city, one of the models who turned up to watch the show told us at the venue.																					Except for Pooja, who did most of the sequences wrapped in a sarong, and with decent uppers to match, the rest were models from beyond Bengals borders.																					The outfits ranged from the exotic to the erotic, with the drooling audience clicking away with their camera phones. Someone went as far as clapping and whistling as the ladies walked past. With the rest of the crowd thankfully not joining in, he quickly went mum. But there was no stopping the makeshift shutterbugs.																					It was the kids who, in their three sequences, won the spontaneous claps and cheers, providing some respite from the uncomfortable giggling and sniggering.																					With the unpleasant displays all round, one lost sight of the fact that there was some truly innovative inner-wear on show.																					 Interesting designs included a cotton knitted cape-style upper, a sequinned satin apron to go with a bikini and a net floral printed dress over a bikini.																					e the show was over too soon for crowd comfort, the exhibition of all-India products will be on at The HHI till August 6.  A flavour of the hilsa festival at the Hyatt Regency. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 												Fusion fish																					 This one is not for die-hard Sorshe Ilish fans. Chef Subrata Debnath has put his culinary skills to an innovative test at the hilsa festival at Hyatt Regency. 																					The Anarasher Ilish, a Sorshe Ilish look-alike, is somewhat bland to taste and unlikely to appeal to Bengalis fed on the inimitable traditional recipe.																					I have blended pineapple puree with mustard paste as both the colour and the taste compliment each other. The acidic nature of pineapple gels well with the pungent flavour of mustard, explained the chef.																					Debnath has taken the liberty to tinker with other age-old recipes like Ilisher Kalia and Doi Ilish as well in a bid to make them more cosmopolitan in nature.																					Smoked Hilsa is served with a sprinkling of Darjeeling tea for, apparently, an exotic flavour. Smoked fish is very popular in Europe where they use oak wood to good effect. We dont get oak here, so I make do with wood chips, explained Debnath.																																													Body basic																					Plan to pamper yourself with a pedicure or a face treatment? Head for Hobbies, on Hungerford Street, where Dead Sea minerals are being splashed around for the next month.																					This is an effort to make beauty-conscious people aware of the benefits of the black soil, water and salt. Our entire range is made up of organic material with no artificial chemical ingredients, said a distributor of the Mineral line of beauty products.																					The products are not sold over the counter, but the range is available at the spas at the ITC Sonar Bangla and Hyatt Regency and many leading salons in the city. 																					As for the beauty fest, anybody walking into the parlour can try out the Mineral line by availing any service worth Rs 200 or more.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Clients duped by oil pumps
 																											- 200 ml to 500 ml less for every five litres draws Rs 1,100 fine SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Arup Mitra would fill up his cars fuel tank once every 10 days. That would suffice. But over the past few weeks, he found that a full 30-litre tank was not seeing him through a week. Suspecting that he was being given less petrol than what he was paying for, he lodged a complaint with the legal metrology section of the consumer affairs department.																								Mitra is just one of the many consumers with complaints of being short-changed at the fuel pump. The large number of complaints prompted us to conduct surprise raids, controller of the legal metrology section Ashok Bhattacharya said on Wednesday.																								But what the sudden checks threw up surprised the department. An overwhelming majority  70 per cent  of the 20 petrol pumps raided confirmed the suspicions of Mitra and fellow victims.																								Most of the pumps were giving 200 ml to 500 ml less for every five litres. 																								The raids were conducted over the past week, officials said. Pumps, from those located in the city centre to those on the fringe areas (North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas and Howrah), were found to be cheating their clients.																								A very prominent pump off Dhakuria and two more, on SN Banerjee Road and near Maniktala, were among those found to be cheating on quantity, said a legal metrology section official.																								The pump on SN Banerjee Road was fined Rs 11,000 and the others Rs 5,000 each. The proprietors were warned that the next offence could land them in jail.																								The volume of fuel they were duping their customers of was hefty. A short measure of 10 per cent means a lot of money if you look at the volume of sales of a petrol pump and the cost of fuel, Bhattacharya said.																								Besides, many of the pumps were found to be using meters and measures not stamped by the legal metrology section.																								The legal metrology section has decided to conduct more raids and called leaders of the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association for a meeting to apprise them of the developments.																								We have told the department it can take whatever action it feels fit, said association president Jaydeb Sarkar.																								The association will take its own steps against errant pumps, added Sarkar.

 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Bandh wagon marches in high court
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								It was a michhil with a veiled message that was lost on none.																								Justice Amitava Lala was in his chamber, as were several other judges of Calcutta High Court, when about 200 members of the High Court Coordination Committee took out a procession on the court premises  a strictly restricted zone  to voice their support for Tuesdays 24-hour trade bandh.																								The rally continued for 45 minutes during Mondays recess.																								According to high court officials, this was the first time such an open rally had marched down these corridors. Committee members, most owing allegiance to the CPM, even shouted slogans in front of the chief justices courtroom, proclaiming that the bandh would be successful.																								Coming at a time when both the judiciary and the administration are in favour of restricting rallies for the sake of better work culture, the rally by the state coordination committee members in a restricted place like the high court has caused quite a controversy.																								The Bar Association of Calcutta High Court and the state Bar Council criticised the rally. It is unjust, unfair and illegal. Even newspaper photographers are not allowed to click the corridors of the high court. Why should penal action not be taken against the coordination committee for violating the rule? asked Uttam Majumdar, chairman of the executive committee of the Bar Association.																								Majumdar said suo motu contempt proceedings should be initiated by high court judges against the coordination committee for supporting a hartal openly, when it had been declared illegal by the apex court. Steps should also be taken to maintain the traditional dignity of Calcutta High Court, he added.																								Ashis Roy, former secretary of the High Court Bar Association, also demanded action against the organisers of the rally. We have to find out whether the committee had sought permission to stage such a rally. Police cannot allow people to shout slogans on the high court campus. Even the registrar has no authority to grant permission for a rally on the court premises, said Roy.																								When asked to comment on the matter, a sitting judge of the high court said that holding of rallies on the court premises was strictly prohibited. 																								But judges cannot take steps until they receive a complaint from the appropriate authority, like a member of the High Court Bar, he said.																								A section of lawyers said the matter must be referred to the state Bar Council, which should ask Chief Justice A.K. Mathur to take appropriate steps against the rally organisers.

 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Four weeks to explain Town Hall roof cave-in
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The West Bengal Human Rights Commission has asked Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee to submit a report within four weeks on how the roof of the Town Hall collapsed. 																								The roof of the heritage building caved in early on January 4 hours after one meeting and hours before another. 																								The commissions newly-appointed chairman, Justice Shyamal Kumar Sen, on Friday said that though there had been no casualty, a bigger disaster could have taken place if the century-old building had collapsed during peak hours. The Town Hall housed several offices of the Howrah Municipal Corporation, but there was little effort to maintain it. 																								We have taken note of the fact that it was a heritage building and a number of people used the building for official work every day. Many could have lost their lives if the roof had caved in during office hours, Sen said. 																								Sen also expressed concern over the spurt in custodial deaths and the poor healthcare system. He said four of the seven cases taken up suo motu after he became commission chairman, on January 1, were health-related. In all the cases, the authorities concerned have been asked to submit reports within four weeks. 																								Sen cited the instances of 40-year old Tapan Deyashi, whose body was found in a hospital vat, and 55-year-old Mahendra Bhuian, who jumped to his death in BN Bose Hospital, in Barrackpore.

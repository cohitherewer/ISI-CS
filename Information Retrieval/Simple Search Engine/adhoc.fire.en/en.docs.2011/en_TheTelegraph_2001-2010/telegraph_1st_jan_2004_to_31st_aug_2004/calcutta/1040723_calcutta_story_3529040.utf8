The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Oh, for the dregs of those days
 Members, cooks and stewards  all played a stellar role in creating the bastion of colonial excellence that Calcutta Club was, recalls Samir MukerjeeI became a member of Calcutta Club in the year 1958 after a short wait of six months. Kamala Bose made it easy for me to gain an entry without any of the rigmarole that often trips up people. In those days Britishness hadnt deserted the club and it was an absolute haven of peace. It enfolded you in its warmth and one felt part of a private exclusive world, self-contained and socially advantageous. The ribald, noisy and dangerous world outside didnt dare to impinge on our privacy. 																								The club was a bastion of colonial excellence and there were still a large number of Westernized Indians around to lend elegance, dignity and colour to the club. The British presence wasnt negligible either. Sir Biren Mookerjee, the Maharaja Sir U. C. Mahtab of Burdwan, Sir Josna Ghosal, Sushil Sinha ICS, Asoke Gupta, Nawab Farooqui of Ratanpur, Lord Arun Sinha  these names gave intimations of another world, members of the aristocracy and landed gentry mingling with each other in spacious surroundings. Elitism hadnt been tampered with and one still felt its warm glow in the middle Fifties.																								Where the members are finicky and connoisseurs of food and wine, one also expects the staff to be disciplined, efficient and work-proud. The wine waiters like Sadhu knew the preferences of the regulars. How well I remember the redoubtable Manto or Abdur Rahim, who had a close rapport with my father. He was allotted all kinds of duties as a sort of ombudsman and towards the end he ran the bar with alacrity. Manto knew an awful lot about cricket and the idiosyncracies of some members. He was all over the place with his inimitable welcoming smile. Later on he kept a check on those members who were not sticklers for sartorial propriety and often entered the club with the wrong footwear or clothes. On one or two occasions I assisted Manto in having these bedraggled members removed from Room No. 7. 																								The cuisine couldnt have been more recherch. The stewards in those days not only understood Western dishes and produced delicacies very often, they were also extremely enterprising, coming up with brand new suggestions and amenable to advice from the fastidious diners. As a starter we often had hors doeuvres which was always scrumptious and consisted of rareties like caviar, pink salmon, herring, liver pat, anchovy, stuffed eggs and pilchard amongst other things. I remember tucking into fish roes on toast at lunch time. 																								We often entertained our friends for lunch or dinner and were hardly ever disappointed. The toothsome prawn cocktail, grapefruit and melon cocktail laced with wine were meant for discerning diners. The puddings took on an aura of romanticism with Biscuit Monte Carlo, Gateau Africaine, Gateau Noisette, brittle fruit baskets and Baba au Rhum adorning our table and rounding off the meal with a flourish. With stewards like Henry Spears, Mr Karma, Mr Medora and Prosanto Banerjee bustling around to ensure the success of any meal, lunching or dining at the club was an exhilarating experience.																								My wife and I used to enjoy an occasional breakfast in the verandah when we tackled fruit juice, fish cakes, sausages and eggs, crisp hot toast and marmalade. The well-appointed colourful and lush garden beamed on us. It was the all-encompassing silence which made our visits to the club so pleasurable. Whichever room we parked ourselves in, conversation was never rumbustious. Voices were muted and our body language was imbued with a quiet grace. 																								I remember the time when my wife and I invited famous dancer, Swapnasundari, and another friend of ours to have lunch with us. One of the veteran wine waiters was Sheikh Bulbul who was asked to produce a novel and fiery cocktail for my guests. Bulbul rose to the occasion gallantly and produced a delectable concoction called Bengal Cocktail  a nice little invention on his part! By the time we were ready for lunch, Swapna had turned into a scintillating raconteur with exciting tales of her sojourn in Africa. She had always been an intelligent conversationalist but this time she was like a storm that could flatten out cornfields! When we want to the dining room the other guest became almost somnolent and nearly drowned in the soup. Without waiting for the main course, this particular gentleman tottered out of the room totally oblivious of the other courses that were to follow. Bengal Cocktail had done its work and I was grateful to Bulbul for devising such an incendiary drink. 																								Talking about the staff, Salauddin has been serving in the bakery for well over 30 years. We liked his natural bonhomie and winning smile but hardly anyone knew that he was a budding Urdu poet who was also interested in reading Urdu literature. I have heard him reciting Iqbals Khudi do kar buland itna, when the bakery melted away and a mushaira sprang into life. 																								Frances Gomes was a consummate cook in the middle Seventies and Eighties. He knew what gourmets wanted and he never put a foot wrong. He invented Chicken Washington which consisted of diced chicken, sweet corn and bacon in a cream cheese sauce. It was during his tenure that we relished Roast Chicken Derby  a small chicken stuffed with bacon, liver, raisins, brown rice and herbs. 																								The cook who followed him, Tarun Pal, was equally adept at smart dishes. He used to serve pat as a cold started on a bed of shredded cabbage. Nothing could be more welcome on a hot and sultry evening. He took the trouble of jazzing up something as plebeian as vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce laced with a liberal dose of rum. Those heady days seem like a dream now and are never likely to return in a benighted world. 																								One or two dinner parties stand out in my mind as symbols of stylish living. My father was quite famous for the trouble he took to entertain his guests for dinner. The waiters had to wear spotless white gloves and crisp uniforms. Silver bowls of Firpos chocolates and crystallized ginger decorated the table which the diners dipped into when the dinner was over. There was never a shortage of Cointreau, Drambuie, Benedictine and Courvoisier. Any deviation from the norm would have appalled my father. Much later, M.K. Kripalani ICS swung into action with his select dinner parties. Before dinner he danced with the ladies at his party, prinked up and reeking of Guerlain or Yves St. Laurent. After that the wine glasses were set on fire and the festive mood dug its heels in. 																								In my days the club was homely, discreet and mellow. It taught you to value savoir faire and social graces. In a hallowed ambience one ate and drank and enjoyed oneself without getting in anyones way. These time-honoured virtues have been mutilated beyond recognition today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Tennis ticket to Big Apple Chance to study and play in US
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Former Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali shows the Parekh sisters how to pull it off. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Reedhina Parekh, 20, is taking a break between semesters after a gruelling 16-month stint with Western Michigan University. She will be joined on the flight back to the US next month by sister Priyanka, 18, who has also secured a 100 per cent tennis scholarship for the four-year programme in the same college. 																								And father Shailesh is glad he wont have to fork out $ 20,000 a year, thanks to the full scholarship secured by his daughters.																								For the Parekh sisters  and other tennis teens in town  a ticket to the Big Apple now comes with an opportunity to sharpen that serve-n-volley while picking up valuable tips on business administration.																								Its advantage tennis, the only sport that holds out the lure of American college education through scholarships, and parents and kids in Calcutta are giving it their best shot.																								These scholarships have opened up many doors for these children. Through tennis, they have this wonderful opportunity to study in the US, which gives them something to fall back on if the sport doesnt work out as a career option, observes former Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali, who now puts his proteges through the paces at South Club.																								Akhtar feels the hard grind of the college system  which has produced the likes of McEnroe, Connors and Courier  along with the exposure, prepares the youngsters to meet lifes challenges head-on.																								Reedhina agrees: Training four hours a day, six days a week, plus all the travel and match-play in different conditions has toughened me from within.																								Without it being a drain on her dads pocket. Others, like Anwar Ali, Leander Paes first coach, are not so lucky. Anwar, who sent son Saif to the University of New Orleans with a 40 per cent scholarship in 2000, has to stitch together in excess of $25,000 every year to support his education. Still, Anwar is keen to send daughter Saima as well, because like Parekh, he values the high standards of education and competitive tennis the US college circuit provides.																								From Nausher Madan to Shonali Mukherjee, Sanzaruz Zaman to Harshit Sharma, Fazaluddin and Saifuddin (sons of soccer coach Syed Nayeemuddin), Akshay Bajoria to Nirvick Mohanta, the city has sent a string of players to Sampras country.																								The chance to study and play in America and also to make some money through odd summer jobs gives them social security, observes Akhtar.																								The basic educational requirement is plus-II equivalent from any board and SAT and TOEFL. On the tennis front, AITA ranking is a must, while ITF Junior ranking, ATP or WTA points are pluses. Once contact is established, the aspirant needs to courier off an action video clip, which is then evaluated by the colleges tennis coach.																								All parents want to give their children a good life and many, a foreign education. This is as good an avenue as could be, stresses Gary OBrien, whose wards Nitya Arora, Soumi Gupta, Riya Bose, Amit Wadhwani and Amanjyot Singh are all in the US.

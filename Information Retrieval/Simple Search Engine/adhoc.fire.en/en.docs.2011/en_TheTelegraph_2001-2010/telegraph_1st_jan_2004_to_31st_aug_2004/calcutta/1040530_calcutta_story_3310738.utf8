The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
Citylights
Amost 10 months after film-maker Mani Ratnams crew descended on Calcutta, rambled the streets scouting locales and even ran into an accident while on the Setu sets, Yuva has hit the city full blast. For Calcuttans, catching a show of the blockbuster shot extensively in the city is proving to be the best thing to do on a summer morning, afternoon, evening or even night. After all, whats better than spending time with stars and the city? Our city, their city Rani Mukherjee and Abhishek Bachchan playing football on the Maidan, Vivek Oberoi and Kareena Kapoor romancing in a tram trundling out of Esplanade depot, Ajay Devgan striding out of the Presidency College portico Theres a bit of Calcutta in almost every frame of Yuva. Its fresh, different and romantic, seen through the eyes of an outsider.  The two bridges on the Hooghly for instance  here a panoramic sweep, there a silhouette, or a birds eye-view. Cinematographer Ravi K. Chandrans lens has even discovered some nooks and crannies to show the city in a way few of us have seen it. The city has so much character The old bridge is very interesting. My favourites are a low-angle shot of the old bridge, beside which Om Puri addresses a rally, and the tram sequence with Vivek and Kareena. Mani was initially sceptical about shooting in Calcutta, thinking that it would be difficult to control the crowds. But we were stunned by the way people cooperated with us, said Chandran. Up close Oi je, dekh, dekh, dekh O maaa, ki dekhte Calcutta got its first glimpse of a galaxy of stars up, close and personal for days on end. The second Hooghly bridge, the streets, the Maidan, the Victoria Memorial, Metro Railway, Metro cinema, Presidency College, Writers Buildings Ajay, Abhishek, Vivek, Rani and Kareena were anywhere, anytime. The fortunate few got a glimpse of the real, for others the reel beckons. Setu slip Vidyasagar Setu. July 16, 5.10 pm. An action-packed stunt sequence goes awry. Vivek running along the bridge, with Abhishek hot on his heels, skids on the rain-washed road. The stuntman on motorcycle rams into Viveks left leg. Watching the mishap, director Ratnam suffers a blackout. Both are rushed to hospital, stunning the cast, crew and Calcutta with this bone-crunching twist in the tale. Vivek voiceover About the bridge shots, I have mixed feelings because of the accident, but I am grateful to Calcuttans for standing by me and praying for my recovery The spirit of Calcutta is amazing. And the tram is a wonderful place to romance, more than the buses in Mumbai, as it has such a colonial, old-world charm. Kareena and I went through all the stations during the shoot The food was amazing, too. Abhishek, Ajay and I would eat as if there was no tomorrow. I would gorge on mishtis, especially rosogolla and nalen gurer sandesh. I also loved the shorshe machh and kasundi. Cal call At INOX and Metro, weekdays are looking more like weekends. Serpentine queues and house-full signs are the order of the summer holidays. The citys sole multiplex  where Yuva has been declared a hit  has seen a footfall of 7,950 in the first six days of screening. Many in the crowd remember the excitement the shooting and Viveks accident had caused in Calcutta.  For some it was the look  I didnt know Calcutta was so beautiful, gushed Mousumi Gupta, stepping out of a matinee show at Metro.  For others it was the feel  The trade union movement has been portrayed really well. Neither extreme, nor too subdued, mused Dipanjan Roy of Asutosh College. Indias greatest cricketer (says Wisden) and Indian crickets first lady (say we) will be adding gusto and glamour to the annual quiz organised by the Advertising Club, in its glittering new avatar. Yes, were talking Kapil Dev and Mandira Bedi.  Max Q-Factor, to be held on June 4, in association with The Telegraph, is the platform created by the channel Set Max to reach out to Calcuttas advertising and corporate communities.  The Rangmanch at Swabhumi is the venue for the Q amp;A evening, which is open to three-member teams from ad agencies, corporates, educational institutions and Ad Club members.  While Soumyadip Chowdhury is the main quizmaster, Kapil and Mandira will host at least a round each.  Most of the questions will be agency or business related, with some general questions as well, but the guest quizmasters will decide what subjects they are most comfortable with, explains Siddhartha Roy, vice-president of the oldest ad club in the country, at 50 and counting.  Fans of the two all-rounders have good reason to try their luck. The winners may just get to share a table with the sporting hero and the screen heroine, provided they can make some time in their hectic schedules.  And Mandira, for one, is thrilled to bits. Im really excited since this will be the first time Ill conduct a quiz well one round anyway. Kapil would ask questions on cricket and Ill ask on movies, since MAX primarily stands for these two. Calcutta is full of intelligent people and lots of quizzers. Its a very prestigious event and I hope it turns out to be a good show.  Coming up on a slightly different pitch  but also for the corporate crowd thats learning to play as hard as it works  is a combination of football and fun. The Telegraph Merchants Cup Football tournament is coming to a close on June 5 with the customary blow out on the CC amp;FC grounds. With DJs Meghna and Jimmy Tangree in the house, a swinging party is in store for revellers  whether the battle is lost or won by their respective companies.  The party will come at the end of a hectic day on the field, with the finals lined up for the main plate, the losers plate and the bowl, as well as an exhibition match for kids. After Cannes, Karlovy Vary. After femme fatale, just another girl. After eye-popping dress, a simple sari.  The Moscow film festival, which played host to Raj Kapoor many summers ago, has picked up Rituparno Ghoshs first Hindi foray, Raincoat, for its competitive section this year.  So, the film starring Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, under post-production in Mumbai, will be coming to Calcutta, via Moscow, in end-July. The fascinating use of the interiors is what won over festival director Eva Zaralova. A simple story of the complexities of estranged love, is how Rituparno sums up his indoor drama. Ask Ash about her role of an ordinary girl and she reveals, If Binodini (in Chokher Bali) was my deepest, Neeru was my toughest (character).

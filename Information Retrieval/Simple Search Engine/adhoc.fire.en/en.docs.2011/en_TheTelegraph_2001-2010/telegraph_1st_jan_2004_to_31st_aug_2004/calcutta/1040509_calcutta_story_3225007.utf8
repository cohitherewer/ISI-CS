 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Police 3 minutes away on poll day
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three minutes are all that the police are asking for to reach a scene of action on poll day. City police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty on Saturday assured that his officers would rush to any troubled spot in the city on Monday within three minutes of receiving information.																								While elaborating on the security ring to be thrown around the city on election day, he claimed that unprecedented arrangements had been made to ensure peaceful polling.																								The computer cell at Lalbazar has stored data on all 782 poll premises, he said. The moment we come to know about any particular booth where trouble has broken out, officers will find out the exact location and the telephone number of the booth, name of the presiding officer and cellphone numbers of the police officers deployed closest to the location  all at the click of a mouse. Within seconds, instructions will be reached to them, he explained.																								More than 15,000 policemen will be on duty on Monday. There will be 40 mobile teams led by an assistant commissioner or an inspector to visit the booths throughout the day. Besides, a radio flying squad divided into 30 teams will be deployed at strategic locations.																								Apart from these, 70 jeeps of the radio flying squad will be doing the rounds, said Chakraborty. Each police station has been given five additional vehicles for patrolling.																								For the first time, patrolling on foot will be introduced on Monday. Officers and constables will walk along a particular stretch till polling is over. Another high-profile team of 60 officers, including deputy commissioners and officers-in-charge, will accompany the para-military forces, added the commissioner.																								Police personnel will reach the booths by 6 pm and escort the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) to the polling premises. The strong-room where the EVMs will be kept will be guarded by the para-military force, Chakroborty stated.																								A warning has been sounded for two-wheeler riders. Section 144 will be imposed on motorcycle riders. If we find five or more motorcyclists riding in a cluster, they will be questioned. If they fail to give us a satisfactory explanation, they will be arrested and the two-wheelers will be seized. The motorcycles will be returned only after the declaration of the election results.																								As a preventive measure, the city police have arrested 14,600 persons and 3,000 of them were booked under non-bailable charges. We have recovered 76 improvised firearms, 150 rounds of cartridges, 290 crude bombs and 18 kg explosives, he said.

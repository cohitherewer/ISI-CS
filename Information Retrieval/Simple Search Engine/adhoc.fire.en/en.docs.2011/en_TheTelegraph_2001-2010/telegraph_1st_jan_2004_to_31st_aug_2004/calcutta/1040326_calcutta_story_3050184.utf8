Picture by Rashbehari Das  Rituparna Sengupta at a jewellery exhibition on Thursday.The best of Jaipurs exotic jewellery is in town. Jewels Emporium, makers of exquisite heritage jewellery inspired by the classic lines of the Rajwada gharana, unveiled their collection at The Taj Bengal on Thursday.																					The exhibition is expected to hit a soft spot with those Calcutta women who cant resist shiny new toys.																					Women in this part of the country wear saris often and are built in such a way that they carry traditional jewellery very well, said Timsy Anand, the Gurgaon-based socialite who has brought the exhibition to town. Conservative is their style of dressing and heritage is what we offer, added Timsy, before actress Rituparna Sengupta arrived to show off some of the creations. First lady Anjana Shah inaugurated the event, also attended by designers Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Kiran Uttam Ghosh. The Riwaz and Arzoo collections will be on display till March 27.																					Riwaz is a traditional collection including vibrant colours and bold designs, taking in necklaces (like classic ranihaars), chokers, jhumkas, pendant sets, kadas and bangles, all set in 22 carat gold. The designs are timeless, and can be handed down from one generation to the next, stressed Timsy. They will appeal, she continues, to the subtle taste and coy nature of women here.																					Each piece of jewellery in jaddau, polki and kundan on display is unique, and draws influence from Rajasthans royalty, explains Timsy, who has successfully worked the style circuits in Delhi, Dubai, Mumbai, Chennai and even New York, taking designs in fabric, fashion, jewellery and art to prospective buyers.																					Arzoo is a fusion of Indian and western designs, with a more contemporary touch. Enamelwork and rose cut diamonds are the predominant features of the lightweight yet ornate collection. Apart from varieties of enamelled jewellery on 18 carat gold, there are designs in a range of coloured stones, mother of pearl, ruby and minakari, with flowers and leaves as recurring motifs. There are necklaces, pendant sets and sherwani buttons in this range.																					cutta has woken up to the need for affordable and dependable designer jewellery, rooted in tradition. People no longer opt for only plain gold or diamond jewellery. They like colours, especially aqua green and saffron, signed off Timsy.																					There was more good news on the gold front on Thursday. A rush of special offers is ahead, with Poila Boishakh around the corner and first off the mark to announce these was The Gold Factory. The Gariahat store unveiled a new range of gold jewellery up for grabs, from April 4 to 14.																					Homing in on the demand for jewellery low on cost and high on design, The Gold Factory will also offer 40 per cent discount on its making charges during the promotion. Rings will start at around Rs 1,500, with earrings going for as little as Rs 350, Necklace-and-earring sets are pegged at Rs 6,000 onwards and wristlets and pendants for Rs 4,000 plus.																					The collection of budget diamonds stocked at the store will be available at a flat discount of 40 per cent. Diamond nosepins, rings and earrings start at around Rs 1,400, Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 after discount.  Boman Irani at the Taj event.												Comic spirit																					It was supposed to be an evening dedicated to the spirit of achievement. It turned out to be more a celebration of humour.																					Boman Irani  you can call him Mahatma (vs Gandhi) or Dr Ashtana (Munnabhai MBBS)  was the show stealer at Teachers Highnights, held at the Taj Bengal late on Wednesday. In keeping with the mood (the ballroom was overflowing with those who had managed to drag themselves away from the Lahore match) the event was dedicated to the spirit of achievement that goes into the creation of great sportsmen.																					Boman took the stage with the magic words for a tense audience: Inzamam got out! soon after which he was joined by co-host Harsha Bhogle on the dais. After some verbal sparring between the two, Harsha rattled off anecdotes about the greats  Sachin Tendulkar to Leander Paes, Michael Holding to Viv Richards  interspersed with audio-visual clips of memorable moments and interviews, like Kumbles valiant effort in bowling on despite a broken jaw in Antigua during the Indian teams 2002 tour. Like Holdings home truths about an all-pace attack: There are no fast bowlers maan, they are only running a long way.																					Regrettably, not a single sportswoman found a word in Harshas segment (except, and in a very different context, Mandira Bedi) as icons of achievement.																					Boman took the stage again for a hilarious stand-up routine, where teachers (in the classroom, not glass), Parsi mannerisms and even a few audience members came in for some playful jibes. Famous Parsis  Alyque Padamsee, Shiamak Davar  the not so famous ones too  Bomans mother, mother-in-law  were the butt of a comedy routine so delightful that the numerous prominent Parsi faces in the crowd didnt seem to mind one bit.																					He rounded the night off with a rendition of We are the World, mimicking with some accuracy the dozens of voices belonging to US singing legends that went into the 1980s benefit-for-Africa track.

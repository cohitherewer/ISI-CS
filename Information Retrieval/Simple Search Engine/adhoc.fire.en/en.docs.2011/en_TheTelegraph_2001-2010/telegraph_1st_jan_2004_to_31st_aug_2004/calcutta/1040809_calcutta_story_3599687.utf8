 OUR BUREAU																								A CID team probing the murder of gynaecologist Susil Pal will leave for Jalpaiguri, where he had spent 15 years of his career. The team from Bhabani Bhavan is expected to leave in a day or two.																								We decided to visit Jalpaiguri while working on some inputs we had gathered during our investigations in Bally and Bandel. It appears that there may have been a Jalpaiguri link behind the murder, said a CID officer.																								Pal was working at Serampore Walsh Hospital. He went missing on July 2 on way to Serampore from his Bright Street residence in Calcutta. His body was found the next day on the banks of a canal in Sankrail, Howrah, 40 km from Calcutta.																								A post-mortem confirmed that he had been murdered. According to the report, Pal was hit by blunt weapons  more than a dozen injury marks were found on his body  before being strangulated. 																								Sleuths had raided the residence of two touts, both brothers, who operated at Serampore Walsh Hospital. On checking the call statement of one touts mobile phone, they came across some Jalpaiguri telephone numbers. Jalpaiguri may have played a key role in the murder plot, said an officer working on the case. 																								Immediately after taking over the investigation, the CID had asked its Jalpaiguri wing to send a report. But the report failed to satisfy the officers here. So, we are sending a team, he added. 																								The team will gather information about Pals activities in Jalpaiguri. We will speak to anyone with whom Pal had spent time. Residents of the area where Pal had rented a home, too, will be questioned, said a member of the Jalpaiguri-bound team.																								The sleuths are also examining the call statements of cell phones owned by Pals in-laws and wife Kanika. We will check all incoming and outgoing calls, said the officer. We are investigating the case from all possible angles. Nobody is above suspicion.																								A Bally-based businessman is also being questioned in connection with the murder. The sleuths refused to disclose his identity for the sake of investigations. We are questioning him to cross-check some inputs we had earlier gathered. The businessmans background is also being examined. the officer added.

 Sunday, May 30, 2004 Bon Appetease Victor BanerjeeDear readers, like Manmohan, I too was not born but, you might say, certainly brought to life, in Assam. Manmohan will now join the ranks of great leaders who have donned plumes and head-dresses and danced with the Khasis, Jaintias, Lushais, Nagas, Mizos, Bodos, Mikirs, Mishmis, Daflas, Ahoms and Assamese and then used their rich reserves to prop up the master chefs of post-independent caste-driven India who, by their sheer narrow-minded numbers in the kitchen, have dictated our national diet.But, something tells me the Northeast may, this time, for the very first time, be in for a feast. Dont worry, I shall sum up this unpalatable piece with a wonderful disclosure from an undiscovered cuisine.Meanwhile, while the world stews in the juices of the Nonsense Stew that I delivered to you last week, what greater fodder scam can there be than my trying to slam dunk ingenious recipes down unsuspecting gullets? Did any of you try making our contemporaneous Pish Pash?While the countrys kitchens were burning up with monumental indecisions and our mentors were conjuring up recipes with indiscernible flavours, I sat back in my armchair and pulled out a book from my shelves. Having blown off the dust that had settled on it for over two decades, I chuckled at what I read. The book is called The Dancing Wu Li Masters and here is what it had to say about nonsense.The importance of nonsense hardly can be overstated. The more clearly we experience something as nonsense, the more clearly we are experiencing the boundaries of our own self-imposed cognitive structures. Nonsense is that which does not fit into the prearranged patterns, which we have superimposed on reality. There is no such thing as nonsense apart from a judgmental intellect which calls it that.So, lets face it, and lump it: whether you liked Pish Pash or didnt, pundits and Marxists predict that that should be our diet for the foreseeable, in fact, out-of-focus distant future.As a fellow hun of the oil (George Dubya be spared) I would like to introduce to you one of the principal reasons why Manmohan Singh chose Assam, over all other states in India, to set up a logistical home.First and foremost, the Brahmaputra is the least polluted of all the major rivers in India. It follows that the mercury content of fish in this state is almost nil and the catch of the day in Guwahati doesnt arrive in refrigerated trucks from Andhra Pradesh. It is true that Sarson di Saag and Makki di Roti are irreplaceable ventricular functions of our Prime Ministers life, but what stole and captured his innocent sardars heart was the fresh fish from the Brahmaputra. The second reason, and last, was that the affection bestowed upon him by the people of Assam was undiluted and unadulterated by motive.Thus, reluctantly, I shall divulge one of the finest recipes for fresh fish that you will ever encounter. It will rival any recipe that we have to offer right here in Bengal. Like machher jhol is to us, Tenga is every mothers secret in Assam. Amusingly, this dish derives its firangi name from the shape of the ouw tenga (chalta) that lends it its distinctive flavour. Victor thrusts something fishy into the Prime Ministers unsuspecting hand Elephant-Ear Fish TengaIngredients: 10 pieces of fish; 3/4 kg tomatoes; 250 gm joha white pumpkin (or lawki); 1 large potato; 1/2 Elephant Ear (chalta); mustard oil for frying (as your heart permits); 1 tsp turmeric; 1/4 tsp methi; salt to taste; 1 bunch coriander leaves; 1/2 tsp sugarMethod (Try and follow the steps in the recommended order): Clean the fish, take the salt and turmeric and rub them evenly on. Finely chop the tomatoes and coriander leaves and slightly larger pieces of joha, and potato. Make one inch pieces of the ouw tenga (chalta) and pressure cook it with four cups of water for 10 minutes.Now only half-fry the fish and keep it aside. Heat one tablespoon of mustard oil in a kadhai and add methi seeds. When the seeds turn black (not burnt charcoal), remove them. To the oil, now add the tomatoes, joha, and potato. Also add salt, sugar and some turmeric. Turn down the flame and occasionally stir fry (replacing the lid on top) until you get a puree of sorts. Add the ouw tenga pieces along with the water you pressure-cooked them in. Bring to boil and then turn the flame down to let it simmer for five minutes. Now add the half-fried fish and let it all simmer for another 10 minutes. After you have taken it off the cooking range or stove, garnish with fresh torn coriander. Serve hot with plain rice and green chillies (preferably not the killers from Tezpur).On a hot summers day, tangy tenga will make your Sunday lunch worth remembering. Acquire a taste for tenga and who knows where it might get you one day? Certainly, recognising the enigmatic and enchanting nuances of everything you previously labelled simply sour, will open new horizons in your approach to life and encumbered governance. Yes, Prime Minister?

Picture by Amit Datta 																								 Handling the first few wrinkles, the irrepressible signs of ageing, has never been easy. Especially for those who have got the lines earlier than they ought to. But the solution to this age-old ageing problem is not far away. Calcutta got its first ever Botox clinic, a non-surgical way to remove the hardest wrinkles, on Friday morning. 																								The clinic was inaugurated by Ayaan Ali Bangash, the man who hardly needs the treatment now. The young musician apparently flew down from Delhi with temperature, to honour a personal request from P.K. Bakshi, the physician who has revolutionised eye-treatment in India and the man behind this clinic. 																								The entry of this Sarat Bose Road clinic (near Minto Park) in the lifestyle scenario of the city means that both men and women can now keep looking younger for a longer time and that too without any side-effects or pain. Botox is being used for therapeutic purposes in India since 1990, but the cosmetic use of this anti-ageing injection is recent, says Bakshi. 																								Botox is a protein which relaxes the muscles and thus brings a huge change in facial appearance, explains expert physician Sukanya Mitra. Botox can be used to remove squint, thought lines on the forehead which gives an angry or unpleasant look, crows feet around the eye formed by squinting long in the sun and even migraine. It takes maximum 15 minutes to inject the protein and it is absolutely painless, asserts Mitra. 																								The side-effects can be in the form of droopy eyelids that last just a week. Once injected, Botox works immediately and keeps the lines away for about four to six months. Depending on the intensity of wrinkles, the treatment will cost between Rs 5,000 and Rs 12,000. 																								We recommend Botox after the age of 35, though those in the public eye may need to use it much earlier, said Mitra. I think Ill see many more beautiful Calcuttans once this clinic gets underway, said Ayaan, stressing that looking good is very important for musicians since it adds to the visual appeal of performances. Participants at the child model hunt at The Park. Picture by Aranya Sen 																								No kidding																								 Calcutta is on its way to becoming a favoured destination for advertising agencies and heres why. The city has just witnessed Smilestone-Little Hearts, a child model hunt that saw over 600 kids from below one-year of age right onto 12 years auditioning to become the new faces in television ads. 																								Walking into the lounge at The Park, with parents and participants waiting with bated breath, one could figure out that the participants meant serious business. Yet, when the parents were being asked the motive behind bringing the children to the contest, those putting the finger on the money button were instantly rejected. 																								We dont want a childs academics to suffer because of this contest, said Sandeep Shah, the man behind the contest. A panel of eight judges interviewed every child, trying to gauge their spontaneity and smartness before putting them through a song-and-dance or acting performance and finally a photo-session. 																								The parents were in fact more tense than the children even as moms set the hair-pins right and dads took quick mock interviews before sending the children away for the finals last week.																								We have had participants from nearer home Jamshedpur and from as far as Mumbai and Hyderabad, claimed Shah, who intends to hold these contests across the country after the success of the first one. Apparently, he already has ad agencies and corporates knocking at his door for the new crop of kids. 																								Two children from each of the six categories will be launched through television commercials, while over 70 others will take part in TV game shows that we will launch, said Shah. The results which will be declared after marks of the photo-session are tabulated with the rest of the rounds are expected on Sunday.						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

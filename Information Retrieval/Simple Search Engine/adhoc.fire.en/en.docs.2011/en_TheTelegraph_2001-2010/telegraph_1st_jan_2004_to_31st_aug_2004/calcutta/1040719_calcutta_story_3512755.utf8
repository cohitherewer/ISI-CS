 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Competition from savvy retail chains brought the once-popular Ramakrishna Bakery to its knees, and the Saha familys fortunes had plummeted to the levels of penury its predecessors had gone through decades ago.																								In the early 70s, brothers Pranotosh and Santosh Saha crossed over to Bengal from Bangladesh. They hadnt a paisa in their pockets. 																								Drifting to Tollygunge, they took up jobs in a local bakery, learning to bake bread and other confections. 																								Sensing the potential of the bakery trade, the brothers decided to take the plunge in the early 80s, and Ramakrishna Bakery was born in Tollygunge. Though it churned out many items, the bakerys USP remained the soft, white milk bread.																								Ramakrishna Bakery may have been thriving, but seeds of discord had been sown between the siblings. 																								The differences came to the fore in 1987, when the brothers decided to part ways. With Pranotosh opting out of the business completely, Santosh took over the reins. From then, it was Santosh who tended to the bakery, along with his sons.																								The boom in business made it possible for the Sahas to build a four-storeyed house at 91/3C, Tollygunge Road. 																								Flush with the success of Ramakrishna Bakery, the father and sons decided to open another unit in 1989. 																								The new venture, in Behala, was christened New Ramakrishna Bakery. 																								According to family insiders, returns from the two bakeries were enough to sustain the entire family. But the new bakery could not replicate the success story of its predecessor and business started flagging from the early 90s.																								With competitors like Monginis and Sugar n Spice gaining ground, returns from the two bakeries were dwindling. Worse, bread from Modern Bakery was becoming more popular, hitting the Sahas hard on their homeground.																								Threatened by savvy competitors who were franchising retail outlets by the dozen, it was in the mid-90s that Santosh Sahas grandchildren decided to diversify into grocery.																								From a family business in bakery products, the Sahas were now dealing in the wholesale of items like suji (semolina), maida (flour), sugar, pulses and cereals.																								According to police officers probing the case, returns from the wholesale business, too, had dwindled, which might have prompted Shibendu Saha to fall into a debt trap. 																								Even after diversifying, business failed to look up and that may have led to the serial deaths, an officer said.

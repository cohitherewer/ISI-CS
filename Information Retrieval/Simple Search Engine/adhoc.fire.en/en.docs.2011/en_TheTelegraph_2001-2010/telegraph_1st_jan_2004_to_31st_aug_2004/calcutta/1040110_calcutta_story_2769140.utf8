 Kalidasas Sakuntala is regarded by scholars as the pinnacle of Indian literature in any language, in any genre. Theatre directors avoid it, preferring a political drama like Mrichchhakatika if they do select from Sanskrit. Perhaps it seems too romantic and idealised, and not at all feminist, but it still speaks to us, says the plays director Ananda Lal. The story of Sakuntala is about male betrayal of love and how one woman deals with it. It is also about man and nature, in which Dushyanta is the depredatory male and Sakuntala represents all life and creation. One could argue that Kalidasa epitomizes a tradition of environmental consciousness in India far more advanced than anything in Western literature, though not compromised. The production, though modernised, applies many classical Sanskrit conventions of the theatre: live music and dance, an empty stage, no properties, mimed objects and gestures, a hand-held yavanika, and parikramas to suggest changes of locale.

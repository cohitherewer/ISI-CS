 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Owner killed in bid to save burning shop
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 67-year-old shop-owner, Prasanta Dey, was charred to death inside his shop on SP Mukherjee Road, in the Kalighat police station area, on Thursday morning. 																								Four fire tenders fought for more than two hours to douse the flames. By then, everything in the shop was destroyed. 																								Jayanta Das, officer-in-charge of the local police station, said Dey, a bachelor, noticed sparks from the DC ceiling fan of his shop and switched it off. But soon, smoke began billowing out of the mezzanine floor, where he stored foam, synthetic cotton and rexine. Dey climbed up the wooden staircase to save his merchandise, but was trapped under a bundle of flaming foam sheets, which had rolled down from the shelves, Das said.																								Nitin Sen, who owns a shop adjacent to Deys, recounted: The shop went up in flames in minutes and was gutted before we could do anything. I knew Kaku since childhood and he loved his shop more than anything else. It is this love for the shop that resulted in his death. He risked his life in an effort to save the shop and died a painful death.																								Officer-in-charge Das said the fire-tenders reached the spot late, as they could not be informed in time. 																								According to people of the neighbourhood, they tried to contact the fire brigade but no one would answer the call. So, a couple of them had to cycle down to the nearby fire station on Hazra Road. By the time the firemen arrived, the situation was out of control, Das added.																								Saroj Kumar Dey, the victims elder brother, lamented: The shop was established in 1960 Prasanta helped my father run it. It was his effort that had made the difference and everyone knew the shop by its name. In fact, it prevented Prasanta from marrying. He lived with my family here in Ekdalia Place. I have lost a brother and a friend..																								Deys charred body was taken to SSKM Hospital and then sent for post-mortem. 																								The body will be handed over to the family tomorrow afternoon. Preliminary reports suggest that Dey may have died of suffocation caused by the dense smoke and was charred after that, said an officer of Kalighat police station.

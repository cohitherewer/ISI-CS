 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 Rare recipes on revival route 
 A bite of Baisakhi Byanjon at Oh! Calcutta. Picture by Pabitra Das Lost and increasingly rare recipes from the Bengali kitchen are the pick of Baisakhi Byanjon, the summer food festival starting at Oh! Calcutta from April 9.																								Over 20 Bengali recipes and 20 more from Calcutta cuisine are being revived for the 10-day festival, some of which can be traced back over 300 years, according to chef Joymalya Banerjee.																								Some of the summer specialities are light on the palate and easy on the tummy. But even if they are not, these shouldnt be missed. Start with the delightful Murgir Shalmi, which is a crispy concoction created from chicken breast, stuffed with bekti and baganer moshla (mint, coriander, shulpo, local parsley and celery). Celery could be evidence of the British influence, according to the chef.																								For a continental starter, try the Prawn Stuffed Mushroom, a juicy explosion of flavour, spiced up with oregano and chilli flakes. Bhapa Chhana  and a number of other steamed dishes  acts as a reminder that Bengali food can be far healthier than perceived to be.																								Bangal recipes dominate the main course. Dudh Koi is an unforgettable blend of just the right amount of mustard in a milk-based gravy. Lau Kakra is a spicy, full-bodied variation of the usual chingri preparation. Jagurather Manghshor Kalia, a recipe apparently invented by a cook called Jagurath, is more like a rezala than a rich kalia, with mutton cooked in yoghurt and cashew gravy.																								For dessert, the Daber Payesh is highly recommended. Succulent strips of tender coconut add a delicate taste to kheer, flavoured with pistachios.																								On till April 18, a festive meal, timed to coincide with Poila Baisakh, should put you back by around Rs 300.Sultry soothersIf desi khana was ruled off your list of summer lunch options, you could be missing out on some sumptuous specialities. Maharaja restaurant on Jawaharlal Nehru Road has lined up a range of summer treats. Keeping flavour intact, the one-and-half-year old multi-cuisine restaurant has created a soothing selection of classic favourites. 																								The popular Chelo Kebab has found its way into the menu, with butter naan, green tomatoes and boiled vegetables thrown in with the usual platter of buttered rice, Mutton Seekh Kebab and Chicken Reshmi Kebab. While the Kasturi Kebabs melts in the mouth, they are also light on the stomach.																								A kebab platter isnt a bad idea either, especially since chef Arup Ganguly has avoided overdosing on spice. Dahi Kebab, Vegetable Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kebab and Stuffed Tandoori Aloo constitute the vegetarian platter.																								A salad spread includes chicken (smoked and in mayonnaise) and papaya salad in honey sauce. A fruit platter throws together fresh fruits with yoghurt and honey. The summer coolers are worth a try as well.																								The most expensive dish on the menu is the assorted kebab platter, at Rs 195. The 80-seater restaurant is also geared up for Poila Baisakh. Coughing up Rs 240 (all inclusive), foodies can dig into Chilli Fish, Mutton Kasa, Murgh Methi, Vegetable Jhalfrezi, Baked Methi Chaman Bahar, Vegetarian Manchurian, and a host of interesting salads and desserts.																								Poila Baisakh is a great excuse for everyone to eat out. So we have designed our buffet keeping in mind the tastes of all, not just Bengalis, explains Joydeep Ganguly, proprietor, Maharaja. Live actCustomised cooking doesnt come from moms kitchen alone. You can have it your way at the ongoing Italian food festival at MBD Airport Hotel as well.																								What sets this fest apart from the usual assortment of pastas and pizzas are live counters where customers get to choose their own toppings, sauces and even cheeses. For the pizza, one gets to experiment with a mix of tomato cancasse, Mozzarella, capsicum, onion, mushroom, chillies, tomato, chicken julienne, Bolognaise sauce and chicken sausage, which is baked in front of you.																								Playing with pasta is as exciting, with a range of sauces to choose from. These include the Alfredo, Arrabiata, Coriander Pesto, Bolognaise, Sundried Tomato, and Marinara. These can be tossed with broccoli, mushrooms, babycorn and capsicum. Those unfamiliar with the nuances of Italian cuisine will have to rely on instinct to choose between a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, chilly flakes, oregano, basil, crushed peppercorn and olive oil.																								Novices can rely on chef Michael DCosta, who knows just the right amount to pep up the most uninteresting mix. Authentic Italian cuisine is a little bland for Indian taste. Thus we try to spice up the risottos and pastas a little, he explains.																								The fixed menu offers Vellutata Di Patate (country-style potato soup), Tagliatelle Alla Vincentera (Tagliatelle noodles with cream and radish), Risotto Ai Funghi Misti (rice with mushroom), Filetto Di Pesce In Padella Con Patate and Zucchini (marinated fish served with potatoes and zucchini), Ai Frutti Di Mare Pizza (with mixed sea food), Panna Cotta (a dessert with eggs and fresh cream) and more. The festival is on at The Poolside Caf till April 12.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA, SOMA BANERJEE AND SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Subrata blind to Behala blisters
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Clogged drains. Broken roads. Dry taps. For an estimated two million residents, the Behala-Thakurpukur belt is Calcuttas latest hellhole. 																								And the 18 councillors of the area  10 from the Trinamul Congress, six from CPM, and one Congress (another seat lies vacant after the councillors death)  believe that mayor Subrata Mukherjee is keen only on improving areas in Calcutta proper. 																								Residents fear that the water crisis will turn acute as the summer peaks. Also, since the drains are not being desilted, the belt  comprising boroughs XIII and XIV of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)  will be flooded during the monsoon. 																								The councillors have tried to draw the mayors attention to the crises, without much success. Most of them were even surprised to see the budgetary allotment cut down drastically, leading to severe disruption in urgent civic work in the area. 																								Every time the matter was raised by us councillors, the mayor assured us he would look into it. But nothing was done, a councillor claimed on Wednesday. The budgetary allocation stayed truncated. This discrimination between the city proper and the added areas is unfortunate. It appears the mayor is least bothered about the added areas. The Behala-Thakurpukur belt stands deprived due to it, the councillor added.																								When the drastic cut in every budgetary head was pointed out to the mayor, he said it was an error committed by a section of officers supervising the matter. He had promised rectification. And there the matter ended.																								With the next CMC election round the corner, the councillors are confused about how they will explain to the residents the lack of development work in the area. 																								Leader of the Opposition in the CMC Nirmal Mukherjee said the mayor had held out assurances that the water crisis would ease from June. He simply gives assurances, but is least bothered about the development of the added areas. The mayor forgets he was elected by the councillors of the added areas, he said.																								Congress leader of the CMC Sailen Dasgupta held a similar view. He said: I had requested the mayor to look into the drinking water scarcity in east Behala. He did not respond. I had to get the job done by borrowing money from different sources.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004  Calcutta Column
 For every Jennifer Lopez, there is a Jodie Foster who prefers to stay away from the spotlight and let her work do all the talking. The Silence of The Lambs star has really been lying low for quite some time now and her dream project Flora Plum remains mired in problems ranging from funds to dates.But dont panic, Jodie hasnt come to a stop: she is all set to play a cameo opposite Audrey Amelie Tatou in Jean-Pierre Jeunets French romantic drama A Very Long Engagement. Set in World War I, the film centres on a woman (Tatou) who tries to clear the name of her missing fianc a soldier who was pushed into no-mans land as punishment for trying to escape the trenches. Based on the acclaimed novel by Sebastien Japrisot, the film is sure to be in the running for the Best Foreign Film Oscar. Jodie, who speaks fluent French, will reportedly go uncredited for her performance.While it seems unlikely that Foster fans in Calcutta would get easy access to this French film, slated to release in November, theres hope on the small screen, though. HBO brings to you not one but as many as four shows of the Panic Room.The film finds Jodie playing Meg Altman, who along with her daughter takes refuge in a supposedly hacker-proof panic room in their new apartment, when three intruders led by Burnham (Forest Whitaker) break in. What follows is a gripping tale where the room becomes more of a Rubiks cube where intruders are challenged to break the code and enter. The show times are: August 14 at 9 pm, August 28 at 12 midnight, August 31 at 6.45 pm, and September 2 at 9 pm.Remember Koena Mitra moving to the Sunidhi Chauhan number Khullam Khulla in the Ram Gopal Varma production Road? If you do, you must have also read how Koena openly declared that she would not to do another item number in her career. In fact she was turning down item numbers one after the other. One of them being the Khakee chartbuster Aisa Jadoo Dala Re that did some heavy-duty magic to Lara Dattas market value.But now the dusky Bengali beauty is getting back into the swing of things. Not only would Koena be dancing to two songs (Saaki and Sun Suniyo) for Sanjay Guptas much-hyped erotic thriller Musafir, she has a meaty role in the film and is also on the judges panel for the Musafir Item Bomb contest.The confusion over Koena does not end there. First there was talk that Yana Gupta was doing the item number(s). Then the buzz was that Koena had replaced Yana, before rumours settling down to Yana doing one and Koena the other.When contacted in Mumbai, director Sanjay Gupta set the dance track record straight: No, Yana is not doing an item number in my film.Koena, on her part, is very particular about what her role in the film should be defined as. I am not doing item numbers in the film. Musafir will be my big debut where I play an important role opposite Anil Kapoor, the Calcutta girl said from Bangkok on Wednesday. Cheers!Werent you impressed with Wasim Akrams commentary on Star Sports exclusively Hindi broadcast during the recently-concluded Asia Cup? If he had been struggling a bit to put the verbal yorkers on the spot in English, he was back to reverse-swing rhythm in a language closer home.And how much of an effort did it take? Not much youd think. And youd be wrong. Remember that Akram may speak fluent Hindi thanks to his familiarity with Urdu, but his love affair with the printed word did not, in Fida-speak, have the perfect ending.Despite all the key graphics, players names and the lot being slapped on the screen in Hindi, the sultan of swing managed just fine. On the ball from minute one, Waz would memorise as many graphic formats as he possibly could and then fill in the blanks with calculated guesses. Co-commentators, too, did their bit and more.But one of the best students of the game of our times is fast learning to vault the language barrier. Heres wishing Wasimbhai happy learning! Its a kids show with a purpose, a muppet show with a difference. Sesame Street, the US television show with a massive following, is making its Indian debut in a special format. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is helping the furry muppets like Elmo, Cookie, Bert and Ernie aim for a place in the hearts of Indian kids, particularly pre-schoolers in the rural areas.With a $500,000 grant from USAID, Sesame Workshop, the non-profit educational organisation will design and develop an Indian version of the series, featuring its own, specially created Indian muppets. The programme will prepare children for school by introducing them to simple concepts and encourage them to use their imagination, think independently and appreciate the diversity of their surroundings.Sesame Workshops goal is to create engaging educational content where there is a need, says Gary E. Knell, Sesame Workshops President and CEO. We are thrilled to begin the process in India and are thankful to USAID for their generous support, he adds. The show will particularly try to reach pre-schoolers in rural areas who do not have access to television. In addition to broadcasting on national and cable TV, the series will be adapted for radios. Special print and video materials will also be designed to reinforce key programme messages. The effort will build in special elements to encourage girls to attend school and be treated equally.Materials for the programme will be developed in consultation with Indian educators, media programmers and child development experts. They will also draw on experience gathered from over 20 developing countries, including Egypt and South Africa. The project is supported by USAIDs Global Development Alliance (GDA) initiative, which seeks to combine the strengths and resources of the public and private sectors to build ownership for local development initiatives.

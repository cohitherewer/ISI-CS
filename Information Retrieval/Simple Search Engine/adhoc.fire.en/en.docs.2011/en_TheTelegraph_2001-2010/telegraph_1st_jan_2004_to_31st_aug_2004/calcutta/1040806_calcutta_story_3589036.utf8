 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Hunger salt on grief scars
 																											- Dhananjoys family penniless, neighbours sorry but helpless OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dhananjoy Chatterjees family in Kurudi, 270 km from Calcutta, is going without food. 																								But overwhelming grief is not the only reason for fasting. They do not have the money to buy rice or crush wheat.																								Two persons came to our house today and paid Rs 300. With that, we bought rice, oil and some other commodities, said Banshidhar, Dhananjoys father, on Thursday. 																								We did not have the money to crush the 52 kg of wheat given to us by the block development officer, the 77-year-old added. 																								Banshidhar is unable to think of the future. I am tired and exhausted after the long battle. I cannot think about anything now, he said. 																								His two granddaughters, Chaitali (13) and Bulbuli (15), both students of Class VIII of Chhatna Basuli Balika Vidyalaya, did not go to school on Thursday. 																								We have eaten nothing, so we could not go to school, Chaitali elaborated. 																								Dhananjoys mother, Belarani, 67, bedridden since Wednesday, after she heard the news of the President turning down their mercy plea, could hardly speak.																								Gangadhar, eldest son of Banshidhar, was out to earn something. The 52-year-old is a graduate but jobless. He depends on private tuition. 																								However, Gangadhar has failed to get any new pupils this academic session as he was busy running to Calcutta trying to save his condemned brothers life throughout the months of June and July.																								His brother, Bikash, 32, who works in a local cycle repair shop, also lost his daily wages for the same reason. 																								All our efforts and money have gone down the drain. We are finished, Bikash said. We will do what the social organisations (helping the family), tell us to do, he added. 																								The younger brother went to the local nagarik committee to bail them out of the crisis.																								The family owned 12 bighas, of which eight were sold and four mortgaged to fight the long legal battle. 																								The Chatterjees neighbours, around 10 families, expressed helplessness. We ourselves are too poor. Even if we want to, we cannot help them, pleaded Gurupada Barui.																								The Chhatna Nagarik Committee will meet within a day or two to decide whether it can help the Chatterjees if they move court again. 																								We are devastated, said Prabhat Chatterjee, president of the committee. The organisation had sought clemency and even organised dharnas in Calcutta. 																								We are exploring every avenue to extend help to the family and save it from ruin, he said.

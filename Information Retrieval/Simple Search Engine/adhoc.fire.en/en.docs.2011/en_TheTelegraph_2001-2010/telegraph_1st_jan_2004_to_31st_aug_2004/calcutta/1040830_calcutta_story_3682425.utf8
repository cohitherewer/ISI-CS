	Stray animals are becoming a menace for two-wheelers on highways. Recently, my husband and I met with an accident while we were travelling on a two-wheeler on a highway. A dog, trying to cross the road, almost came under the wheels. My husband lost control of the motorcycle and we were thrown off it. Thankfully, we escaped with very minor injuries.

	Of late, many kindergarten schools and Montessoris have sprouted in and around the city, as it has become a profitable business proposition. Most guardians rush their wards, even two-year-olds, to these institutes, which claim to prepare the tots for clearing the admission tests in reputed schools. But some teachers in these schools are not properly trained to handle the kids. Guardians should verify the credentials of the faculty in these pre-nursery schools beforehand.

	Quality spares of tape recorders and radio sets are not easily available in the market these days. Reputed companies should continue manufacturing these spares as it is part of their after-sales customer service. The government should also roll out schemes to keep the local radio set manufacturing industry alive.

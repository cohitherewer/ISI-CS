Make Calcutta Better
Chandni Chowk Anyone who has ever had to travel to  or through the Chandni Chowk market area would know what we mean by the three-wheel threat (picture above by Pabitra Das).The Park Circus-Chandni Chowk autorickshaws overrun the entire area. It is mission impossible to drive through this stretch without having to turn off the car engine for a full 10 minutes and fuming why the administration cant get the basics on the ground right before embarking on its flights of transport-plan fancy. I quite agree that the autos in the Chandni area create a lot of chaos, admits Anadi Sahu, general secretary of the West Bengal Auto Rickshaw Operators Union. At present, the number of autos exceeds passenger demand. The only way out is to shift some of the autos to other routes.Wanted: a modicum of method in the auto madness, to give Chandni a chance.

 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 A wow for women in white
 															- WONDERFUL... BUT WHERES THE VIBE? SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 Hi, what are you doing here? was how Sourav Ganguly greeted surprise visitor Mandira Bedi on Wednesday afternoon. Both were at Eden Gardens, she to promote womens cricket and he to practise for Pakistan on the indoor pitches. Picture by Pabitra Das																								It was the first visit to Eden Gardens for crickets first lady  no, not Dona Ganguly. The lush green and the vast expanse bowled Mandira Bedi over. But the presence of hardly a handful of people at the third One-Day International between the Indian and West Indian womens teams stifled that wow somewhat.																								Ive heard so much about the stadium, its wonderful to finally be here, gushed the woman in all-white  top, Capri, sneakers and transparent glasses. But wheres the vibe and energy that you associate with the stadium? she asked, pointing at the empty stands.																								Mandiras one-day tryst with the city of her birth was to try and set that right  to bring patrons and people to the womens game. After changing the face  and figure  of mens cricket, shes now firm on doing the star turn for the women in flannels.																								The actress-cum-model-cum-presenter (not a commentator, she insists) has convinced diamond brand Asmi to sponsor the Indian womens team. Ive become very shameless now when it comes to asking for funds for womens cricket, she admits. Whenever I come across corporates rooting for womens empowerment, I tell them theres a bunch of girls they can help. A bank and a household appliances company have already pledged funds.																								Between cheering her Team India and chatting with players and officials, Mandira took her mission forward by meeting the two big men of Bengal  and Indian  cricket.																								First up, a 20-minute tete-a-tete with Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya, seeking institutional support for the womens game.																								Then, a brief encounter with Sourav Ganguly. Learning that the Indian captain had padded up for a session on a concrete square, Mandira did not let go the chance to wish him well for the showdown across the border.																								Ten Sports, holding exclusive rights to the series, is categorical about not doing a Mandira, but the star of Sonys World Cup 2003 coverage will be making it to Pakistan after all. Mandira will be travelling to Lahore for two matches  not to steal the show on the small screen, but to pen media columns.																								Film, television and theatre actress; cricket and Bollywood presenter; product endorser and crusader for womens cricket  Mandira admits shes still trying to find her calling. The Jill of all trades has just finished her first film as heroine (Shaadi ka Laddoo, directed by her husband) and till Tuesday night was busy shooting for her second lead role in Divorce, before packing her bags for the Calcutta touch-and-go.																								But Wednesday evening, after duly crowning the victorious Indian team, was meant to spent at her maasis place in New Alipore, not too far from Woodlands Nursing Home, where Mandira was born.

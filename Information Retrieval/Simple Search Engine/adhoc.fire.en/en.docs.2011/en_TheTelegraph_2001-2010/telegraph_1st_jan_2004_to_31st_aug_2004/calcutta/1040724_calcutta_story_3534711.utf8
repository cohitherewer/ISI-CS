The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 First class aplenty, masters seats few
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Too many high performers, a limited number of seats and a deeply worried university. 																								Calcutta University (CU) announced on Friday the results of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II (Honours) exams, throwing up a record number of first class-holders, who are expected to throng CU for admission to post-graduate courses in each stream. 																								While I compliment the high performers, I am afraid many of them may face a problem getting admission to post-graduate courses, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).																								The number of seats in some of our post-graduate courses is very limited. We are trying to find out a means of accommodating as many students as possible, he added. 																								An estimated 40,000 students from about 200 under-graduate colleges in and around Calcutta took the exams in April. The results were announced within 56 days of the completion of the written examinations.																								This year, 1,302 students have got a first class in B.Sc Part II, against 993 last year.																								In BA, 196 examinees have scored 60 per cent and above, compared to 174 last year.																								It is the second time in as many years that a large number of students have got a first class in the Part II (honours) exams. 																								Das said CU had noticed the trend of a growing number of high performers in subjects like commerce, geography, physics and botany since last year. 																								We may find it difficult to accommodate them in post-graduate courses because the number of high-scorers is higher than the number of seats, Das said.																								Citing an example of a department where a seat shortage is expected, CU officials said the M.Com course can accommodate 850 students. 																								After Fridays B.Com Part II results, 1,056 first class-holders will make a preliminary bid for admission.																								That means, 206 students who have scored first-class marks in this years B.Com Part II (Honours) will not get an opportunity to enrol for the post-graduate course. Students with high second-class marks, too, will be shut out, an official said.																								Following a students agitation last year, after many high-performing CU graduates were denied admission to the universitys post-graduate courses because of a scarcity of seats, the state government introduced teaching of post-graduate courses in some under-graduate colleges. 																								Higher education department sources said this time, it would not be possible to open new post-graduate courses in any under-graduate college.

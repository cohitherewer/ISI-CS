 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Debts drive dawn suicide
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The early-morning calm in the serpentine bylanes off Sahitya Parishad Street was shattered on Sunday when a still-groggy Sikha Das found her husband hanging dead in the bathroom, with a towel around his neck. That was around 6 am.																								Sambhunath Das, 40, committed suicide by hanging himself with a gamchha, police said. 																								He left a note, saying he was ending his life since he had run up large debts that he could not repay. The body was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and from there, for post-mortem.																								We had dinner with my family. He did not mention anything about any debts. In fact, he never told me anything about borrowing money, was all Sikha could say between sobs. 																								He wrote that he was mentally depressed, but had not shown any signs of depression lately, she added. The narrow and dingy courtyard was packed with mourning members of both families.																								Though the Das couple lived on Goabagan Street, they slept at Sikhas parents place on Sahitya Parishad Street. Sambhunath spent Saturday at home, and went to his in-laws, a five-minute walk away, late in the evening. 																								The couple had dinner with the rest of Sikhas family at around midnight, and retired, as usual. No one suspected that Sambhunath would commit suicide some time in the night.																								Sambhunath was the eldest of four brothers. The brother immediately younger to him died of jaundice more than a decade ago. 																								Along with his two brothers, Sambhunath worked on contract, punching and pasting labels and making cardboard packages for locally-produced perfumes. He married Sikha 10 years ago, but the couple had no children. 																								Earning anything between Rs 100 and Rs 500 per head per day, as and when they received contracts, the Das brothers supported a family of 12. 																								Relatives said it was possible that Sambhunath had borrowed money from an acquaintance at the workshop he sometimes got contracts from, though they could not say where the workshop was located or who ran it. 																								An investigation has been initiated, an officer of Burtola police station said. 																								We will question Sambhunaths brothers about the workshops they got jobs from. Our priority will be to find out exactly whom he owed the money to and what the amount was, the officer added.

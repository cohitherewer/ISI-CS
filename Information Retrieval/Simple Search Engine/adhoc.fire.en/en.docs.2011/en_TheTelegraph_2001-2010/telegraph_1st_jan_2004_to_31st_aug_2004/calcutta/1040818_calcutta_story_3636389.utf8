The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Brief blackout at non-prime time
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bob the Builder on Pogo: Beam bandh																								For Mohan, it was an agonising six hours without advertisements on television. For Mini, his mother, making him eat on a Tuesday minus the small-screen jingles was mission impossible. Mohan is nine months old.																								Three-and-a-half-year-old Ayush couldnt understand why the Pogo screen went blank when Bob The Builder was to have been on beam. He coaxed his mother to take him to his grandparents place. But there, too, the TV played truant.																								Across town, from roughly 10 am to 4 pm, it was the same story of kids being denied their favourite afternoon fare  and adults missing out on the Olympics, the soaps and cinema  thanks to the cable blackout called by multi-system operators (MSOs).																								The 24-hour bandh to protest the Centres decision to hike service tax and levy education cess on the industry was aborted by the sixth hour with MSOs under pressure from the government, viewers and cable operators to cut it short.																								Considering the inconvenience of viewers, the pressure from cable operators and on the request of the government, we decided to call off the strike early, said Amit Nag, CEO of RPG Netcom, the largest city MSO.																								Barring CableComm, the other three MSOs (RPG Netcom, SitiCable and Manthan) switched off feed around 10 am. As announced on Monday, Doordarshans National and News channels and a handful of private news channels remained on air on the cable networks. Local cable channels beaming movies and songs were also untouched. Each of the MSOs scrolled a message informing viewers of the cause of the blackout. By 4 pm, however, they were all back on air.																								The timing and short duration of the blackout prevented it from denting the fortunes of the channels. It is certainly not desirable for any channel to go off air for even a few minutes, said the city representative of an entertainment bouquet. But due to the comparatively low viewership during that specific time-period, there were really no problems, he added.																								Among those playing the dual role of actor and parent, Sabyasachi Feluda Chakraborty said before the brief blackout: As an actor, I am certainly not happy if our programmes are blocked My sons, who watch AXN, Cartoon Network, History and sports channels, wouldnt throw a tantrum, but will certainly sulk if there is a cable blackout.

 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Mock split for tax benefit
 																											- High court refuses to allow house rent plea on separation grounds OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Marriage for gain is passe. Separation for tax and other benefits is the order of the day. 																								Couples are filing false divorce cases to obtain income-tax and other financial benefits, Calcutta High Court observed on Tuesday. This court will not be a spectator to the current practice by many working couples of misleading the court by instituting false cases of legal separation for the sole purpose of enjoying income-tax and other financial benefits, Justice Barin Ghosh declared.																								Central to the judges observation was a petition filed by a city schoolteacher, pressing for a directive to a government-aided school to pay her a house-rent allowance (HRA).																								They (the school authorities) have not been paying the allowance because my husband, who works for a state-run firm, is availing of the same allowance, she said in her petition. 																								I do not see how you can claim to have a case, the judge said. How can you expect the same allowance that your husband is already drawing?																								The teacher tried to convince the judge on two points: a Supreme Court ruling earlier on a similar case and, more important, her stated separation from her Chandernagore-based husband. 																								Do not try to mislead the court, because we know how couples are increasingly filing false divorce cases for tax and other benefits. We cant let this happen, the judge told her.																								Salaried husbands and wives, supposed to file their returns after clubbing respective incomes under Section 64 of the Income-Tax Act, are often filing the returns under Section 139 as separate individuals.																								There are couples who try to avoid Section 64 and, at the same time, obtain certain financial allowances by taking recourse to false divorce cases, says Saradindu Biswas, tax consultant. 																								Justice Ghosh on Tuesday said the court would not readily issue a directive on payment of financial benefits to couples approaching it for divorce. The court will first ascertain that it is not getting misled by a mock battle between husband and wife, whose sole objective is to garner financial benefits without actually going in for separation.																								Justice Ghosh also said the Supreme Court ruling in a similar case could not be regarded as a precedent because the petitioners combined HRA drawal was lower than the limit.

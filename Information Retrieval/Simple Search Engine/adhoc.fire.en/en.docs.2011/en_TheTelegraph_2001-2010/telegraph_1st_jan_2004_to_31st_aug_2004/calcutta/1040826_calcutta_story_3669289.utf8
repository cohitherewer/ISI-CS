 South Dum Dum (one vat)Projection: Better runways, more flights and, perhaps, distinction as a hub of Southeast Asian operations.																								Reality: Too many crows, too much garbage. 																								For all the facelift at Calcutta airport, aimed at ensuring passenger safety, pilots have complained of one hazard: crows, drawn by tonnes of garbage dumped along VIP Road.																								The airport authorities, in a tizzy, have shot off a letter to home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, also chairman of the airports environment committee, urging him to ensure that the area is cleared immediately. 																								I have written to the district magistrate, home secretary, police and all authorities concerned to do something immediately, or else a disaster will occur any day, said airport director Rajendra Pal.																								The eight-km stretch of VIP Road, between MBD Airport Hotel and Ultadanga, is flanked by mounds of litter, attracting murders of crows and emitting an unbearable stench. 																								The situation came to light recently when some pilots, while landing or taking off, noticed the garbage and the army of scavengers in the air. They raised the alarm. If the crows come very close to the aircraft, the lives of the passengers will be at stake, said an air safety officer. 																								The three neighbouring municipalities of Rajarhat-Gopalpur, Dum Dum and South Dum Dum are responsible for dumping the garbage. 																								Dum Dum municipality chairman Dipak Bhattacharya, however, pleaded innocence: We dont dump garbage near the airport. Our garbage vats are emptied at Mathkal, near Bediapara, in Dum Dum. But since the affected stretch of VIP Road falls within the civic bodys jurisdiction, he promised to look into it.																								Teghoria, Baguiati, Keshtopur market and Sribhumi are the worst-hit areas. We have two vats in Teghoria, in which garbage from various blocks are dumped. The municipalitys vans collect the waste from there and dump it at Mathkal. Well review the system and consider whether it can be improved, said Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur civic body. 																								Residents often pay garbage-lifters and make them carry even carcasses. The municipality vans usually dont clear them. The carcasses are left to rot beside VIP Road, Chatterjee added.																								Adding to the woes, a group of ragpickers has taken up residence on the road. Well evict them soon. They have wrested control of the area, Chatterjee asserted.

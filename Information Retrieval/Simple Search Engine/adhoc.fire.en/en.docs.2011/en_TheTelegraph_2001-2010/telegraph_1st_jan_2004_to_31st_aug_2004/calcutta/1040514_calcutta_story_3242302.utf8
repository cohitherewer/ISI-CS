																								Muk Academy celebrates its 23rd anniversary with a mime show based on Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyays literary masterpiece, Pather Panchali. Directed by Mukul Dev, the show wonderfully recreates immortal moments from the novel, enabling the audience to relive the passions and emotions, agonies and ecstasies experienced by the principal characters, Apu and Durga. It also gives us an opportunity to share with Apu and Durga the pleasure and excitement of their innocent, childhood adventures. Through beautifully controlled and modulated gestures and expressions, the mime artists articulate the wonder, betrayal, pain and pathos, that the siblings experience. Apart from the playful moments that they share together, the scene where the children experience sheer joy and wonder on seeing a train go past them is particularly memorable.																								Event: A mime show of Pather Panchali by Muk Academy																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

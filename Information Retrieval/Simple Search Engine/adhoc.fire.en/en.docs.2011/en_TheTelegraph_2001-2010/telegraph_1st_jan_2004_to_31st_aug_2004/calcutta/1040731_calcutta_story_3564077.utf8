 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Sushmita batchmates denied bail
 A STAFF REPORTER																								They walked into the packed courtroom with a stony expression. After a one-and-a-half hour wait, they were escorted out on the verge of tears.																								Suparna Sengupta (Banerjee), Rajib Choudhury and Debanjan Das, the prime accused in the Sushmita Dhar case, were remanded in jail custody on Friday. The rejection order on the bail petition filed by the defence counsel was pronounced by additional chief judicial magistrate Sagarmoy Ghosh after lawyers representing both the sides were engaged in a joust lasting three days.																								By noon, all the three accused had arrived at the Alipore courtroom. Gone was the shyness exhibited over the past three days during the legal battle. Numerous Criminal Investigation Department (CID) plainclothesmen were present, and Sushmitas relatives took their place on the wooden benches behind the rows occupied by the lawyers. After a wait, the judge summoned both the prosecution and the defence counsels to the bench and announced the decision rejecting the bail plea. 																								Sushmita Dhar, an MA student of Jadavpur University, went on a pleasure trip to Chandipur in the company of seven others on May 13, 1995. She went missing on May 16, and the rest of the group returned home without her. The government ordered the case to be reopened after her parents met the home secretary in June, when the CID found fresh evidence in the form of photographs of bloodstained nightwear, which was identified as Sushmitas.																								The nightwear was recovered by a private detective agency engaged by Suparnas father about a month after Sushmita went missing. The case took a curious turn at this point, when the agency was ordered to return, and the matter was hushed up. 																								Coincidentally, Shyamal Dhar, Sushmitas father, approached the same private detective agency about a month ago, and found out its previous findings. Outside the courtroom, Sushmitas elder sister Arpita Chakraborty said: All we want to know is what happened to Sushmita and where she is.

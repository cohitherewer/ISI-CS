Window to life: The St James School theatre group presents its take on a slice of Calcutta life through Window, at the 26th School Drama Festival of Original One-act Plays, organised by the British Council last weekend at Kala Mandir. The team portrayed an ordinary day at a roadside tea stall. Picture by Sanjoy ChattopadhyayaCalcuttas denizens (two, four, even six-legged) and spirits, its high and low life, changes and constancy, feel-good and feel-bad factors, luxuriating in it and lampooning it, pervaded a packed Kala Mandir over the weekend. British Council gave young metropolitans the theme of Catching up with Calcutta to go to town with at its 26th School Drama Festival.				 				 																															No prizes for guessing that a myriad problems dominated the pie graph. Apeejay School shared the best actress award with a sensitive study of single women lured to the big city, realistically depicting suburban train travel to guitar rhythms and the typical characters on an EMU local. Julien Day Ganganagar presented a more conventional tragic murder of an idealistic crusader against garbage in parks, drug peddling and construction mafia.				 				 																															Calcuttas spirits (human, not liquid) were invoked by Don Bosco Park Circus and La Martiniere (boys). The former exposed child labour, pollution and corruption but, best of all, used a detailed panoramic scenic cutout of the cityscape that riveted the eye and any regular theatre group would envy. La Martiniere shared the team-effort prize for placing the spirits of a grandfather and grandson in conflict over value systems and their rapprochement, the grandson winning the best actor award as a boogieing councillor.				 				 																															The changing urban face formed the subject of two other schools. Modern High wrote the most moving play, about the reunion of a puchkawala with his favourite customer, a girl now grown up, returning after many years. The girl acting the puchkawala shared the best actress award. St Augustines treated the contrast between old and new generations.				 				 																															Calcutta International raised the issue of sexual abuse of women, but failed to contextualise it in Calcutta (it happens everywhere). However, they won the technical prize for an unusual application of shadow theatre on the backcloth.				 				 																															More imaginative aesthetics came from Cambridge School and St Xaviers, on the marginalisation of arts in our city. In the former, a producer rejects a dramatists symbolism as not popular enough; Cambridges Indian dance choreography of fire, water, sky and soul distinguished it from other participants. Similarly, St Xaviers produced a mature, stylised treatment of the decline in importance given to arts. Although influenced by Stoppards Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, they deserved an award (if nothing else, for best originally composed song) but in an ironic reflection of their thesis, received none.				 				 																															Then there were the feel-gooders. Birla High (girls) depicted a slice of life on a movie set epitomising the heart of Calcutta, Heritage School showed snippets from an ordinary day chosen by pupils for a project, and St James did the same for a roadside tea stall, with debts to Ionesco.				 				 																															Satire, both fanciful and outrageous, appeared, too. Don Bosco Liluah sent a Calcutta Police inspector as advisor to the moon, landing that utopia in anarchy. The image of our police faced the biggest battering at the fest. Its to their credit that they lent the kids their uniforms sportingly. Birla High (boys) took on ministers, one of whom lost his nose to a barber and got it back only after promising to fulfil earlier promises.				 				 																															Mans best friend and womans worst enemy joined the fun. As always, St Thomas had a hoot with costumes, amassing an army of cockroaches upset with recent plans to clean the city. The insects insurrection provided enough rock n roach to share the team-effort prize. Loreto House offered the endearing biography of a dear departed dog, done to death by cats, which won the honours for best concept. Even canines know that Calcutta has a heart!(Young Metro thanks Professor Ananda Lal of JU English for penning this piece) 				 				 																Fresh start 				 				 																															A fresh Interacting year kicked off in the Rotary International District 3290, with the installation ceremony of the Interact District Council for the year 2004-05. 				 				 																															Held on July 25, the 21-member council was led by district Interact representative Harsh Gupta from the Interact Club (IC) of MP Birla Foundation and district Interact secretaries Sangeet Shirodkar from IC Apeejay and Navneet Tibrewal from IC DBPC and treasurer Jayant Chowdhary from IC LSA.				 				 																															It was inspired by the ideals set by past district governor Prabhat Rohatgi and district chairperson, Interact committee, Rajni Mukherjee, and had help and support from the Rotary and Interact fraternities.				 				 																															Sangeet Shirodkar made an earnest appeal to all Interactors to rethink their priorities and bring the Rotary motto of Service before Self to the forefront. Also, coinciding with the bicentennial celebrations of Rotary International, the council announced a target of setting up a hundred Interact Clubs across District 3290, including in Nepal, during its tenure. Madhumita Das 				 				 																Governor speak				 				 																															Governor of Mizoram A.R. Kohli, an alumnus of IIM Calcutta, delivered a talk on Managerial organisational transformation in a hyper competitive world on July 23. He shared his experiences of various key posts he has held during his career in the hour-and-a-half-long interactive session with students.				 				 																															The first batch alumnus of IIMC stressed the need to cultivate and preserve the tradition and culture of an organisation to maintain its identity in todays competitive world. Character is measured in terms of temptations overcome, he told students, warning them off unethical practices in professional life. 				 				 																															The governor also praised the institute for maintaining a healthy tradition of personal touch among faculty and students. He urged the students to be job-creators rather than job-seekers. The former adviser (development) to the chief minister of Mizoram has been intimately associated with management development activities. He has conducted more than 300 workshops in human resource development, on subjects like team building, managing adverse environments and management of change.Century stand				 				 																															A hundred years of a legend were celebrated in style last week. The J.R.D. Tata Centenary Quiz was the event, July 29 was the date, and GD Birla Sabhagar was the venue. There were 57 participating teams in the preliminary rounds, from schools like St Thomas Boys, Scottish Church, St Lawrence, Queen of the Missions, LMB, Calcutta Boys, St Augustines, Calcutta Girls, DBPC, Don Bosco Liluah and Birla High (boys).				 				 																															The teams of three members each were asked 30 questions on subjects ranging from business to sports by quizmaster Charanpreet Singh. Some interesting facts were revealed  the plastic ends of shoe laces are called aglets, Hero is the worlds largest manufacturer of bicycles, Mother Teresa wrote a book titled The Simple Path and the Iron pillar influenced J.R.D. Tata to set up a steel plant.				 				 																															Six teams went forward for the finals  LMB, Birla High, St Augustines, Calcutta Boys, Don Bosco Liluah and DBPC. There were 10 rounds, comprising direct and general knowledge questions, audio, sports, visual, Who am I and more. The audience was also involved, with prizes for right answers. The youngest and oldest Australian Open champs, Tintin, Feluda, Dil Chahta Hai these topics were all touched upon. 				 				 																															Birla High was the winner with 88 points, way ahead of St Augustines (70 points) and Calcutta Boys (60 points). A short docu-feature on the life of J.R.D Tata was also screened. Anand Sen was the chief guest for the evening, with several personalities from the Tata Group also present. Asif Salam, Asutosh College, amp; Puja Agarwal, JD Birla InstituteProject Report Silent expressions
Walking, talking, lughing, crying but without words or sounds. Thats the art of mime. Exaggerated facial expressions and body language is the secret of this art form, something the students of Heritage School are privy to or at least the members of the Mime Club are. 
	The trainer, Subhendu Mukhopadyay, gives importance to fitness and agility, so every session begins with warm-up exercises, as well as interactive games.
	The physical aspect of drama is the emphasis of mime. So students learn special techniques like the four types of stationary walking military, stylised, weight-carrying and general and the glass illusion, which depicts a person on the other side of a wall or window. The 95 students are also treated to summer workshops on unique and fun skills like stilt-walking.
	Facial expressions are the other skill they are taught, to differentiate between moods, emotions and feelings. The activities include pointing exercises, shape-making, improvisation and improving powers of observation.

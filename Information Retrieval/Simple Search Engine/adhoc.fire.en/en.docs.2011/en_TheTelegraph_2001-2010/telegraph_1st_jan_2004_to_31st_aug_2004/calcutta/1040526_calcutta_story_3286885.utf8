 															- Howrah cable operators protest attacks, industry watchers blame lifestyle shift A STAFF REPORTER																								On Saturday, a cable operator was fatally wounded in Bally when three extortionists shot at him and then attacked him with choppers for failing to cough up some money.																								The day before, the house of a cable operator was burgled in Domjur.																								Though the two incidents are unrelated, the fact is that the cable operator, now more than ever, is being seen as a cash cow and the prime target for many, including those trying to regulate the cable industry, government officials and now criminals.																								These attacks on cable operators must stop immediately, feels Anindya Hazra, president of Howrah Cable TV Operators Association, which held a protest meeting at Howrah Sarat Sadan on Monday, and met the superintendent of police and district magistrate of Howrah about Saturdays attack. 																								Over the past 16 months, we had been anticipating something like this and alerted the police several times, but nothing was done, complained Hazra.																								Superintendent of police (Howrah) Mihir Bhattacharya, however, refused to tag cable operators a target group. We have no information that the person was attacked because he is a cable operator; it could have been due to other personal rifts, he said.																								If Hazra and his association members try to make the authorities sit up and take notice, industry insiders warn that the trend could only get worse with time. The changing lifestyle of cable operators is attracting a lot of attention from different quarters, said a cable industry observer.																								Due to rampant under-declaration, a section of cable operators is making a lot of money. As a result, an operator who may have been wearing Hawaii chappals and riding a bicycle till yesterday, is now sporting gold chains, toting expensive mobile phones and travelling in fancy cars, he alleged.																								There is a lot of disparity in the market, agreed an operator in Teghoria, who is known for declaring around 65 per cent, a figure much higher than the industry average. The problem is that the monthly subscriptions are more or less the same. So an operator who, like me, charges Rs 200, but declares less than half of what I do, gets to keep the rest.																								According to market estimates, around 7,200 operators serve nearly 1.8 million cable homes across the CMDA area. The collection from these households amounts to around Rs 320 crore annually. No more than Rs 60 crore flows back to the broadcasters. Also, nearly 70 per cent of operators earn Rs 12,000 to 15,000 per month, while the remaining 30 per cent earn around Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000, according to internal surveys.																								This has caught the eye of the authorities, too. Recently, the excise commission conducted a drive to recover service tax from a large section of defaulting operators. Police stations across the city were also instructed to gather information on cable operators in their areas, with details of the number of households under them.																								This comes even as the clamour regarding another impending revamp by broadcasters gathers ground in the market. There wouldnt be so many hikes if the operators made a proper declaration, announced the spokesperson for a broadcasting house.

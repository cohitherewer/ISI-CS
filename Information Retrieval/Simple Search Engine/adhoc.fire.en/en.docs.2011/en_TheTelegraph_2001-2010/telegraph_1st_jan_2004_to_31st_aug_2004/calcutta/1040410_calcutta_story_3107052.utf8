 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Cheat tag on 23 oil pumps
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The consumer affairs department has slapped a fortnights notice on 23 petrol pumps, guilty of cheating car-owners. The pumps have been ordered to rectify their equipment or face a penalty ranging from a cash fine to imprisonment.																								The department, which conducted a month-long check at 35 petrol pumps, found 23 of them across the city guilty of short-changing the customer.																								We have imposed a cash penalty on the rogue pump-owners, ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000, and also given them a fortnight to get their act right to avoid more stringent measures, said Ashok Bhattacharya, controller of legal metrology of the consumer affairs department.																								Officials who conducted the surprise raids said the 23 errant pump-owners had meters that were neither verified nor calibrated by the legal metrology department. This is mandatory for all fuel pump-owners.																								The inspectors also found the outlet nozzles of some pumps faulty. Most of the pump meters were tampered with, the intention being to cheat customers. The short supply varied from 50 ml to 200 ml per five litres of petrol or diesel, they said.																								The rogue pumps are located at Tollygunge, Garden Reach, Alipore, SN Banerjee Road, Cossipore, Bhangar, Howrah, APC Road and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road.																								In December last year, the consumer affairs department had raided some city pumps in the wake of complaints from customers. Nine pumps were pulled up for the offence and slapped with a cash penalty.																								The prices of petrol and diesel are shooting up, but pump-owners continue to cheat the customer. We will not tolerate this any more, asserted consumer affairs minister Naren De.																								According to officials, the penalty for short supply ranges from a cash fine of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. If the offence is repeated, the penalty is imprisonment up to two years, along with a cash fine of Rs 20,000.																								Legal metrology officials convened a meeting with the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association on Tuesday to discuss the fallout of their surprise raids at the petrol pumps. 																								Pump-owners tried to deflect the blame by complaining about short supply from the oil companies, but the officials were not ready to buy the argument.																								If you suspect less supply from the tankers, inform us. Our inspectors will rush to verify the quantity, controller Bhattacharya told the pump-owners. 																								Association president Jaydeb Sarkar washed his hands of the errant pump-owners. We dont mind if the government takes action against them, he said.

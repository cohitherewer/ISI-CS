	The state central library on CIT Road has huge collection  of books and caters to a large number of readers. But it  is a matter of regret that the water cooler machine which  used to provide relief to thirsty readers has stayed out  of order for the past four months or so. Inspite of repeated  requests, no step has been taken to repair it. I appeal  to the education department to address the issue. 
	 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane.  
	The swimming pool behind Howrah Girls College is said  to be the lungs of the town. But it has become extremely  polluted. Garbage is dumped on the west bank of the pool  which spills into the water. I urge the district magistrate  to take action. 
	 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, Collin Lane.  
	There is no public toilet on the vast stretch on Banaphool  Sarani in Lake Town. Pedestrians have been forced to turn  the area into a urinal. 
	 Biman Saha, Lake Town.

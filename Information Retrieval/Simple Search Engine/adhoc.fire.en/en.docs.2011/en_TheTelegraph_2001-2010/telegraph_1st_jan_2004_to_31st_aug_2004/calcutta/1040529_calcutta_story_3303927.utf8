The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Hundreds in trek for a trip to stardom
 A STAFF REPORTER																								As a member of a private security service, Sanjay Mandal is used to keeping things under check. But on Friday, he had to check something entirely different.																								Scores of young boys and girls were pacing up and down the balcony of Salt Lake Point School, Mandals seat of vigil, memorising lines for Indias Best Cinestars Ki Khoj contest. One of them thrust the script into his hand and started off, defying the decibel bar and stumping Mandal.																								Zee TVs across-the-nation (and beyond) talent hunt for the reel threw up moments of real-life passion in Calcutta, which has registered the highest number of applications (about 5,000) among the cities covered so far. 																								In the main hall, a frail young man was hurriedly scanning a page of the Samsad Hindi-English dictionary. A Bihar boy, he had taken the Ranchi-Hatia Express and checked into a hotel the night before so he could take a shot at stardom. There are grammatical mistakes in the lines they have given us. I need to correct that first, he said.																								Dreams come in different shapes and sizes. Or so the long queue (building up at the gate since 7 am, a good two hours before kick-off time) proved. The hunks and the not-so-handsome, the tall and the tough, the puny and plump had all lined up for a chance to star alongside Salman Khan, Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in a film to be produced by Zee Films.																								We are taking the show to 20 cities in India and five overseas. The idea was conceived by our chief Subhas Chandra as Bollywood, he feels, is increasingly becoming the domain of star children. This Rs 100-crore exercise is aimed to provide a platform for talent without scope, said Sanjay Arora, senior manager, channel promotion, Zee Telefilms.																								If it was all seriousness outside, the auditions glimpsed anti-climactic moments. Sunglasses in hand, headband holding back an unruly mane, a contestant in a bicep-bulging vest strutted into the room where TV director Ravi Rai (of Sailaab and Thoda Hai Thode ki Zaroorat Hai fame) was holding court. But two lines into the fiery courtroom dialogue, he suddenly started stammering and then fizzled out into blank silence. One more chance, sir, he pleaded.																								By Saturday evening, we will select 50 from these youths who will be groomed on Sunday morning by experts for the city finals, Rai said, taking a break from judging. We are hopeful of someone making it to the national finals from Calcutta as it is a city of art and theatre, he added.																								On Sunday evening, it will be up to judges Suchitra Krishnamurthy, Mohan Agashe and Rupa Ganguly to pick the fortunate four from the city.

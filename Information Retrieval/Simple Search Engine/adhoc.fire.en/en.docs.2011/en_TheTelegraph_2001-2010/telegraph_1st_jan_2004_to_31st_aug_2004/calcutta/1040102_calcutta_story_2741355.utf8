The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Weight in doubt, check it out
 																											- Customer complaint flurry spurs crackdown on markets, shops SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Wondering why a kg of sugar has run out sooner than it should? Check the weights the shopkeeper used. Also, watch out for the packets of biscuits or toffees with broken seals or names and other details not clearly printed.																								Complaints from consumers had spurred the government to launch a massive crackdown in city markets in the last week of 2003 and seize a large number of weights and scales, apart from food packets of dubious make.																								The consumer affairs department has taken penal action against nearly 50 traders for cheating customers and selling food packets that do not conform to rules. Officials said the punishment is a minimum fine of Rs 500 and a warning. If a trader repeats the offence, he faces a six-month jail term.																								We were surprised to find a large number of weights that had been tampered with in major markets like Gariahat, Lake Market, Santoshpur, Jadubabus Bazar, New Alipore, Maniktala and even the plaza at the Bengal Ambuja housing complex on the Bypass, said Ashok Bhattacharya, controller of legal metrology.																								Consumer affairs minister Naren De said it was a matter of concern that people were being duped by dishonest traders. We have asked our officers to continue raiding shops in the other markets, including grocers and departmental stores, he said.																								Inspectors who conducted the raids said the confiscated weights were either fake or had been tampered with. Many weights did not have authorisation, while some were found with cavities underneath. Some weights had their surfaces heavily rubbed. These unauthorised weights are 10 to 20 per cent less heavy than the genuine ones, they pointed out.																								The officials said several packets of biscuits, snacks and toffees were seized for not having batch numbers, the maximum retail price and the address of the manufacturers printed on them. Many were not even sealed.																								It is mandatory for traders to get the weights and scales verified by consumer department inspectors once every year. For any packaged commodity, it is also essential to print a six-point declaration on the top of the packet and it must be sealed, controller Bhattacharya said.																								The consumer affairs department has decided to organise awareness camps, in collaboration with NGOs, to help people identify fake weights and dubious packets of food items. 																								Officials will elaborate on the rules and regulations of weights and measures, and where complaints can be lodged in case of doubts. Meetings will also be held with different market associations and traders bodies, the department said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty								Singer																																							One cannot remain blind, like Dhritarashtra, to technological progress. If there is a facility, one should always avail of it. I use a cellphone myself and put across calls to find out how my father or my daughter is doing. But that does not mean one should use gadgets in an uncivilised manner. When there is no need, I keep my phone switched off. Thankfully, because of the kind of programmes I attend, I can choose my audience. Yet, I have also faced ringing of cellphones during performance. On such occasions, sometimes I pretend not to have heard and carry on while at other times I shut up and sit in silence for some time as if the fault was mine. If such people are so eager to keep in touch with their business relations, why dont they sit in the market with their phones instead of coming for cultural performances? They should be taken by the collar and thrown out. But what would the organisers do if the culprit turns out to be a head honcho?

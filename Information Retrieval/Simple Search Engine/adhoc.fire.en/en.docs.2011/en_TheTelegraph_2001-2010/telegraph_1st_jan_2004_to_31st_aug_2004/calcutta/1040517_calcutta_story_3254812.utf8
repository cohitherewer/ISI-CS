 Radiotherapy in progress at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySujit Kumar Dey: How costly is the treatment of the disease?																																																													The cost of treatment varies according to the stage and nature of the disease. In general, all three forms of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and use of radioactive rays) are costly. It is, indeed, ironic that till today, a person cannot avail of proper treatment if he does not have enough money. 																																																													 The chemicals used in the treatment of cancer are mostly manufactured by multinational companies, and the costs are unlikely to come down. Even if they do reduce their prices, the situation will remain unaltered, since the treatment for the disease is entirely controlled by a handful of private companies. Thus, we can safely assume that the cost of cancer treatment will not come down in the near future. 																																																													 Moreover, there is a prevalent trend of patients seeking treatment outside the state. I have myself observed that though the patients go to South India or to Mumbai for treatment, a sizeable portion of them return and continue the treatment right here. As a matter of fact, there are marketing teams, privately engaged by medical centres outside West Bengal, who mobilise patients to those centres. For instance, patients from Burdwan prefer to go to Chennai or Vellore for treatment, while patients from South 24-Parganas with the same ailment opt for treatment in Mumbai.

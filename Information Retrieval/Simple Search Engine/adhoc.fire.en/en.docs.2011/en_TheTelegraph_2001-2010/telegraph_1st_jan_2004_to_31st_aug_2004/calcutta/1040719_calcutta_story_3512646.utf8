Picture by Rashbehari Das																								 As its first birthday gift to Calcuttans, Veda, the north-west frontier cuisine restaurant on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, has launched a brand new menu. The eatery celebrates its first anniversary on July 19. 																								The menu launch on Thursday afternoon was graced by fashion designer Anamika Khanna, who dropped by with her sons to check out the new spread.																								The menu has been guided by the feedback we received from guests over the past year. While we have kept the popular items, many new additions have been made, said Prashant Tibrawalla, owner, Veda.																								The non-vegetarian section is intact, with a few poultry picks being added on. A few vegetarian options have been replaced, too.																								One can begin a meal at Veda with a Tamatar Ka Shorba (fresh tomato soup) or Murg Shorba (chicken broth flavoured with herbs and saffron and garnished with chicken quenelles).																								Both the starter and main course sections have ample choices for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. For the veggies, the Makai-Tak-A-Tin (American corn, diced capsicum, tomatoes and onions stir-fried in herbs) or the Charra Aloo Chatpata (baby potatoes with a tangy melange of mango powder, freshly broiled spices and green coriander) are must-tries.																								A trip to Veda would be incomplete without sampling the kebabs, particularly the melt-in-the-mouth Kakori Kebab (a blend of minced lamb and the chefs special spices, carefully skewered, char-grilled and finished with saffron), the Gelavat Ke Kebab (minced lamb medallions pan-fried) and the Murg Tikka Mirza Ilasnoo (morsels of chicken marinated in saffron-flavoured yoghurt with exotic spices and char-grilled). Another delicacy here is the Raan Veda, a whole leg of lamb cured with spices and pomegranate juice.																								For the main course, one can opt for the Machhali Ka Quorma (juicy chunks of fish marinated and shallow fried, finished in onion-based gravy) or the Murg Tikka Lababdar (boneless morsels of tandoori chicken flavoured with coriander and simmered in rich tomato gravy). To go with these, there is an assortment of breads and rice including Ulta Tawa Paratha, Lachhadar Paratha, Methi Paratha, Dum Biryani or a choice of pulao with mushrooms, jeera, dhania or vegetables. To round off the meal, theres the traditional Awadhi Shahi Tukda and a choice of other desserts from the Dessert Platter. A selection from Tamarind. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								The real south																								A word of warning: Dont go near the restaurant if you are in a hurry, as it may take a while for food to arrive on your table.																								 The dosa, idli, uttapam and curd-rice brigade should beware. Calcutta is finally waking up to authentic south Indian non-vegetarian cuisine.																								Welcome to Tamarind, the new addition to the food scene on Sarat Bose Road. Try the Chettinad Chicken if you are a spice freak or stick to the vegetarian or non-vegetarian stew from Kerala cooked with coconut milk if you are on a health watch. Whether its the biryani or the simple appam, this is south Indian food at its best. 																								 The dcor is in the style of a Tarwar, or a zamindars house. The portico, waiting area, finer details of wood-work on the ceiling and wooden window grills  the look and feel of the place is in keeping with the food.																								The interesting thing about this 50-seater restaurant is the space it offers to the guests. Each table is set three feet apart and a large section of the hall has been kept unfurnished to give a spacious look. Tables are also kept bare of frills, with napkins being the only linen in sight.																								The menu boasts of cuisine from four different southern states beginning with the easy-on-the-tongue Kerala, moving onto the slightly more spicy Karnataka and further up the spice ladder to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. 																								Among the many innovative things at the restaurant, the menu requires a special mention. The background of each page is made from a textile typical to a particular state. Thus the page with dishes from Kerala has Kasava as the backdrop while Bangalore silk decks up the Karnataka sheet. 																								For those who would like to have a quiet private meal with friends and family, Sadhya, the exclusive room meant for a 15-member team could be the perfect choice. 						SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

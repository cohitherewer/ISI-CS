 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a bid to inculcate managerial skills among working executives, the Vinod Gupta School of Management at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur is rolling out a two-year post graduate management programme for people already on the job. 																								The diploma programme, to be conducted in contact-cum-distance mode of instruction and learning, will start from July 27 and the classes will be held at the institutes campus in Salt Lake.																								Similar programmes will also be launched in Bhubaneshwar and Kharagpur. 																								With the forces of competition getting stronger in the industry, professionals are recognising the importance of being business savvy and are looking forward to opportunities to add value to their skills. Thats why we decided to offer this course, said Kalyan Chakravarti, director, Vinod Gupta School of Management. 																								Tailoring the course to match the needs and suit the timings of the working professionals was a challenge, he added. But after deliberations, the management school at the countrys premier technical institute drew up a four-semester programme with a proper mix of theory and practical exposure. 																								The students will have to do an industrial project in the summer quarter. 																								Pre-recorded audio-visual lectures on various subjects will be played three to four times a week as part of classroom training. Over the weekends, the students will get the opportunity to interact with teachers with the help of video conferencing facilities, added Chakravarti. 																								Admission tests for the programme will be conducted on May 1 and graduate professionals with two years of work experience are eligible to sit for the test. The course fee for the programme will be Rs 1,80,000. 																								To begin with, 25 students will be enrolled for the programme, but the authorities have plans to increase the intake. 																								We want to increase the number of seats once the course gets popular. We have unutilised space on our Salt Lake campus and we have plans to construct one more building there, he added.																								Though the institute will not offer any campus recruitment facilities to the students, they will receive some placement assistance, promised Chakravarti.

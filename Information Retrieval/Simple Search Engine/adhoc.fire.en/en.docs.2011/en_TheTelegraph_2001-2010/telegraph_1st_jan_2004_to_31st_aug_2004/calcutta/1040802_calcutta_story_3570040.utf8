The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Airline, healthcare majors in medical tourism tie-up 
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 																								Planning to visit Calcutta for critical heart surgery all the way from Dhaka, but have no idea which hospital to go to or which hotel to stay in? 																								Indian Airlines (IA) could be of help with a travel, treatment and tourism package, which will not only be 30 per cent cheaper but worked out even before you take a plane for Calcutta.																								IA becomes the first airline to jump on the medical tourism bandwagon and to tie up with top city hospitals to offer a wide range of sops (see box) to boost traffic through Calcutta airport.																								According to the details of the medical tourism package, being given final shape jointly by Indian Airlines and city hospital majors like Apollo Gleneagles, Suraksha, AMRI, CMRI and Ruby General, at least 30 per cent discount will be offered to air passengers on a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic services in city hospitals. 																								To promote the offer, which will be inaugurated in a months time, the healthcare majors and IA are planning to develop a public awareness programme in respective hospitals as well as major airports. 																								So far, the idea has gone down very well. Medical tourism is the order of the day and the brand name of Indian Airlines would definitely give a boost to the healthcare market as well, said M.S. Balakrishnan, IA regional director. 																								Besides, Apollo Gleneagles has plans to give special discounts on the lifestyle management programme (preventive health check-ups) for all IA passengers arriving in Calcutta. 																								The announcement of the offer will be made by the airline, in print with the boarding passes. An additional card will be provided by us for passengers to enable them to avail of the discount at the wellness centre of our hospital in the city, said a senior official at Apollo.																								The arrangement between IA and the city hospitals comes at a time when the national carrier is planning to increase flight frequency between Calcutta and Dhaka. 																								The hospitals, too, have plans to tap the entire Bangladesh medical market in a bigger way. 																								There is a lot to be done as far as tapping the huge market is concerned, because a lot of Bangladeshis are going to either USA or Delhi for treatment, opined S.C. Aiyer, chief executive officer at CMRI.																								On the other hand, IA is hoping that attractive sops will help passengers travel more on its flights, specially due to the fact that the Bangladesh High Commission issues more than 4,000 visas a day to Bangladeshis coming to Calcutta, and only 15 per cent of them travel by flights.																								To raise awareness about preventive healthcare, Apollo as well as Suraksha are planning to provide customised health and lifestyle programmes for all corporates flying with IA. 																								After treatment, too, IA offers tourism discounts for destinations like Darjeeling, Mumbai or Bangalore.

 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Booksellers put paid to expert lifter
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Boimela theke jara boi churi kore, tara sadharanoto chhatra-chhatri. Ora boi bhalobashe, kintu kenar samartha nei (Those who steal books from fair stalls are usually students who love books but cannot afford to buy them) Sujoy Chakraborty, commissioner, Calcutta Police.																								With the arrest of 29-year-old Mrinal Naskar on the last day of the Calcutta Book Fair, the police chiefs view (which he voiced two days ago on the fair grounds) was proved wrong. Naskar, police said after interrogating him, is a professional book-lifter, not an amateur. He is a member of a gang that apparently stole books worth a hefty sum from this years fair.																								An honours graduate in accountancy from north Calcutta, Naskar made publishers poorer by thousands on Sunday, the concluding day of the fair. He was caught redhanded after a three-day effort by the publishers.																								Naskar is being interrogated to ascertain how many books he had lifted during the fair. We are yet to get the names of his associates, who went about stealing books in a similar way, said Asish Sengupta, officer-in-charge (OC), Maidan police station.																								Police said Naskar, for the first two days, entered a number of stalls and monitored the process of sale and purchase. He even bought a few books to get hold of a cash memo stamped paid.																								Naskar, who runs a coaching class for a living, then selected stalls where two counters had been set up for payment and issuing of cash memos. He prepared three rubber stamps, which resembled those used by the three publishing houses  Deb Sahitya Kutir, Deys and Penguin.																								He would choose the rush hour to start his job. After lifting the books, Naskar would queue up in front of the cash memo counter, like others. Once he got the cash memo from the despatch counter, Naskar would quietly take out the ink-pad and stamp paid on the bill. This was how he kept dodging the cash counter, OC Sengupta explained.																								The booksellers suspected some foul play when they found that the cash books were not tallying with the statements provided by the despatch counters. The publishers, then, thought of changing the format of the rubber stamps, which bore the word paid. And the watchmen posted at the exit gates were put on alert, said an officer of Maidan police station.																								Naskar had probably never thought that someone could outsmart him. He started operating as usual on the last of the Book Fair. Just as he was about to slip out of the Deb Sahitya Kutir stall, security guards caught him red-handed with seven packets of books.																								Police later recovered three stamps and an ink-pad from Naskar. We suspect he was not alone in this operation. Someone must have made off with books in such a fashion earlier. He had lifted books worth about Rs 20,000 from this years fair, said Sengupta. Interrogation is on and more arrests are expected soon.

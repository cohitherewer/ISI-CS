 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Emotions etched on canvas
Art finds its most soulful expression in the folds of tranquility that is induced, more often than not, by a sense of painful loneliness. Having spent a decade away from the hustle bustle of the city, Subrata Pal had an enriching rendezvous with nature in the heart of some unspoiled villages in the country. In those 10 years he cemented his relationship with the artist in him. The ongoing exhibition at the Academy has on display paintings that Pal lent shape to over the last two years. His paintings reflect the everyday world and the artists reaction to this world; a reaction that an ordinary person would fail to note as he busies himself with the ordinariness of his existence. A journey through the world painted by Pal gives birth to a serenity that we often miss as we hurry through life with little leave for the appreciation of the sights and sounds of a pulsating universe.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings by Subrata Pal																								When: Till July 13; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

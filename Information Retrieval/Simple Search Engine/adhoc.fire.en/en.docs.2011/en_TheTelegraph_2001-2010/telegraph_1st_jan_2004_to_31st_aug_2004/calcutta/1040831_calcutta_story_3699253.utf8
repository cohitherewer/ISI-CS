 College Capers: Psychedelic lights, music and masti were all part of the action at Careergraph Rhapsody 2004 at Calcutta Medical College last week. Students from the city and beyond let their hair down to enjoy the offerings at the 58th annual fest of the college. Guest performances by two bands on August 25 evening (above) set the stage for what was to follow. Picture by Pabitra Das The critical case some of our future doctors had to deal with last week was Careergraph Rhapsody 2004. The patient was masti. The treatment was enjoyment. The medicines and other remedies were music, quiz, dance and more. The net result was a successful outburst of energy and enthusiasm. The doctors-to-be had let their hair down on the Calcutta Medical College campus from August 25 to 28 for the annual fest. Organised by the students union, it proved medical students, too, can freak out and have plenty of fun. The 58th annual fest of the college was sponsored by The Telegraph, Inscol Academy, Cafe Coffee Day, Temptation, Priya, UTI Bank, Nestle, Toshiba, Food Station and 107.8 Power FM.				 				 																															The celebrations saw a huge gathering of several educational institutions including IIIT, NUJS, IEM and Calcutta University, as well as St Xaviers, Maulana Azad, Loreto, Lady Brabourne, Asutosh and Presidency colleges. A few had even crossed borders to make their way to the event. To promote a spirit of mutual harmony, students from different colleges could team up with each other to compete in the contests. This was a unique concept for a college fest. 				 				 																															The inauguration on August 25 was followed by an odyssey dance and flute recital. After that was Hindi antakshari, in which 36 teams participated. The next event, scientific paper presentation, raised the IQ quotient. A panel discussion on painless labour followed, along with a medical quiz. Ending the evening on a musical note, there were guest performances by bands Byakoron and Insomnia.				 				 																															A general quiz featuring 56 teams opened the next days programme. Next on the schedule was an English debate on Power lies in the ability to harm and not in the ability to help. Following this was the Hutch one-act play where six teams participated. The medley was next, comprising dumb charade, Vatiz and chaos quiz, with 31 teams up against each other. Fossils, guest band for the night, rocked the 1,200-odd audience. 				 				 																															August 27 started with a pre-clinical quiz, followed by Battle of the Bands and Made for Each Other. Couples expressed their love for one another, enacted several scenarios, drank from one bottle, played football and more. Krosswindz ended the day with a mix of Baul and rock music. 				 				 																															The last day of the celebrations opened its innings with the eastern solo competition, followed by choreography, western solo and prize distribution. Then was the Nestle DJ Night, giving Tantra and Incognito a run for their money. The social dinner party ended the event. Asif Salam,

	 Digital original				 				 																															Animated sets, photographic flashback, original storyline, script and music. A few firsts for a bunch of students. The play is about five friends who parted ways after graduating in 1994, pursuing their dreams and losing touch with each other. Ten years later, they meet up again. The why, what, when, where and how is the plot of Andrews 94, which you can catch on September 10, at Gyan Manch.				 				 																															The English musical, written and directed by Nirmalya Majumder, features original music composed for the play, although pre-recorded, and its the fifth original one to be staged in the city. 				 				 																															The young cast and crew are testing the concept of animated sets, too. They are digitally created, some with moving images as well. To add to the filmi feel, pictures will be used to recreate the flashback sequences. A look and feel-good effect is what theyre gunning for.

2nd year English hons, Presidency College project reportWhat happens to Harry?Harry Potters creator, J.K. Rowling, teased young fans about what the future has in store for the young wizard during a reading at the Edinburgh book festival recently. The Guardian newspaper reported that the author offered only a tantalising taste of the answers to the riddles plaguing readers. She said there were two important questions she had not been asked about the series, which might help to unravel its mysteries. Rowling said fans should be asking not why did Harry live but why didnt Voldemort die?. The second cryptic question is: Why didnt Dumbledore kill, or try to kill, Voldemort? At a public reading in Scotland after four years, the 39-year-old read from Order of the Phoenix. The first time in 1997, as Joanne Rowling, she had read to only 30 people. This time, she could have filled a football stadium. As to whether Harry will grow up as a wizard, she replied: He will survive to book seven, mainly because I dont want to be strangled by you lot, but I dont want to say whether he grows any older than that. However, she kept the title of her final book a secret.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Rs 21.75, even after court pay order
 																											- HC rap for councils failure to give appointment to teacher OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Even a court order is not enough to make the North 24-Parganas District Primary School Council pay a teacher his well-earned salary. All he gets is a princely sum of Rs 21.75.																								On Thursday, Justice K.J. Sengupta of Calcutta High Court came down heavily on the district primary school council for not complying with the courts order to pay Pranab Kumar Sengupta his salary.																								The judge threatened the chairman of the council that he would ask the state education department to stop his salary if he did not take steps to pay the salary of the petitioner teacher by next Wednesday.																								The judge also directed the chairman to file a compliance report before the court on May 19. 																								The schoolteacher joined Basak Bagan Primary School of north Calcutta as assistant teacher in 1973 and since then he has been drawing a monthly remuneration of Rs 21.75.																								When he found that even after two decades of service, the school authorities were reluctant to regularise him he went to Calcutta High Court in 1995. Even after repeated orders of the court, the district primary school council did not increase his salary by even a paisa. At the entry level, a primary school teacher now draws around Rs 6,000 a month.																								The teacher, then, moved a contempt petition against the council and the state education department. His plight was reported in The Telegraph on July 18, 2002.																								Following the petition, the court had asked the director of the school education department as well as the chairman of the district primary school council to appear in court on Thursday.																								The courtroom of Justice Sengupta witnessed a drama when two departments of the state education department locked horns over the court order.																								The counsel representing the school education department said in 1996 it had approved the appointment of the teacher and the chairman was issued the necessary instructions. But no requisition has been submitted by the council to the directorate in respect of payment of salary to the petitioner. So, the question of releasing funds does not arise, he reasoned.																								When the judge asked the council lawyer why his client did not bother to carry out the order, he did not have an answer. The irritated judge asked the council to file an affidavit stating that the order would be obeyed. 																								The chairman of the council is delaying the appointment of my client, said Senguptas lawyer Saibalendu Bhowmick, accusing the government of causing mental torture.																								A judge of Calcutta High Court in 1995 had directed the council to give Sengupta the appointment with effect from 1973. But the council has not taken any steps to carry out the order.

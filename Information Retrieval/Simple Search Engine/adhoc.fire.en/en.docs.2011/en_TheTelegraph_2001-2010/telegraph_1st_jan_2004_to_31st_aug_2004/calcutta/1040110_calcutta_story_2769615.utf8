 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Children at the winter camp																								Summer camps for kids have become must-dos, with creativity, learning and healthy doses of fun. But this winter, a rather unique camp had been organised, with plenty of outdoor activities and excursions in the mellow winter sun. Kislaya Montessori, on Loudon Street, spread the word about their eight-day winter camp, held from December 26 to January 2. About 26 children, aged between four and 10, from various city schools, who had signed up for the programme, were educated through entertainment.																								For five days, the kids were taken on trips. Each one involved active participation, often with the older ones looking after the toddlers. At a ceramics factory in Salt Lake, they viewed the entire process of how mugs and dishes are made. The prized moment was when they were given the opportunity to paint some clay mugs themselves. 																								The block-printing factory in Tollygunge was another treat, where the youngsters viewed the processes of designing and printing on saris, salwar-kurtas and cloth, and the tie-and-dye procedure. Creating their own patterns on handkerchiefs was the highlight of the day.																								The visit to the Agri-Horticultural Gardens involved a nature walk through the grounds, with explanations of the various plants, flowers, seeds and vegetables, as well as tips on how to plant and grow them. Then it was time to get their hands dirty, as the kids set about digging up the earth and planting some greens.																								At the fish farm, near Narendrapur, where aquarium fish are bred for export, although they couldnt quite participate in the daily duties, the children had a blast identifying the colourful creatures and learning about them  body parts to feeding habits.																								The Arts Acre experience  the artists studio near Calcutta airport was more of a relaxation, as they sat in groups in the sun making Ravanas with 10 heads and snakes from crepe paper and rope, under the supervision of the artists. For the rest, be it making sandwiches and jam biscuits or doing aerobics, there were dollops of fun with an added dash of knowledge.

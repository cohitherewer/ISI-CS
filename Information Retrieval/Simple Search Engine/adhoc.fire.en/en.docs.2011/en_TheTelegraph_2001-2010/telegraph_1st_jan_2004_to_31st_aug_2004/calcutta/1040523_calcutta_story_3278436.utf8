 Sunday, May 23, 2004 Be happy, dont worry 
AdLib / Shiloo ChattopadhyayBig B as brand ambassador is as big as they come. Some seek the megastar, some the manHe looks so sweet, naa. Is it his grand daughter? Who, that little girl? Shwetas or Abhisheks? Stupid, Abhishek is not married (giggle). My little one also loves Cadbury chocolates.Some stray comments. Heard after an airing of the latest Cadbury chocolate ad. Amitabh Bachchan plays with a little girl. Together, they say: Dont worry, be happy.Curiosity is a good appetiser. To be noticed in a capsule of 17 other ads is a major achievement. Perhaps, half the battle is won there itself. AB (often referred to as amader jamai  Bengals son-in-law, if you please  on the para rocks till not so long ago) usually delivers that with lan. His presence itself is the magnet.But then Cadbury possibly wanted a little more from the great man. Remember the recent imbroglio that Cadbury found itself in? Worms found in chocolates. Perhaps freak accidents, possibly negligence of its dealers. But Cadbury today needs to reassure its consumers. Now its packaging has been reinforced. Chance of a recurrence, it feels, is now insignificant.This needs to be communicated to millions of Cadbury lovers  children and their guardians. AB works equally well with kids and their grandparents. His choice in the Cadbury ad for that reason alone is inevitable.Yet, there is something even more crucial that was required in the ad. Cadbury could have said, dont worry, be happy. But then that may have carried a whiff of vested interest. The reassurance needed certification.A paediatrician? Perhaps, but how boring. A film star? Exciting, but will people believe it?AB is the two in one. His appeal as a film star is obvious  his doctor-like credibility is unduplicated.Borrowing a star image to impart on to a brand is pretty common. Akshay Kumar in the Thums Up ads is a good example. Thums Up is forever striving to become a macho adult and who better for the job than Akshay, the manly hero? However, we do not quite know whether Akshay is in the habit of beating people up in personal life. His screen incarnation does it relentlessly. Thums Up has borrowed the stars screen image.Is Cadbury also borrowing a part of ABs screen image? But his screen image is very blurred. Where then does the credibility originate from? The well of credibility lies in the man himself, not the megastar. Most of his fans, and that is nearly everybody, think of him as an honest, sincere, distinguished, successful individual. This persona is what has been very intelligently used by Cadbury.Every other brand borrows a star. Cadbury imported the man behind the star. For, when AB the man graces an ad, he blesses the brand. That is a rare star trait.

 BHAJAN GANGULY				 	 Howrah Town Hall: A crumbling piece of history																								Negligence  though unintentional has been nailed for the Howrah Town Hall cave-in.																								The four-member expert committee set up to probe the collapse of a portion of the Howrah Town Hall on January 4, has submitted its report to the state government.																								According to the inquiry team, the cave-in was caused by the non-intentional negligence of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC). The civic body had no way to gauge the condition of the heritage building or determine the extent of damage to the inner layers of the ceiling, it observed.																								Seepage had badly damaged the load-bearing capacity of the 2,500 sq ft ceiling in patches. Though the damage was not visible, the collapse could have been averted if a method of non-destructive testing had been undertaken.																								The report further states that the section of the ceiling collapsed due to catastrophic failure. It had been weakened with rainwater seeping into the layered roof and slowly rusting the iron rods.																								The iron rods had either crumbled or lost their load-bearing capacity. So, the roof collapsed, explained Prof Bikash Chandra Chatterjee, head of the department of civil engineering, Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur.																								The rods had been painted to insulate them, but a mere coat of paint could not arrest the decay, experts said. An arch supported by two horizontal walls was the principal structure. According to Chatterjee, the arched roof would rest on the horizontal wall supported by iron rods that partially penetrated it and strengthened its support to the arch.																								Generally, clay tiles plastered with lime and some other indigenous material were used to strengthen the base on which the roof was built.																								That was how roofs were constructed over houses in those days, so the arched structure of the Howrah Town Hall was a rarity in the truest sense of the term, Chatterjee said. Basically, it was a non-pillared structure and the entire weight of the arched roof rested on the wall supported by the iron rods.																								The report suggests that the HMC should have checked the inner condition of the roof by non-destructive testing and taken some precautions. Admitting the lapse on the part of the civic authorities, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said they were ready to repair the dilapidated roof of the hall and recreate the earlier form.																								We will preserve the heritage structure for the next generation, asserted Mukherjee.																								The team of experts has even suggested appointing a group of special officers to monitor all heritage buildings and implement the non-destructive testing method so that such accidents can be averted in future.

 A model flaunts an outfit from the new line at Hugli. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 Hugli, a lifestyle store tucked away quietly on the banks of the Ganges, is dishing out some excitement after a long lull. The plush studio that houses fashion and home dcor items from various parts of the world is all set to pamper the citys fashion senses with some classic weaves from Thailand. 																								Spun out of cotton and silk, the fabrics used for both mens and womens wear have been coloured with natural dye. 																								For the ladies there are interesting fishermens pants in both heavy and light fabrics, which when tied around the waist sits pretty on the contours of the body. Men who like to experiment with their dressing can also try out these pants. Extremely relaxed and urban in look, these are best suited for a day out with friends. 																								For the more feminine look, sarongs with both contemporary and archaic look are on offer. The ones in tribal prints and a melange of colours are the show stealers. Some lovely tops, blouses and jackets, as also scarves and stoles make for a wholesome wardrobe straight from Southeast Asia. 																								For those with a taste for the crispy whites or the classy khakis, lovely uppers with straight cuts, huge buttons and smart necklines are must picks. 																								The store also houses lines by designers from all over the country like Jason Cherian, Abraham and Thakore, Shreela Debi and the brand Just Urban. Kite skirts by Abraham and Thakore catch the eye, with a fetching flow and extra fabric on the sides lending a feminine touch. I am soon going to have clothes for larger women, or lets say clothes for real people and not just those with model-like figures, said Madhulika Khaitan, an art collector and the brain behind the store.Culture call																								 Come August 7 and five new stars will shine on the culture horizon of Calcutta. Shalimar Anandabazar Patrika Adwitiya, a state-wide contest for women that kicked off on Friday, is a platform for fresh talents in the fields of music, dance and recitation to hit bigtime with their forte. 																								Co-sponsored by LG, Senco Gold and Himalaya, the contest is being held throughout Calcutta, Midnapore, Siliguri and Asansol. 																								The Calcutta zonal preliminary round started off on Friday morning at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. The whole of Friday and Saturday have been devoted to dancing and singing, while the recitation round will be held on Sunday. 																								Around 200 women will be taking the stage throughout the three days. The zonal rounds in Midnapore, Asansol and Siliguri start on July 14, 23 and 30 respectively.																								The singing section has been divided into three categories. The first comprises Adhunik, Rabindrasangeet, Rajanikanta, Atulprosadi and Dwijendrageeti. The second category has devotional, raagpradhan and Nazrulgeeti, while the third one is folk music. Dance and recitation make up other two categories. 																								The contestants will be judged by Ambali Prohoraj for dance, Santanu Bandopadhyay for singing and Gouri Ghosh for recitation. 																								Three chosen contestants from each of the five categories will take part in the Calcutta zonal final to be held at the GD Birla Sabhagar on Sunday. A performance by singer Pratik Chowdhury will follow the contest rounds. 																								One winner from each of the five categories in each of the zones will be chosen to participate in the mega finals to be held at the Science City on August 7. 																								Apart from these rounds, an award will also be given away for contribution to society. One deserving candidate, to be chosen by a panel of judges from applications received, will be feted during the mega finals. 						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

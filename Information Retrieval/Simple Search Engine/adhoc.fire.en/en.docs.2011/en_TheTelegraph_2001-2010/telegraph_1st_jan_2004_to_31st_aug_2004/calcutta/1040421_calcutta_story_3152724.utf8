																																																		Calcutta High Court on Tuesday refused to hear a petition filed by Trinamul Congress MLA Arunava Ghosh seeking an order of the court declaring the order passed in 1997 restricting the use of loudspeakers as infractuous. According to the petitioner, after the introduction of the central noise norms the order has no validity. The petitioner contended that the state pollution control board (PCB), on the basis of the high courts order, had issued a circular asking political parties not to use loudspeakers in election campaigns during the Higher Secondary examination. Ghosh claimed that in the central norms, there was no restriction on the use of loudspeakers during examinations. The division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee held that since the Central Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 had already been implemented, there was no need to modify the high court order restricting the use of loudspeakers. The court, however, gave liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh petition. Later, Ghosh said he had filed another petition challenging the notification of the state PCB dated March 3, 2004, asking political parties not to use loudspeakers till April 26 for the Higher Secondary examinations.

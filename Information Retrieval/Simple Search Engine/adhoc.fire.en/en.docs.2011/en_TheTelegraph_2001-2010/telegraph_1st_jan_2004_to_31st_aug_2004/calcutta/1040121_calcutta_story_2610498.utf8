 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Quality cell for colleges in quest of star status
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A quality assurance cell has been formed to improve teaching in state-aided colleges.																								The higher education department has also decided to have all colleges scrutinised by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). This scrutiny has already been conducted at the universities.																								The cell, chaired by higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty, comprises 14 members, including higher education secretary Jawhar Sircar, Rupen Roy of PricewaterhouseCoopers, CPM parliamentarian Lakshman Seth and other leading educationists, with member-secretary, higher education council, Pratip Chowdhury, convening.																								The cell will formulate and implement plans to improve teaching standards. It is to take steps to sensitise colleges on quality issues, to identify and address weaknesses and to prepare them for NAAC.																								NAAC spokesperson Latha Pillai said from Bangalore that colleges accredited by NAAC get additional funding of Rs 65 lakh annually for five years, besides a special grant for research work.																								We issued a circular to all states two months ago, urging them to initiate accreditation of colleges. We got thousands of applications, but we had little response from West Bengal, Pillai said. The University Grants Commission, she said, has decided to make it mandatory for all colleges to get accreditation and a circular to this effect is to be sent out shortly.																								Sircar blamed the poor response on lack of coordination between the NAAC and the government. NAAC has been directly dealing with the colleges, bypassing the universities and the higher education department. The college authorities could not take the decision on their own and the government was unaware of it, so the response was poor. When NAAC contacted us, we responded promptly, he said.																								The six colleges in the city that now have accreditation got it on their own initiative. Applications for Loreto College and Gurudas College have already been sent to NAAC.

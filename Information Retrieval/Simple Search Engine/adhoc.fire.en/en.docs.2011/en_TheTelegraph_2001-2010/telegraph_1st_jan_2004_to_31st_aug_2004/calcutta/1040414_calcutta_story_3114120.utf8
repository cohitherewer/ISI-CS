 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Look twice before picking up a foreign perfume or a carton of cigarettes or a bar of chocolate from any departmental store.																								The consumer affairs department, in raids conducted over the past week at some departmental stores across the city, has impounded cartons of fake and doubtful foreign goods. The haul includes biscuits, toys, chocolate, utensils, perfume, shaving cream, cigarettes, electronic goods and also medical equipment.																								The markets raided include Shoppers Stop, AC Market, Charnock City, New Market, Bagri Market and Gariahat. 																								People have been complaining of traders selling goods that are of dubious make. Our inspectors conducted a surprise check and seized a whole lot of doubtful goods from 30 traders. We slapped a cash penalty of Rs 5,000 on each, said Ashok Bhattacharya, controller of legal metrology, consumer affairs department.																								Some bars of locally-made chocolate were found packed in colourful wrappers with Made in England printed on them. But there was no mention of the manufacturer or its address.																								Shaving cream and biscuits were found without a batch number, date of manufacture or the maximum retail price. Many packets were unsealed. The name of the manufacturer, its address and licence number were missing from some bottles of perfume and packets of soap.																								Even medical equipment, like stethoscopes and thermometers, were seized as they appeared dubious. Many traders failed to produce valid documents in support of the imported goods.																								Alarmed at the flood of fake foreign goods in city markets, the consumer affairs department has decided to hold a joint meeting with the Customs officials and traders bodies to chalk out a plan of action.																								According to the rules, any packed foreign item must have a sealed packet with a clearance tag from the customs department. On the packet should be printed the name of the manufacturer, its address, date of manufacture and expiry, licence number, batch number, maximum retail price and net weight. 																								Besides, the traders have to obtain a licence from the local authorities for selling imported goods or documents to substantiate that the goods were procured legally (a receipt from the wholesaler or a certificate from the customs department or a challan from the importer).																								There is no harm in buying foreign goods from a licensed shop. We request customers to check and crosscheck the genuineness of the goods. Do not buy any foreign item simply going by the made in USA stamp on the packet, consumer department officials said.

 															- Home-grown catering king to lay the veg spread at Mittal wedding extravaganza A STAFF REPORTER Palate Picks Kachori ka chaat
 Special stuffed samosas
 Vegetables in fancy shapes in assorted gravies
 Fusion Indian sweets with chhena, badam and malai as base
 Combo jalebis and rasgullas to go with ice-cream and wild French berriesThyme, basil and oregano blended with freshly ground saffron and cinnamon. Wild blueberries embellished with tender chhena on a bed of creamy malai. Munna meets Mittal. Its an Indian wedding in a French chateaux, and the palate picks are flying out from Calcutta.																								Home-grown catering king Munna Maharaj (alias Dipak Kumar Singh) is set to add yet another celeb feather to his chefs hat, laying the spread at the high-profile, six-day Mittal wedding extravaganza (June 18-23) in the Palace of Versailles, on the outskirts of Paris.																								Lakshmi Mittal, Britains fifth richest man, is rolling out a lavish bill of fare for daughter Vanishas wedding (to 25-year-old financier Amit Bhatia) with authentic Indian vegetarian inputs from Calcutta.																								If Hemant Oberoi of the Taj will be doing the non-vegetarian kebabs and gravies, Munna Maharaj and his troupe of chaatwallahs, mithaiwallahs and regional cuisine experts will rustle up the all-veg fare at the high-tea and dinner on the wedding night (June 22).																								This is a big stepping stone for NRIs to fly in celeb chefs from India and we are proud to take our Calcutta specialities to Paris, says Munna Maharaj, 10 nights before the departure of his 15-member team.																								A common base kitchen, around 50 km from the wedding venue, to be shared by the Taj team, Munnas men and the appointed French caterers will send the taste-bud ticklers to the stylish chateaux in eight refrigerated vehicles. The special trucks will stand by for live items the 1,500 select guests might want piping hot on their tables.																								The gastronomic gala kicks off on June 20, with a formal sit-down French dinner by the French caterers with Munnas mithais. The Bollywood Nite follows the next evening, where Munna Maharaj will whip up an array of north Indian vegetarian items. The grand event is more than two weeks and several time zones away, but the culinary countdown is cooking closer home, in Delhi, with the brides mother making frequent food-tasting trips, Munna Maharaj and Hemant Oberoi in attendance.

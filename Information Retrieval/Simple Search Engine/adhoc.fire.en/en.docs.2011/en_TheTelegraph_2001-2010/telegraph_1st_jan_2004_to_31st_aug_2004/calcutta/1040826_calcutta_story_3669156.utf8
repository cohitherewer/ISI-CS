 Thursday, August 26, 2004 LifeChill-out by the poolsideZeeshan Jawed rolls out a formula for a bash with a splash Plan a Party
	Do 
Ask your guests to carry bathing suits and towels
Place enough easy chairs and tables around the pool
Light up the area with lanterns
	Dont 
Start the party too early, 7.30 pm should be the right time
Go overboard with alcohol If the rains have succeeded in keeping you indoors, its time to defy Nature and make a splash. With the humidity dropping and the August breeze cooling down, a chill-out session by the poolside beckons. So, just invite some friends over and get together by the water to beat the blues.Time it rightSaturday evening is the perfect time to pool in your efforts to have some fun. But if you want to kick off your party at 4 pm, chances are youll create a ripple not a wave. So, instruct your guests to drop in well after sundown, say 7.30 pm.Back-up basicsUrge your guests to carry their bathing suits and towels. But do not forget to stock up some extra ones yourself because, take it from us, some will conveniently (and maybe even deliberately) forget about the dress code.Deck it upSet up a number of easy chairs and tables around the pool. Put in place two additional large tables for food and beverages to avoid any jostling. As the evening wears on, light up the pool area with stylish lanterns. For the right shade of romance, have some floating candles (once everyone has done the dip) and some half-filled heart-shaped balloons in the pool.Live wireThe whole point is to make the poolside come alive. So, hire a good DJ to mix it up and set the tone for the party, says Debarun Mukherjee of Hints amp; Allegations, a Calcutta based event management company. Bad music can be a real spoilsport, he warns. But do watch your step while dancing, unless wet and wild is what you want and the pool is the place to be in.Dress to thrillYou have the perfect alibi to show off those muscles or curves. For her: Pull on those denim shorts and a dark and tiny T-shirt, or maybe slip into that bikini youve been waiting to wear forever. To play it safe, go for pedal pushers or capri pants. As for your feet, those floaters are just fine.Love thy neighbourThe best idea would be to involve your neighbours, too, but if thats a no-no then do ensure that you dont disturb them. Do not allow the decibel devil to drown the music and drive the neighbours up the wall and please make sure that however high the spirits on this side of the wall may be, nothing (read: bottles or balloons) should go flying beyond the boundary.Light biteKeep the food fare as light as possible  salads, fruits, veggies and dips  as swimming with the tide is the theme for this dream. You can also arrange for some sandwiches or hot-dogs on the barbecue. Avoid alcohol for swimmers: serve sodas, teas and juices instead. If you are serving alcohol, take necessary cover. There should be a restricted service of alcohol and you should also take precautions by lowering the level of water in the pool to avoid any mishap, advises Sanchita Kushari Bose of The Dream Merchants, another event management company.Clean and safeGet the pool cleaned and chlorinated before the party, the last thing you want is your guests to catch an itch. Make sure there are no electric wires near the water. Also, be extra careful if the little ones are around.

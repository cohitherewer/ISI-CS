 Thursday, August 19, 2004 Pillow fights with old pals
Plan a PartyDishing out a menu for some girlie fun all night long Do  Start the party as late as possible  Stick to pyjamas or shorts teamed with funky T-shirts Dont  Draw up a health food menu, junk goes down the best 
 Have the music system blaring all night, spare a thought for your neighbours Pillow fights and peals of laughter; movies and manicures; ice cream and boy bashing. Dj vu taking over? If you are fondly remembering those pyjama parties of old, stop reminiscing. Pick up the phone, call some old pals, get going.Call with careBe careful with the invites, as not everyone is comfortable crashing with a crowd. On the other hand, you might want a lazy night in, and your friends might want to turn your bedroom into a nightclub.Time it rightIf you want your friends to stay overnight, start the party as late as possible. And pace yourself. If you have an agenda, make sure you roll things out one thing at a time. You dont want your guests to get bored by 10.30 pm.Casual appealDont take the phrase pyjama party too literally. You can slip into a pair of shorts to show off your long legs on a muggy day. But for the more prim and proper sorts, flannel PJs and floaters will do just fine. Pull on a snazzy T-shirt with some funky prints.Gossip galoreSome harmless bitching without back-stabbing is sure to be the best part of the night. Time to let the cat out of the bag, but while revealing secrets, make sure they are your own. This is the time to admit that you had been sweet on your best friends fianc (but please proceed with caution) or that you had a secret crush on your history professor while in college. If you want to lighten the atmosphere, just pull out your old cassettes and take a trip down musical memory lane.Diet chartHealth food is a strict no-no. Junk food and aerated beverages and fancy cocktails should be the staples for the night. You can delegate responsibility to your pals, to share the burden. Some finger food and snacks could be well advised. If you want to make a community affair of it, do some grocery shopping and have a cook-in. Help at handIt would be a good idea to have some basic medicine at hand, in case of a midnight crisis. A box of tissues would also be of use in case somebody is reminded of an ex-flame. For the sake of all those around you who havent been invited, keep the volume under control.Picture by Rashbehari Das

 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Traders held for gambling in market
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Seven traders were rounded up from Jadavpur market for gambling on Saturday night and the police recovered Rs 5,000 from them. All the arrested men belong to the Jadavpur Byabasayee Samity, a body of traders backed by the local CPM. Association secretary Mihir Mazumdar was among the arrested.																								Local Trinamul Congress leader Deepak Mazumdar alleged that the market had turned into a den of goons. The police turned a blind eye as the criminals were backed by the ruling party. We pointed out the goings-on to the police a number of times. The market has become a haunt for criminals, who not only gamble in there but also sell and drink country liquor after dark, Mazumdar said.																								However, local CPM leader Batakrishna De said some innocent persons had been arrested to tarnish the image of the local traders and the party before the elections. It was quite surprising that police picked up only our men for gambling or selling country liquor. We will protest to the superintendent of police through the party, he said. 																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir said the raid followed regular complaints from local traders and residents.The complaints were pouring in, but we could not arrest the goons because they had advance information about our raids and would flee the spot. He denied that party affiliation had guided the arrests. We booked the goons for gambling and also recovered money from their possession, he pointed out.

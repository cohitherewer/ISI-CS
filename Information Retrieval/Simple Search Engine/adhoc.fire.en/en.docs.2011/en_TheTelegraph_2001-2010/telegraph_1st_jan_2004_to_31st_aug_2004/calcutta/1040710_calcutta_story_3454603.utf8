 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Schools by Punjabis but open to all
 															- Quality education on non-profit basis: Topsia address with Behala, Howrah twins DEEPANKAR GANGULY  Project cost: Rs 7crore (approximately)
Targetted opening: 2006
Size: Multi-storeyed, spread across 10 bighas; net built-up area 100,000 sq ft (approximately)
Facilities: Swimming pool, health centre and gymnasium
Capacity: 1,200 boys and girlsOne of Calcuttas most enterprising, colourful and resource-rich communities plans to set up a chain of schools. Punjabee Bradree, which has long been engaged in social and community development, said on Friday that the first of the chain of schools  to be modelled on the finest in the country  will come up on East Topsia Road, near Science City. The other two will come up at Behala and Howrah. 																								Our aim is to provide quality education on a non-profit basis not only to Punjabi children but also those belonging to other communities. After completion, these institutions will be able to match any premier school in the country, said M.L. Dutt, president of Punjabee Bradree. 																								The school at Topsia, scheduled to open from the 2006 academic session, will be co-educational, fully residential and affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. A certain proportion of seats will be kept reserved for Punjabis and students from poor families. 																								 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has already sanctioned the construction plan for the school on East Topsia Road and mayor Subrata Mukherjee will lay the foundation stone on July 11. The Punjabee Bradree has engaged a former Doon School principal, Gulab Ramchandrani, as consultant. 																								According to Dutt, the school will function at its full capacity within four years from commissioning. Initially, about 500 boys and girls will be taken in. 																								It will have all modern facilities, including separate gymnasiums and swimming pools for boys and girls. The main school building will accommodate the classrooms as well as the laboratories, library, computer, art, music, craft and language rooms. For budding engineers, a well-equipped workshop will allow students to experience how things work. 																								The name of the upcoming school is yet to be decided. The Punjabee Bradree plans to choose a suitable name from suggestions submitted by its 3,000 members. The proposer of the name finally chosen will be rewarded, said veteran Punjabee Bradree member Kanwaljit Singh. 																								Dutt said the school will have classes from nursery to XII and the primary section will not be residential. Our school will not be a money-making machine. We will not charge capitation fee during admission. The tuition fees and other charges will be calculated to make the institution self-sustaining, said Dutt.																								The student-teacher ratio for each class is expected to be about 25:1.

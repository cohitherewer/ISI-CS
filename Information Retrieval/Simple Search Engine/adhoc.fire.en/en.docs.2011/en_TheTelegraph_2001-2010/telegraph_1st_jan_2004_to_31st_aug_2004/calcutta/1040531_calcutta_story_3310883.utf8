 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Court prod on Liluah home amenities
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta High Court has asked the state social welfare department to offer an explanation for not following the recommendations of the state human rights commission on improving conditions at the Liluah home for destitute women. 																								The government has failed to implement any of the measures suggested by the commission three years ago.																								Last week, the high court showcaused the department secretary, asking for a clarification on why contempt proceedings should not be taken against him for not implementing the recommendations. 																								The order was passed recently, after advocate Tapas Bhanja informed the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice S. Sen that a team led by then chairman of the state human rights commission, Justice M.K. Mukherjee, had suggested that the government improve amenities after visiting the rescue home in 2001. 																								Bhanja moved a petition seeking the courts intervention in the escape of women brought to the government home at Liluah. He referred to the reaction of present chairman of the commission, Justice Shyamal Sen, who recently visited the home.																								As the court-appointed special officer in 2000, Bhanja had himself noticed that owing to a number of reasons, mainly lack of amenities, girls ran away from the home. 																								He mentioned in his petition that in 2001, Calcutta High Court had asked the state human rights commission to submit a report on the Liluah home after conducting an inquiry. 																								On August 17, 2001, a commission team visited the home and later, submitted its report to the court, making some suggestions on how to improve the prevailing conditions. According to the report, 38 women had escaped from the home between 1997 and 2001.																								When the report was submitted to the high court, a division bench under Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice Girish Gupta said the recommendations must be followed by the secretary of the state social welfare department. Bhanja said in his petition that none of the recommendations were followed and women continued to escape from the Liluah home.

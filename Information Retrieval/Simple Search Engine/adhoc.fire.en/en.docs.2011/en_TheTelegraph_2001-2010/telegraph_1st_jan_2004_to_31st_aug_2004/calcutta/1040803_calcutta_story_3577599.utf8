				 	 ATUL TODI Atul TodiColourful canvas Is the trademark of this 18-year-old. Water colours or acrylics, oil paintings or mixed media, recreating life with brush and palette is his passion. Atul does landscapes and cityscapes and everything in-between. At the Indian public school art meet in Gwalior last year, organised by Camel, the travel and nature lover even attempted mehndi, which he says he loves working with. Easy as one, two, three Is painting, for Atul  maths is another favourite pastime. Having discovered his latent talent five years ago, the Salt Lake boy doesnt let an opportunity to paint pass him by, although what and when he paints depends on his mood. Once the creative juices start flowing though, producing a picture takes very little time.Going solo Is what the ex-Doon School student does best. His third exhibition, A Prism of Life, was on at INOX City Centre, after one in his former school, which is where it all began, from nostalgia for home (read Calcutta). Next was a show in a hotel in Jaipur. Back in the city, the former Assembly of God Church student (till Class VII) is all set to join St Xaviers College with economics. The maths and English freak was also the captain of the school badminton team, editor of the Hindi magazine, in the school choir, an athlete who was particularly good at discus-throwing and a prefect.Climbing high Is also a passionate pursuit for Atul, the highest being 20,000 ft in the Himalayas. The mountains are not just his favourites when it comes to painting  he loves nature just as much as painting old buildings in Calcutta. As a member of the school mountaineering team, he went on his fair share of trekking trips every year, from glaciers to peaks. But the bookworm  he spends a lot of free time reading any journal he can lay his hands on  hopes to become an art promoter after college, to give other amateur artists a chance. Art, for Atul, is more than just a hobby.

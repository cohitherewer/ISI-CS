 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 Paresh Maity with one of his large watercolours at CIMA Gallery. Picture by Aranya Sen																								In the latter half of the last century, watercolour was still part of the curriculum of art schools in Calcutta. It still is. But after graduation few fledgling artists remained faithful to the medium, perhaps because it was not considered as serious as oils. This, in spite of the fact that Bikash Bhattacharjee was a very fine watercolourist himself, and Shyamal Datta Ray had done some groundbreaking work using this medium. His series on the broken bowls had given a new impetus and symbolic meaning to this neglected medium. It was a powerful statement on our social situation.																								Later, Shaibal Ghosh had taken up the challenge of adding weightage to transparent watercolour. He very successfully created a great sense of density and volume using nothing more than a brush loaded with paint. His was a very poetic language and watercolour was the perfect medium for exploring his worldview and he never deviated from it. But Ghosh died an untimely death.																								Watercolour has been the forte of Paresh Maity since his days as a student of the Government College of Art amp; Culture and he still excels in this medium. An exhibition of some of the artists large watercolours opens at CIMA Gallery on Wednesday evening. Even before he left the institution, he had held an exhibition of his watercolours, among which was the charming representation of a monkey. He has not looked backward since.																								One of the most successful Bengali artists based in Delhi, 1965-born Maity has several sell-out exhibitions to his credit. The works being shown now were painted between 1987 and 2004, and as the artist asserts they were all done on the spot. They serve as a record of his travels, as he hopped from one continent to the other.																								Lowering rain clouds, boats and water are three elements that all his works have in common. Gondolas float in the canals of Venice with dark clouds hovering over them. Sometimes golden light breaks through. In Mumbai, waves break on Marine Drive as hordes of commuters try to battle the elements. In Calcutta, they valiantly wade through waterlogged streets. Orissa, too, is flooded. In Varanasi, umbrellas cluster around the ghats. In Dhanuskodi, a huge, dark temple looms near the ocean.																								Maity says: It is tough to use dark colours. They could get muddy or chalky. It was a challenge. Four 44 inches by 7  feet works on a single sheet of French Arches paper are of spectacular dimension.

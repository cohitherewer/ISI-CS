 							 - Hit parade for a theatre at home 								The problem: your schedule simply doesnt match with that of the movie theatres. Worse, the movies you want to see often dont get released in your neighbourhood cinema. The solution: build your own theatre at home.																								Investing in a home theatre system is not only cool, but also value-for-money now with component prices falling rapidly, bringing the overall price down. But for those willing to fork out a little extra, high-end brands are also becoming available in the city.																								Home theatre systems come in two varieties. One, the more popular Home Theatre In A Box (HTIB) and the separate system. HTIB is just what the name suggests. Bring it home, unpack, plug in and youre ready to roll. The separate system, however, needs careful selection, mixing and matching compatible components  something like an assembled computer.																								What makes a home theatre system hot Dolby Digital and digital theatre system (DTS): For the sound quality that you get in the best movie theatres.  The source: Must be a player that can play a digital video disc (DVD) which supports the Dolby digital and DTS formats. The visual display unit: Simply put, the television set (LCD or plasma), projector or even a computer monitor for display. The amplifier or audio/video receiver: For receiving the data from the DVD player and sending it to the speakers. Set of speakers: 5.1 or five speakers and a sub-woofer (the latter for the deep, bass notes) is the minimum requirement. The more the merrier, but not more than 9.1.																								And something we couldnt resist...What you see is an 8x6 ft Dalite matte screen that costs Rs 18,000. The excellent picture quality is courtesy a Barco cathode ray tube (CRT) projection system priced at Rs 4.95 lakh, though a Rs 2.45 lakh option is also available.

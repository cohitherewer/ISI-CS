 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Man run over by bus near Sealdah
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The New Year started on a sombre note when an unidentified, middle-aged man was run over on Thursday morning near Sealdah station. 																								The accident once again underlined how traffic rules are constantly flouted despite several attempts on the part of the city cops to make people more aware.																								According to deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh, the accident occurred around 7 am on Sukea Street, in the Amherst Street police station area. The man was crossing the road when a speeding bus on the 3D/1 route hit him from behind. He died soon after his head hit the edge of the concrete pavement, said an official at the local police station.																								Local residents rushed the injured man, bleeding profusely from his ears and nose, to NRS Hospital. While some informed the police, others blocked the way so that the driver could not escape with the vehicle. The culprit was later handed over to the police, the official added.																								The 45-year-old was declared quot;brought dead quot; by attending doctors at the emergency ward. We did not find anything on him to establish his identity. He didnt seem to be a local resident either, as no one could recognise him, nor was he a footpath-dweller. We have sent his body for post-mortem, the official said.																								Amherst Street police have started contacting all the police stations across the city and on the citys fringes to find out if anyone is missing in their areas. .

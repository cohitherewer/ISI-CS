 															- Stress, tension, disease and pollution robbing young men of their crowning glory BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								A growing number of men in their early 20s are becoming bald in the city. Till recently, genetic factors were considered the sole cause of male pattern baldness, known as androgenetic alopecia. This results in extensive hair loss near the crown or a receding hairline on account of genetic factors. Thereby, one became sensitive to dihydrotesterone, a male hormone which shortens the growth of the hair cycle. But stress, tension, disease and growing pollution seem to be the other big causes of hair loss. Causes that were till recently all but ignored.																								The biggest worry now is androgenetic alopecia, which causes 97 per cent of hair loss in men. Till recently, mostly middle-aged men were affected. But now, it affects men in their early twenties, says cosmetic surgeon Manoj Khanna. The reasons are varying, but acute stress and pollution in the city seem to be affecting young men a lot. It is astounding that for the past year or so, we have received about 100 requests for hair transplants from men who are less than 30, he adds.																								Sachin Verma, a dermatologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, attributes hair fall to increasing use of strong chemicals (bleaching, hair colouring and stylising) among men. Men, too, have become very fashion conscious, but they must be careful, for they are already genetically prone to hair loss and do not need to speed up the problem, says Verma.																								According to statistics available with experts in Calcutta, about 30 to45 per cent of men show signs of male pattern baldness by 20. The medical fraternity is concerned as the incidence of such baldness is increasing at the rate of 10 per cent per decade, say doctors.																								Iron deficiency, hypothyroidism and indiscriminate drug intake and protein deficiencies, too, cause baldness. Even typhoid fever, cancer and lifestyle diseases, including stress, are causing baldness in men. We are advising patients to be extremely careful about their health, because people generally ignore their hair, says dermatologist Ashoke Sinha. The rising graphs of cancer and subsequent chemotherapy and also arsenic in the districts are other prime causes of hair loss, he added.																								Besides, medications like lithium; beta-blockers; the blood-thinners and other drugs, too, cause hair loss as an annoying side effect. Other medicines used in cancer chemotherapy can cause sudden generalised hair loss, say experts.																								Hair loss through trauma, also known as traumatic alopecia, is a result of wrong hairdressing techniques or exposing hair to extreme heat and twisting or by use of strong chemicals, say experts. They believe that many Calcuttans opt for unscientific techniques to grow hair again. There are FDA-approved methods, like applying minoxidil on the head, or taking an oral pill known as finasteride, but people fancy alternative therapies that are not scientific. They cause more harm than good, explains Sinha.

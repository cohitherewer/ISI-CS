 Moon Moon Sen at Trincas on Thursday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								 Its never too late to coin a new term and introduce an occasion. Especially if it helps get friends together and ensures a fun-filled afternoon lunch and chat session.																								Boumasthami, which began in Trincas last year as a take off on Jamai Sashthi, has become a huge hit among the mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The popularity of the event has managed to lure some fathers-in-law and sons-in-law as well this year. 																								On Thursday afternoon, the guest list at the cosy Park Street restaurant included names like actor Moon Moon Sen, theatre director Sohag Sen, the designer duo behind Monapali and communications expert Rita Bhimani, among many other faces of the citys cultural and social circuit, talking about what is still a favourite topic of discussion  the great mother-in-law and daughter-in-law divide. 																								It would have been so much better if I had a daughter-in-law. Boumasthami would have made more sense to me then, said Moon Moon. But even in the short while that she stayed, she cast her spell all around, hailing waiters by their names and enquiring about restaurant staff who were not on duty. I have been coming here for years now, she smiled. 																								I dont think this daughter-in-law and mother-in-law divide is an issue in the present day urban world, said Sohag Sen in her candid style. I am very friendly with my daughter-in-law and I am not enjoying speaking on a mike while Im at lunch.																								The friction cannot be denied, but I think the Hindi soaps are just blowing everything out of proportion, the saas-bahu serials are absolutely mindless, Pali Sachdeva pointed out. 																								Rita and Kishore Bhimani could easily take the award for the most stylish couple. Kishore in a black kurta, dhoti and kantha-embroidered shawl was the best dressed man at the event. 																								Jewellery designer Nelanjana Chakraborty took a more serious path, describing the condition of daughters-in-law in rural areas. By the end of a rather long exchange session anchored by Barun Das, the guests still didnt know which side of the fence they would rather be. But the need for sustenance was never in question and they headed straight for the yummy Indian spread. 																								lA few drops of one variety claim to help reduce those extra inches around the waist, a bath with another ensures renewed energy. Yet another vial promises healthy tresses.																								Aromatherapy has been topping the charts of the beauty conscious, with people wanting to stay fit and look good not getting their nose-full of these products.																								Thus when FMs, yet another company selling aromatherapy items launched their natural range recently, beauticians from across the city turned up in hoards. 																								We have been exporting our products to markets in the west and selling in Mumbai, but this is our first foray into Calcutta, said Ravi Ratan of FMs. The products will be sold through some select stores and beauty parlours and is not being marketed to the masses.																								We are not promising miracles, but from client feedback from other markets, we can safely say that people using it will positively benefit and not suffer any side effects, added Ravi.																								FMs product list reads like the ultimate solution to all physical problems with some oil or the other available for anything from hair to toenail care. But an oil that guarantees mental health? Apparently, the use of the companys product called Divine Drops will not only release stress and tension but will also ensure the person using it has sweet dreams too.						HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

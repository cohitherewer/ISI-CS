The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, February 11, 2004  The City Diary
																																																		For the second time in six months, some Hutch subscribers in the city found their cellphones going blank. On Tuesday afternoon, subscribers in south Calcutta and areas adjoining the EM Bypass were affected after cell sites in the area tripped and stayed out of order for around three hours. Sunil Sood, chief executive officer, Hutchison Telecom East, said a power failure had sparked the problem between 2 pm and 3 pm, but refused to specify the areas affected. Only three cell sites were hit, he added. However, no major power failure was reported from south Calcutta during the day. Last August, the central business district, including Park Street, BBD Bag, Esplanade and Minto Park, had gone blank for two hours. Industry sources say power failure in a particular area cannot trigger a widespread disruption in the network. Every cell site has a generator and battery back-up, and failure of all power sources is a remote possibility. Technical snags or capacity overload could be the probable reasons.																																																		Bangladeshi national Nassarul Haque, 25, was arrested late on Sunday by passport control officials at Netaji Subhash International Airport. He was about to board a Bangladesh Biman flight without a ticket. Airport sources said Haque had tried to board a late-night flight by pasting a sticker of that flight on his baggage. Later, Haque was handed over to airport police and several flight stickers were found on him. He had allegedly stolen them from the Bangladesh Biman office.																																																		Thirteen persons were seriously injured when a Matador carrying a dead body from Salap in Howrah overturned on Kona expressway, near the Kajipara crossing.

Of the 13, four were admitted to Howrah District Hospital in a critical condition, police said. 																																																		The body of an unidentified youth was found beside the railway tracks of Belghoria on Tuesday. Police said the youth was murdered elsewhere and later dumped at the station. 																																																		Four persons were arrested on Tuesday for fraud following a complaint by the owner of a private company, Shivaji Panja.

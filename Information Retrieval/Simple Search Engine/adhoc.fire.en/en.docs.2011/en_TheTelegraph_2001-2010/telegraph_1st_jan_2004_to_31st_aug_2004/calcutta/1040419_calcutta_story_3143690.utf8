 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Payment defaulter set ablaze
 A STAFF REPORTER																								About a year ago, Jaimul Abedin got himself an autorickshaw with a loan taken from a private financier. On Sunday, Abedin, 45, was set ablaze by the financier for defaulting on repayment.																								The financier sent his henchmen to summon Abedin to his office in the Jorasanko area on Sunday afternoon. When Abedin explained his inability to pay the instalments within the coming week, he was allegedly doused in petrol and set alight, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.																								Abedin was hospitalised with severe burns.He is in a very serious condition but we managed to record his statement, on the basis of which we have started a case of attempted murder against the owner of the finance company, Rambabu, and one of his employees, Sunil. We have arrested Sunil, but Rambabu is absconding, said deputy commissioner (central) Rajiv Kumar.																								Sunil, during interrogation, admitted that Abedin had been called to the office but he was neither threatened nor set ablaze. We asked him to meet us in the second-floor office but before he came up to us, he had set himself on fire, Sunil said.																								Abedin, a resident of Jannagar, in Beniapukur, had defaulted on payments for the past nine months. He had assured the financier of squaring off his dues with interest but was assaulted a couple of days ago by goons hired by Rambabu, police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Sun-up winter losing bite
 OUR BUREAU			The severe chill in Calcutta and its adjoining areas over the past three days lessened on Wednesday, with the sun shining and the maximum temperature steadily rising to 23 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal. On Tuesday, the maximum temperature was 19.1 degrees.																								The minimum temperature, however, was pegged at 10.8 degrees, two degrees below normal. At Dum Dum, the minimum temperature was nine degrees. 																								Director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre in Alipore, K.K. Chakraborty, said Wednesdays was a normal winter condition and would continue for the next couple of days. The cold wave in Bihar and Jharkhand was also less furious on Wednesday, he said. He, however, warned of severe fog over the next few days.																								Officials said though the minimum temperature stayed around seven degrees in Patna and Ranchi, the wind blowing into the city from that region lacked the bite of the past three days.																								The prevailing situation, they said, is the ideal winter condition. The sky is clear and there is no low pressure forming in the Bay of Bengal. There is no wind from the sea and the weather is expected to remain dry.																								Dense fog over the airport, however, continued to disrupt traffic. There were no flights to and from Calcutta in the morning. The British Airways flight on the London-Calcutta sector did not arrive, said sources in the Airports Authority of India. 																								Altogether, 16 flights of the Indian Airlines, Jet Airways, Alliance Air and Air Sahara, including those bound for Delhi, Mumbai and Port Blair, were held up at the airport for two to four hours because of poor visibility.

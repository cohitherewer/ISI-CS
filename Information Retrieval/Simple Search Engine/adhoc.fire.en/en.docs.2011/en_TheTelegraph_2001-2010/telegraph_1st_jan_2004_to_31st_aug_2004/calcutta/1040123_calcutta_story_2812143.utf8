																								January 23 is a red-letter day for all Indians as we gear up to celebrate the birth anniversary of a brave soul, Subhas Chandra Bose. Born amid affluence, he had the courage to give up everything and risk even his life in his battle against British imperialism in order to realise his cherished dream of a united, secular and independent India. An incurable romantic, many would say, but how can one forget the fact that he was a born leader who had not hesitated once to dedicate his life for the welfare of millions of Indians! A brilliant scholar, he stood third in the prestigious ICS examination that used to be conducted from Britain and he had to compete with the best of British brains. Yet he gave it up without even batting an eyelid. The supreme commander of the Indian National Army (INA) inspires millions even today. Netaji Research Bureau hosts the annual Netaji birth anniversary celebration at Netaji Bhavan at 10.30 am. Presided by Governor Viren J. Shah, the programme features eminent filmmaker Shyam Benegal who will deliver the Netaji Oration 2004 on In Search of Netaji, followed by music recitals by Pramita Mullick and Srikanta Acharya. At 6 pm, a 13-member dance troupe of the Art Academy of Mauritius will perform. At Mahajati Sadan, its trustee board also celebrates the patriots 108th birth anniversary at 9.30 am with flag hoisting and rendering of patriotic songs by school children. The evening session at 5.30 pm features a discussion session on Bharater Swadhinata Sangrame Netaji Ebong INA-er Bhumika by Captain Lakshmi Sehgal. Also, dance-drama Rani Jhansi Vahini.

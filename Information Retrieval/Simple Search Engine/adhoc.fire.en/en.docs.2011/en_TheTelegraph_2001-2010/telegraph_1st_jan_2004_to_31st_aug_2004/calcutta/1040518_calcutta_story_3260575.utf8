Moods and moves during the staging of Rhinoceros. Pictures by Pradip SanyalIs college life all about fun and frolic only? No, its about serious dramatics too, asserted a bunch of talented youngsters at Gyan Manch on Saturday. The evening saw the new face of drama group The Red Curtain present Eugene Ionescos Rhinoceros.				 				 																															The performance marked the debut of Shuktara Lal  a post-graduate student of English literature at Jadavpur University  in the directors shoes. The youngsters did not disappoint the full house that had turned up to watch them.				 				 																															For a closer connection with the audience, the play was adapted and modified to include Indian locales and characters. So, the protagonist Berenger, an average citizen in a nameless French city, becomes Akash, in another nameless city (most likely our own, with one of the settings being a city coffee shop), the local government office where he works becomes a private law firm, to mention a couple among similar other changes.				 				 																															In the play, Berenger (or Akash), a young, slightly indifferent man (initially depicted as having lost much of himself to alcohol), eventually finds out that people around him have turned into rhinoceros. These include his close friend, Jeet, his office colleagues and finally his love, Tara.				 				 																															Red Curtains Rhinoceros spanned almost two-and-a-half hours. But despite the length, it had the audience glued to the seats, thanks to tight performances by all the actors. In particular, Prithviraj Choudhury and Dhruv Mookerji, the former as Akash and the latter playing Jeet, were brilliant.				 				 																															The funny scenes had the audience rolling with laughter. The logician, doling out syllogisms to his disciple (Socrates is a cat, all cats die, therefore all cats are called Socrates) drew plenty of laughs. Bibek Bhattacharya put in a great performance in the role of the logician and later as Akashs boss, Mr Dalmia. Samimitra Das, as the disciple and later as Mr Bose with a heavy Bengali accent, was very entertaining to watch as well. All proceeds from the performance, went to Children in Pain (CHIP), an NGO working for the betterment of children.				 				 																															The cast and the director seemed to enjoy the proceedings. I felt the play would be relevant for our society, said Shuktara  a regular in JUs departmental productions under her father Ananda Lal  who had tried her hand at direction in school once before.				 				 																															And though acting is what she is generally seen doing, in case of Rhinoceros, she had decided that she cant act and direct at the same time. The script selection and her own research began in January, while rehearsals were on since February.				 				 																															It was loads of fun, exclaimed Debosmita Majumdar, another JU student who was a part of the costume and makeup team. The best part is that were all friends anyway, so the bonding is all the better.				 				 																															Owing to the college and university examinations, no plans are afoot to take the Rhinoceros by its horns to other stages right now. Later, maybe? It all depends on the availability of the team, Shuktara said.				 				 																
	 Turning 3 in style				 				 																															Army Public School, Calcutta, celebrated its third annual day recently. 				 				 																															For a month, auditions, selections and rehearsals had kept everyone busy. Finally the big moment came.				 				 																															The programme began with a speech by chief guest Major-General Z.U. Shah. Then the school band provided the music for the welcome dance. The annual school report followed. Next, it was the prize distribution ceremony.				 				 																															Later, the junior school made Rudyard Kipling join creative forces with the Brothers Grimm in its production in which Mowgli meets Snow White. The senior school staged the award-winning Alls Not Well That Ends Well, inspired by Shakespeare and current Bollywood trends.				 				 																															The play Dil mein jami barf, on busy parents and their lack of time for their children, provided food for thought. The younger students put their vocal timbre to test in If I were a butterfly.				 				 																															The finale was a dance celebrating the harmony of the elements. The applause made all the hard work worth the hours that went into it. Moen Sen,

	 Chipping in				 				 																															CHIP (Children In Pain) organised a musical evening with singer Pratik Chowdhury and Bangla band Bhoomi recently to raise funds for a newly-built library for underprivileged kids. 				 				 																															The purpose was to inculcate a fondness for reading among the children and enhance their literary abilities. Books in English and vernacular languages will be accessible to them. Although people enjoyed listening to Pratik Chowdhurys Ek Je Achhe Kanya and Bhoomis Tomar Dekha Nai, they were also eager to be a part of the CHIP family.				 				 																															The event helped raise funds and create awareness about the organisation. A good response from the crowds and the cooperation of the artistes made the show a success.				 				 																
	 Truly TagoreSchools and colleges around the city celebrated the Bards birth anniversary in his own words and tunes.Madhur tomar shesh je na pai was the theme of the Rabindra Jayanti celebrations at Loreto College. All the teachers, clad in saris, paid tribute to Rabindranath Tagore on his 143rd birth anniversary. There was a slide show presentation, featuring portraits of the Bard.				 				 																															The programme was divided into two sections. The first half highlighted romantic love and Tagores passion for nature. Teachers sang songs like Hey nuton and read out from Chitrangada. The second part emphasised the Nobel laureates love for the country and performed a number of patriotic songs.				 				 																															The songs conveyed the message of the destructive power of love. The teachers sang Agun Jalo and read from his essay I am proud of my people. The programme ended with a vote of thanks by Sister Tina and a prayer penned by Tagore himself.  Suchi Arya,

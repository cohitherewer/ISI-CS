The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Bratati Bandyopadhyay, elocutionist. Your practicality sees you through problems. You are best at executive work. Be prudent in money matters. Your choosy nature will leave you with few but firm friends. Children will bring joy. Classical music may hold the healing power for you.  Kusum Bhandari

 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Consular book boost for brand Bengal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on overdrive to showcase the states increasingly favourable business climate, timely buttress has again come from consular quarters to carry the hard-sell pitch overseas.																								Following the tremendous success of the structured international business seminar last November as part of its annual golf meet, the Consular Corps is poised to launch a book, which will spread the good word on brand Bengal abroad. 																								The chief minister himself will release A Resurgent West Bengal on June 9, a publication of the Consular Corps, chronicling the proceedings of the conclave.																								West Bengal is ready for a take-off across a number of sectors, Bhattacharjee had remarked at the conference, and the line of thinking at the Writers is that there couldnt have been a more effective vehicle for reaching out to prospective foreign investors and outsourcing agencies. The Consular Corps in Calcutta has members from 44 countries, besides Unicef.																								We are looking to ship copies of the book across to all the Indian embassies and diplomatic missions around the world and through them, project the critical strengths of Bengal. It would give all prospective investors a fair idea about the business climate here, explains Satish Kapur, honorary consul of Finland in Calcutta and one of the prime movers behind the initiative.																								West Bengal needs an aggressive image turnaround exercise, noted economist-analyst Jairam Ramesh had prescribed at the seminar. And going by the steady stream of overseas business delegations that have touched down in the city since November, the perception is surely on the mend, feel city-based diplomats.																								The Consular Corps brass, though, is quick to point out that infrastructure must keep pace with the image-rebuild move. Foreigners coming to stay and work in the city would be looking at international-quality education, medical facilities, clubs and entertainment, and also passionate pastimes like golf and racing. Care should be taken to properly nurture and promote these elements, observes a member of the Corps.																								Flenders chairman Udo Land had suggested that Bengal needs to showcase its success stories. Somnath Chatterjee, chairman of WBIDC (co-host of the seminar) makes a start in the book, identifying a strong agricultural backbone and robust infrastructure as inherent strengths of the state.

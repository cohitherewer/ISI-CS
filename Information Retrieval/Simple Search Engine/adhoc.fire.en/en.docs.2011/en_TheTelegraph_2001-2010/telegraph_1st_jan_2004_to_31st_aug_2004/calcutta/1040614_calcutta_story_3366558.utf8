The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Handyman, standby hangman
 															- Executioner comes out of retirement on job pledge for grandson DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Hangman Nata Mallik came out of retirement and agreed to execute caretaker-cum-liftman Dhananjoy Chatterjee on June 25 for raping and murdering 14-year-old Hetal Parekh in 1989. But Nata agreed to do so only on condition that the government find a job for his 19-year-old grandson Prabhat Mallik. The government obliged. But there was a catch, which even the hangman had not bargained for.																								Both Nata and Prabhat had to give an unusual undertaking which states that the younger Mallik would have to work as the governments hangman whenever required  that is, when Nata or his sons are not around.																								Prabhat Mallik does not know what his official job will be like, but he admits that the jail and social welfare department has made it clear that he will have to double as the official hangman whenever the need arises. When I requested the government to find a job for my grandson, I did not know that they would make me and my grandson give such an undertaking. I had a long discussion with Prabhat and only when he agreed to the governments condition did we decide to sign the documents, Nata said.																								According to the agreement papers handed over to the jail and social welfare department, Prabhat would have to travel anywhere in Bengal to carry out a hangmans duties and he will be paid Rs 10,000 for each hanging, which is what the government pays his grandfather.																								Had the government refused my grandson a job, I would never have agreed to come out of retirement and carry out the latest execution, says Nata. The last time he tightened the noose was in 1991, when he executed two men for murdering four members of a family in South Dinajpur.																								Ever since 1991, Nata had been clamouring for a job for his son. The government procrastinated till the high court sentenced Dhananjoy Chatterjee to death.																								So, when the jail department officials came knocking on Natas door, the octogenarian refused to budge from his earlier decision. You did not keep your promise then. My son has got a job now, but if you want me to carry out the latest sentence, you will have to get my grandson a job, he said.																								The government contacted a hangman in Tihar jail, who, besides asking for an astronomical sum, demanded an air ticket and star treatment. So the government had to go back to Nata and oblige him.

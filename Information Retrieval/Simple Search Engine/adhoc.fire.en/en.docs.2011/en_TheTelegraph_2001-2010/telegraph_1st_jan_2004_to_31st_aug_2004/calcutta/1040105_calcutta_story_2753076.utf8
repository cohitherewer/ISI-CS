 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								What do readers want? A question not asked at National Library for years suddenly finds itself echoing through the corridors of the much-maligned repository of knowledge.																								In a desperate bid to improve work culture and render better services, the National Library authorities have reached out to their readers, asking them whats wrong with the place (in brief) and seeking suggestions on how to set it right.																								Director Ramanuj Bhattacharjee has started distributing a 14-point questionnaire among readers (see box). The questions begin from the basics (How long have you been a member of this library Is there any special reason for using this library?) and carry on till the tech talk (Does the division/section you use work in a computerised environment Have you used our e-mail?).																								I have conducted a number of surprise visits in different departments of the library and met readers. Many have complained of the poor service. There have been a number of complaints that readers are not getting the books they require and are waiting for hours to get a document photocopied, said Bhattacharjee.																								Following up on such feedback, director Bhattacharjee issued the Q amp;A to readers late last year, asking them to submit their views by December 31, and directly to his office.																								I have received 150 responses so far and decided to extend the last date for submission by another week. I have assured the readers that the library authorities will keep their feedback secret so that they are not victimised in future, added Bhattacharjee.																								Readers seemed to have welcomed the move. We have been expecting such a drive from the top for some time now, said Indra Mitra and Ardhendu Mukherjee, who have been using the library for the past 20 years.																								There are so many problems we face every time we come to library. We have often explained our problems to the junior officers, who have given us a patient hearing. But nothing has ever changed. Now, hopefully, the readers feedback will make a difference, they added.																								The National Library Staff Association (NLSA) also reacted positively to the directors move to streamline the administration and improve services.																								We have demanded that the photocopying facilities be extended to readers on Saturdays and Sundays as well. At present, the facility is available from Monday to Friday and that, too, till 3 pm, when our cash counters close, said Saibal Chakraborty of the NLSA, stressing the need for change.

Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop, an experimental dance company, in association with two city-based NGOs, Sparsha, a support agency for people with HIV/AIDS, and Saathi, an organization promoting HIV/AIDS initiatives, presents Positive Lives, an evening of contemporary dance performance along with discussions that seek to honour the struggles and moral courage displayed by victims of this dreaded, life-threatening condition. A visual montage that tells the story of people living with HIV, this is a unique concert that uses an artistic medium to endorse a social cause. Inspired by real-life stories, anecdotes and case histories, the performance sensitively portrays the travails endured by HIV-positive patients and how they have learnt to survive with dignity despite the mental agony, alienation and social stigma from which they are made to suffer.																								When: Contemporary dance on HIV-AIDS initiatives																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

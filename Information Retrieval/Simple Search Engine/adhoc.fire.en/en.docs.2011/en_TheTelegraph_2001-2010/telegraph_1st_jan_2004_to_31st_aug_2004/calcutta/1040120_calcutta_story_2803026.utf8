 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Taint fears shut cancer hospice, isolate son
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA				 	 Goutam Chatterjee: Shunned by kin																								What would explain city-bred political activists shutting down a hospice for terminally-ill cancer patients on the grounds that medical wastes would pollute the area? What would explain a fathers alleged decision to throw his cancer-patient son out so that he could not spread the disease in the family?																								The answers could be disturbing and distressing. The hospice was inaugurated on December 24, 2003, in the presence of former Calcutta High Court judge Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee and others. But even before a single patient could be wheeled in, the hospice (at 24, Park Avenue, Modern Park, Santoshpur) has been forced out of business.																								A 50-strong mob, comprising CPM cadre from the area, stormed it the day after it was inaugurated and told representatives of the Friends Foundation of Asia (the organisation behind the hospice) that they would have to move out.																								This is a residential area and we will not let you pollute the environment here with biological waste, they ticked off the foundation members.																								We tried our best but were unsuccessful in making them see reason, admitted foundation spokesperson Somasree Ray. We explained to them that this would basically be an old-age haven for cancer patients unwanted at home, she added, regretting that the protesters kept on insisting that the whole para would be infected by the hospice.																								House-owner A.N. Pal, who had initially seemed supportive, later shifted his stance. We were paying rent for the past few months but though he did not tell us in so many words, we could understand that he was under a lot of pressure, Ray added. 																								So, the foundation pulled out of the rented Santoshpur accommodation and took up another place at Narendrapur, in South 24-Parganas.																								When approached, the local CPM party office refused to comment. Retired Jadavpur University teacher Pal accused the foundation of concealing the fact that they were planning a hospice. I do not want to talk about it, he said, but denied that he was under pressure from his neighbours to show his tenants the door. Why do you want to dig up the past? he asked.																								CPM leader Kanti Ganguly, a resident of the area, appeared stunned by the turn of events. I will look into the matter and provide whatever help the organisation requires, promised the Sunderbans affairs minister.																								Justice Banerjee, too, was shocked. We claim to be liberal, progressive and generous but are actually uneducated and illiterate, he said.																								Goutam Chatterjee is another victim of what Justice Banerjee refers to as the lack of education. The private tutor living in Taki, in North 24-Parganas, moved out of his parents home after marrying without their permission. But things took a far nastier turn after he was detected with cancer of the larynx. His father, according to the south Calcutta-based Laryngotomee Club, then hardened his stand and asked Goutam to stay away.																								The 35-year-old Chatterjee is now living at one of his students residence and cannot talk of his travails. But wife Anjana confirmed how the detection of cancer was linked to the slamming of family doors. 																								Bibhuti Chakraborty, founder-member of Laryngotomee Club, is teaching the tutor oesophaegal speech so that he does not lose his livelihood.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Failed students demand re-exam
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hundreds of students of private engineering colleges on Monday converged on the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) at Salt Lake, demanding they be allowed to reappear for the exams they failed in in the first two semesters. 																								Do not ruin our career, they chanted, after assembling in front of the university. Later, they submitted a memorandum to vice-chancellor Ashoke Thakur.																								The students stressed that they be given another chance to clear their backlog papers, as each of them had paid Rs 16,000 per semester. Loss of a single year would mean each student wasting Rs 32,000.																								The students demand has put the WBUT authorities in a quandary. One cannot deny that the students in private engineering colleges have to pay higher fees than those who study in the government-funded institutions. But we cannot allow the failed students to go up to the higher classes in this way, Samir Bandopadhyay, university registrar, said. 																								The issue will be discussed with the authorities of various private engineering colleges shortly.																								A similar agitation by students of private engineering colleges of Calcutta, protesting detention in class, had earlier rocked the city. Finally, the university authorities had conceded their demand.																								According to the WBUT rule, students of private engineering colleges may proceed to the next semester even if they fail a maximum of four papers. They are required to clear the failed papers within two consecutive semesters. 																								By the rules, they have to be detained when they fail to clear the papers in the two consecutive semesters. 																								For example, a student who fails to clear any paper of the first and second semester cannot go up to fifth and sixth semesters. 																								University officials said the students demands will be placed before the academic council this week for consideration. We will act according to the decision of the academic council, registrar Thakur said.

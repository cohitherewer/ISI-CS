The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 Life Designs on the brideSMITA ROY CHOWDHURYDiivyaa Gurwaara and (above) actor Jeet flaunts one of designer Sharbari Dattas creations for the event. Pictures by Rashbehari Das and Pabitra Das 															Marriages may indeed be made in heaven, but that doesnt make the process of finding the right finery any easier. Unless you are planning on heading for Bridal Asia, an annual extravaganza showcasing a melange of bridal necessities, being held in the Capital for the past four years. The most awaited wedding fair of the country will roll out its fifth edition in Delhi between September 21 and 27. And while the participation from Calcutta has always been good, this year the event features the whos who of the citys fashion circuit.Designer diary																					From stalwarts like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Sharbari Datta, Anamika Khanna, Monapali, Suman Nathwani and Shamlu Dudeja, to budding talent like Shantanu Goenka and Nisha Beri  the city is quite well represented.																					We have a complete bridal story from Calcutta this year. All the designers work with different craft forms and each ones creations are so very unique, says CEO Bridal Asia, Diivyaa Gurwaara, visiting Calcutta on Friday. While Sabyasachi has promised to do a very special line for the event, Anamika will present her collection exclusively for the wedding season and Sharbari will showcase a gorgeous line for the groom with her trademark hand-embroidery. Shamlus traditional kantha work, Shantanus signature lehnga cholis, Nishas chikankari , Monapalis ornate ethnics and Sumans lingerie line will complete the picture, along with bridal jewellery from Calcutta-based jeweller Nemichand.Calcutta has always been a very important city for Bridal Asia and not just for its designers. A lot of buyers fly over to Delhi to check out the fare and they constitute a large proportion of our audience, adds Diivyaa.Ramp roster																					The event will start off with three ramp shows between September 21 and 23, which will be followed by an exhibition of all the collections. On the first day, the rising talent from the countrys fashion world will take the ramp, while Day 2 and 3 will be devoted to the bigwigs.																					The inaugural show on September 22 will boast two big names with Calcutta connections  Ritu Kumar and Sharbari Datta, while the finale will see Sabyasachi creating a stir. The other Calcutta designers have chosen to stay away from the ramp, opting to showcase their collections in the exhibition. Model moves 																					The designs will be flaunted on the catwalk by some of the top pirouetting beauties of the country like Vidisha Pavate, Viveka Babaji, Tapur Chatterjee, Lakshmi Menon among others and some relatively new faces like Moni Kongona and Mridula. We have always believed in giving new talent a platform  be it designers or models, says Diivyaa.																					But the main attractions, as far as the clothes horses are concerned, will be Pakistani actress Reema and four models from across the border  Mikaal (quite a hit with the women at last years show), Nial Ahmed, Nomi Qamar and Usman Ali Khan.Next step																					January 2003 brought Bridal Asia to Calcutta for the first time and though it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience, the dates for this years event have not been fixed yet. Calcutta is a smaller market and hence we have to do the show on a smaller scale. The logistics and economics dont always work well in that case. We are looking for logistical support and once that is in place, we will be ready to freeze the dates, adds Diivyaa.																					But what she is more upbeat about at the moment is taking the show across the border. I am looking at taking Bridal Asia to Pakistan and maybe even London towards the end of the year. But all that is still in the planning stage, she reveals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Victor gracious while wresting back seat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hanti hanti pa pa, Trinamul bari ja																								It was 30 minutes past one when the last batch of Trinamul Congress supporters trudged towards the exit door of the counting centre at Hastings. With CPM candidate from Jadavpur Sujan Chakraborty leading by an unassailable margin, the crestfallen Trinamul men found all exit doors slamming shut.																								A few hours later, Chakraborty was declared winner of the constituency, trouncing sitting Trinamul MP Krishna Bose by 86,000 votes. The cloud of abir in the air said it all  the reds had wrested the parliamentary seat they lost in 1989.																								Comrades, rejoice Its time to celebrate, but remember you must not cause any inconvenience to the public or even the Opposition, Chakraborty broke into an impromptu speech, flashing the victory sign, as partymen thronged around him. 																								I want to be different and will not make any promises that I wont be able to keep. I will definitely call on the losing candidate (Bose) when I am through with my work here, smiled the first-time MP, gracious in victory. 																								Citing reasons behind the NDAs nationwide failure, Chakraborty said it was the combination of an anti-BJP wave, misrule at the Centre and Mamata Banerjees wayward politics that finally swept through the heart of the city. This victory is a clear mandate against the Trinamul. Its time for them to go, he told Metro. 																								Apart from winning the elections, the masters degree-holder in pharmacology also takes credit for research on cancer.																								Sujanmama would spend sleepless nights working for the party as the Student Federation of Indias (SFI) all-India general secretary in 1998. He would campaign all day in the sweltering heat and his doctor, sportsmen and pharmacist friends would cheer him all the way, recalled the leaders nephew, Pronab Chakraborty.																								Nodding his head in delight was Babu, the tea-stall boy from Jadavpur, who walked with the victory procession that started from Hastings at around 5 pm.																								While the victory march wound its way through the city, Trinamul candidate Bose chose to shut herself away from the public eye. 																								She had come to the counting centre only once in the morning, said one of her supporters. 																								By 5 pm, Bose had locked herself in her Sarat Bose Road residence, refusing to meet anyone.																								Apart from the Behala West assembly segment, which Bose led with 1,000 votes, she lost all the remaining six segments  Behala East, Jadavpur, Baruipur, Mograhat, Bishnupur and Kabitirtha  by huge margins.

 SUBHRO SAHA																								In January alone, 37 lives were lost in road accidents across the city, which also left more than 50 people seriously injured. 																								Trauma-care experts ascribe a vast majority of the fatality and morbidity in traffic mishaps to erratic primary handling of victims.																								A daylong workshop on World Health Day (April 7), with 25 senior traffic police officers, will kick off a campaign by Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals to orient the cops in safety of the victim and roadside procedures to stabilise the patient and prevent further harm till trained paramedics arrive.																								Our effort is to sensitise our personnel in proper scientific methods of lifting and transporting accident victims from site to hospital and we welcome this initiative by Apollo. The initial target is to get all the 250 sergeants in our department oriented through the workshops, says deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Piyush Pandey.																								Arijit Bose, consultant, emergency medicine, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, and his emergency team, who handle two to three severe injuries almost every day, have prepared a working protocol of dos and donts for the traffic police to help them handle accident victims better. 																								Awareness and swift action on the part of onlookers and police personnel, who are often nearest to the accident site, can go a long way in efficient management, at times saving lives as well, observes Bose.																								The checklist for cops and pedestrians stresses on airway control, bleeding and circulation, the ABC of trauma management.																								Special attention should be given to stabilise the cervical spine and minimise movements of the head and neck when injury in those regions is suspected, besides careful airway management, warns orthopaedic surgeon Ranjan Kamilya.																								The hospital also plans to provide the traffic police department with special trauma first-aid boxes, to be kept in booths near major intersections. 																								Each box would contain a cervical collar, an airway tube, bandage and gauge, an intravenous cannula and colloids  essential tools for preliminary trauma care.

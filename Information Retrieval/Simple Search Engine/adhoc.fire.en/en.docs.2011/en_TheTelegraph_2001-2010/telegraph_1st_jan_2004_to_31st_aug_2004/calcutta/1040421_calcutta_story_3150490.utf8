				 	 Cabin crew training has landed a lucky few a brush with Bollywood. Case in point: Hum Tum starring Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee																								That a pretty or handsome face is the necessary passport to becoming an airhostess or steward is the biggest myth. This, from the largest company in cabin crew training in India. 																								Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training (it is open to men too!), which announced expansion plans in the city on Tuesday, is categorical in assuring all hopefuls that there is far more to mid-air hospitality than good looks. This is not modelling or showbiz. Airlines look for honest, hardworking men and women. Looks are secondary, says chairman of Frankfinn, K.S. Kohli.																								This is good news for young hopefuls signing up at the centre, which launched a one-year diploma course last year. Having received overwhelming response nationally, the east has been no exception. After the Camac Street centre, a branch was inaugurated in Salt Lake a week ago, with another to follow in Alipore.																								The industry is growing fast, according to the Mumbai-headquartered Frankfinn. Sixty per cent of recruitment is by international airlines, says Kohli. With more and more airlines from the region turning to India for cabin crew, the numbers will keep on growing. Royal Jordanian and Gulf have been recruiting widely in India, and Southeast Asian companies are expected to follow suit.																								Some trainees also had a brush with filmdom, when the Yashraj team roped in Frankfinn students to play reel-life cabin crew in the upcoming blockbuster, Hum Tum.																								Of the 150 students enrolled in the city, most are between the ages of 18 and 26. The enrolment season is set to start now, with exams finishing. Our course is two hours a day, five days a week, so students have no problem pursuing a college degree while studying here, adds managing director R. Agarwal.																								The Frankfinn diploma covers not only the aviation industry, but the hospitality and travel sectors as well. Our main focus is training students to face the challenging interviews, explains Agarwal.																								Special attention is paid to aviation industry requirements. Most international airlines apparently require all recruits to have swimming skills, so students are taught how to swim with their clothes on, and assist someone else, as they may need to in an emergency.																								Technical training is not the focus as airlines take care of that post recruitment. Personality development, grooming, spoken English are instead the core areas covered.																								Calcuttans and those from the Northeast generally do well in this industry, because the perception is that they are good with hospitality, smiles Kohli.																								But with the number of vacancies still limited  last year there were around 800 from private players  the on-ground hospitality industry is a good place to start. Experience in hotels increase the chance of absorption into the aviation industry, advises Agarwal.

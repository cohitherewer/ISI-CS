MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA AND SANGITA S. GUHA ROYChef Qureshi at The Atrium on Thursday. Picture by Rashbehari DasThe boys in blue may have lost their appetite in Lahore after Thursdays thrashing, but Calcuttas foodies are getting a taste of the best the city has to offer.A Street Foods of Lahore celebration has set mouths watering at The Atrium Caf. The city is famous for its Food Street, where dishes from all over Pakistan can be found. And consultant chef Md Irfan Qureshi  son of the legendary chef Imtiaz Qureshi  has brought the delightful flavours to town for a festival on till April 18.A must-try  as well as the chefs recommendation  is the Chapali Kebab, a lightly seasoned soft beef patty, with pomegranate. If mutton is your preferred meat, the Kadhak Seekh Kebab is more tender than the standard seekh kebabs served up in the city, with a crisp cornflour batter coating.There is not much difference between Pakistani and Indian cooking, explains chef Qureshi. Some of the selected dishes, like the Chapali Kebab, may be more Pakistani than Indian, but the spices and styles are similar, he explains.The Chicken Churga is a variation on Tandoori Chicken. The Murgh Kastoori Kebab is very tender. For vegetarians, the chef recommends the Makai Seekh Kebab and Pindi Chole.The ambience at the coffee shop at The Park is in keeping with the theme. Cricket, of course, is on the telly. Waiters have given up T-shirts for long kurtas and jeans, with topis or bandanas on their heads. A paanwallah and churiwallah are at hand at the entrance.We held a Calcutta street food festival earlier, which was a big hit, and are planning a Delhi festival soon, says food and beverage manager Anirban Simlai. We find that more than fine dining, this is the kind of food that appeals to Calcutta, he adds. The popular dishes will find their way onto the main menu. The six-month old supermarket at Ballygunge, Wot Not!, organised a cookery demonstration of Bengali food on Wednesday. Poila Baisakh is that time of the year when tradition jostles with innovation on your dinner table, said culinary pro Shampa Raha, conducting the promotion. I have tried to make use of a few traditional ingredients to come up with some rare recipes like Moti Pulao and Aamer Morabba apart from the usual fare.Shampa showed the audience how to make Moti Pulao (pulao with vegetable tikkis), Dhokar Dalna, Potoler Dolma, Kesar Payesh and Aamer Morabba.

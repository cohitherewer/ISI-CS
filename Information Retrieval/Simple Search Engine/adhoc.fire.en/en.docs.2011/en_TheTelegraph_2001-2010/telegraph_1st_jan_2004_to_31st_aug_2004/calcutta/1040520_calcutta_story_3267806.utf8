And this time, the Free School Street centre has extended a helping hand to Swayam, a womens group working for women against violence.																								At an exhibition starting on Wednesday at Darbari, a lifestyle store on Purna Das Road, products developed by the women of Rasa and Swayam are being showcased.																								The exhibition, which was inaugurated by danseuse Tanusree Shankar, actor Swastika Mukherjee and jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty, showcases a range of beauty products, spices and tea that have been especially created for this exhibition.																								Sujata Dey, one of the two owners of Darbari said: By giving needy women a chance to earn their living, Sasha is working for a noble cause. When they approached us for this exhibition, we were all too eager to do our bit. We had already tested the waters by stocking some Rasa products at our store and the response we received was immense. Both the cosmetics and the spices were a hit, especially with our NRI clients.																								The exhibition will continue for the next 20 days, after which there will be a permanent Sasha corner at the south Calcutta store.																								The special attractions of the exhibition include a face pack and a hair pack which have been beautifully packaged together to make ideal gift options, lemon tea, ginger tea and another combo pack of a bath oil and a bath salt.																								I have used many of the Rasa products. The cosmetics are very natural and dont contain chemicals. Spices like the Biryani masala, Chicken Tandoori masala and the Mutton Vindaloo mix are good, too. 																								The way they have been packaged now make them ideal for gifts and the best part is that they dont burn a hole in your pocket, said Nilanjana, while checking out the stuff on display.

 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Guard slain in factory raid
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Police have launched a probe into the murder of a security guard and the subsequent dacoity in the factory he was on duty at on JN Mukherjee Road, in north Howrahs Ghusuri area.																								According to additional superintendent of police Lakshmi Singh, a gang entered Delhi Iron and Steel Company, maker of spares, at dawn. After killing guard Benimadhab Chakraborty, 35, the criminals dumped his body into a well. They then broke open the office safe and made off with Rs 35,000. 																								Police said Chakraborty used to turn in after night shift at around 4 every morning. Initial investigations revealed that the criminals were well armed, since the guards body bore several deep marks of injury. The investigators believe that he may have known the criminals. 																								It is evident that he tried to stop the gang from entering the factory. But as he had only a bamboo stick in hand, he could hardly put up a fight, additional superintendent Singh said.																								When factory manager Radheyshyam Sharma arrived for work at 8 am, he found the front gate open. He thought Chakraborty had taken a break. On entering the factory, however, he found that the office had been ransacked and the safe was open and empty. 																								He raised an alarm. Neighbours launched a search for guard Chakraborty, and in a short while, his body was found in the well. The search party informed the local police at Malipanchghara, who sent the body for post-mortem.																								Additional superintendent Singh said Chakraborty was a resident of Burdwan and had worked in the factory for nearly 10 years. His family was informed and the body will be handed over to them later. 																								Initial investigation shows that the killers might have been known to him. We have already interrogated a number of persons and hope to net the criminals soon, Singh added. Mass leave threat: Civic  services may be disrupted in the city on Wednesday as members  of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations Clerks Union have  threatened to go on mass leave to press for a charter of  demands. However, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said that action  would be taken against those who skip duty on the day.

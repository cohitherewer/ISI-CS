The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 07, 2004 on amp; offScreen on amp; off

	The fans of Feluda are a die-hard lot. Not only of the novels and the two classics by Satyajit Ray  Sonar Kella and Joy Baba Felunath, of course  but also of the latest screen adaptation by his son. The more you give them, the more they want. So heres something for them.
	 After a long, long run in city cinemas, Bombaiyer Bombete had finally gone off-screen some time back. But now, its galloping back again into INOX City Centre, every evening by popular demand. 
	The daily screening idea follows the success of the movie in the recently-concluded Bengali film festival at the multiplex. The Bombaiyer Bombete show had a full house, but there were still people who were disappointed that they didnt get tickets, said a spokesperson for INOX. We got a number of requests for another special screening, she added.
	 INOX has complied with the call for more with just that  a little more. Its another chance, then, for Feluda freaks who missed the film the first time to catch Bengals favourite sleuth pit mind and muscle against the gory Mr Gore.
	 I have not been able to drop in at INOX City Centre yet, but the fact that people are clamouring for more of Feluda is very encouraging, said Sabyasachi Feluda Chakraborty. 
	Age cannot wither nor custom stale Every screen goddess or demi-goddess would like us to so believe. But somehow it does not always work that way. Or why should Bollywood royal Kareena Kapoor look so mature (to put it politely) beside Shahid Kapoor in the promos of Fida?
	 Kareena, aka Poo, aka Chameli, has streaked her hair and is playing Neha. Shahid, on his part, rides a bike and flexes his muscles (for the wowing pleasure of the teen brigade) as Jai. In the teenybopper romance Ishq Vishk, Shahid looked more at home (in terms of age that is) alongside the likes of Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywalla. But in Fida sadly, the youngster, with whom Kareena is supposed to fall in love because of his sheer determination and willingness to do anything for her, looks more her younger brother than beau.
	It is a bigger tragedy considering the fact that the two are more than friends in real life, and ever since Pankaj Karamchand Kapoors son stepped into her life, Kareena has been shouting out loud in every interview she has given on and off screen that she is the youngest heroine material around fit to be paired with Shahid. It is with Fardeen Khan, who also shares screen space with her in the Ken Ghosh film, that she fits in. The discrepancy hits the eye all the more as seconds from Fida it is snatches of the screen romance of Ash and Vivek that come on beam in Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... And boy, dont they look cosy together. 
	Television software conglomerate UTV has come calling in Calcutta, scouting for talent. No, this search is not of the kind launched by Zee TV or Channel V. The firm has recently launched its film production and distribution wing and will soon be going full throttle with a clutch of films, including the much-awaited Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Swades directed by Asutosh Gowarikar. Before that, they plan to put their distribution network in place. 
	The UTV recruitment net was spread across the whole of the eastern region  West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and the northeastern states. 
	Few distributors post people in these remote corners. But in our single-umbrella concept, we have to have representation everywhere, says Sanjeev Mehta, vice-president, film distribution.
	 But the catch is, UTV is targeting people outside the film distribution business. 
	We want our recruits to work the way we want the network to function. So we would rather have them from other professions, without any pre-conceived notions of operation. The requirement is a background in handling consumer durables  telecom to automobiles. The logic is that since such people are savvy about marketing, customer relations and negotiations, they fit the bill to handle a film. 
	We look at movies as brands with a short shelf life. Gone are those days of celebrating jubilee weeks. If a film runs for six-eight weeks, it is good enough for the producer, Mehta muses. 
	She had more on-screen smooches than costume changes to her credit in Khwahish. She went on to Murder the box-office in a bikini and less. And she even got to do the Chan Chan. Kaho na kaho, Reema Lamba aka Mallika Sherawat is definitely flying high these days. When just one quote from her can change headlines across the country, you can well imagine what entire interviews can do! And thats precisely what shes giving to news and music channels, post-Jackie Chan. 
	Either rubbishing or being rubbished, Mallika manages to remain one of the most talked-about heroines around. 
	Her prime talking point now, of course, is her on-screen and off-screen tete-a-tete with the one and only Jackie Chan. Mallika not only became the first Indian actress to break The Myth that a Bollywood beauty cannot match the high energy levels of the martial arts master, she even went on teach Chan how to do those desi matkas and jhatkas. 
	And she had the Rush Hour star copying her step for step, they claim. There is even talk of Mallika doing a repeat round on reel with Chan. 
	Say this about Mallika, when shes not on the big screen, she makes sure there is lots of her on the small screen. If in the run-up to Murder, one remembers her doing the laptop act with Mahesh Bhatt on the sets, after The Myth she will be seen this weekend in an interview where her neckline stops where the talks table begins. So, happy viewing.

 SUBHRO SAHAAn increasing yen for alcohol, over-reliance on fast foods, a propensity to pop in painkillers at the hint of a headache, dependence on anti-depressants, experimenting with amphetamines Todays jet-setting lifestyle comes with its concomitant ills, and its not just the heart that bears the brunt of this unhealthy cocktail.																								So, the next time you have a nagging pain in the right upper abdomen or experience unexplained bouts of nausea and fatigue, ignore the signs at your own peril. It could well be fatty liver disease (FLD), a condition often linked to alcohol and wrong food habits, and afflicting nearly 30 per cent of Calcuttas population, say specialists.																								Not just lifestyle liver condition, but ailments like alcoholic and drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver cancer, are on the rise, warn city hepatologists and gastro-enterologists.																								While the prognosis for Hepatitis B or C can be far more serious, theres no denying that fatty liver disease (enlargement of the liver due to deposition of fat exceeding five per cent of liver weight) is a snowballing problem. More so, since up to 30 per cent of those afflicted can progress to cirrhosis if untreated, cautions Mahesh K. Goenka, chief gastro-enterologist, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.																								Doctors report a 15-30 per cent spiral in diseases of the liver over the past two-three years and a large percentage can be traced to an inherently flawed lifestyle.																								Opinion differs on how much is too much, but alcohol abuse remains the most common cause of fat deposition in the liver. An adult male consuming more than 80 gm (20 gm is equivalent to 60 ml or one peg measure of whisky) of alcohol a day runs a 90 per cent risk of developing FLD over a five to seven-year period. For women, the threshold would be significantly lower, says Goenka.																								Its not just about quantity downed, but faulty drinking habits too, which contribute to the cause, adds consultant hepatologist and gastro-enterologist Sarika Kedia. Unlike in the West, here people have a tendency to drink on an empty stomach, like before dinner, along with snacks like peanuts. This causes more damage to the liver cells, which are not nutritionally protected. It also kills appetite, she explains.																								Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), classically linked to obesity, high triglycerides or diabetes, often caused by fast foods rich in fat but deficient in vitamins, has also showed an alarming rise in recent times.																								Once a patient is diagnosed with FLD, it is important to investigate for all the Syndrome X disorders like hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes, angina or heart disease, for which there is a high genetic predisposition in these parts, doctors suggest.

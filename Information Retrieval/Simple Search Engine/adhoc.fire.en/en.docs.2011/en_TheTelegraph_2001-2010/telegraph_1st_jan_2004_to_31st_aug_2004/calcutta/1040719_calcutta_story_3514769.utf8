 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Suicide note points finger inside
 							 - A family fallen upon bad times A STAFF REPORTER Krishnendu: ill-fated trip																								Was it because of Amalendu Saha, one of the uncles?																								The Sahas would not speak and nor would the familys only surviving member, Shibendus elder sister Jayashree. But neighbours and others close to the family say that decadence had already set in in the otherwise flourishing trade of the Sahas. 																								Detectives probing the case are holding on to Shibendus suicide note as the key lead. The three-page, hand-written document holds Amalendu responsible and even raises questions on the role of two other women  Amalendus wife and his mother-in-law. 																								Ever since Shibendus father, Nabendu Bikash, withdrew from the day-to-day running of Ramakrishna Bakery, Shibendu and uncle Amalendu were managing affairs. There must have been some problems. I guess it was inevitable, since they were coping with the times. I am not sure if there were any differences of opinion. It was not discernible, said Purnendu Bikash, another of Shibendus uncles.																								But not everything was gung-ho. The Sahas, who had mounted a lavish wedding for daughter Jayashree a few years ago, were not a content family. Shibendu would complain to the extent that he was struggling to buy baby food for his son, claimed one of his friends, an LIC agent, on condition of anonymity. 																								The money was just not reaching Shibendu. When other members of the family would ask the uncle-nephew duo for money, Shibendu would fumble. Back home, he would crib to his wife about lack of funds for the business, claimed the friend, who has grown up with Shibendu. 																								To meet the growing demands of his family, Shibendu decided to take loans. Savings certificates and other assets were sold off, but the proceeds werent enough, so he touched brother Krishnendu for a loan.  There is no denying that he was neck-deep in debt and that he had exhausted all possible sources of money, said an investigating officer.																								Detectives believe Shibendu had given up all hope of a turnaround. This possibly explains why he has indicted his uncle as the man responsible for the tragedy and for referring to his aunt as kaalnagini, said an officer of Charu Market police station.Bodies being stretchered out of the Saha house on Sunday afternoon.

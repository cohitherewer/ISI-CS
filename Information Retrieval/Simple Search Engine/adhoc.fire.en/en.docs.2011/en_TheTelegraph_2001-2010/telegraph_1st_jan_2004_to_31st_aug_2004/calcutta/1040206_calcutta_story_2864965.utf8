 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Fast-track court nails Gabbar for murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than two-and-a-half years after the death of businessman Sanjiv Jhulka, alias Bunty, the Alipore fast-track first court on Thursday found crimelord Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar, guilty of carrying out a pre-planned murder.																								Three of Gabbars accomplices in the crime  Shabnam, Trisha Roy and Fatman Brooks  were also found guilty. The other key conspirator, Ranvijay Singh Rathore, son of a south Calcutta businessman who had hatched the plot along with Gabbar, fled from the Alipore court premises in September 2002. He remains untraced.																								Acting according to their plan, Rathore and Gabbar had invited Bunty to a Tangra restaurant on May 22, 2001. Trisha, who was having an affair with Rathore and was finding it difficult to refuse Bunty, who had also confessed his love for her, was present on the spot.																								Police investigations later revealed that Rathore had asked Gabbar to join them in a Maruti van from Tangra. After driving for some time, he asked Gabbar to carry out the job. 																								While Rathore, Trisha and Fatman held Bunty, Gabbar pulled out his revolver and shot him. The body was dumped on the EM Bypass near Tiljala, said Subir Chatterjee, officer-in-charge of Tiljala police station.																								Gabbar and his aides were whisked into the Alipore courtroom from a police van amid tight security at around 12.30 pm on Thursday.																								A company of commandos kept at bay the hordes of onlookers who had gathered on the court premises for a glimpse of Gabbar, accused in 21 murder cases.																								Wearing a light yellow T-shirt and blue jeans, the crimelord stared blankly, as additional and sessions judge S. Chattopadhyay read out the case history charges against him.																								The court found Gabbar guilty of murder and kidnapping with the intention of murder, while Trisha and Fatman were charged with kidnapping for murder and concealing evidence. The other accused, Shabnam, was found guilty of concealing evidence. 																								Investigating officer Joydeep Banerjee said 22 witnesses had been cross-examined in the case.

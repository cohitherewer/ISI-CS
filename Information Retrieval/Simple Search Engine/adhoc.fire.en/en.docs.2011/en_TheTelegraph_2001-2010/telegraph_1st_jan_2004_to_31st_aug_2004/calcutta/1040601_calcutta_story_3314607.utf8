 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Lawyers return on leave nod 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The seven-day-long ceasework by lawyers in two courts  Alipore and City Civil and Sessions  was called off on Monday.																								The lawyers had stayed away to demand, among other things, a summer vacation in the courts. The decision to call off the agitation followed an assurance from the high court authorities that all subordinate courts across the state will be allowed a 15-day summer recess from next year.																								The high court administration, however, made it clear that the lower courts would have to remain open at least 232 days in a year, as directed by the Supreme Court. 																								The lower courts would have to curtail other holidays to enjoy the summer vacation.																								Amiya Kumar Chatterjee, chairman of the West Bengal Bar Council, said on Monday: It is unfortunate that owing to the high court authorities procrastination, litigants had to suffer. The summer vacation in the lower courts should be allowed from the current year. I made repeated appeals to Chief Justice A.K. Mathur in this regard. 																								Dibyendu Biswas, a member of the executive committee of West Bengal Bar Council (representing Alipore court) said: While the administrative committee of the high court judges has assured the Bar Council that a fortnight-long summer vacation will be allowed in the subordinate courts, the state judicial department has assured us that it will provide the minimum amenities in the court buildings with immediate effect.

 Sunday, May 30, 2004 Right there for Raasta Angels
pet passion Nelanjana BhowmickIf you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the principal difference between a dog and a man  Mark Twain. Yesterday, I went back to where my heart is. On the streets, in the slums of Mumbai, to my Raasta Angels. You call them street dogs, strays, pariahsNot so long ago (four years) animal welfare, ABC programmes, first-aid, rescue remedy were not words in my dictionary. Today, these are my magic mantra. Technically, Peeli is the first dog I cured, and Shera is the reason Im here, working for their cause.The beginning: I was on my way back from college, when I saw Peeli, sleeping under an autorickshaw. I spotted a small, watery wound with a peculiar stale smell, on her outer thigh. I put some savlon and nebasulf powder on her wound. Days later, I was met by an ecstatic Peeli, wagging her tail incessantly.Word spread. A couple of weeks later, a 10-year-old boy was at our door asking for help with his dog Shera. Chandana and I, armed with biscuits, medicines and a torch went into the slums, looking for Shera, who was suffering from a crater-like wound with a peculiar stale smell, infested with maggots. With a volunteer from the WSD (Welfare For Stray Dogs) showing us how, we nursed the wound. We have never looked back since!Tip: Before you begin any voluntary work for stray animals, get your Anti-Rabies Vaccine.

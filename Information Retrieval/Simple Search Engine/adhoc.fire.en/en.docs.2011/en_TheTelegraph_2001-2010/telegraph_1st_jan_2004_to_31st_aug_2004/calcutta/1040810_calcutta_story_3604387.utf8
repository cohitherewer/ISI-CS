 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Salt Lake bus bar violated
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Violating a police directive, school buses entered the blocks of Salt Lake on Monday, residents of the township alleged, to collect and drop back children as they used to before.																								In the morning, several small and medium-sized buses entered our blocks and there was no policeman in sight, said Bidyut Kumar Paul, general secretary of the Salt Lake BF Block Residents Association. Members of the AE Block Samaj Kalyan Sangha, too, made similar complaints. 																								Last week police asked school bus operators to pick up children from points on main roads and not to enter the blocks to avoid accidents.																								Today we caught several school buses which entered the blocks. But we let them off with a warning as this was the first day, said Humayun Kabir, sub-divisional police officer, Salt Lake. Officials said many bus drivers claimed they were not aware of the directive and so no one was prosecuted.																								In a meeting between block associations and police about a fortnight ago, residents complained about school buses entering the blocks. Senior police officers said it was difficult to implement the directives as residents were divided over the issue.

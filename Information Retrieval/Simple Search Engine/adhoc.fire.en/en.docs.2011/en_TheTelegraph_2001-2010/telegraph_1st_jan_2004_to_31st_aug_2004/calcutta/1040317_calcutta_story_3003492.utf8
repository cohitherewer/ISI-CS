 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Cop copyright cell revived to fight piracy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With complaints pouring in from manufacturing units and information technology (IT) firms, the police have set up a wing to combat piracy.																								According to Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), the special wing should start functioning within a couple of weeks. 																								Frankly, such crimes had not been our priority. We concentrated on dacoities and murders and were not really aware of how to go about implementing the laws associated with intellectual property rights (IPR). Our officers need to be trained and educated on the basics of these laws, to ensure conviction of the culprits, Mitra added. 																								However, raids in recent months have yielded a large number of music and film compact discs (CDs), which proved that the earlier methods had become obsolete. Now, any person equipped with a CD-writer can copy music and films with the aid of a personal computer, and sell the pirated versions at far-below-par rates. This creates quite a dent in the purses of the production companies and government tax departments.																								At a workshop organised jointly by the detective department and Manufacturers Association of IT (MAIT) companies, the detective chief observed that the existing laws for trademarks, copyrights, counterfeiting and piracy should also figure as a priority on the agenda. 																								Mitra plans to revive a defunct cell  the press cell, which since the Raj dealt with copyright laws  to counter the threat of illegally duplicated intellectual property. We will upgrade the facilities to match present-day demands, he added.																								Officers of the sub-inspector level will qualify for the training programmes. With the help of organisations like MAIT, the officers will be given an orientation on the new developments and amendments of laws. Sub-inspectors of the detective department, as well as from the police stations, will be told how to implement them, Mitra added.																								A key part of the workshop dealt with defining the various IPR crimes. Ideas, designs or inventions that are illegally copied and circulated for commercial gain by any individual is counterfeiting, explained Vinnie Mehta, MAIT executive director.																								Counterfeit rackets also serve as fund-raisers for terrorist outfits, and findings by international agencies point out that militants in Asia generate capital by circulating fake money and pirated products. 																								We have been told by the central investigating agencies that the eastern region has become a major hub for counterfeit products churned out by extremist forces. This is why we have revived the cell. It also explains our involving police station-level officers in the drive, said a detective department source.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 29, 2004  Calcutta Column
Many footpaths have been dug up by various agencies like the Corporation, electricity board and Calcutta Telephones for repair work. Puddles form on these footpaths after every light shower. While the muddy water leaves ugly stains on the clothes of pedestrians, elderly persons and children stand the risk of falling while negotiating these puddles. It is surprising that the civic body has left the footpaths in such a deplorable condition despite monsoon approaching.Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row 
	The traffic police and the transport department have earmarked some new bus stops on AJC Bose Road. Two of them are near La Martiniere school and JD Birla college. But buses drivers are yet to be notified about them through bus associations. Many passengers wait at the stops but the buses, including state buses, do not stop despite sign boards prominently displaying that these are bus stops.

 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Property tax thrust in Salt Lake budget
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bidhannagar Municipality is planning a major tax-collection drive this fiscal and contemplating action against government and private organisations that have been evading property tax.																								In its proposed annual budget for 2004-05, tabled before the civic board on Monday, the municipality has proposed an estimated earning of Rs 9.8 crore from property taxes, against last years estimate of Rs 6.72 crore. 																								The civic body also laid out plans for a three-fold increase in income from trade licence fees, thanks to City Centre and other commercial organisations. Last years proposed earning from trade licences was Rs 5 lakh.																								We will implement a Geographical Information System for increasing earnings from property tax. Implementing revised rates of taxes proposed by the Central Valuation Board is also under discussion, said Dilip Gupta, municipality chairman. 																								Properties not properly evaluated earlier will have to pay revised rates. Legal action will be taken for realising the tax, Gupta said. These measures could rake in an additional Rs 4 crore.																								Officials said several central government housing estates and offices would be brought under tax net. There are several new commercial and industrial units that have come up. These will also be brought under the tax net, the municipality chairman said. 																								Last years actual earning from property taxes was Rs 5.8 crore. Taking into account the arrear earnings of Rs 1 crore, this years estimated earnings would go up to Rs 10.8 crore.																								Gupta said the municipality would use its infrastructure for collecting property taxes. 																								For earnings from trade licence fees, municipality officials said the setting up of City Centre was a major boost. According to the decision taken by the previous board, the changing of names of some shops in old markets is underway. There has been a great response from the shop-owners. Once it is fully implemented, we can increase our trade licence fees, an official said.																								The municipality has also stressed on repairing roads. For repairs within blocks, the authorities have proposed to spend Rs 1.2 crore, while Rs 2.88 crore will be spent for maintaining the main roads. There will be a detailed plan for maintenance of parks and green verges, a municipality official said.

 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Poll brake on college autonomy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Some of the citys prestigious undergraduate colleges, including Presidency, St Xaviers and Asutosh, making a beeline for autonomy status, may have a longer wait ahead. 																								With the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has temporarily shelved the issue. This delay is coming in the way of the University Grants Commission (UGC) awarding autonomy status to the colleges. The state government has the final say on the autonomy status. The delay will deprive the deserving colleges of a grant of Rs 1.76 crore which the UGC has planned to sanction to each of the autonomous colleges across the country, UGC vice-chairman V.N. Rajasekharan Pillai said on Friday.																								On a days visit to the city to participate in the convocation of the Netaji Subhas Open University, Pillai said that the state government as well as Calcutta University had informed the UGC on February 26 that it would finalise its decision on the autonomy issue if the UGC accepted its demand to modify some of the guidelines concerning administrative and academic control of autonomous colleges. The UGCs policies are flexible and immediately after the February 26 meeting in Delhi we wrote to the state government asking it to send its modification proposals. But surprisingly we have not heard from the government as yet, he maintained.																								The UGC had set a deadline of February 26 for all the states to give their final opinions on the autonomy issue. A meeting was called, at which representatives of Calcutta University  to which most of the undergraduate colleges in question are affiliated to  refused to submit their opinion on the plea of there being certain flaws in UGCs guidelines.																								Officials in the state higher education department admitted that they had received a letter from the UGC. As the Lok Sabha polls are approaching, the state government cannot take any fresh decision, they said.																								Suranjan Das, pro-vice chancellor Calcutta University, said he was aware of the UGCs nod for the modifications. The syndicate body of the university will meet after the polls to identify the guidelines which the university seeks to modify, he added.

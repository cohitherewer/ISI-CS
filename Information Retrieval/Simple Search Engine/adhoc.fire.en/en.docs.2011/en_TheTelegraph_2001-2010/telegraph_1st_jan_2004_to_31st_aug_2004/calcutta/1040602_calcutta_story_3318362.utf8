 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Can Love defy Death?
																								Ever since his inception into the world, man has been embroiled in a war against death. He has learnt to struggle to keep the candle of his race burning, but if there remains one insurmountable constant factor that disrupts his complacence, it is death. Soumitra Chattopadhyays Pran Tapasya traces one mans deliberate attempt at disregarding the very existence of death. Alokendu believes in love, he believes in the redemptive powers of love, he forces himself to believe that love can defeat death. In the face of one of the most trying circumstances of his life, with his wife battling death in spite of its overbearing imminence, Alokendu turns to love as the saving grace. He is aware of its limitations, yet he has the ability to feel the warmth of its radiance. His love for his wife gives him the courage to face life as a warrior who refuses to concede humbly to the inevitability of death. It is through his psychological annihilation of death that Alokendu finds the strength to stand by his dying wife.

																								Art is one of the most effective vehicles for the expression of ones emotions and perceptions. It may be subjective or objective in its presentation, but either way it is a manifestation of the artists vision and allows for a wider understanding of his feelings. And when an artist finds the opportunity to bring his aesthetic sensibilities before a discerning public, it is perhaps the ideal rendezvous for the exchange of ideas. Painters 04 is an exhibition that showcases the artistic brilliance of some young artists, Anindya, Atin, Kallol (whose Human Being appears alongside), Madhurima, Moutushi, Paramita, Ranjit and Struti, who have experimented with themes that cover a wide range of abstractions. The ongoing exhibition hails the exemplary talents of these young painters while welcoming them into the wider fraternity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Parliament passport satisfies new face
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Once vanquished, twice victor. Md Salim, in his second attempt from Calcutta Northeast, unsettled and then unseated Ajit Panja, the reigning champion in the constituency since 1984.																								It was a victory of sorts last time as well, since we narrowed the margin to just 41,000. This time, we were confident of winning from the very beginning, and so, the result is satisfying, said the 46-year-old MLA from Entally, minutes after getting his passport to Parliament.																								Taking on the barrister-cum-politician-cum-actors experience of 14 elections, and brushing off the star presence of back-from-Bollywood Moushumi Chatterjee, had kept the CPM camp on tenterhooks throughout the poll process. By Thursday evening, though, it was time for the winner to take it all.																								The victory margin of 80,000-plus was reason enough for the technical education minister to hop into an open jeep and embark on a victory lap, greeting supporters with a wave or a V.																								One step behind the new face of Northeast, a smile of pride in place, was didi Meera Bhattacharjee, wife of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								She had been with Salim bhai throughout his campaign trail and it was only right that she be by his side in his moment of victory.																								In a vibrant red-bordered cotton sari, flanked by Titu and Tipu, the teenaged sons of the suave Salim, Meera Bhattacharjee smiled: The event calls for a celebration and why shouldnt we celebrate? He is like my younger brother. I am very happy for him.																								Salim, in poll-trademark white kurta-pyjama, was inside the counting hall, keeping a close watch on the numbers game in Beleghata and Burtolla. 																								Outside, his sons were chatting away with the chief ministers wife, juggling cellphones and giving real-time result updates to all those calling up their father.																								Ekhon 22,000 lead achhey, kintu finally 70 hajar theke ek lakh-er moddhe hobe (The lead is 22,000 now, but it will go up to somewhere between 70,000 and a lakh), Titu, a student of Patha Bhavan, whispered into the cellphone. 																								But the lead of 22,000 was enough to turn on the celebration switch.																								Ajit Panja has done nothing for us and we all like him (Salim), said Laltu Bhattacharjee, a resident of Beleghata, while waiting outside the amphitheatre. Soon, Tamal Bose and Sibnath De joined him and started shouting: Md Salim zindabad..																								Serious business awaits Salim after the celebrations. 																								The mandate against the NDA is visible everywhere and the people of West Bengal, too, have given their verdict against the BJP-led combine. We will have to wait and watch before getting a clear picture of Delhi, but we are sure that we will have to deliver, he signed off.

 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Boy gang chief held for temple theft
 A STAFF REPORTER																								If the crime graph is rising, the age bar is dropping.																								In a chilling proof of the youth affairs in Calcuttas crime syndicate, police on Wednesday picked up the 14-year-old mastermind of the Maniktala Parashwanath temple theft.																								Nearly two months after the temple theft, Rana Hazra was arrested from his shanty in the Maniktala slums lining the canal.																								But there was no trace of the stolen goods  a gold chain with pendant of the main deity and Rs 5,000 in cash.																								According to deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra, Hazra, a petty thief, and his four mates had stumbled upon the opportunity to raid the not-so-well-guarded temple.																								They were out on the night of April 4 to loot the nearby Loknathbaba temple. But as they approached it, pavement-dwellers near the temple sounded the alarm and chased them away, said Mitra.																								On the run, with the men close on their heels, the teenaged burglars found themselves a convenient hideout beyond the high boundary walls of the Parashwanath temple when they discovered a ladder  left by some CESC repairmen  resting against the wall.																								They climbed the ladder, scaled the wall and crossed onto the temple premises to ward off their pursuers.																								Once inside, Hazra hit upon an idea  why not pull off a far more difficult rob job, in the temple which had heavy doors securing the main enclosure?																								According to the detective chief, the teenaged boys then started kicking a portion of the huge sandalwood door that already had a crack. Repeated kicks on the door created an opening for the boy gang to pass through.																								They were confronted with another door (the inner door), that was secured with a padlock fastened around two iron rings.																								But the boys took advantage of a small gap in the inner door. One of them slipped his hand through it, unscrewed the bolt holding one of the rings in place, slipped the ring out of the door and opened it.																								According to police, during daylong interrogation, Hazra confessed to his crime and reconstructed the incident in front of the cops and members of the temple committee.																								The boy will be produced in court on Thursday. We have not been able to recover the pendant and the gold chain yet. He told us that he had sold it off to a jeweller in Howrah. We are looking for the man and hope to recover the items soon, said Mitra.																								The boys arrest and the information provided by police have, however, raised a few unanswered questions: Police had said they had found the inner door secured and locked. This implies that the thieves had screwed back the iron ring and fastened the door on their way out. Why would they take the trouble? Police said an iron grille beyond the inner door was locked. How did the boys then get to the idols? What about the fingerprints that revealed the handiwork of a man, not a boy?

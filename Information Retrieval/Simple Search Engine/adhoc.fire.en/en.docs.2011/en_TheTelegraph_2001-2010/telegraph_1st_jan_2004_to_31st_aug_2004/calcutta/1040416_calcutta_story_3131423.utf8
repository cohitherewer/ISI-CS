 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Nobel-stung cops to cover more than museums
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 A gallery at Indian Museum: Prized possessions																								A Nobel is gone but a lot else remains to be guarded. 																								On Thursday, a high-level meeting was held at the Calcutta Police special branch office to assess the security provisions at key installations. Representatives from Victoria Memorial and Indian Museum as well as CESC, Calcutta Telephones, Reserve Bank of India and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited thrashed out areas of concern in a two-hour brain-storming session. 																								Sources said a list of initiatives was drawn up. A dog squad dedicated to the security of these installations was proposed as was intensive training of the guards manning them. The security equipment at these sites, it was decided, would be checked by experts from Lalbazar. Plainclothesmen from the special branch would help monitor security on a day-to-day basis. The police and the authorities of these organisations will be working in close liaison henceforth, the source added.																								Earlier, on April 6, the special branch had asked the museums and galleries to submit their building plans showing all the staircases, gates and the location of fire-fighting apparatus.																								If the state government is pulling up its socks, the Centre has been no less active. A meeting was convened by the secretary of the Union ministry of culture Dhanendra Kumar in Shastri Bhavan on April 8. The meeting was attended by officials from the home ministry and the Central Industrial Security Force as well as the heads of the government-run museums, including National Museum, Victoria Memorial, Salarjung Museum and the National Galleries of Modern Art. Our aim was to tighten the security in all our museums in view of what happened at Santiniketan. Since the Nobel theft took place at a privately-run place, we could not do anything about it, but we should ensure that the government-run museums are safe. After all, they are housing the countrys most treasured possessions, said Kumar over telephone from Delhi.																								At the meeting, the museum directors were asked to review their security arrangements and inform the ministry about their requirements. It is upto the individual museum managements to look after their possessions. If they need our assistance, we are ready to help out, Kumar said.																								The Centres initiative has made the museums happy, especially since it brings hope of a rethink on security staff strength. Indian Museum, for instance, has been working with 55 personnel against a sanctioned strength of 72. The Centres optimisation policy, requiring establishments to reduce workforce, is taking its toll on the museums. Sometimes we even have to keep galleries closed due to lack of an adequate number of guards, rued director-in-charge Saktikali Basu.																								The museums are also taking initiative to exchange notes and pool their resources. While the National Museum in Delhi has called a meeting on April 29, the Indian Museum wants to gather all its counterparts in the eastern region on the talks table in early May.

 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 CM trio amp; a vision of homes for all 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Vision India 2020: Housing for All  a brainstorming session involving the chief ministers of Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand, will seek to address issues standing in the way of affordable shelter for all by 2020, and look at feasible solutions.																								Organised by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai)  Bengal (formerly City Developers Forum), the January 21 city conference will be attended by Union minister of state for urban development and poverty alleviation Bandaru Dattatreya and urban development ministers of the three eastern states.																								It has been proven time and again that our people are our greatest strength. The economic resurgence of the country, led by IT and ITES exports, only drives home this point. But, if we aspire to become a developed nation by 2020, we must start by providing every family with a decent home, observes Pradip Chopra, honorary secretary, Credai-Bengal.																								The major roadblocks to the goal of housing for all by 2020, as identified by Credai-Bengal, are antiquated legislation, like the Urban Land Ceiling Act and Rent Control Act, besides the high incidence of municipal taxes, stamp duties and sanction fees, red-tapism, inspection raj. These crippling impediments have led to piecemeal development and slums have sprouted all over, creating sub-human living conditions, Chopra laments.																								The developers forum feels supply of houses can be enhanced by repealing outdated Acts, releasing land locked in factories, state litigation, acquisition proceedings, Wakf Act, Thika Tenancy Act, etc, and by enlarging the scope for tax benefits.																								To reach the housing for all goal, the country needs 100 million houses by 2020, which means 6.5 million houses must be constructed from now on, every year till 2020. Just imagine the economic spin-offs to accrue if it can be achieved, exults Credai vice-president Santosh Rungta.																								Speakers like Sanjay Kumar, municipal commissioner, Pune, N. Hiranandani. managing director, Hiranandani Construction of Mumbai and V. Ravi Chander, member, Bangalore, Agenda Task Force, have also been invited. 																								We hope by sharing their experiences, they can engage authorities and local stakeholders in fruitful interaction, says Credai-Bengal president Jugal Khetawat.

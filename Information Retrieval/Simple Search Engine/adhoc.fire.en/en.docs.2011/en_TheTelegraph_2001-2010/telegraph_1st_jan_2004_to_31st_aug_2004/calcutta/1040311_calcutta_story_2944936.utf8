 																											- Second unit, pharmacy chain to tap regions rising patient count SANJAY MANDAL																								Apollo Gleneagles, a major investor in the citys health infrastructure, is ready to set up its second unit in the state. This, hospital officials said, is part of the expansion programme in the eastern region. The group is also coming up with franchisee clinics at Howrah, Salt Lake and Behala, apart from a series of pharmacy outlets in the city.																								We have definite plans to build another hospital in West Bengal, Shobhana Reddy, one of the directors of the Apollo Hospitals group, told Metro over telephone from Hyderabad. 																								Talks are on the cards with the state government regarding land and other infrastructure. 																								State health officials admitted that talks were on with the Apollo group over land. We plan to provide them with land at the proposed health city near Rajarhat, where we are inviting hospitals to set up units, said Chittaranjan Maity, director of medical education.																								The group runs a unit on an 8.5-acre plot on the EM Bypass, which includes a 325-bed hospital and an administrative block.																								According to Apollo officials, preliminary talks were held with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during his recent visit to Hyderabad. With the flow of patients from the Northeast and other parts of the region on the rise, Apollo has decided to concentrate on Bengal as the hub.																								This is a part of the network we plan to build up in eastern India, director Reddy said. This region is presently our priority area. We are very enthusiastic about the response from the Bengal government and things are looking positive, she added.																								The plans for the new hospital may well be on the drawing board, but the hospital is setting up an oncology clinic on its Bypass campus. Construction will start in a month. We are waiting for the Calcutta Municipal Corporations clearance, said V. Satyanarayana Reddy, chief executive officer (CEO), Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Calcutta.																								The 50-bed clinic, CEO Reddy said, will have a state-of-the-art bone-marrow transplant unit, linear accelerator (radiotherapy unit) and other facilities. There arent very many oncology facilities in the private sector in the eastern region, he pointed out.																								A chain of pharmacies  at least 20 across Calcutta  and three clinics are in the pipeline, officials said. One clinic in Howrah is expected next month and the other two will be operative soon, they added.

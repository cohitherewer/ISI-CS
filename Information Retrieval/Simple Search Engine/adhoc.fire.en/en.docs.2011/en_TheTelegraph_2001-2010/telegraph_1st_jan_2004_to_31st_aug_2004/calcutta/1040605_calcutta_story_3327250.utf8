Some of the Bengali plays of the previous generation have been so popular and well received by theatre lovers, that they continue to be presented for the viewing pleasure of the audience even today. One such play is Badal Sarkars Sara Rattir, which deals with the the dynamics of human relationships and the foundation on which such relationships rest. The maiden production of Titash, the play provides a fresh perspective on various common yet critical social and moral issues. Essentially a play of ideas, it questions and turns on its head the values and beliefs on which middle-class life is based. The play begins at a point when a couple, who have lost their way on a stormy night, take shelter in an abandoned building. Here, they meet an old, wizened man, who helps them uncover the hidden traits of their personalities and, in the process, discover their true selves. Interesting dichotomies between peace and happiness, dreams and reality, love and constancy, lift the play to a philosophical plane that is far removed from lifes banalities and trivialities.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Sara Rattir, produced by Titash																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Mukta Angan

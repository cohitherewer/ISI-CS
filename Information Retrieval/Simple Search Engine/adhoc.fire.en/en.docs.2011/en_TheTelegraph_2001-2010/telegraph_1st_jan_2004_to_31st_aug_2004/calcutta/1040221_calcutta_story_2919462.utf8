The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Bishop rap met with Delhi durbar cry
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A day after the Calcutta Diocese witnessed an unprecedented demonstration by some members of Church of North India (CNI) against Bishop P.S.P. Raju, threats of disciplinary action were met with counter-threats to take the dispute to Delhi.																								Bishop Raju, facing allegations of financial irregularities, warned the agitators that they were crossing their limit. Stern action might be taken  with cancellation of membership not ruled out  if they continued to tarnish the image of the church by levelling baseless allegations against him.																								I am still looking at things from a pastors point of view, he said on Friday morning. But stern action may have to be taken if some people go on disturbing the church, he added, alleging that Thursdays agitation was pre-planned and masterminded by a group of disgruntled people in the community, whose wishes were not fulfilled.																								The movement would go on until their principal demand  the Bishops resignation  was met, announced the agitators. 																								There is no going back, said Sailesh Mukhopadhay, secretary of the Calcutta Diocese. We want our church to be free of corruption.																								Hundreds of Christian men and women  all of them members of the 29 churches within CNI jurisdiction in the city  demonstrated in front of Bishop House at 51, Chowringhee Road, on Thursday, marking a first in the citys Christian calendar.																								The protestors have threatened to take their grievances to Delhi. They will meet senior CNI officials in the Capital and give them documentary evidence of the charges they have levelled against Bishop Raju, they said.																								The Bishop denied every allegation against his family, associates and himself. All the allegations are false and without the support of any cogent reason and document, he maintained.																								One of the main allegations brought against the Bishop is his attempt to hand over a large portion of Bishop House (designated a heritage structure) to a hurriedly-chosen realtor.																								The deal was allegedly struck in September 2003 without seeking the approval of the executive committee of the CNI and the Indian Church Trust (ICT), the apex body dealing with property-related matters. 																								The Bishop, however, insisted on Friday that the executive committee had been kept posted.																								Mukhopadhay said it was way back in 1999 that developing a portion of Bishop House was discussed at a meeting of the executive committee. The matter was never discussed after that, he added.																								Another allegation  that the Bishop had established firm control over the admission procedure of prominent Anglo-Indian schools within CNI jurisdiction by appointing people of his choice in the admission committees  was also countered by him. 																								Some of them (the agitators) wanted to join the board of governors of big schools and turned against me as I did not oblige them, he said.

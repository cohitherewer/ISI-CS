 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Cars granted fine breather
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The owners of four-wheelers won a breather till January 31 to pay their tax dues, minus the penalty, following a high court directive on Thursday.																								A group of car-owners had moved a fresh petition, seeking an order directing the government to withdraw its notification demanding that five years road tax be paid at one go.																								Although Justice Pradipta Kumar Roy of Calcutta High Court dismissed the petition, he said that four-wheeler owners would not have to cough up a fine as long as they paid their tax dues by the end of this month. 																								The matter will next come up for hearing in a division bench.																								State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had earlier extended the deadline for payment of taxes by four-wheeler owners till January 31, but added that they must pay a late fine as well.																								Counsel appearing on behalf of the state told the court that the government had to impose the new tax in order to increase revenue and use it to improve infrastructure.																								Justice Roy is the fourth judge of the single bench of the high court to hear similar petitions by different petitioners and pass varying orders.																								While Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharjee is hearing a similar petition and has adjourned it for the final hearing, Justice Roy of the same court, in his Thursday order, upheld the right of the government to impose new taxes.																								Similar confusion clouds the 15-year tax on two-wheelers. 																								When Justice Bhattacharjee admitted a petition filed by the owners of two-wheelers, challenging the notification for payment of lifetime tax, and passed an interim order, another bench of Justice Pratap Kumar Roy of the same court stayed the government notification and termed the tax unconstitutional.																								The appeal filed on Wednesday by the state government in the high court division bench on Wednesday against the orders passed by the trial courts is likely to be heard next week.																								In its petition, the state government had mentioned that orders from different courts had created confusion among vehicle-owners. 																								The government also argued that the court had no jurisdiction to intervene in administrative decisions of the state.

 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Fingerprint tests on computer log-in
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Wiser after the contradictory report of the fingerprint test conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) during the inquiry into the Nobel prize burglary, the state police will upgrade the test process and introduce, for the first time in the state, a computerised fingerprint test system.																								The process has already started. We are now looking for suitable software, said a senior police officer. 																								A number of foreign companies manufacture fingerprint software. Besides, experts in our country, too, have started producing such software. We are talking to both Indian and foreign companies before buying the item, he confirmed.																								The state police had to face an embarrassing situation during the Nobel probe. The CIDs test report had confirmed that the fingerprint of a suspect (Pradip Barui) matched with the samples collected from the Rabindra Bhavan museum. 																								But when the CBI conducted the test with the help of hi-tech gadgets, it was found that there was no similarity between Baruis fingerprints and the samples collected from the place of theft.																								We dont know how they matched the prints. Our test process is considered the best in India. Experts have conducted the test with the help of laptops and others equipment, said Vivek Gupta, joint director, CBI, during his stay in Santiniketan.																								Fingerprints are manually tested at the State Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Experts come to a conclusion on the basis of observing prints with a magnifying glass, said a police officer.																								The process of fingerprint test is lengthy. We collect two samples of each finger of a suspect. So, we examine at least 20 samples, said a fingerprint expert. We take two days to test three suspects, he added.																								On the other hand, when computers are used for the same test, it takes a few minutes. Out of thousands of samples, the computer will suggest within a few seconds to the experts which one is close to their sample. It makes the rest of the work easy, explained a CBI official.																								Now, fingerprint tests are conducted only in the city. Police or other law-enforcement agencies have to come here from distant places if they want to get a fingerprint report.																								After computerisation, the process will be faster. If they scan the sample and send it to us via e-mail, we will let them know the report within minutes, said an expert. 																								Senior officers at the state-run laboratory agreed that after computerisation, the chance of error will be narrowed.

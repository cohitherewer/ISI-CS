 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Dry run rerun plagues Howrah
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Pockets of Howrah town are in the grip of a water scarcity for the second time in the past month. The situation has come to such a pass that residents are having to buy water from areas where the supply is normal.																								Atindra Mukherjee Lane, Ramkrishnapur Lane, Umacharan Bose Lane, Baishnabpara Lane and Nilratan Mukherjee Lane, in wards 26, 30 and 32, are the worst hit.																								Residents said seven wards had to go without water a few weeks ago. Supply improved after the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) officials intervened. But things are back to square one. 																								We have asked the mayor several times to take steps so that the problem could be resolved at least during summer, but nothing has been done, complained Buddhadeb Sarkar, councillor of ward 30.																								The taps went dry 15 days ago. Again, for the past four days, there has been no supply at all. This scarcity is chronic every summer, lamented Prafulla Mukherjee, resident of ward 30.																								According to HMC officials, supply was stopped to a few areas as a leak had developed in the main supply line in ward 41. 																								The supply will stabilise after repairs. The demand for water rises during summer, so scarcity ensues. Water consumption declines comparatively during the monsoon and winter, explained an HMC official. The corporations water supply capacity is limited and residents should be aware of this, he said.																								This is an old story and yet the problem persists. But this time, we are not going to spare the officials, said Mintu Khara, another councillor. 																								In a deputation to the mayor, the leader of the Opposition and other Congress councillors said water scarcity is on the rise and it would take some time to bring the situation under control.																								We have tried to draw the mayors attention. The civic body should take steps on a war footing to improve the water supply system. If the authorities do not take any initiative, we will start an agitation, said Seema Naskar, Congress councillor and leader of the Opposition in the HMC.																								Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said this happens every summer as the ground water level decreases. Monsoon will bring relief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Property tax assessors wings clipped
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After announcing a bonanza for Calcutta two days ago, mayor Subrata Mukherjee made a move to introduce an area-specific reasonable rent structure to determine property tax for hitherto-unassessed, as well as newly and to-be-constructed, buildings. 																								My intention is to take the fixing of property tax rates out of the tax inspectors hands, explained mayor Mukherjee on Friday. To achieve it, I must start at the beginning, which is freezing the basis, namely the reasonable rent. 																								The reasonable rent is notional, taken into account to fix the annual valuation of a building and determine the tax on it.																								Civic officials, according to Mukherjee, will codify the reasonable rent from 70 paise a square foot (in places like Behala, Jadavpur and the eastern fringes of the city) to Rs 5 a square foot (for areas like Park Street). For commercial buildings, the same will be pegged between Rs 7 and Rs 15 a sq ft.																								When introduced, it will immediately save the owner of over 200,000 unassessed buildings in Behala, Garden Reach, Jadavpur and on the eastern fringes from extortion by assessment inspectors, the mayor said. 																								All assessment inspectors were directed to follow the guideline in fixing civic property tax on a newly-constructed building or an unassessed building.																								 There are over 600,000 buildings in the city and the number of unassessed buildings will be close to 200,000, elaborated officer on special duty to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh. 																								According to the CMC Act of 1980, the annual property tax of a building is to be worked out as a percentage of its annual valuation. Annual valuation, in turn, is to be calculated on the basis of reasonable rent of that building. 																								In the absence of a specific rent chart, assessment inspectors would fix it arbitrarily. 																								The lower the annual value of a house, the lesser the amount of tax that a house-owner had to pay. So, it became almost mandatory for house-owners to bribe assessment inspectors to undervalue their property.																								As a result, there are only 800 high-value houses in the city, or those houses whose value has been pegged at above Rs 5 lakh at the current market rates, said the mayor. 																								It was difficult determining the monthly reasonable rent per square foot for buildings in different zones of the city owing to the failure of the rent control department of the state government to supply a rent structure for different areas of the city.																								According to the critics of Mukherjees move, the means of access to all houses are not equally wide. In the zonation system, the rent per square foot has been fixed on the basis of the widest road in that zone, though all the buildings in that zone are not on the same road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004 Life - Style Check Fashion fiesta with fling flair															When you have fashion and you have fizz, all you need is to have a Fling. Celebrating its latest concoction, Seagrams set the mood for a fun-filled evening as city models strutted their stuff in flirty crepes and chiffons stitched together by the design brigade to save a sultry Saturday on the RCGC lawns. We were there, up front, at the Blenders Pride party. City models showcase the efforts of the designer brigade at the Blenders Pride party at Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Saturday 															Wide awake																					Supported by Sleep-in, the evening got off to a wispy start as sexy lingerie ruled the ramp. Camisoles, two-pieces and spaghettis in linen and satins were more a wake-up call as both men and women got quite an eyeful of toned male and female bodies sporting the nightwear to best effect. 																																													Kantha callThe elegance of daywear though comes out best in Indian drapes. Its another matter that kantha queen Shamlu Dudeja is into experimenting big time with the poor mans quilt to lend everything from bridal trousseaus to casual wear a touch of class. Leading the clarion call to buy kantha for it helps empower women in rural Bengal, Shamlu presented lehngas and wraparounds in kantha combined with a lot of shimmer apart from the ubiquitous sari and churidar kurta. What really stood out though was the kantha sherwani, just right for a summer wedding.Street smart																					If fusion is in, Indo-western cant be far behind. The high on wearability and low on creative aberration genre finds many takers and Abhishek Dutta has been smart enough to realise it. Trying to infuse an element of novelty in the obvious choices, however, Abhishek professed to be inspired by jatra (Bengali street play) for his collection.																					Hand-woven fabrics were about the only connection one could find with his muse. Denim and leather were other choices,																					though the use of leather seemed a little misplaced for the season. 																					The use of kalamkari and crochet clinched the Indo-western issue.																																													Attitude oodle																					Yet another one to bite the Indo-western dust was the fresh face in the fraternity, Pritam Panda. He hoped to differ with the declaration of Indian wear with loads of western attitude, where lehngas teamed with Victorian corsets was as creative as Pritam could get. 																					Even though he persists with my clothes are all about attitude, the wispy fabrics of crepe, georgettes, silks and tussars do little justice to the aggressive punchline. Probably cholis teamed with flared trousers was his idea of it all. 																					Kantha mixed with zardozi and the use of bright shades like fuchsias, oranges and yellows marked his otherwise tame collection.																																													Cocktail circuit																					When it comes to dining out, Shantanu Goenkas Wine collection can raise a toast. 																					Whereas saris with sexy cholis looked better on the ramp, light jacket and trouser sets looked more believable.																					The use of sheer crepes was well thought out as well. Thread work juxtaposed with Swarovski crystals helped embellish the ensembles with understated elegance.												Razzle-dazzle																					Varda Goenka harps on the wearability factor of her jewellery but maintains that diamonds are a girls best friend. The jewellery designer was the only one around to help with accessories. But the Duchess and the Parisian rounds seemed a tad off limits as far as all the contemporary chic goes. 																					Though good pieces of craftsmanship, her precious stones seemed to be better off on Dior Gold racks at Metro Plaza, from where she retails.																																													Crown clincher																					The crowd was rewarded for sitting through it all with an opportunity to shake a leg to thumping chart-toppers while downing flavoured bottles of Fling.																					The drink went to the head, and literally, as an impromptu beauty contest among the guests threw up a Fling queen, judged by the pretty models themselves.

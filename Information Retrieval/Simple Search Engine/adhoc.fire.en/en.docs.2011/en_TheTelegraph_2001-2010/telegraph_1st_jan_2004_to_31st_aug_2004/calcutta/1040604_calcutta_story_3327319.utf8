 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Girls outnumber boys at madarsas, which are now looking at an attitude shift to check the dropout rate. A Telegraph picture 																								An attitude change is what the West Bengal Board of Madarsa Education is calling for, and the introduction of co-curricular activities and community initiatives is the approach it is adopting to convince students to stay in school.																								A joint initiative with Prayasam, an NGO, will see 10 madarsas in and around the city and 10 mainstream schools put up skits on the importance of family savings for World Population Day. It will also start a long-term project to retain and increase students at 17 centres in North 24-Parganas.																								On Thursday, the representatives of 10 madarsas participating in the population awareness programme met at the Board office to discuss the details of the show with the NGO and officials. The students and faculty are to write the skits themselves, communicating their point through music. The children will enact them in the schools, as well as at an event at Sisir Mancha on July 9.																								The children have worked on polio vaccination drives before, which we have found to be very effective, says Board president Abdus Sattar. Parents may not listen to adults, but they are sure to listen to their kids. And as future parents, he adds, the message is also reaching the right minds.																								Savings was the theme chosen because it drives home the need for money to ensure children get their basic rights, and this is only possible if the families are smaller.																								But involvement in this kind of activity also achieves a broader objective. Engaging children meaningfully with creative pursuits or sports will help combat threats like drug abuse and other adolescent problems. 																								If they become passionate about music, theatre or sport, they are less likely to have time to fall prey to negative influences, says Sattar.																								Improving the quality of education is the main objective of the North 24-Parganas initiative. Even if students are enrolling, retention is a major problem, explains Amlan Ganguly of Prayasam. So, the first plan of action is training for teachers, as well as community mobilisation, to ensure parents and children understand the importance of being in school.																								Times have changed. Society will no longer accept whatever happens in school unquestioningly. Nowadays, you will have to address their needs and concerns, cautioned Sattar at the meet. He also advised the teachers to make themselves as accessible as possible to students, to be a friend rather than the stern authoritarian.																								More interactive teaching techniques, which are child-centred and gender sensitive, are key to the NGOs strategy. With girls outnumbering the boys in madarsas, and students coming in from all communities, all-round development is essential, agrees Sattar.																								But the communitys role is also a crucial one to keep children in school. We will act as a liaison between families and teachers, stresses Ganguly, for which neighbourhood groups and education committees will be formed locally.

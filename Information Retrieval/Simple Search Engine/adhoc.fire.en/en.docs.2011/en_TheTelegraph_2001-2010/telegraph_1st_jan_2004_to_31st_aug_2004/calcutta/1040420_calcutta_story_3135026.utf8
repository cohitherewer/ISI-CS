The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 Life - A Thought for FoodCatch it fresh every Friday 
 Selections from the seafood promotion at the Oberoi Grand. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								 There is a flood of the freshest seafood to be caught in the heart of the city. La Terrasse, the coffee shop of the Oberoi Grand, is serving up quite a feast every Friday.																								A huge fishermans net greets you at the menu stand set up at the entrance, and the colour blue rules inside. The waiters have abandoned their regular attire in favour of bright blue shirts and a display of blue lamps and lamp shades lend a cheery atmosphere. All this to set the tone for the seafood menu, replacing the regular a la carte fare once a week.																								We have sourced the best quality soft shell crabs from around the country. Salmon from Norway, scallops from Japan and baby octopus, mussels, clams from all over the world have found their way into our menu, explains executive chef George K. George.																								We decided to showcase seafood in its entirety. Which means that weve left no scope for compromise or substitution, he adds. A look at the elaborate spread is enough to reassure seafood fanatics that even those delicacies usually left off the Calcutta menu are not neglected here. Poached, steamed, stir-fried, grilled, baked, braised or stewed, however you treat it, it tastes heavenly.																								To begin with, there are soups like the Italian Minestroni and Thai Tom Yam Koong. On the cold buffet you can choose from sushi (like Steamed Seafood Nori Roll and a vegetarian option too, California Roll  cucumber marinated in wasabi paste, pressed into Japanese Nori Rice), baby octopus in a herb vinaigrette, smoked salmon, pickled herring, mussels and prawn cocktail. Three live action stations will serve up Japanese tempura, grilled seafood, and oriental stir fries. 																								The main course includes Indian specialities as well, like Crab Masala and Tandoori Pomfret to Continental favourites like Lobster Tail Thermidor, Hot and Spicy Prawns and Pan-fried Norwegian Salmon. All this comes for Rs 850 plus taxes. There is some good news, too: the meal comes with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine.																								While the main course items will change each week, La Terrasse promises to pay adequate attention to the craze for prawns and crabs for as long as the seafood spread is available.But this is one promotion where non-vegetarians enjoy a clear advantage. While a choice of vegetarian dishes will be included with every Friday spread, the emphasis is clearly on the seafood and fish items. Specialities at Seths, the New Alipore food court. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Four floors up 																								 A food multiplex has opened in New Alipore, filling the void of dining options in the south Calcutta locality. Seths Cuisine offers four floors of speciality dining, with Indian and Chinese already on, and Continental to soon follow.																								On the ground floor of the food court is Tarka, a dhaba-style set up, which serves north Indian food. One floor up brings you to Frontier Court, which specialises in North-West Frontier cuisine. The second floor is open to small parties during the week, and to lunch and dinner guests on weekends. Oriental Wok, as it is called, can accommodate between 30 and 50 guests. Above that is China Moon, offering Schezwan and Cantonese-style delicacies. Finally, on the top floor is Dissolve, a bar and grill that is scheduled to sizzle in a few weeks.																								Seths opened a few months ago, but has kept a low profile. We wanted to make sure things were running smoothly so our quality didnt suffer with the rush that follows publicity, explains proprietor Sumesh Seth. Great attention has been paid to ensure quality consistency is maintained. We had trials running for a year to make sure the dishes were just right when they were leaving the kitchen, he adds.																								Sunil Mahanori, previously with the Taj Bengal, and the team from Seths travelled to various parts of the country to find out what the authentic dishes taste like at the source. After that, much innovation and experimentation have resulted in the menus on each floor of the plaza. What we liked we kept. What we didnt like was chucked out, says Seth. Like the floor now being used for parties was previously meant to be a stir-fry floor. But the uneven results were enough to prompt the management to rethink, and the party concept has caught on.The floors are small  each accommodating between 35 and 55. Prices are also reasonable, with costs per head hovering around Rs 250. The Chicken Tai Pan is a must-try from the Chinese menu, and the Dahi Kebabs is a great option from the Indian selection, as is the Chicken Kandahari Kebab.  Some of the festival items at Pakwan. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								Dum cooked																								 The sheer variety on offer is likely to draw foodlovers to Pakwan. The Purna Das Road restaurant has turned the spotlight on biryani, covering the different versions of the dish found in every corner of the country.																								Biryani is a favourite with gourmets here. Bearing this in mind, I designed the festival to appeal to all palates, explained Soma Sharma, who, along with her husband Lt-Cdr Vijay Sharma, has been running the restaurant. Their self-confessed appetite for a good rice-and-meat dish has made its mark, with 18 varieties of biryani, each of which can be modified in three ways to include either mutton, chicken or fish, on offer from April 15 to May 9.																								Chefs Manoj and Reyaz have lent their expertise to cook up the delights, most of which are cooked on dum. So, there is little stirring involved and most of the flavour comes from the meat itself. From the rich, spicy, kewra-flavoured, dry-fruit laden Awadhi Nawaabi Biryani to Lucknows famed Nawaabi Seekh Biryani and the lighter Shahi Biryani, these treats taste good enough to be straight out of Nawab Wajed Ali Shahs kitchen. 																								Steeped in the flavours of saffron, the Wazwaan Biryani from Kashmir is also worth a try. While the Thief of Baghdad Biryani is made of white rice, dried dates, fried onions and cottage cheese thrown in with mutton, the Khyber Pass Biryani, inspired by Afghani cuisine, consists of yellow rice with a generous amount of cashews, pistachios and huge chunks of mutton. Pak Sar Zameen and Mughals Invade are the more common kinds of biryani.																								Biryanis are also savoured down south. Only they are hot and tangy and replete with the flavour of curry leaves, coconut and tamarind. Choices here include Chettinad Biryani, Mopillah Biryani and Ravanas Grub. The Pakwan Special Murg Mussallam Biryani is especially scrumptious, though better described as seasoned rice stuffed inside a whole chicken and cooked.						SOMA BANERJEE AND MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 VICTOR BANERJEE Khichdi fare in coalition times What a mixed ravioli in marinara this little world of Paneer Butter Masala has become since I last survived on missel pao a few weeks ago in Mumbai. At last, the trod upon shall stand up and claim their ounce of Pista or should that be Pasta  perhaps even linguini flattened by labour forces?																								But, take heart. As I look at life as I would at a bowl of noodles, I wondered long and hard about what obtuse line I could take in my kitchen to exemplify the complete coalition muddle we find ourselves in.																								I thought cooking our favourite ghaent would be most appropriate and also significant. Every Bengali will admit that a ghaent is the finest coalition of otherwise incompatible vegetables (with a Mr Laloo and Dr Bhuloo!) that ever graced our tables  rich and poor alike.																								Advanis delicious Sindhi Saibhaji is a calculated, though democratic, alliance of vegetables  though the importance of them being fresh and not stale items that have uselessly vegetated at the back of the kitchen doli, is an aspect sometimes overlooked.																								That brings me to khichuri: with all its provincial colloquial connotations and yet, while we savour it with ghee, ilish machh bhaja, bori bhaja, begunis and pianjis in northern India, khichdi is administered to the sick and ailing as something bland and nutritious.																								Now, in the kedgeree (Oxford Dictionary definition) that I find myself in, what, oh my fellow countrymen, what culinary experiences virtues could I possibly extol this week? What a mishmash noodle soup we seem to be swimming in!																								Hence, I can think of nothing better than what sense some early foreigners made of Indias peculiar habits and why, against all odds, Indian coalitions can be forced to work without disinvestment of popular taste.1. PISH PASH: (Suitable for the working classes of all collar colours)																								Ingredients: 1 kg chicken cut into pieces (or  kg mutton); 2 cups rice; 2 bay leaves; 6 peppercorns; 1 onion, sliced; 1 piece ginger, sliced; 100 gm carrots; beans; potatoes (optional: cauliflower); salt to taste; garam masala (two pods each of elaichi and clove and a small stick of cinnamon); 1 chicken cube for flavour.																								Method: Brown onions, along with ginger, bay leaves, peppercorns and garam masala. Add chicken or mutton and cook till meat is soft. Add rice, vegetables, chicken cube and boil all ingredients together till cooked. The great thing about Pishpash is that you can cook it backwards too by boiling the chicken first and having fun thereafter!But, I couldnt possibly leave you and our leaders without a viable alternative: so, 2. SAUSAGES AND SUNDIALS (originally cooked up by Langford Reed)																								Sausages and Sundials, Gazeteers and Glue!/ Mix them all together and make a Nonsense Stew;/ Add a pinch of Parsnip, season with Sardines,/ And the parchment covering of four Tambourines,/ Stir well with a Scaffold-pole, bound with purple String,/ Isnt that a dainty dish to set before a King?/ Sausages and Sundials, Gazeteers and Glue!/ Mix them all together and make a Nonsense Stew. 																								Jokes aside, my wonderment at coalition ghaents and Pishpashes is not born of skepticism but Socratic methodological doubt that will dialectically create better recipes for the future, ungarnished by contemporary semantics. Finally, let me admit that, the contradictions of the times may well make sarcasm the condition of truth.

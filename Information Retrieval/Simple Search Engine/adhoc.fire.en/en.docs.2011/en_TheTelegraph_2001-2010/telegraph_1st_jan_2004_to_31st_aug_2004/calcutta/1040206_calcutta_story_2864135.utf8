	Some booksellers on College Street offer huge discounts  on prices of engineering books. While reputed shops sell  them at marked prices, the roadside stalls offer 25 to 35  per cent discount. The contrast may be due to the different  commissions charged by publishers from booksellers. Those  who dont frequent the book mart might be unaware of the  slashed rates and end up losing a lot of money. Publishers  should push the books through their own retail outlets for  the benefit of students.

	Food vendors should not be allowed in the vicinity of schools.  Most of the foodstuff sold by them, like ice creams, pickles  and snacks, are prepared under very unhygienic conditions.  Besides, they do not bother to wash their hands before preparing  items like chaat, bhelpuri and phuchkas.  Civic food inspectors should ensure that eatables sold in  front of schools do not trigger an outbreak of diseases  like cholera and dysentry.

 Shaun KenworthyCalcutta has often been referred to as the city that lives to eat. Yet, theres never been a concerted attempt to put together a gastronomic guide to the city. Filling in that blank is The Telegraph Food Guide.																								A 300-page tribute to the tastes and preferences that make the city go round, it flits through a range that is ravishing, a flavour that is famishing.																								The Telegraph Food Guide, in association with Royal Challenge, was launched at a star-studded gathering on Sunday evening, at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC). Leading from the front was Team India skipper and budding restaurateur Sourav Ganguly, who unveiled the book.																								Opening partner Perizaad Zorabian preferred the Race Course to Joggers Park as she felicitated the top 21 restaurants in Calcutta listed in the guide and had an absolute blast.																								As did everyone else, an eclectic mix from varied worlds who trickled into RCTC through the drizzle. Starting with Derek Brien, who steered the show, and ending with last-to-arrive Rupa Ganguly, business and the beauty business brushed shoulders in style.																								If the Food Guide packs in the best of Calcutta cuisine, a large slice of the palate platter was served up on the spot by the star hotels  ITC Sonar Bangla, Taj Bengal, The Park, Hyatt Regency and The Oberoi Grand  for Sundays star cast. With each opening a counter to dish out on demand, food and fun seasoned the night.For those who were not there  and even those who were  here are some moments from the memorable evening. SKIPPER'S CHOICE: Sourav Ganguly flips through the Food Guide with Derek O'Brien, who later rattled off the Indian captain's favourite menu ( quot;a full Bengali meal of rice with posto, dal, fish and meat quot;).SUP IN STYLE: June Maliah at the ITC Sonar Bangla kiosk with Nelanjana Bhowmick. The Laksa soup was hot property.TICKLED PINK: Perizaad Zorabian has a chat with Indrani Halder, while catching up with some old friends and making many new ones. quot;I don't know where to eat out in Calcutta (apart from Flurys); the book will guide me, quot; she smiled.TWO'S COMPANY: Koneenica Banerjee spent most of her time with screen friend Swastika Mukherjee. But they missed Chandreyee and Debolina, who just quot;loved the food quot;.WOMEN IN BLACK: Tanusree Shankar shared colour and spotlight with Madhu Neotia. And a call on her cellphone from daughter Sreenanda in Mumbai capped the choreographer's evening.STAR COUPLE: Teen heartthrob Jishu Sengupta was never too far from fiancee Nelanjana. Or was it the other way round? quot;You won't believe the number of love letters he gets, quot; gushed the lady in orange.
MODEL MENU: Glam dolls Pinky and Tina, along with Nicola and Puja, pushed up the oomph factor.  quot;It's a party with the nicest people and the nicest food, quot; they exclaimed.

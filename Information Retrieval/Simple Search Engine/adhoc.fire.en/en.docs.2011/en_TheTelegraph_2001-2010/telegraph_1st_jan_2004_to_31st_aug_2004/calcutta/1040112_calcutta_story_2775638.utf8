		 SHADY DEALINGS: An illegal market on railway  land turns into a illicit liquor parlour after dark.  Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryAmiruzzaman: Illicit liquor is being sold openly along the railway tracks near Bakulbagan railway quarters and Gurudas Road. That pocket is becoming a law-and-order problem.																																																													I am aware of this. Strictly speaking, this problem is not under the purview of our civic authorities. It can only be solved if the Government Railway Police and local police undertake a continuous drive against the illicit liquor-sellers. I have spoken to officials of Maniktala and Phoolbagan police station earlier on the issue. They promised to clean up the place. Earlier, they had conducted a few raids, but I suppose they are unaware of the proportions the problem has assumed. I really do not know if police can stop the nuisance. Unfortunately, I have witnessed policemen taking money from the liquor-sellers and even drinking there late at night while on patrol in a police jeep.

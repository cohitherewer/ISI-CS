 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Lake eviction after election
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The Eastern Railway on Friday assured the high court that the unauthorised settlers on railway land between Ballygunge and Tollygunge stations, on the Sealdah South section, would be evicted immediately after the Lok Sabha elections.																								The railway also blamed the state government for not cooperating with it in the eviction.																								The state, however, informed the court that it would not take part in the demolition of the squatters shanties but would extend support to the railway in its eviction programme.																								The case relating to the beautification of Rabindra Sarobar (Dhakuria Lakes) came up for hearing before the green bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee. The bench inquired about the progress of the development drive.																								The lawyer representing the state pollution control board told the court that the water of the Sarobar was still unfit for bathing in. The court observed that unless the settlers were removed from the area, the quality of the Lakes water would not improve.																								The court then asked railway counsel Uttam Majumdar why his client was dragging its feet over carrying out the courts order on evicting the settlers.																								Majumdar told the court the railway had requested the state government for a demolition schedule but had been rebuffed.																								Government pleader Rabilal Moitra denied that any request had been received from the railways. He, however, told the court: We will not take part in the demolition. We will provide them logistic support.																								The matter will come up for hearing after four weeks.

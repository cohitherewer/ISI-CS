The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Vinod crime ring run by cell phone
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sheikh Vinod (face covered) being produced in court in September 2000. A Telegraph picture																								Sheikh Vinod, now lodged in Alipore Central jail for involvement in several cases of extortion, runs a racket outside the prison with the help of his mobile phone. This truth came to light with the arrest of five of his henchmen at 3 am on Monday near the Childrens Little Theatre ground adjacent to Dhakuria bridge, in the Lake police station area. 																								The five, including Vinods brother Sheikh Asgar and brother-in-law Sheikh Nasir, had gathered there, apparently before committing a robbery. Police found a cell phone in Asgars possession.																								Those arrested revealed that Vinod would call Asgar on his cell phone from jail and give him instructions on running the extortion racket, said Asit Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of Lake police station. We already had Vinods cell number and were trying to lay a trap for four others, who have been absconding.																								All five arrested on Monday, according to police, have been extorting money from real estate agents of the Lake Gardens, Jadavpur, Regent Park and Charu Market areas under Vinods guidance. 																								We have asked the service-provider to send us a call statement of the cell phone. Besides, officers are verifying the numbers stored in the phone memory, said an officer of Lake police station.																								Ramapada Bhattacharya, deputy inspector-general of police (prison), overseeing Presidency jail and Alipore Central jail, said on Monday night that he was not aware of Vinod having access to a mobile phone. 																								We had intensified vigil in the jail after the recovery of a phone from Aftab Ansaris cell. This is a serious offence and I have asked the jail superintendent to probe the matter and submit a report by tomorrow, he said. Those guarding Vinods cell will be charged if they are found guilty of dereliction of duty, he added. 																								Our warders must have handed over the cell phone to Vinod, as they did to Ansari, admitted a jail official.

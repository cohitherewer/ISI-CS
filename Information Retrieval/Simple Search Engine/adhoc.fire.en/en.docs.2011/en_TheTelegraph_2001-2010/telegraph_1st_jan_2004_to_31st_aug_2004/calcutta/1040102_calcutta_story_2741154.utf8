 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 In battle over building rules
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The mayor and the building department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are divided over the state housing departments move to include promoters in the panel of experts to frame new building rules for the civic body.																								On Thursday, mayor Subrata Mukherjee dubbed the move practical, but his council member (building) Swapan Samaddar said: It tantamounts to including drivers in a committee to frame the citys traffic management policy.																								The civic authorities had asked the municipal affairs department several months ago to set up a committee to frame new building rules for the city, as the present rules have outlived their relevance. Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharaya, too, admitted that the civic building rules required a recast, but to date, no committee has been announced by the state government.																								Meanwhile, some builders with links in the state housing department have started lobbying that the municipal affairs department include their representatives in the experts committee. 																								Building rules need to be recast every 10 years to accommodate changes in the cityscape, peoples aspirations and emerging environmental aesthetics, pointed out CMCs director-general (building) Ashok Roychaudhury. The building rules of 1977 were recast in 1990. So, its time for a fresh look, he said. 																								We need a set of practical building rules for a 300-year-old city. Framing building rules for Calcutta is quite different from framing rules for Salt Lake or Rajarhat, pointed out mayor Mukherjee. 																								It was unfortunate that the earlier rules were framed presuming that Calcutta was a sprawling plot of vacant land. According to the mayor, the addition of 83 sq km of municipal and panchayat areas in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur has further complicated the job of framing a unified set of building rules.																								The city proper is predominantly built-up and the only scope for building is reconstruction. If the new building rules allow the same floor-area ratio (FAR) for new constructions and reconstructions, it will be difficult to give the city a facelift, the mayor elaborated.																								Most of the old buildings are tenanted and the basic precondition for their reconstruction is rehabilitation of the tenants. Now, if a landlord or a developer is allowed much less FAR when he decides to construct a new building after demolishing the old structure, he will not find the project feasible. The new rules should take into account this important development aspect, he said.																								Besides, the middle-class will not agree to build a house leaving about 50 per cent of the plot open, according to the mayor.

 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Malaria count up, Delhi freezes funds
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) registered over 7,000 malaria cases in the past three months, nearly 800 of which are of malignant malaria-causing pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. So far, one malarial death has been recorded at Garia burning ghat. The malaria death toll last year was two.																								It is just the tip of the iceberg. For every positive case of malaria recorded in the CMC clinic, three go unrecorded, said a senior doctor in the School of Tropical Medicine. 																								City civic authorities were alarmed as the central government has stopped the malaria control grant to the CMC this year, when more cases are being reported in the city. 																								It is for the first time that we are not getting central funds to launch a malaria awareness campaign. The change in the central government may be the cause, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 																								According to mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh, the central government, under the national anti-malaria programme, gave Rs 14 lakh last year and Rs 24 lakh in 2002 to launch a malaria awareness campaign in the city.																								Officials in the health ministry, who were dealing with it, have been transferred to Kerala following the changeover in Delhi, Ghosh said. 																								However, the supply of medicine to treat malaria under the project from the Centre remained intact. The anti-malaria programme was being carried out by the central government in different parts of the country with assistance from the World Health Organisation (WHO). 																								Since the malaria graph suddenly shows an upward trend between July and October, municipal commissioner Debashis Som had directed the civic health department to stock chemicals like pyrethrum, Baytex and Solfac in advance so that larvae-control activities and fogging could be undertaken in the malaria-prone pockets.																								We have placed a requisition for the procurement of chemicals worth Rs 1.25 crore before the municipal commissioner, said officer-on-special duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee.																								Disowning responsibility of the only malarial death in the city (recorded at Garia burning ghat), Mukherjee said the man did die in a Calcutta hospital but he was from Sonarpur. 																								If city people become a little more vigilant in preventing the breeding of mosquitoes in accumulated rainwater, the incidence of malaria will go down substantially in the city, he said.

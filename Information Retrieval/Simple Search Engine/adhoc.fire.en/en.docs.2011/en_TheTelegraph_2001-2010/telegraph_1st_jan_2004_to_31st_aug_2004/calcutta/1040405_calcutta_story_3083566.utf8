The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Tact, sensitivity can iron out the creases in topics still taboo
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Peeing in public is fine. But drawing a sketch of a man in the act can invite severe punishment. When a five-year-old was spied in the classroom drawing the sketch of a man peeing, all hell broke loose in a city school.																								The red-faced authorities punished the child by throwing him out of the school, sparking a debate over morality. Most people blamed the school but for different reasons. One section accused the school of failing to impart the right values and to keep children occupied in more noble pursuits. Others blamed the school for the harsh measure and felt that it was expected to handle the delicate situation with more tact and sensitivity. 																								A small minority, however, felt that the child should have been complimented for being so observant, as also for his drawing talent.																								In any case, there was a consensus that rusticating the boy was not a solution to whatever the school felt the problem was. Predictably enough, teachers blamed the parents for not restraining the childs riotous imagination. It is not known how the parents, painted as both victims and villains, reacted.																								Amidst all this, people generally lost sight of the trauma the poor child must have been subjected to.																								The incident also fuelled the old debate over the urgency of introducing sex education in schools. Efforts by the West Bengal government in this direction have already met with resistance from a large section of teachers that seems to have been greatly offended by the manual prepared for the course. 																								The all-powerful teachers association has indignantly described parts of the manual as pornography, forcing the education minister to forward it for scrutiny by medical experts.																								One would have called the exercise a farce if the subject had not been of such grave concern to people. Several schoolteachers confided that many of their students have been abused at home, a few have committed suicide and at least in one case, a boy was driven to suicide because he was sodomised by a teacher and seduced by close relatives. The needs of children will vary with age but they need to be handled with greater sensitivity.																								Different surveys have indicated that Indian teenagers are becoming increasingly sexually active and the levels of promiscuity are high in both rural and urban areas. Even more alarmingly, one out of four girls in the country, and one out of six boys are likely to be sexually abused before they attain the age of 16. 																								Teenage pregnancies, as well as sexual assaults on single women, are going up. In the event, the question is not whether sex education is needed in schools but how to go about it.																								Even in the US, where sex education was introduced in schools six decades ago, the subject continues to remain contentious. Several educationists insist that sex education should ideally be imparted by parents. They cite surveys in which 10 to 12-year-old children have indicated their preference to learn about the birds and the bees at home. But surveys also indicate that American parents are reluctant to take on the role and that by the time the children attain the age of 14, their information source shifts from parents to friends. 																								It would, perhaps, be easier for teachers to tackle the subject if modules are developed to link the subject of sex with literature, art, films, commerce, mental illness, health, psychology and law. It could then be made more interesting, as well as more interactive, besides being more informative. The method might help youngsters acquire a better perspective about human sexuality, develop relationship skills and help them exercise greater responsibility.																								Finally, it should not be very difficult to involve school students and ask them what their needs are and how they would like the schools to go about addressing them.

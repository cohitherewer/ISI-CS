The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Flashback to a fantastic journey
				 	 Konkona Sen Sharma with Paul Brownbill at the British Council. Picture by Amit Datta																								Imagine the rain-washed lush lawns of Tollygunge Club, and you meandering along in a motley crowd under umbrellas. The slushy landscape has become a magical city scooped out of memory, while you relive a fantastical journey that Marco Polo took to the East some centuries ago. Your tour guide: Konkona Sen Sharma and some of her actor friends.																								Its a performance far removed from the traditional theatre experience, promises Nigel Ward, in town with his three-year-old UK-based Kinaetma Theatre to stage The Silk Route: Memory of a Journey.																								The production draws upon the travel accounts of Marco Polo and 20th century Italian writer Calvinos Invisible Cities, which re-tells Polos tales in a very poetic mode.																								For Ward, a senior lecturer of drama in De Montfort University, his second journey to India brings back memories of his first (and successful) production in Calcutta last year when Kinaetma Theatre played out The Changing Room, based on Ovids Metamorphoses, to a packed Kala Mandir.																								Under Wards direction, childhood buddies Konkona and Royona Mitra, and set designer Paul Brownbill, will give shape to The Silk Route, with a team of city participants through three weeks of extensive workshop.																								I am very envious of them (Ward, Royona and Brownbill) because all three do so much theatre in the UK, while I didnt get to do much last year, says Konkona, in town after a long shooting schedule in Delhi and Mumbai. Royona and I were school friends. Much later, we discovered that we shared similar tastes and views on theatre. And last year, we managed to pull off a play, laughs Konkona (Koko to family and friends), having short-listed 25 participants for the workshop. 																								But why Marco Polo? As the first European traveller to the East, Marco Polos accounts are the foundation text for a western perception of the East. For us, his journey opened up the scope for a dialogue between two cultures. At Kinaetama, we work with different cultures, with Royona hailing from India and myself raised in the UK, explains Ward, a former assistant director in Royal Shakespeare Company. We will build on our experiences But its a challenging process for us to control, he adds.																								Royona, the other founding member of Kinaetma, who has grown up in Calcutta and now works in the UK, is eager to interpret Marco Polos journey through her own perception of dislocation.																								The journey has already been made. We are trying to recreate it. Here, the focus is not on the end product but on the blending of western and eastern ethos, explains Royona.																								We will use Calvinos text as a framework, where he discovers Marco Polos accounts as fragments of many invisible cities. The process of remembering it will be through the mind, the body and voices, adds the lecturer of drama in Wolverhampton University. 																								For a city audience not too familiar with a stage that is constantly being displaced, Brownbill has surprises up his sleeve. Since the play will travel from one place to another within the club premises, props and costumes become crucial. I am planning to recreate a space with terracotta, bamboo and wood, says the veteran set designer, adding: In the UK, we have transported audiences 20 miles away in buses for site-specific performances.																								For the moment, evolving a play from some disparate fragments of journeys, some set cultural perceptions and various layers of cultural exchanges seems the most daunting.																								We are not working on a pre-organised script. The play will evolve with the workshops and all the performers will be creators as well, clarifies Ward, seasoned in holding cross-cultural workshops in the Czech Republic and Latvia.																								Presented by British Council in association with Tollygunge Club, the curtains will rise on The Silk Route on September 10.																								But if you are expecting a seat, you might be disappointed, Royona sounds a warning, with a smile.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 City lights shine bright
For the past two years, the buzz about Calcutta-based designers couldnt have been louder at the most happening showcase of Indian fashion  the Lakm India Fashion Week. And this year promises to be no different, with Anamika Khanna being selected as one of the designers for the grand finale. But that is just the icing on the couture cake, with all the best and the brightest heading for the bash, from April 27 to May 3 at The Grand, New Delhi. Here is The Good Life send off for some of Calcuttas style ambassadors: Glimpses from Fashion Week 2003. Creations by Anamika Khanna																								Anamika Khanna																								 She caught everyones eye with her clean lines  classy yet trendy, innovative yet wearable. This year, her look is set to be far more high energy. The May 3 finale, where around 25 to 30 garments will be on show, will be in keeping with the Lakms Fruit Shock theme. Anamika has designed a collection called Burst and shares the prized pedestal with Aki Narula and Anshu Arora Sen.																								I am going completely batty, laughs Anamika, working 24x7 to get everything together with precious days left before the gala. The collection will scream energy and freshness, promises the designer, and is a far cry from Lakms image of old. All might be peaceful at her Short Street boutique, but her fairly large workshop currently resembles a madhouse.																								I get a sense of satisfaction and a sense of pride that Calcutta is doing well, says the latest in line of city designers to create a stir.And Anamikas collection will have a longer shelf life, as colours inspired by Burst will make their way into Lakms cosmetics lines for a summer statement. Glimpses from Fashion Week 2003. Creation by Sabyasachi MukherjeeSabyasachi Mukerjee																								 Sabyasachi has been the toast of the Calcutta crop for a couple of years now. Not only has he moved from strength to strength with style, he wears his fame with enviable ease. Starting out as the darling of Calcutta buyers, his work began to turn some serious heads nationally after Fashion Week 2002. Since then, he has hit ramps around the world, and is making his Bollywood debut with Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Black, where he is dressing up stars Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee.																								But stale talent is no talent at all, and Sabyasachi is not one to sit still either. Frog Princess is what he is calling his Fashion Week line. It is about the dreamer in all of us, says the man affectionately known as Pepsi. His vision for the line came from a sense of dissatisfaction with his work. I was making a lot of expensive clothes, and I wasnt happy with what I was doing, he confesses. So Frog Princess will invite you to wear it. The clothes are well loved and well worn, and not meant to look designer.																								 The look is 50s and 60s, with hints of the 70s, 80s and even 30s. The first thing that triggered it was the movie Mona Lisa Smile, he reveals. Velvet, satin, beiges, rose pinks, mint greens and pale blues make for a more mundane collection with a second-hand feel.																								While in his search for a creative challenge he may have broken out of the groove of his success, he hasnt completely abandoned his signature bohemia for the 25-odd ensembles for women and six for men. Glimpses from Fashion Week 2003. Creation by Kiran Uttam GhoshKiran Uttam Ghosh																								 If India is shining, than couture can claim at least some of the credit. So Kirans collection  called India Shining  is all about Indias happy marriage with internationalism, to be unveiled on the evening of April 29.																								It is a collection whose bedrock can be the benarasi yet whose interpretation can be international. Where a dhoti becomes cosmopolitan and flirts outrageously with a trenchcoat. That is the message Kiran  who retails under the label Kimono  wants to send with a line born out of the designers own optimism and that which engulfed the nation (or its politicians, at least).																								Her use of fabrics sticks to this theme, as well. Earthy cottons in apolitical alliances with khadders, she writes in her concept note. Georgettes competing with chiffons in common constituencies. The vote clearly is for all that is intrinsically Indian...																								Others to watch...																								...Monapali, the creation of Calcuttas design veterans, Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdev, who cant be missed at the annual event. 																								Another design duo will feature on the ramp on May 2. Swapan and Seema, the husband-wife team debuted at Fashion Week two years ago. Their label  also known as Swapan and Seema  retails from their boutique Vachi.																								Hopefully, this will be hat-trick year for team Calcutta.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY				 	 LANDGRAB LOCALE: Shanties line one of Parnasree Pallys waterbodies. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Once a stolid middle-class Behala bastion, Parnasree Pally is now a picture of squalor. Its waterbodies are choked with filth, excreta and other waste, thanks to squatters who have erected houses, shanties, shops and stalls wherever land was available.																								Home to nearly 15,000 people, the 75-acre mini-township is in a turmoil over the squatters, blamed for degrading the environment.																								Residents, with their back to the wall, decided on Tuesday to approach the government and the state pollution control board (PCB) to rid the area of squatters. They have turned the place into a slum with unauthorised constructions. Many of the illegal houses have septic tanks with outlet pipes running into the waterbodies. Much of the construction has been carried out after filling up parts of the townships four lakes, complained Ajoy Bhowmick, director and secretary of Parnasree Pally Samavyaya Samity. 																								Roadspace, too, has reduced to half by the encroachments and traffic snarls have become the order of the day.																								Residents say local political leaders had not responded to their repeated appeals for relief. The local MLA and the councillor are both from the Trinamul Congress. Local leaders have turned a blind eye to the problem. Now, we have no other option but to take the issue to the government and the PCB, said Bhowmick.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said he was aware of the problem and would soon take the initiative to clear the area of squatters and pollution. I had earlier instructed the local borough committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Now, I shall carry out a drive from the headquarters soon, he added. Residents had earlier submitted a memorandum to Mukherjee on this score.																								Parnasree Pally was set up in 1950 after the government acquired 75 acres to allow government employees and refugees from former East Pakistan to build houses. 																								We built our homes here to live in a peaceful environment, but our dreams were shattered with increasing encroachment, said Deepak Sarkar, a local resident.																								Initially, the main road was 80 feet wide and even the lanes and bylanes leading into the township were spacious. But now, the main road has been reduced to about 60 feet with shops and shanties coming up on both sides. As a result, vehicular traffic gets frequently stalled, Sarkar added. Apart from shanties, pucca constructions, too, have come up on the banks of the waterbodies and waste is discharged into them. 																								Residents have met local MP Sujan Chakraborty, local MLA Partha Chatterjee, local councillor Sova Ghosh and borough chairman Anjan Das to discuss their problem but no concrete steps were taken. Debabrata Bhattacharjee, a resident, said: When we went to the police, they said they cannot do anything without the governments consent. So, we shall approach higher authorities.

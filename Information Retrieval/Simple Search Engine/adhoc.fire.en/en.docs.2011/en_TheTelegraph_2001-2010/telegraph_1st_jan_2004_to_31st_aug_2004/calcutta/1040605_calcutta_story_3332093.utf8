The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 05, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Kenny G, musician. Cooperation and a sense of responsibility make you a good worker. Your friends will stand by you. Watch out for mental tension. Your gem: diamond. Lucky colour: white. You lack perseverance. A home-based business with a little forethought may succeed. Let loved ones know how much you care.  Kusum Bhandari

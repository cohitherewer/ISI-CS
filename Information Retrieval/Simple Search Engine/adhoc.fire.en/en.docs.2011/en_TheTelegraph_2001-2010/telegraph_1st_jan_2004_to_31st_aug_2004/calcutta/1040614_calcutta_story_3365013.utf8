The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 House-full film flood Film glut feels good
 A STAFF REPORTER																								When it comes to films, fine dining doesnt work. Its the combo meal that does the trick.																								A wholesome mix of English fantasy, Hindi masala and Bengali sentiment has suddenly pepped up the citys celluloid platter. Two Hollywood biggies, eight Bollywood blockbusters and a slew of family dramas from the Tollywood stable have drawn a huge number of Calcuttans to cinemas this week and the one before.																								Starting June 4, there has been a phenomenal flow of films  and cine-goers  at theatres across town, reveal trade figures. Take the citys only multiplex. Of the nine films currently being screened at INOX, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban recorded 100 per cent occupancy in the first week, and is already sold out for the second. Even the awkward 9.15 am slot is full up.																								Giving the whiz kid a run for his popularity are action-adventure The Day After Tomorrow and Yashraj Films Hum Tum, both of which are running to packed houses at the multiplex. The Day After has done very well at Navina and is doing pretty well at Globe. Down south at Menoka, Hum Tum has registered an encouraging 65 to 70 per cent occupancy.																								With most films enjoying a long run, few vacancies are opening up for new releases. Navina, for instance, had to pull out The Day After  even after the film touched 75 per cent occupancy last week  to make room for Dev and Girlfriend.																								The flood of films has given film exhibitors reason to smile soon after mayor Subrata Mukherjees budget bonanza, but the space jam on the big screen is serious enough to keep the frown firmly in place. 																								The slash (of collections to the civic kitty from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent) has come as a relief for exhibitors, as it will ensure better cash flow for them, says Arijit Dutta, president, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA). Exhibitors are also happy with the overflow of programmes, but theres a dearth of good halls in the city to screen so many national releases, he adds.																								At INOX, for instance, the much-hyped Girlfriend has had to settle for two not very appealing slots.																								As all the films are running very well, we didnt want to disrupt the shows and had to put Girlfriend in the 10 am and 12.20 pm slots, says Jeevan Joshi, programming manager, INOX.																								Among the ones refusing to make way for new releases is the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Main Hoon Na, which had hit a high of more than 95 per cent occupancy in the first week at Hind.  A still from Yuva: Promising start, poor showIn its seventh week now, the film is still grabbing a 90 per cent seat share at the Elgin Road multiplex. At Menoka, the film notched up around 50 per cent occupancy in the sixth week, which is good by any standards, according to a hall spokesperson.																								The too-many-films-but-very-few-halls has hit Tollywood as well, with around 12 to 13 films waiting in queue. 																								The launch of Premi has been pushed back to June 25 because Aakrosh is doing well in the Minar-Bijoli-Chhabighar chain. Even Shudhu Tumi is awaiting a hall for release, says Krishna Daga, chairman, EIMPA, producers section.																								The lone Bengali arthouse movie, Iti Srikanta, is also making its presence felt after a slow start on June 4. The box-office collections have climbed in the second week at both Priya and Mitra. At INOX, the film has picked up pretty well, too. The first week is often not very impressive in case of Bengali films. The pace shoots up from the second, explains a spokesperson for Mitra.																								The only damper in the flood of big-budget releases was Yuva, which fell flat by the third week after a promising start.																								But theres more star power in store. The week starting June 4 has till now been the best this year. We expect to get better with forthcoming releases like Lakshya and Troy, says Joshi of INOX.

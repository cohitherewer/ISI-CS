The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Share the blame and the bill
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Is the bus-owner liable to compensate the victim(s) if his vehicle causes an accident? More letters will be published next week									

Santosh Agarwal,
																		Beleghata 																																																														Statistics show that most accidents occur either due to ill maintenance of vehicles or employment of irresponsible bus drivers. For both these lags, bus-owners are to be blamed. Therefore loopholes in the system should be plugged such that they are not let off without proper penalty.									

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,
																		Dum Dum Park 																																																														Since the bus and its driver are the bus-owners responsibility, he can be held indirectly responsible for an accident. If the owner is made to compensate for the fault of his driver, the penalty will make him instruct his driver to be careful.									

Indu Rani Shaw,
																		Address not given 																																																														If the bus driver is found inebriated while driving, his licence should be cancelled and in case he is driving without a licence, the owner should compensate the victim(s). 									

Anil Kumar Sen,
																		Ramchandra Chatterjee Lane 																																																														Bus-owners have become indisciplined. As their employees, drivers care little about traffic rules, only wanting to earn money by hook or by crook. So, if bus accidents turn fatal, bus-owners should be held responsible and be liable to compensate the victim(s). 									

Diptimoy Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake City 																																																														The drivers have to be put on leash, by the owners as well as the law. The errant drivers are hardly ever put behind bars. But the real culprit is the state administrations lackadaisical attitude.									

Nirmal Kumar Saha,
																		Sinthee 																																																														Bus-owners alone cannot be held liable to compensate the victim(s). Careless pedestrians, hawkers, the tendency of overtaking and rash driving, inadequate policemen and citizens lack of traffic sense are to be blamed for accidents as well.									

Piyush Saraogi, 
																		Kings Road 																																																														It should be made obligatory for the bus-owner to compensate the victim(s) if his vehicle causes an accident. This step, if taken, will certainly reduce the number of accidents caused by buses to a great extent.									

Prasit Sen, 
																		Address not given 																																																														Bus drivers never get punished even after being responsible for the death of victims. In such cases, the owner of the vehicle must take responsibility of the accident caused due to reckless driving of his employee. The owner should help the victim or his/her family by giving medical or financial aid. 									

Basant Kumar Chowdhury, 
																		Kankinara																																																														Every illegal act calls for a penalty. If a vehicle causes an accident, a hefty fine on the irresponsible driver should be made compulsory. The bus-owner should be penalised too. 									

Anirban Mondal, 
																		Chinsurah 																																																														An in-depth probe should be conducted to figure out who the real culprit behind an accident is  the bus driver or the victim. If the driver is found guilty, it should be made compulsory for the owner of the bus to compensate the victim(s). 									

Rounak Pal,
																		Birati 																																																														Though as a financial commitment a compensation means a lot, it does not bring back the lost lives. A compensation also allows offenders to go scot-free. 									

Atif Ayaz, 
																		Serampore 																																																														The government must pass a law about the compensation regarding an accident caused by a vehicle. Compensation is always helpful for the family of the victim(s). 									

A.K. Mitra,
																		Puddapukur																																																														For every life lost in an accident, the driver should be made to pay Rs 8,000, the conductor Rs 2,000 and the owner Rs 5,000. If the accident is caused due to bad road conditions, the CMC should also pay up.									

Ronita Dutta, 
																		Jadavpur																																																														The main culprit is the bus-owner, whose employee, the driver, has no consideration about the way he endangers public life by driving rashly. Therefore the owner should be held liable to compensate the victim(s). 									

Reuben Aaron,
																		Wellesley Square																																																														In case of an accident, the bus-owner bribes the vehicle inspectors for a brake fail certificate. The compensation to the victim(s) should be equally divided between the owner and the government, which should also pitch in. 									

Surajit Gupta, 
																		Fakir Chand Mitra Street																																																														It is the bus-owners prerogative to choose expert drivers. So if these drivers are reckless and irresponsible, leading to fatal accidents, the bus-owner should be blamed and be liable to compensate the victim(s).									

S.N. Mukherjee,
																		Lake Gardens																																																														It is mainly due to the fault of the driver and the conductor that accidents are caused. So they should be made to pay a compensation to the victim(s) as also the bus-owner who employed them in the first place.									

mahasweta saha,
																		Garia																																																														Drivers are responsible for rash driving which is the main cause of most road accidents these days. If drivers are penalised or sacked, they will think twice before being careless while at the steering wheel.									

Manasi Chakraborty, 
																		Behala																																																														A bus-owner is liable to compensate the victim(s) if his vehicle causes an accident. This can take care of the medical bills of the family of the victim, especially one who is financially weak.									

Ahasan Jahir Molla, 
																		Mahestala																																																														The owner is liable to compensate the victim(s) only when his vehicle is not properly maintained or when the driver does not possess a valid licence.

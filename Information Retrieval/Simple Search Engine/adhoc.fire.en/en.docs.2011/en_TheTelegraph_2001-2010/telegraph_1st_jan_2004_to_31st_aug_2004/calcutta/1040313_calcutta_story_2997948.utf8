The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Rally: joint venture
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Clearing the way comes easier than cleaning the air for the state government. On the day the government submitted to Calcutta High Court that the Bharat Stage II deadline could not be met, it also promised to restrict weekday rallies on city streets to ensure smooth traffic and pedestrian flow.																								The matter came up for hearing on Friday before a division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee five months after the filing of an appeal by the state government, that challenged the order of Justice Amitava Lala restricting weekday rallies.																								Appearing for the state, advocate-general Balai Ray told the court that the government had already chalked out a plan prohibiting michhils and meetings on certain city thoroughfares. On some, rallies would be allowed only on certain conditions, stated Ray.																								On roads where rallies will be allowed, there will be certain dos and donts. Processionists will not be allowed to take up the entire width of the road, asserted the advocate-general, stating that the government intended to introduce the rally rules after the Lok Sabha polls.																								Ray said the government had convened an all-party meeting to reach a consensus on the contentious matter. But, unfortunately, three major Opposition parties did not attend the meeting, he pointed out, before adding that the government was expecting their views in writing.																								The division bench heard the advocate-generals submission and remarked: We also feel that this decision should be taken by the government, because it is an administrative issue. We dont think it is fair for the court to intervene in administrative matters.																								The chief justice, however, asked the advocate-general to bring the political parties, that did not attend the all-party meeting, to court, if necessary.																								We feel there should be a consensus over the governments rally rules. For this, we are also ready to impress upon political parties who would like to listen, said Chief Justice Mathur.																								On September 30, 2003, Justice Lala, in a suo motu order, had directed police to ban weekday rallies on city streets between 8 am and 8 pm.																								This order was openly criticised by political parties, led by the ruling CPM. On October 13, the state government filed an appeal challenging Justice Lalas order before a vacation division bench. The vacation bench had issued an interim stay on Justice Lalas order, but said the matter would be finally heard by a regular bench.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Calling all smart kids
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Siddhartha Basu in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								He may not be too keen on comparing the two. But add quizwhiz Siddhartha Basu to a cocktail of expensive sets, mega prizes and contestants gruelling it out through rounds of general knowledge questions, and the comparison with Kaun Banega Crorepati is obvious.																								Indias Child Genius: The Search For Indias Smartest Kid, Basu insists, is quite something else. Its not a game show. The programme would be means of rewarding and encouraging the gifted children of India, he explains. Loosely based on The Challenge of the Child Geniuses  a popular show in the US, where child prodigies battle it out once a year in a two-hour programme  the first episode of Indias Child Genius was beamed on Star World last Sunday.																								The 27-episode show would continue for the next six months and reach its climax on Childrens Day. It would test the general knowledge of kids between 10 and 12, and quiz them on verbal and non-verbal reasoning, mathematics, science, history, natural world, geography, mythology, literature, English language and spellings. And its not just the smartest kid tag to play for, but also prizes, worth Rs 50 lakh. The winner takes home Rs 10 lakh, while the second and third best Rs 7.5 and 5 lakh.																								The response for participation, like most of Basus shows, had been tremendous. Around 20,000 applications poured in from around the country, when we first announced the show in January, he said. To be considered for selection, the tweens needed to have a good academic record, among other things, scoring at least 80 per cent for two consecutive years. Telephonic interviews, written exams and other screening methods followed.																								Among the final 80 participants chosen from the east, five are from Calcutta.																								Its also a family show, Basu takes pains to point out, perhaps due to the show being aired on Star World, a channel not really known for its kids content. And what kind of ratings does he expect? As high as an English language programme can get in the country, he adds, with the confidence that stems from being one of the pioneers of quiz programming on television.																								The show airs every Sunday at 9 pm on the channel, with repeats twice a week.

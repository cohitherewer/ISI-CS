The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 Bon Appetease Victor BanerjeeThis is the season when the minority community in India flees to cooler climes in the Austrian Alps or for a round of golf at St Andrews or Gleneagles (which I prefer), in Scotland. The majority community ventures forth on pilgrimages where a minority of them perish as buses fall into khuds or they slide down landslides to flow downstream in the Bhagirathi and thence via the Hooghly into paradise.I thus have a choice. I can either tell you about the pleasures of eating Jhangora (the poor mans rice) and Techwani which he cooks with aloo and mooli (the only vegetables that they can grow) or, I can pamper to the minority and tell them what to do after they get themselves Austrian visas and temporarily flee the perils of being subjected to higher taxation and a five-year-plan of labour unrest.Last year, Vienna was the hottest it has been in the last 200 years with the mercury at 33 degrees Celsius at 11 clock at night. Landing in Vienna on a balmy afternoon, I waltzed straight into the familiar warmth and elegant ambience of the Hotel Sachers bar on Kartner Strasse, for a cup of their outstanding blend of Darjeeling tea. Far better than Fortnums, I will have anglophiles know. Accompany the tea with Sachers chocolate torte and your life is made.At night, dressed in shorts, I walked past the Giant Ferris Wheel (an area that has now become a quaint European mixture of Bombays Chowpatty and Englands Battersea Park) to Schweizerhaus for their legendary roast pork. It is only served by the kilo, so dont waste your time ordering for one plate. Delightfully, you are left alone to peel the succulent meat off the bone like youd tackle a raan at Karims in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, or at Zeeshan at Park Circus, Calcutta. Dip some crusted bread in the grease and you will discover heaven on earth.I waved down our charming waiter Bernhard, who was now carrying eight pints of foaming Budweiser to a table of sun-drenched Americans. I apologetically asked him for Riesling wine. The best option on a summers day (or night). The Americans had no idea that it was the first owner of Schweizerhaus who, on a visit to Bohemia in 1926, had discovered and made famous the hitherto unheard of Budweiser beer that is sensationalised every year at their Super Bowl  that is, of course, when Janet Jackson doesnt steal the show. Before the majority community takes umbrage, let me cheer you up. So, for wayfarers in the Garhwal Himalayas, whose exaggerated charter of demands in the plains left union leaders richer, let me make life exciting by giving you a nonpareil dal recipe.Garhwali ChausaIngredients: Coarsely ground urad dal (with skin, or partially broken)  1 cup after grinding Onion  1 medium Garlic  6/8 pods finely sliced Garlic  10 pods ground Tomatoes  2 or 3 cut finely A pinch of hing 1 tsp jakhia (the magic of the mountains) or whole zeera Mustard oil 1  tbspDhania powder 1 tspHaldi powder  tsp Whole garam masala (2 laung, 2 small elaichi, 2 small pcs dalchini) Red chilly powder and salt to taste 2/3 glasses of boiling water Ghee, sliced garlic and 2 dried red chillies for tarkaMethod:Heat mustard oil in a kadhai, add onions, sliced garlic, hing and jakhia and stir in the oil a minute or so. Add ground dal and fry for a few minutes. Next add chopped tomatoes, dhania powder, haldi, ground garlic, red chilly powder and salt to taste, and add the whole garam masala. Continue to fry until the masalas are properly cooked and the dal is ready to boil. Keep stirring all the time to avoid dal sticking to the bottom of the kadhai. Now add boiling hot water and mix well. Cook till the dal is ready. Heat ghee and add a tempering (tarka, chownk) of chopped garlic and a couple of dried red chillies. Before serving, pour in as much pure gawa ghee as your arteriosclerosis permit.After you have cooked and enjoyed this dish of the Himal, take a walk to the riverside on the Strand. Gaze carefully, think hard and then stop demanding to call the Hooghly the Ganga and a branch of Tollys Nullah, the Adi Ganga. From Gangotri, Jai Ho!

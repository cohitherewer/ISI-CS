The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Business as usual for some
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Monday was a holiday for most but business as usual for a few. From shop stops to appetite addresses, there were those who defied the bandh call and refused to allow a political party to disrupt their daily schedule.																								Bandhs are out of fashion and we are in the fashion business, said Kishore Biyani, chief knowledge officer, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd. Both the Pantaloons outlets, at Gariahat and 22 Camac Street, stayed open, as did Big Bazaar on VIP Road.																								In Salt Lake, City Centre kept its doors open like any other day. While anchor Shoppers Stop had put up its staff members at a nearby guest house overnight, the essential duty staff of the mall stayed put on Sunday night to keep the facilities running.																								Forum, on Elgin Road, which had stayed open during the previous two bandhs this year, did not lift shutters till 4 pm. We took this opportunity to service the chiller unit during the first half. From our previous experience, we have seen people dont venture out till late in the afternoon on bandh days, said Rahul Saraf, managing director.																								On the citys food street, a precious few lunch tables were laid out. Buoyed by a recent Supreme Court judgment frowning on bandhs, establishments like Oasis, One Step Up and Bar-B-Q chose to defy the shutdown.																								Why must a whole city pay the price for the whims of a handful of people? demanded Pratap Daryanani of Oasis																								I decided to open the outlet as everything was peaceful It is always possible to take a stand, though it is often difficult for individuals to resist political pressure, added Daryanani.																								That undercurrent of unease was palpable on Park Street on Monday. It is best not to comment on these matters as we could well become the targets (of the bandh brigade) the next time, said a manager at Bar-B-Q.

				 																																									Many roads in the city are undergoing repairs. Some have been dug up for laying telephone and electricity lines. However, the labourers often accidentally damage the underground drinking water pipelines during the course of the work. Especially in the rainy season, rain water trickles down and mixes with the drinking water through the leaks. It is because of such contamination that people are increasingly falling prey to water-borne diseases. The authorities in charge of the digging should ensure that the labourers take utmost precaution not to damage the supply pipelines.

It prevents children from playing games that require an open stretch of ground. The slide should be demolished and a new one constructed at a corner of the otherwise spacious park so that the children can utilise the space properly.

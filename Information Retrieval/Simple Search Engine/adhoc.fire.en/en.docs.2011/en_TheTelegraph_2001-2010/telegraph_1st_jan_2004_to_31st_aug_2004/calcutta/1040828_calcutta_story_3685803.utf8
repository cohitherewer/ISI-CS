 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Mayor eyes flyover twins
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic body is exploring the possibility of constructing two more flyovers  at Esplanade and Ballygunge Phari  at a total cost of Rs 50 crore. 																								The one at Ballygunge Phari will connect Birla Mandir to the Pantaloons store.																								An extra arm will descend on to Hazra Road.																								While the Park Street flyover will take care of the rush at the Park Street-Chowringhee crossing, a mini flyover, stretching from Peerless Inn to Bentinck Street will help ease the traffic load at Chowringhees intersection with Lenin Sarani and SN Banerjee Road.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has approached three city-based builders to submit draft plans for the flyovers. 																								The flyovers at Gariahat and Park Street are not enough. Unless complementary flyovers are built, the traffic flow cannot be substantially improved, the mayor explained on Friday.																								He said the northern end of the Park Street flyover should have been extended to the Bentinck Street-CR Avenue crossing.

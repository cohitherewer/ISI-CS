Born 15th January, 1914
Died 5th May, 1957
Aged 43 years.These were the simple words on one of the gravestones at the Jewish cemetery at 45, Narkeldanga Main Road. But on Wednesday morning, the marker was set aside while the grave was dug up to retrieve the remains of the man who passed away 47 years ago.																								The reason: his familys wish to bury him back home in Israel.																								My elder sister Georgina burst into tears when I told her last night that our fathers remains would be dug up today, because its actually the day daddy died, were the emotional words from Elizabeth Yirmiyahu at the Jewish cemetery. Shes the only one who actually remembers him, because she was seven years old when he died.																								The 47-year-old and her husband David caught the images on camera as the grave was dug to six feet under, the cement slabs covering the body were removed and his remains were placed in a wooden box, wrapped in plastic.																								Elizabeth recalled memories of her childhood in Calcutta, where her father lived and died. Elijah Daniels widow and five children had migrated to Israel in 1970. His remains will be buried there when Elizabeth returns on May 11.

 Lee rehearses with Roy at her Ho Chi Minh Sarani home. Picture by Pabitra DasWoman power on the edge Their prettily-furnished verandah at 5, Ho Chi Minh Sarani, overlooking a manicured lawn, is where US consul-general George N. Sibley lounges around in his spare time with wife Lee-Alison. But for the past few weeks, the lady of the house has been spending most of her morning hours there couched in a settee, rekindling a passion that had lit up her life many years ago.The couple that met and fell in love through theatre in the US will come together on stage after several seasons  and for the first time in Calcutta  with a Spandan presentation, Women on the Edge, in August.Only this time, Lee, also the director of the production, will help her husband with valuable tips to play the perfect Stanley Kowalski (or should we say Marlon Brando), in A Street Car Named Desire.The four-piece collage  consisting of a scene each from Euripedes Medea and Tennessee Williams A Street Car Named Desire, Bubbles Sabharwals Runaways and Nag Bodas The Divorce  has been conceived by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. With Lee and Renu Roy playing the two lead roles in all four acts, Women on the Edge debuts at Tollygunge Club on August 6. Women on the Edge is about women spanning the millennia... About how their basic problems remain the same despite the change in time and place and how they deal with situations like betrayal, violence, illnesses and being trapped in a tricky circumstance, explains Lee, whom the city also knows as a Rabindrasangeet singer. George is always very busy, but he has promised to take some time out for the rehearsals. He plays the narrator, the judge in The Divorce and Stanley Kowalski in the Tennessee Williams play. I think the ladies will enjoy him doing a Marlon Brando in a T-shirt, laughs Lee, picking out the script and her husbands rehearsal schedule from a sheaf of papers. And I think I almost love directing more than acting, confesses Lee.The four pieces have been chosen after a lot of reading and research, reveals Roy. Lee was looking for plays that contained strong two-women scenes. We considered several plays by Shakespeare, Eugene ONeil, Shirley Valentine and some Indian writers. Finally, we settled for these four which portray two women under great duress, she explains.And how has it been rehearsing with the consul-generals wife? She hasnt yelled at me even once during the rehearsals! confides Roy.The first piece shows Medea avenging the betrayal by her husband, the second finds Blanche DuBois reeling under the effect of a violent Stanley, the third features two women meeting in a bus, and the fourth revolves around a woman who appeals for divorce after her husbands death.Theres a twist in every turn of the tale and Lee has accentuated the varied moods with a medley of background music. A Greek-like rendition will support Medea, while A Street Car... has been set to jazz pieces by Louis Armstrong. A Tagore tune sung by Lee has been kept aside for Runaways, while the fourth score is something the debut director chooses to keep as a surprise.After the Tollygunge Club show, Women on the Edge will take the stage on August 7 and 8 at GD Birla Sabhagar. Reshmi SenguptaTailored to taste, kurti or capriSmart capris and georgette drapes for the girl. Linen shirts and trendy suits for the guy. The yet-untitled biggest-budget commercial film to roll out of the Shri Venkatesh stable finds lead pair Koel and Jeet sporting a cool new look.City-based designer Agnimitra Paul has chalked out a whole range of neat, non-fussy costumes that blend with the roles the two play. For Koel, who needs two distinct looks for a double role, Agnimitra has stitched together separate Indian and western trousseau.In the first half, Koel is a typical Indian girl and I have given her bright churidars and short kurtas with very little embroidery. A couple of georgettes will also feature but with very unusual drapes. When she turns trendy, Koel is only into dungarees, capris, kurtis and blouses, says Agnimitra, who has been helped by makeup artiste Prabir Kumar De to create a well-defined look for the dashing duo.The first brush with celluloid costume, for Agnimitra, came with Koi Mere Dil Se Puchhe, where she did a couple of costumes for Esha Deol. The salwar suits in white and peach were mine, she points out.The 30-something designer, trained in BILAMS, also does the personal Indo-western clothing for Sridevi. I met her through a friend and showed her some of my samples. She liked them very much and ever since has been picking up my kurtis, tight churidars and dupattas. Though Sridevi prefers saris, she carries off western clothes very well, too, reveals Agnimitra.Back home at 11, Gurusaday Road, Agnimitra has just started retailing from her studio, thanks to a growing customer base. Apart from a steady stream of individual buyers, comprising quite a team of Tollywood stars, Agnimitra supplies to Espee in Calcutta, Oorja and Elahi in Hyderabad, Folio in Bangalore and Melange in Mumbai. Picture by Pabitra DasAmong home-town actresses, she does a thing or three for Debasree Roy, Raima and Riya Sen, Indrani Dutta and Rituparna Sengupta. I am quite fond of Agnimitras clothes and often buy her kurtis and salwar suits, says Debasree.Though kurtas, short tops and skirts are her forte, Agnimitra also works on saris, especially georgettes and crepes that cling to the body. All in the game: Koel Mullicks on a rollCool white dungaree, bright yellow bandana, glossy wet lips, strings of pleated hair. Balancing a colourful basketball, Koel Mullick gears up for her shooting schedule later this month with a smashing Sporty Spice act. I love the Indo-western clothes Agnimitra has designed for me in this film and plan to pick up some stuff for personal use as well, chirps the rising Tollywood star. What with the right hint of shadow and a dab of blush-on, Koel is ready to roll with a squeaky-clean look for her trendy girl role.

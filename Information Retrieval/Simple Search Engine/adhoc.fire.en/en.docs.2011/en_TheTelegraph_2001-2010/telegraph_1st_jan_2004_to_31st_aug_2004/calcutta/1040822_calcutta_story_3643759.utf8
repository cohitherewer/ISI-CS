The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 22, 2004 Play with pride against tide
Calcutta Swimming Club (16), English Sergeants Institute (0)  read the scoreline at a waterpolo match sometime in the early 1900s, when a bunch of British soldiers in transit landed in choppy waters of this traditional city bastion of water sports.For over a hundred years now, the heritage institution on Strand Road has kept the sport afloat in Calcutta. The high point of the entire week for a growing band of young and old enthusiasts  members and children  is Sunday morning, when they can hit the pool and make a splash.Rain or shine, we are always there by 11. We cant imagine a Sunday without a game of waterpolo at CSC, says Anish Gupta, who along with the likes of Milon Roy, Kamal Bhandari and Bharat Toolsidass (the oldest player-member at 47), has been instrumental in keeping the waterpolo flag flying.Over the decades on either side of Independence, the game thrived at CSC thanks to the patronage of expatriate members. From the 70s through the early 90s, it was buoyed by Christian Minderhood, a Dutch national, Manabu Chikumoto, a Japanese expat, and Shashank Shush Kocher.There was a period in the mid-90s when waterpolo nearly dried up at CSC because there werent enough playing members around. But fortunately, over the past five-six years, there has been a fresh wave of enthusiasm among the younger members, observes Toolsidass. So, from the babe in the pool Varun Bhandari, 10, to other youngsters like Vedant Gupta, Mihir and Mayank Sanganeria, Rachit Mehta and Shivam Varma, all are keen to keep the game going.While we have enough players to field two teams of equal strength, other clubs often struggle to stitch together a single playing outfit, laments club president Nandu Belani. Thus, at the annual Tollygunge Inter-Club Challenge Trophy, an exhibition tie featuring CSC versus the Rest, the club often gets a walkover, since others cant field a team.Tollygunge Club, Saturday Club and Calcutta Club, the others in the fray, find it tough to show up with a full contingent these days, says Gupta, who cant imagine missing the Sunday action, even if he is sidelined with a fractured foot.We will do everything possible to keep the game flowing. A Friday night experiment under floodlights has proved successful and we might make it a regular fixture on every last Friday of the month. CSC would also like to host an inter-club meet in future. To start with, we can kick off an intra-club league, since there are enough waterpolo die-hards in our ranks, the president declares.

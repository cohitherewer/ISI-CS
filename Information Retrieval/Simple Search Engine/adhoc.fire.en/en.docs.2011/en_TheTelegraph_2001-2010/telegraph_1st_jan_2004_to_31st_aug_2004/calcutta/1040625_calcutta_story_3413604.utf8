 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Seat shortage shade on glee
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The mood in some of Calcuttas better-known schools was upbeat on Thursday, in view of the achievements of their students in Madhyamik 2004. 																								But even in these schools, a large number of students, who have scored high marks, feared a crisis of seats in Class XI, in view of the rise in the number of first divisions against last years figure, and also an increased number of star-holders (students obtaining 75 per cent and above).																								What is very special about our result is that nearly 45 per cent of our students have obtained more than 80 per cent marks. We are proud but at the same time concerned because we may not be able to accommodate many of our own high-performers in Class XI. The overall performance of students has been better this year, said Jayati Solomon, principal, South Point School.																								The school sent up 850 candidates for Madhyamik this time, of whom 787 have scored 60 per cent and above. Sixty-two of them have bagged second divisions (above 50 per cent) and only a single third division.																								South Point, with 350 seats in its science stream this year, has fixed 700 marks in aggregate for its own students to seek an application form for admission. For outsiders and students from other boards, the requirement is higher. One of the best performers is a student of this school, who has obtained 771 out of 800.																								Like South Point, many other prominent Madhyamik schools have been forced to increase the cut-off percentage for admission of students to Higher Secondary. 																								Carmel Convent, where the success rate is high, has fixed 560 as the cut-off mark for its own students for admission to the science stream. For non-Carmelites, the requirement is even higher.																								St Lawrence had sent up 120 students for the exam. Seventy-six of them were placed in first division, and 29 of them have scored 75 per cent and above. School sources say students scoring less than 75 per cent will hardly get a chance to bag a berth in Class XI there. 																								Kanak Kanti Pariah, headmaster of Jadavpur Vidyapith, said: We will distribute forms to students securing a minimum of 540 marks and above. But I dont think there is any chance for a student who has scored less than 85 per cent to manage a seat in my institution.

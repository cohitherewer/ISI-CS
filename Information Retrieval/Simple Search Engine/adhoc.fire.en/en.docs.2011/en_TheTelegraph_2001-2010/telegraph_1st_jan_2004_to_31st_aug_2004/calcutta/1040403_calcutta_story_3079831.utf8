The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Poll alibi to delay rein-rally regimen
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								First politics, then the polls. After blaming the lack of political consensus for the initial failure to formulate a rally-restriction plan, the state government is now using the Lok Sabha polls as the pushback plank.																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Friday prayed for more time from the Calcutta High Court to encrypt and enforce a rally code for the city.																								According to the submission, the government thought it unwise to restrict rallies in the run-up to the May 10 election. The division bench hearing the matter granted the prayer and adjourned the matter till mid-May.																								When the appeal filed by the government against the rally-restrict order of Justice Amitava Lala had come up for hearing a fortnight ago, the state had said it was drawing up a plan to restrict rallies, but had been slowed down by the lack of consensus in some political quarters.																								Justice Lala, on September 30, 2003, had directed Calcutta Police not to allow rallies on city streets between 8 am and 8 pm on working days.																								On Friday, advocate-general Balai Ray told the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee that the police were busy managing pre-election matters.																								 The regulations for restricting rallies in Calcutta will have to be implemented by the city police chief. By May 15, the Lok Sabha election will be over. After the elections, our government will take up the matter with city police, said Ray.																								This, according to legal circles, is a bid by the government to win a breather till the polls are over and allow it to try and convince some players  like the Trinamul Congress and SUCI  to toe the rally-restrict line.																								The advocate-general had earlier informed the court that a meeting convened by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to reach an all-party consensus on prohibition of weekday rallies had failed due to some notable absentees. 																								Ray, however, had assured the court the government was sure that those reluctant today would see reason tomorrow.																								Some union leaders of the left camp are openly saying that if the government imposes any kind of ban on rallies on city streets, they will oppose it, said a Writers Buildings source. The government cannot take the chance of an internal conflict over the rally issue before the polls. So, the time-out tactic.

What takes up most of her time these days is the Mahila Sanskritik Sammelan, an organisation concerned with the social and economic development of women and children. Biswas joined the body after returning to the city.																								The organisation functions out of a building on Prince Anwar Shah Road. A school for streetchildren, with around 25 kids, has them learning the languages and elementary mathematics, apart from lessons in drawing and singing. There is also a sewing centre in the same building where stitching is taught to women. Soon, computer courses are also scheduled to begin.

She is a Rotarian, a member of the National Federation of Indian Women and also finds time for the Consumer Action Forum.																								Born in erstwhile East Pakistan, Biswas, like so many others of her generation, crossed the border during Partition and came to Calcutta. She had begun her studies there and continued them in the city. Later, she taught at various city schools, including Kamala Girls and Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan. She was also an active member of All Bengal Teachers Association in those days.																								In 1957, she left the city for a course in social work at Pennsylvania University in the US. After completing the course, she travelled back and forth between India and the US. Between 1963 and 1968, she was involved with the UP governments Planning Research and Action Insitute, working in over 225 villages.																								In 1997, Biswas took up a teaching position at Lock Haven University in the US. She was to spend almost the next two decades there. The social work never stopped though.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Victoria ponies bleed Helsinki heart
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Kati Pulli at Ashari, the animal hospital																								The sorry plight of the Victoria Memorial ponies has pained them. As has the often indifferent attitude to stray dogs on the streets of Calcutta. One found the Kalighat temple a real scary experience, while her friend couldnt help crying as Shah Rukh Khan kept sinking in Kal Ho Naa Ho.																								Nonetheless, for both Kati Pulli and Johanna Parviainer, there are mostly pleasant memories to ferry back home from a city where they have made more friends than they would have bargained for when they boarded that plane from Helsinki.																								While 24-year-old Kati has completed four years in vet school at the University of Helsinki and in her final year, is seeking practical exposure to tropical animal ailments, like the foot-and-mouth disease, Johanna, a year older, has completed her course in vet-specific nursing at the Institute of Paijanne.																								Their agenda met at a common point  to work with an animal welfare organisation in Calcutta while soaking in the sights, sounds and essence of the vibrant city. Ashari, the animal hospital of People for Animals on the Bypass, offered a tailor-made rendezvous for the two Finnish women, who have worked together as volunteers for Society for Protection of Animals in Helsinki and Rights for Animals.																								I have always wanted to be a vet and this extended stint in Calcutta (she arrived after Christmas, following learning tenures in South Africa and Zimbabwe) has been a most enriching experience, declares Kati, who loves to travel and check out regional cuisine. People are nice and warm here, but she wishes the Victoria ponies got a better deal.																								Animal welfare is never divorced from human welfare and if those people are earning their livelihood from the horses, they should try and make life a little easier for those mute, hapless creatures, appeals Kati. 																								The veterinary student, who also expresses concern over poor sterilisation protocols during surgical procedures here, has compiled an advisory report, which, among other things, suggests oral rabies vaccination in the border areas for civet cats and foxes.																								For Johanna, who was laid low by a stomach bug shortly after she arrived, lifes philosophy has changed post-Calcutta. In spite of all the chaos and poverty, I have felt safe here and the ability of the people to stay cheerful amidst such adversity has taught me not to whine about small wants when I get back home, she smiles.																								Kati, who has been around the globe quite a bit, agrees there is great inherent vitality in Calcutta, which sets this city apart. Her commitment to voluntary work for shelter-less animals takes her to Nepal next. Health permitting, she wants to travel back home without using airplanes, via Tibet, China, Mongolia and Russia.																								If I feel up to it, I hope to catch a glimpse of wild Mongolian horses (her perennial dream) on the trans-Siberian train ride from Beijing to Moscow, from where I can take another train home to Helsinki, Kati says, fingers firmly crossed.

 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 Italian pizzazz past pasta 
 Shaun Kenworthy demonstrates his culinary skills at The Park, Lots of chiffon rustled at the Pine Hall at The Park as a select crowd of women gathered for a brush with Italian cuisine on Saturday. Chef Shaun Kenworthy, executive chef of the hotel, hosted one of his popular cookery classes for the members of Preferred at The Park.																								The exotic five-course meal that the expert chef dished out in a jiffy went on to prove that Italian food is not all about pizzas and pastas. The culinary class started with Quaglinos Mushrooms on Toast, one of the best-selling items at the Quaglinos, a celebrated restaurant in the UK where the chef had worked for some time.																								This was followed by the recipe of Panzanella, a salad of tomatoes, onion, red capsicum, doused in balsamic vinegar with basil leaves, olive oil and tossed with chunks of day-old bread. The Gem Lettuce with Croutons and Blue Cheese Dressing is another exotic salad he made simple.																								An Italian meal, after all, is not complete without pasta and for the main course Shaun presented his recipe of Farfarle with Smoked Duck, Chilli, Lemon and Caper Berries. He followed this up with grilled Salmon with Soft Polenta and Gremolata.																								When it comes to ending a meal on a sweet note, no one knows it better than Shaun (the innovative range of desserts at all the Park restaurants is proof enough). He shared the recipes of two traditional Italian desserts called Summer Fruit Zabaglione and Ginger Snap, Orange, Mango and Mascarpone Trifle.The one-hour session was punctuated with some handy kitchen tips from the master chef, who also made sure the audience was kept entertained with his one-liners. The women, on their part, lapped up every word. Said Sayantani Moitra, one of the participants: Seeing the chef cook up the delicacies was an enjoyable experience in itself. Though some of the ingredients he used might not be available readily and one might have to look for substitutes, it was a learning experience. Delicacies from the new menu at Sonargaon. Pictures by Rashbehari DasBreaking bread Sonargaon, the Indian speciality restaurant at The Taj, has gone through its first major overhaul since it opened 14 years ago. Keeping the rustic ambience  a winner with its loyalists  intact, the five-star dining destination has changed around 70 per cent of its menu, as well as redesigned its service style.																								Regulars will see that some things have changed in terms of dcor. For one, there are two show windows.																								Behind the first  the Roti Counter  two ladies sit, making everything from kulchas to phulkas.																								Behind the second window is the Fish Market. The days catch is on ice, for patrons to take a look at before choosing what fish they want, with a number of options available in terms of preparation. Another novel feature is that the seafood is sold by gram. If a couple comes and chooses a small fish, the bill would be decided by the quantity, rather than a fixed price, explains Yuvraj Johar, executive assistant manager, food and beverage.																								The menu has retained many of the old favourites, like Dal Sonargaon, Kakori Kebab and the Hara Tawa Kebab. But a fatigue factor had crept in for regulars in terms of the food and the service, says executive chef Surinder Singh. So, keeping in mind the emerging culinary trends, the old restaurant tries to learn a few new tricks. The show windows are the closest the place could come to interactive kitchens, with the ducts not equipped to deal with the kind of smoke generated in an open kitchen.																								The food has also been redesigned along healthier lines. We have moved away from the heavy cashew and full-cream kind of cooking to lighter food, adds Singh. Selections can be cooked in olive oil on request. To make those who eat out frequently feel at home, phulkas have been added to the list of breads, on popular demand.																								A lot of thought has clearly gone into the revamp, which is the product of eight months planning. I probably made between 700 and 800 items of which 70 to 80 were finally chosen, reveals Singh. 																								There are also suggestions about the kind of imported wines which would complement particular dishes.																								The layered service style ensures there is always action at the table. From the welcoming Chana Shorba to the elaborate tray of achaars to the closing paan platter, there are a number of add-ons.																								Of all the new items  and there are plenty of tempting treats to try out (the kebabs as good as ever)  there is one hands-down winner: the Bailleys Kulfi. The generous dose of Irish Cream will ensure that Sonargaon is one place that this traditional dessert will never be taken for granted. The summer special spread at Kalash. Picture by Rashbehari DasSoft spiceThose of you who thought traditional North Indian food was too spicy for the summer months, its time for a rethink. The Hotel Hindusthan International is hosting a Summer Special Food Festival, the highlight of which is extremely non-spicy Indian food. The festival started recently at Kalash, the Indian speciality restaurant, and will be on for the entire season.																								Says Aftab Khan, executive chef (Indian), HHI: The dishes we have introduced for the summer are specially marinated with certain herbs and dahi to suit the seasons palate. That Mughlai food is not necessarily too hot and spicy for this weather is the point they are out to prove.																								The dishes that have been introduced include a variety of kebabs, like the Dahi Kebab (a blend of hung yoghurt and gramflour), Fish Kesari Tikka (chunks of fish specially flavoured with saffron), Murg Tikka Malai (skewered chunks of chicken marinated in cream and spices) and many more.																								In the main course, a special addition for the season is the Murg Lasooni Biryani, which doesnt leave you feeling heavy in the stomach like the usual biryani. This is served with a special Purani Raita, a garlic flavoured raita, which, apparently, aids digestion.																								Theres Gosht-e-Aftab, a mutton delicacy created by the chef and named after him, Khandani Paneer (cottage cheese cooked in saffron gravy), Dal-e-Kalash (North Indian lentil cooked with cream and fenugreek) and others. These go well with Lachcha Paratha, light and with very little oil, something you wont get anywhere in Calcutta, according to chef Aftab. All the dishes are priced between Rs 120 and Rs 250, with the prawn items priced at Rs 450.																								So, if you want to pamper your taste buds during the sultry afternoons or sweltering evenings, you now know where to head for.

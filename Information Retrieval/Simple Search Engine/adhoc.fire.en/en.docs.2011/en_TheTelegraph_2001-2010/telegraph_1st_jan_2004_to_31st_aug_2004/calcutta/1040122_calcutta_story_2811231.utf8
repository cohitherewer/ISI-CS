The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Return to roots with BPO buzz
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Transforming an investment of $2,50,000 into a $53 million company in around four years, city boy Oney Seal, 34, has shown what entrepreneurship is all about. Today, his company, Databazaar, ranks among the fastest growing companies in the US and also features in The Wall Street Journals Top 75 praiseworthy e-commerce companies. 																								But Seal wants to grow bigger and after setting up an organisation that has offices in the US, India and Hong Kong, he is ready to tread into new areas of technology business. 																								We are expanding our operations in India and will be hiring over 200 people for our business process outsourcing (BPO) business, says Seal, who did his MBA from University of Florida after graduating in commerce from St Xaviers College in 1991. He worked for eight years in Distributors Express, the third largest distribution company in the US before embarking on his own venture.																								Databazaar is a technology distribution and services company, which sells computer and printer supplies in over 23 countries, both physically and electronically. For round-the-clock customer service, the company has a captive BPO division with its office in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). 																								But now we will be offering BPO solutions to other companies as well and we have already roped in a number of clients, adds Seal, now based in Miami. The BPO business will be kicked off by the end of February and the south Calcutta boy has already set an ambitious target for the company. 																								We will take the number to 500 in the next 12 to 18 months and expect to generate over $25 million from our BPO business, he rolls out the growth plan. 																								But not just a typical call centre with inbound and outbound call facilities, the company promises to offer a host of value-added services to its clients.																								Databazaar is not pitching for projects from the big league of Fortune 1000 companies and is, instead, looking at a niche market and setting up a boutique BPO. As Seal explains: In todays economy mid-size and smaller US companies have a crushing need to outsource and thats why we are targeting the small and medium sector. 																								This strategy will in no way add more fuel to the fire against outsourcing, assures Seal.

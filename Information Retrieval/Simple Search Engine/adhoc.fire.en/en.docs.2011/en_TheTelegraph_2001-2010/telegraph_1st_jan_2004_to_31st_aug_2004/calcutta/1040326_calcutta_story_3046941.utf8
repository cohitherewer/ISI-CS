 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Husband hired hitmen
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The day after Soma De, 32, was found murdered and mutilated in the bedroom of her highrise apartment at Dunlop, Belghoria, police arrested husband Satyajit. He was accused of plotting the murder that was carried out by professional killers.																								Hers was a violent death, said Ashoke Sinha Roy, officer-in-charge of Belghoria police station on Thursday. She had been set up by her own husband, which she, perhaps, did not realise till she had allowed the killers into her apartment on Tuesday night.																								A reconstruction of the crime, on the basis of a statement made by Satyajit, alias Gopal, threw light on the sordid consequences of a messy marriage.																								It took the three killers around 15 minutes to slash Somas wrists before strangling her, slitting her throat and severing her arms, police said.																								We have identified the killers. They belong to the neighbourhood and are in hiding now, said Sinha Roy.																								Preliminary investigation suggested the killers gained entry into the apartment between 9.30 pm and 9.50 pm, when Satyajit had taken their four-year-old daughter Ishani to a local physiotherapists chamber as an alibi.																								Police, however, are not sure whether Soma was killed in the kitchen or in the bedroom, where her mutilated body was found. There was blood in the kitchen, suggesting that she had been first attacked there.																								Satyajit, on Thursday, made contradictory statements to throw sleuths off track.																								According to an officer on the case, De may have been instigated by someone to plot the crime, but it was not clear whether he had hired the killers himself or had depended on someone to plot the strike.																								De, however, had confessed that part of the plan was to murder his wife and chop her body into pieces, put them in a bag and dump it at some place far away from the neighbourhood.																								Somas body was found with her arms severed, suggesting that things had gone according to the plan till that point.																								Daughter Ishani  who was the last to see Soma alive as she went into the kitchen to announce to her mother that she was going out with her father  was also questioned by the cops on Thursday.																								Like on Wednesday, she told the sleuths that she was watching television on Tuesday night when her father came into her room to tell her about a pain in the leg and asked her to accompany him to the physiotherapist.																								With her mother falling victim to a diabolical plot and her father the prime accused, the four-year-old is now under the care of her paternal uncle.

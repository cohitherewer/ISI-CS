 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 World yoga meet ticket for booth-owners son
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Saubhik Manna, an 11-year-old, is headed for Madrid this October. The son of a public telephone booth-owner will represent India in the World Yoga Competition starting on October 13. 																								The boy, who has been practising yoga since age five, bagged a gold medal at the All India Yoga Competition at Chennai in February which earned him his passport to international action. 																								On Tuesday at Writers Buildings, he was handed a cheque for Rs 10,000 by sports minister Subhas Chakraborty as assistance for participation in the event. Due to our cash crunch for the past two years, we have a very conservative attitude when it comes to sponsoring trips abroad, Chakraborty admitted after handing over the cheque. But Saubhik is full of promise and was sent to me by the chief minister himself. We will extend further help in case the family needs it, he said.																								The boy and his parents also met the chief minister, who wished him luck for the October event. He (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) is very interested in yoga, said an official at Writers Buildings, especially in its use as a tool for maintenance of health. 																								On receiving the amount, Anup Manna, Saubhiks father, looked a relieved man. We have almost put together my sons passage money. A private firm has agreed to sponsor his trip. But the family is still worried about his coach Utpal Roys travel expenses.

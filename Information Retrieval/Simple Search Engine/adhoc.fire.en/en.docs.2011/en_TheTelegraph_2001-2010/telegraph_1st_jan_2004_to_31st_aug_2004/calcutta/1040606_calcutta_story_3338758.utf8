The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 06, 2004 Friday house on fire 
 The beat is on: DJs Pearl and Nikhil at Tantra and (below) actors Reema Sen and Soha Ali Khan at the same venue. Pictures by Rashbehari Das A woman DJ at the console is always an interesting departure. Besides playing good music, she adds a touch of glam to the generally male-dominated occupation. 																								Add to that a VJ-turned-DJ who women adore, and youve got all the right ingredients for a Friday night blast. And DJ Pearl, with VJ-DJ Nikhil Chinnappa did just that. 																								We make a great pair behind the console, said the master prankster flaunting a T-shirt with neon writing. I open the show with funky, soulful house music and then sweet looking, petite Pearl just takes over and shocks the life out of everyone with some hard progressive house. 																								A 10.45 pm deadline is what Nikhil had given himself by which to start playing, but Calcuttas party people decided to keep him waiting for a while longer. By about 11.15, the floor was beginning to get choked and the bar was over-flowing. Just right to turn up the faders and pump in the music. 																								Ive got music from all over the world just for you guys, announced Nikhil, in his effort to educate a happy crowd with the latest in international music (though met with little excitement). 																								When DJ Pearl, who has trained in Amsterdam and played in a host of party destinations across the globe, came in flaunting her shiny bustier, the Friday fever shot up. Among the known faces were actors Ayub Khan and Deboleena Dutt. A hoard of US Consulate officials dropped by to get a taste of international music as well.																								Tracks hot off the London charts are what Calcutta heard and danced to as the duo jammed on the turntables and sent the city high on house. They have been playing at Smirnoff events across the country as a pair and will be rocking Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune after this. 																								Having started DJing a year-and-a-half ago, Nikhil is already at home with his new-found profession, almost as comfortable as his original love  VJing. But its difficult to convince people that I can also play serious music. Since they are always used to seeing me cracking jokes and acting funny, most people think I cant have brains enough to be able to play music, smiled Nikhil. 																								Does Calcutta feel that way? Well, Nikhil knows best. Winners, tooCalcutta on Friday was flooded with music from London and celebrity DJs. If Tantra was boasting of a deadly duo, Winning Streak, the sports bar, could not let it be a one-man show on the town. It roped in DJ Ivan to rock the floor. 																								With the promise of similar kinds of tunes (new music from London and lots of fun with house) from DJs at both nightclubs, the electronica-happy Calcuttan had plenty to choose from.																								With a few pegs down in the system and the clock ticking well past midnight, the clubber was making the most of the options on hand. I have come here to hear Ivan play, said Rohit Singh, a regular in the party circuit, hopping over to Winning Streak after a stint at Tantra. Im here to check out the crowd, but I will go back to hear Pearl and Nikhil. I think theyre doing a great job, gushed Kushal Kothari, not at all bothered by this problem of plenty. 																								Though Ivan visits Calcutta every three months or so, his fans still dont seem to be getting enough of his music. I play no Hindi music at all, so that is like a welcome change for many, said Ivan, who opened his evening with funky house and went on to more aggressive music as the night progressed. 																								Just back from London two weeks ago, Ivan showed off some of the new music hes picked up on his trip. Now, not only does Calcutta party longer, there are more people who party and are more open to new sounds, he added. So for one Friday night, Calcutta gave remixes a miss and, from what we hear, no one was complaining too loudly.Its the time to disco																								 Why should only adults have the right to party? This weekend Bachcha Party, a kids-only event held at three clubs, kept the tiny dynamos busy. 																								Party-hoppers hung out at Tolly Club on Friday evening, while the action shifted to Calcutta Swimming Club and RCGC on Saturday and Sunday.																								The show started with talented young dancers setting the tone to the same chart-busters that can be heard at discos around town. The audience members, from five to 10 years, were seeing much the same things as their dads and moms might at a night at Tantra.																								DJ Akash was next in line, churning out music for the little ones. I had fun. The kids energy compels you to put in your best, said Akash, set to play at six bachcha parties through the month. 																								Two lovely anchors, Sakshi and Rhea, navigated the enthusiastic audience through the show. Magician Sandeep kept them busy, as did a brief session on manners at parties and a sit-and-draw competition. 																								We thought of this as a way to keep children busy during their summer holidays, said Gurpreet Sethi, one of the organisers.

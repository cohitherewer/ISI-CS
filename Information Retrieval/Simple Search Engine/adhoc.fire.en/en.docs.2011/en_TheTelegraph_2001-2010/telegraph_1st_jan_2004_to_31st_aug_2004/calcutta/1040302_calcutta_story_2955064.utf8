	AN EYE ON CALCUTTA 
	KIRAN UTTAM GHOSH																																																																																																																											I spent a relaxed evening this weekend catching up with women friends. Theres something special about women friends. Something about spirit, confidence and femininity that glues the girls together. 																																																				And theres something different about todays woman. I see her all over Calcutta. Shes comfortable being herself, whoever she may be. The latest hip word to replace the metrosexual man is the contrasexual woman. The aggressive, in-your-face woman. I dont quite agree with that perspective. She was oh! So Nineties. But I dont see her. Neither does Ektaa Kapoor who seems to have her pulse on the archetypal woman. Instead, what I see all around me, wherever I go in Calcutta, are women who wear their comfort on their cholis, a subtle style on their sleeves. The psychograph mercifully straddles all ages. After all, this is more about innate attitude, isnt it? So this genre embraces mothers, journalists, teachers, even grandmothers. 																																																				Its about Uma Ahmed, whose elegance is her hallmark; Bharti Deveshwar, who can hold her own anywhere; Lipika Majumdar Roy Choudhury, commissioner of customs (preventive) with her unruffled competence and zest for living; and of course, Aarti Oberoi, whos taught me the spirit of celebrating life. Spirited, gung-ho, multifaceted, I thought Id write about some of Calcuttas women whose lives touched mine, in the last few weeks. Models live it up at the Shisha bar  one of the few hangouts in town that has special evenings devoted to women only and (above) one of the paintings from the Chittrovanu Mazumdar exhibition at Uma				 														Entirely in tune Most of us know her as bari maa. Salt and pepper elegance, crisp white and beige cottons, Bimla Poddar embodies the spirit and dignity of the Calcutta woman who is traditional yet a visionary. And shes truly a daughter of the city. She came to Calcutta, a bride of 13. Her passion for classical music blossomed over the years. After her husband passed away, it was music where she found her solace. A meeting with Girija Devi brought forth the idea of Gulab Bari, a musical evening that has grown from a small gathering of 50 people in the 1980s to over 1,000 today. A personalised note goes out to each one of us unfailingly every year. 																																																			Flower power  																																																				If marriages are made in heaven, the most heavenly flower arrangements are made in Calcutta. My planner, for the last two months, was sequinned with wedding invitations. Two things struck me about Calcuttas biyebaari scene. One, the city continues to feel apologetic about wearing its heart on its sleeve. The colours of choice are greys, maroons, browns. Is that inspired by the citys most visible bird, the sparrow? And if there is colour, it is something garish. As predictable as last nights weather. 																																																				But what struck me this year was that Calcuttas weddings have really blossomed with gorgeous flower decorations. The name behind most of those that interested me was Baisakhi Ghosh. And this is no theory of relativity. Shes been around, prettying flowers for the Park Hotel, The Taj Bengal and the ITC Sonar Bangla. Theres an Alice in Wonderland kind of feeling behind her creations. I watched amazed, last week, a mandap made of blown glass and wild orchids, almost as if the heavens were showering flowers. Hers isnt the Ikebana style of measured inspiration. Im not a flower person, but theres something special about this one. 																																																			Old is gold  																																																				What makes a gentle, unassuming and beautiful woman, walk the untrodden path alone? Her passion for the past. Its an ardor Ive seldom met for a subject most of us take for granted. Its a fervour that makes her visit a museum gallery more than 30 times. Reshmi Chatterjee has a Swabhumi store called, Halo Heritage. There, you can pick up artefacts that date as far back as the 5th century BC and its all legit. Trained in museology, Reshmi Chatterjees is the first recognised and authorised outlet in India for museum-branded pieces. Quite apt for this soft-spoken, articulate woman to start in Calcutta, you think, when she tells you that there are more than 30 museums in this city! The models, made out of POP or fibreglass, and out of stone dust or metal on request, are excellent copies. One woman whos making history while shes promoting it. 																																																			Heart and craft  																																																				We bring home the products, but how many of us give a thought to the woman behind the Sasha success story? Armed with degrees in economics and business management, Roopa Mehta could have been pushing up the bottomline in some bank. Instead, since 1981, the executive director of Sasha has brought hope to more than 5,000 craftspersons, taking its turnover to Rs 4 crore. She and her committed team have revived dying crafts, empowered artisans to take on entrepreneurial initiatives, and taught them skills that turned craft into hope. Things can get only better, now that theyve worked out the heart and craft of the matter.																																																			Then theres the men  																																																				Behind every successful woman, theres a man. This city has its share of men who support the spirit of Calcuttas women. Like Aditya Kanoi and Nitin Kohli whose Shisha bars womens evening gives us our own space. Or golf pro Indrajit Bhalotia who takes time to teach us golf. Or Prabir De, who spends hours making our women look beautiful. 																																																			On the run  																																																				Shortly after the Mumbai marathon, Calcutta held its second. I picked up the phone, since I wanted to run for my city, to be told, this race was only for men. They said I could come and watch. I was appalled. In this century! Is feminism on the run in Calcutta? 																																																			Brilliant strokes 																																																				If theres one man who is as spirited as the ladies of Calcutta, it is the fiesty Chittrovanu Mazumdar. On a day when I thought I couldnt spare more than a few minutes for food, I ended up being mesmerised for an hour and a half at a brilliant contemporary art and installation exhibition by him. Im told he doesnt deal with narratives. His work tells no tales, and so, theres a freedom of interpretation. His first solo after six or seven years, this one was thanks to the Seagull Foundation at Uma. The venue, again, is brilliant. Uma, the brainchild of Tanya Sinha, aspires to be a flexible cultural space. What makes it versatile and unique, is that an old bungalow, every cranny of which sighs with memories, encourages the visitor to meander through and into the garden. 																																																				And Chittrovanu, who painted the walls in brilliant colours such as red, indigo blue and black, said it all on one of his paintings, Silence lit...and light made silent. One sensed a restlessness. While hes worked with three senses  sight, sound and touch  on mediums including metal, acrylic and computer prints on film, gilt frames, rubber sheets and industrial material juxtapose in a collage of complete opposites. Sound was an integral part of the installations: one room was almost like a shrine where you picked up sounds of breathing. I couldnt figure out whether the sounds were human or mechanical, and yet one could identify Paul Celans voice reciting his poetry. Just how evocative it was comes through when they told me, while installing it, the workers were so awed, they removed their shoes. An old house, the three senses alerted, a certain disquiet in the work. I could almost feel a presence. I couldnt resist but reach out to a crushed fabric dividing spaces for tangible reassurance. I loved it.

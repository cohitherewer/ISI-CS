 A STAFF REPORTER																								A subsidised clinical investigation scheme is in the pipeline for two million slum-dwellers, the largest votebank in the city. Initially, all pathological tests, ECG, blood pressure assessment, malaria detection and Manteaux tests will be provided at the barest minimum price. 																								The project is a collective venture of the slum development wing of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) with pathological clinics, Rotary and Lions clubs, NGOs and local clubs, explained mayoral council member (environment and slum development) Javed Ahmed Khan.																								The citys overall health was largely dependent upon the health of its slum-dwellers, he pointed out on Tuesday. There are 572 registered slums in the city, in which 36 per cent of its 5.5 million population live. Of them, Darapara bustee, in east Calcutta, inhabited by 35,000-plus people and spread over 250 bighas, is considered the biggest.																								According to the draft proposal of the scheme, which awaits mayor Subrata Mukherjees nod after his return from abroad, local clubs or resource persons in the slums will act as receiving centres for pathological samples to be tested. The CMCs slum development wing will deploy three vehicles to collect samples from the receiving centres and take them to pathological clinics.																								Ten clinics have agreed to cooperate with the CMC and they are ready to train resource persons on how to draw blood to prepare slides and measure blood pressure. A resource person will get a commission of Re 1 for every sample collected.																								The tentative rates for clinical tests, as discussed by the CMC, Lions Club Sanjeevani and several pathological clinics will be:  Blood sugar: Rs 10 Malaria test: Rs 5 Tests to detect jaundice or B-coli: Rs 5 each ECG: Rs 20 Blood pressure checks: Rs 2.																								Lack of civic amenities, high density of population, poverty, lack of education and lack of a basic sense of health and hygiene have turned these slums into disease-prone pockets, said director-general (slum development) Tarit Banerjee.

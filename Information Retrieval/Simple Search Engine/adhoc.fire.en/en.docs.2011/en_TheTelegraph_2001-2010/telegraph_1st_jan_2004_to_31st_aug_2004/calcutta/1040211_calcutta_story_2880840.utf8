 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Simple appeal of art
																								Sukti Subhra Pradhan is an artist who believes in feeling her art before it transpires into a palpable medium. Her art is born out of an amalgamation of the world outside and the soul within. It speaks the language of beauty and rhythm, a language that can be comfortably communicated even with a novice having no prior education in the art of painting or drawing. Her style consists in simple linear representations that have the ability to elevate the senses. She draws inspiration from geometric symbols and it is through them that she transports her feelings to the world. Pradhans work discusses such features of Indian philosophy as spirituality and psychological transformation, both of which are subtly blended with the senses that help her to perceive the universe in all its vigour before she lends her creations credibility as art to be unveiled before her audience.																								When: Till February 15; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture

				 Suvro Mazumder  Suvro Mazumder  Theatre is his love in life   not on stage, but back stage. It is the entire process that  fascinates Suvro Mazumder, from ideation to public performance,  and it is to the analysis of the making of a play, the effect  on the audience and the role of theatre in social development  that his lifes work is dedicated.																								The 40-year-old is interested in two things  archiving the working of living theatre legends in Bengal and understanding the part that theatre plays in creating awareness among the masses. While he has made progress towards both ends, the road for the member of bangla-natak.com has not always been easy.																								The former Ramakrishna Mission Narendrapur students association with the stage began early, with a mother who was an actress in a group and a father who enjoyed theatre. I used to accompany my mother to rehearsals. It was the combined efforts to produce the end result  from light to sound  that made me think, he recalls.																								Although a graduate and post-graduate in Bengali from Rabindra Bharati University (RBU), he finally turned to theatre for his PhD from the same institution. His thesis subject was the live study of living legends like Manoj Mitra, Rudrapasad Sengupta, Bibhash Chakraborty and Ashok Mukhopadhyay. I had to really study them. For instance, Manoj Mitra got his ideas during his morning walk. I persuaded him to let me join him. I analysed the transformation, from conception to script, rehearsal and the show, the part-time lecturer in the drama department at RBU explains.																								After his father succumbed to cancer, Mazumder had to take over the family construction business. I failed miserably. Im just not cut out for it, he smiles. Then, he joined a friends wholesale fish-selling business, only to give it up. I had to do a lot to survive. I even did chores for people, like going to the bazaar and bank. At least I was free in the evenings to pursue my PhD  going to rehearsals and researching.																								It is as a member of bangla-natak.com that he works in the social sector. Be it plays with the West Bengal AIDS awareness cell or with Population Services International among truckers in Haldia and the city, or anti-drug campaigns in red-light areas at the behest of Calcutta Police, his job is to analyse the impact of the exercise on the audience. As is engaging in community theatre projects, like a workshop on ecology with children in the Sunderbans. It works, because people notice.																								Now, Mazumder is happy just being able to concentrate on what he loves. But there is a dream: I want to create an audio-visual archive depicting how the masters work. Or else, it will be lost to the next generation.

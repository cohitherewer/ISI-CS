The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Time runs out for tanneries
 																											- 30 days for Bantala shift or bulldozer run, warns govt SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Relocate or be razed was Tuesdays hardline message from Writers Buildings to tannery-owners reluctant to shift to the new leather complex. The demolition deadline: 30 days.																								Government officials have made it clear that the integrated complex at Bantala, off the EM Bypass, is ready with all amenities, including the contentious common effluent treatment plant (CETP) required for tanning and allied industry. But the tannery-owners, they allege, are just refusing to budge.																								Of 670 tanneries (500 large and 170 small units) in the Tangra belt, only 30 have shifted to the Bantala address and none of them have apparently started production.																								We are tired of urging the tannery-owners to shift. Enough is enough. We have to draw the line somewhere. We have no option but to take a tough stand against the tannery-owners. I want to make it clear to the tannery-owners that they must either relocate the units or wind up business, said commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen.																								On behalf of the tannery operators, Sheikh Aslam said it was not an easy task to relocate units to Bantala.																								We need more time to shift our units. But if the government now applies force without realising our problems, we are helpless, he lamented.																								The minister reiterated that the state government was bound to abide by the order of the Supreme Court to relocate the tanneries beyond city limits.																								We have invested crores to build the CETP and other infrastructure, like roads, electricity and water for the sake of the leather industry and to benefit the tannery-owners and workers. Besides, we have assured them all assistance. Even after that, they are showing no signs of shifting. We will not tolerate this any more, asserted Sen.																								Faced with such resistance to relocate, the commerce and industry minister held a meeting with senior officials and asked them to take steps against tannery-owners once time ran out.																								We have given them a months time to relocate their units and if they do not carry out the order, we will have to launch a eviction drive, announced commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.																								If necessary, we will disconnect water and electricity supply and seize all the equipment, raw materials and finished goods of the errant tannery-owners. Then, they will have to face the bulldozer, warned commerce and industry secretary Sen.																								The tannery-owners were continuing their business on the old premises illegally, despite their demands being met by the government, he added.

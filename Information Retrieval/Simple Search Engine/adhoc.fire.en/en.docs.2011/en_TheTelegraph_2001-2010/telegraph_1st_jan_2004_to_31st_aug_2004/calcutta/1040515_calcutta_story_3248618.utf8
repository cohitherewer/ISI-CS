The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Scorcher off heartland
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Scorching winds from the heartland, sweeping across Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, tormented Calcutta and the south Bengal districts over the past two days, and claimed two lives in the city on Friday.																								A Calcutta Police sergeant, Sonai Mukherjee, 32, on duty at the crossing of AJC Bose Road and Alimuddin Street, suffered a heat stroke around 3.30 pm and was declared dead on being taken to Calcutta Police Hospital. 																								Sixty-year-old Asrafil Mullick, a conservancy worker at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, collapsed while working inside a manhole in Doctor Lane, in the Taltala area. He was pronounced dead at Medical College and Hospital.																								The dry and hot west wind, blowing at about 36 kph over Calcutta and the south Bengal districts, caused the scorcher.We thought the temperature on Friday would climb further and cross the 41-degree mark, a weather office spokesperson said.																								On May 20, 2002, the maximum temperature had soared to 43 degrees  the highest in 23 years  under similar conditions.																								But there was some respite in sight on Friday. Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore said a change in the wind pattern from Friday morning had led to a slight drop in the maximum temperature, from a seasons high of 40.3 degrees Celsius on Thursday to 38.9 degrees.																								From Friday morning, a soft southerly moisture-laden wind started blowing in from the Bay of Bengal. There was also a light cloud cover in parts of the city and its neighbourhood from the afternoon. The combined effect helped bring down the temperature, said Tapan Kumar Basu, director at the Met Office.																								Officials said there was a chance of a smart shower in Calcutta on Friday evening, as a mass of raincloud, nine km tall, formed over Burdwan, broke into two cells and moved towards Nadia and Calcutta.																								But the cloud cell broke further and scattered before reaching the city. Only a trace of rain was experienced in some parts.																								The weatherman, meanwhile, has warned that the monsoon is still over three weeks away. 																								But the monsoon has already set in over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In Calcutta, we dont expect heavy rain immediately, unless a favourable condition (read: a cyclonic circulation over the city) builds up, was the word from Alipore.

 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 At a Himalaya Optical outlet: Contemporary trends, core values. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								The semi-round black celluloid nitrate frame sported by Soumitra Chatterjee in Saat Paake Bandha came from this heritage house of glasses. Soumitras screen colleague in that Ajay Kar classic, the inimitable Suchitra Sen, still swears by the brand, dropping in often to get her vision assessed and glasses corrected, even though she rarely appears in public these days. 																								Her contemporary, Supriya Devi, who used to get the lenses for her German-made Menred golden frames handcrafted from here, keeps coming back too.																								From the bottom-free, top-metal Kenoter glasses in the 60s to full-plastic (celluloid acetate) frames favoured by Ray in the 70s to the golden and gunmetal revolution of the 80s  Himalaya Optical has seen the complete sweep of eye fashion down the decades. Right down to Hrithik Roshans rimless rage in Kaho Na Pyar Hai, Shah Rukh Khans carbon craze in Baazigar and Preity Zintas black shells in Kal Ho Na Ho.																								Yes, we have borne testimony to the changes and have always managed to swim with the tide, smiles Shyam Binani, managing director, Himalaya Mega Optical Store. His father, M.L. Binani, had set up the chains first city store on BB Ganguly Street back in 1948, after being forced to shut down Karachi operations post-Partition. The family couldnt bring anything down and had to start its Calcutta business from ground zero.																								Even though Himalaya enjoyed a near-monopoly in the optical trade till the late 70s, operating out of its 1,400-sq-ft Bowbazar showroom, traffic congestion, parking peril and a growing market triggered an expansion drive, with the Camac Street outlet opening up in 1978. Now, it has nine standalone stores in Calcutta and is ready to move into malls (South City is tied up, Forum II on roadmap) in swanky formats.																								A fierce commitment to quality  we always had our own lens workshop and never relied on the market coupled with a slew of head-start initiatives, has enabled Himalaya to keep its nose ahead, claim the Binanis. We had D-bifocals at a time when the product was not available outside the US, stresses the MD. 																								Himalaya launched the citys first computerised eye-testing machine in 85 and has now introduced another first  the Kappa Edger, an automatic computerised glass-cutting tool.																								But resting on their laurels is not the Binanis cup of tea. We want to go beyond the label of optical traders and give customers total eye-care solutions, declares Sarat Binani, Shyams nephew, trying to steer the family business towards new frontiers through constant reinvention. Hence, the move to restructure all the showrooms with bright interiors and an emphasis on fashion and youth, a more contemporary product line including the Guccis, Versaces, Chanels and Calvin Kleins.																								We must have the latest Men in Black RayBans on the racks, while retaining our core values, smiles 34-year-old Sarat.

clubsandwichWake up in the morning and be one with Nature. Try your hand at archery, pick up the bridle and mount the saddle for a hearty gallop, swing a round of snag golf. Or simply soak up the sylvan surroundings.The Village Circle is a club with a difference. Nestled in the 100-acre cradle of Vedic Village, the unique back-to-nature wellness project off Rajarhat Road promoted by Circle Clubs and Resorts Ltd, it has unveiled a bouquet of products and services that promises to add something extra to the citys clubbing spectrum.This is the only club in Calcutta located in a completely pollution-free environment and attached to a resort, while the ambience is totally international. So, you can use the club facilities and enjoy a vacation at the same time, like you can do in Bali, says Raj Modi, managing director, Circle Clubs and Resorts Ltd. The unit is part of the Sanjeevani Group, which gave the city Space Circle and, before that, The Circle.At the Village Circle club, apart from snag golf (a fun version for the uninitiated), horse riding and archery, one can explore a number of other outdoor sports like boating, swimming, tennis, beach volleyball, cycling, cricket and trim trail. For indoor buffs, there are cue sports, table tennis and board games, besides a spa with steam, sauna and jacuzzi.Members have a discounted access to the Sanjeeva Spa on the campus, which offers a host of rejuvenating and healing packages based on naturopathy, Chinese medicine, water therapy, therapeutic and feel-good massages, ayurveda, meditation and yoga. They can also use the Yagna restaurant, which serves pure organic food from the Village farms.Almost 90 per cent of the consumables on the campus are organically grown, which is in sync with the essential character of the property, which stands on the fulcrum of wellness. We dont believe in just catering to the feel-good demand, says Modi. The design solution for the resort-club facility was firmed up after extensive R amp;D in Thailand and Indonesia.One gets a feel of nature at Tolly and the Royal too, but the Village Circle has the potential to boost global spa tourism, with its authentic rural Indian ambience blended with five-star comfort and conveniences, feels M.J. Robertson, former CEO, lifestyle division, Sanjeevani Group.The club is offering a couple of introductory membership schemes  Rs 49,500 for 12 years with 21 complimentary room nights (Silver) and Rs 95,000 for 20 years with 70 complimentary room nights (Gold).

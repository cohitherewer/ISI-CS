The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Kitchen politics and Kali the mother
 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Ekta Kapoor at Kalighat on Monday: From dhoklas to rasgullas. Picture by Sudip Acharya																								Friends is her favourite, and she also likes Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin. But her aphrodisiac is her own saas-bahu brigade; injecting twists and turns in their lives and watching television audiences lap up the high dose of universal emotions is her way of life.																								Ekta Kapoor, the reigning queen of Indian cable homes, with a cluster of 20 shows on air, is always clued into what her viewers want. A finger is firmly placed on the Calcutta pulse, and with good reason, too.																								Star TV constantly updates me on the feedback from Calcutta, which, I must say, is tremendous. I have even had to mould the plot of Kasauti Zindagi Kay according to their preferences, says Ekta, creative head of Balaji Telefilms, breezing through town on Monday.																								I made Kasauti... for my Calcutta viewers. The shift from dhoklas to rasgullas was all for them. We had Kali pujas and Durga pujas in the serial. Apparently, people didnt like the Bengali accent of the actors. So, we had a Bengali teacher on the sets working with the cast on the correct diction, she smiles.																								Vermilion smudged on forehead, pearls and stones on each finger, Ekta looks close to the stereotypical small-screen heroine her creations have spawned. Goddess Kali is like my mom, so I have to visit her when I am in Calcutta. Next time, I must make a trip to Dakshineswar, she says, clearly smitten by the city. It has so much tradition. I will probably shoot a film some time here, she muses.																								The regular diet of kitchen politics has almost hit saturation point, admits Ekta, and she is willing to diversify within the parameters of regular commercial entertainment. The new serial, Kesar, is modern in content but done in a traditional fashion, because I dont want to create an ambience where I almost alienate half my viewers, says Ekta, who believes the typical home-bound woman has clicked with the audiences because they identify with her.																								I essentially saw my mother as a housewife. Living with relationships  her mom-in-law, husband and family members  was a full-time job. Growing up in such a family, understanding the housewifes psyche was very natural, she adds.																								Though the craze for Jassi and Des Mein Nikla Hoga Chand has succeeded in rattling her, the 20-something daughter of Bollywood star Jeetendra is all for competition. Its fun to have a Jassi around. It gives you a reality check because you cant be the only player in the market. And besides, if I dont have a show to compete with, what excitement would be left in my life at least? But incidentally, it is all my serials, the Kyunkis and Kahani Ghar Ghar Kis, that are competing against each other, she proclaims.																								Diversification plans are steering Ekta towards the big screen, with six feature films ready to roll. Having had her fill with a thriller (Kucch to Hai) and a horror film (Krishna Cottage), Ekta is longing to switch to sweet romance. No more horror and thriller for the next seven years. I am planning a comedy, a romantic, feel-good film with Satish Kaushik and a Walt Disney-kind of light entertainment with Raj Kumar Santoshi, reveals Ekta. But TV, she promises, remains priority no. 1.

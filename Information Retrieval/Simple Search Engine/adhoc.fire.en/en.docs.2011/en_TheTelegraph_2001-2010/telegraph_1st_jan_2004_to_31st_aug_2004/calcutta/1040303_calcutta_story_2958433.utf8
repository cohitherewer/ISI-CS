 															- Vans to vend organically-grown Nadia produce A STAFF REPORTER																								Health freaks in the city have reason to rejoice  they can soon buy organically-grown, fresh vegetables right at their doorstep. 																								The West Bengal State Food Processing amp; Horticulture Development Corporation has finalised talks with farmers in Nadia to produce organic vegetables through group farming. 																								So, on a bright summer morning, after a walk on the Maidan or in neighbourhoods like Lake Gardens, Ballygunge, Salt Lake or Gariahat, you may come across mobile vans selling these vegetables. Dont mind the price, the bishuddha shabji  as the packets will be labelled  will be worth it. 																								Tastier and richer in vitamins and minerals, organic vegetables are now in great demand, though they are dear and not easily available in local bazaars. Organic vegetables are bound to be expensive because organic and bio-fertilisers are used in growing them. We are, therefore, targeting the higher-income groups, who wont mind even if the vegetables are expensive, explained N. Hazra, the corporations managing director, on Tuesday. 																								We hope the price will come down once the product finds its niche in the market, he added. 																								Summer favourites like bitter gourd, cucumber, brinjal, tomato, pumpkin and gourd, will be grown in pockets of Nadia, like Chakdah, Ranaghat and Krishnagar. We will start selling the produce this summer in mobile vans. If the venture is viable, production will assume a larger scale, Hazra added. 																								The food processing and horticulture development corporation has failed several times to export the vegetables because foreign countries are increasingly getting rid of products grown with chemicals, Hazra said. So, the corporations target is to find out how well organic vegetables do in the domestic market and then move on to exports. 																								Agriculture in the state is largely dependent on chemical fertilisers, though their repeated use reduces soil fertility, a senior official of the state agriculture department said. 																								Bio-farming has started in the state, though not on a large scale. We cannot replace chemical fertilisers with organic and bio-fertilisers altogether, because it would not be cost-effective even if produced on a large scale, he added. 																								However, farmers have taken to organic farming in the state on an experimental basis. Organic fertilisers and manure are made with decayed plants and animal excreta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Youngsters of today are hardly interested in visiting a library. Most children lack healthy reading habits. Books do not appeal to them, maybe because of the proliferation by television and other visual media, along with the internet. The trend is extremely worrying. Books, have a charm of their own which is not available in any other media. Parents and guardians should try their best to inculcate the habit of reading amongst their wards.

	I had deposited two passbooks with Dhakuria post office on May 5 for getting them updated. They have not been returned to me yet. I learned from a staff member in the Tollygunge HPO savings department that the passbooks were not being processed because of shortage of manpower. Postal authorities should recruit more people or divide the work in a proper way among its staff to redress customers complaints and to serve them better.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Taste test for new spread
																								Restaurants frequently revamp their menus to make the most of the flavours that click and ensure regulars get a taste of something new. That is the process The Park is currently going through, but this time, it is with a twist that might make all the difference.																								Every proposed entry will have to pass the ultimate litmus test: a true foodies discerning tastebuds. Calcuttas prominent diners are being called in to sample the chefs innovations and grade them according to the key parameters.Friday lunch saw the first group of new items go through the wringer, with celeb judges tabla player Bikram Ghosh, fashion designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh (in picture above by Pabitra Das with chef Shaun Kenworthy) and adman Anurag Hira sampling Zen cuisine.																								Before we would do the tasting in-house, but internationally, it is quite a standard procedure to get outsider input on the new menu before introduction, explains chef Shaun Kenworthy of The Park.																								A score sheet for each judge requires scrutiny in three main areas  taste, colour and texture. If a particular recipe gets consistently bad ratings, it will not be included, adds Kenworthy.																								The menu at the oriental speciality restaurant for the meal included Chinese and Thai dishes, some of which were innovative, while others were more traditional. 																								Two of the best new prospects are from the vegetarian selection. The fried baby aubergines were superb, batter fried and cooked in a mild, sweet sauce. The crispy mushrooms with sesame were the perfect starter, tender and crisp.																								Two other starters  shredded beef salad and sprouting bean and glass noodle salad  were both excellent, though a little heavy handed with the onion and garlic. Of the main course hopefuls, the Kung Pao Chicken was a perfect rendition of an old favourite.																								The new selection should be in place on June 1, after the rest of the choices are also approved. The same process will be repeated at The Atrium, the coffee shop, and at Saffron, the Indian restaurant. 																								The challenge, according to Kenworthy, is presenting a new thing in a different way. New concoctions are the result of much experimentation. Sometimes I would just muck around in the kitchen for an hour, he smiles. Or, I would ask one of the team to impress me; to show me what they can do.																								Sometimes the efforts click, sometimes they dont. But the true test is the response from the customer, which is near impossible to predict, according to the chef from Manchester. 																								From the response of the judges, the first trial was a hit. Not only did the food go down well, there was hardly a pause in the chatter. 																								It started with a walk down memory lane to days at St Xaviers College (as it happened, all but two of those at the table owe their education to the Calcutta institution) and moved on to movies (from the Mona Lisa Smiles to Main Hoon Nas) and how to juggle an overpacked schedule.

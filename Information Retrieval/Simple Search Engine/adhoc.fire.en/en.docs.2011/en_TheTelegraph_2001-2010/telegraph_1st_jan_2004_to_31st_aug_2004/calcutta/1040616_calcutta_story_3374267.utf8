The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Shift signal in civic corridors
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY				 	 The CMC headquarters on SN Banerjee Road: Relocate ring																								If you are 60 or above and have dropped into the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters on SN Banerjee Road to pay tax, deposit a fee or collect a form, be prepared to walk around a maze of departments on the first, second or third floors, trying to locate a counter. 																								Help is not forthcoming from the employees. Some of them have boards on their desks saying: This is not an inquiry counter.																								The experience is set to be a thing of the past. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has directed municipal commissioner Debasish Som to draw up a blueprint to shift all the public service-oriented wings to the ground floor.																								This move will save the elderly from having to trudge up the flights of stairs and face undue harassment in the CMC office. It will also put a stop to touts loitering freely on all the floors of the civic headquarters, explained mayor Mukherjee.																								Entry of outsiders on the other floors will be restricted after the relocation. The courtyard will be beautified and there will be kiosks for snacks, soft drinks and coffee, apart from a public call office booth. 																								According to the mayor, more than 8,000 visitors drop by at the civic headquarters every day to collect forms and certificates or deposit taxes or even to attend hearings. Forty per cent of them are on the wrong side of 60.																								After the relocation, hearings of assessment cases and those relating to building construction will be held in the north-west corner of the first floor. Birth and death certificates can be collected from the eastern wing of the second floor.																								There is no provision for another elevator. The three elevators in the CMC headquarters can carry a total of 26. Long queues are common in front of them. 																								According to civic engineers, at least 30,000 sq ft need to be generated on the ground floor to shift the public service-oriented counters of about 30-odd departments there.																								The civic authorities plan to generate space by shifting the printing press to the newly-constructed basement of the Town Hall. The main problem in generating space in the CMC headquarters, pointed out director-general (project and development) Nilangshu Bose, was that it was a heritage building.																								Hardly 60 per cent of 136-cottah plot is covered, but because of its heritage status, no new construction can be carried out. The printing press occupies no less than 20,000 sq ft and the ceiling is high enough to accommodate a mezzanine floor, said Bose.																								We hope senior citizens will benefit from this, said Bose.

 KINSUK BASUWHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR 
	 AIR-CONDITIONING: Zones where tests for STD, HIV and hepatitis are carried out should be AC. Even the donor room and the area where cross-matching of samples is carried out should be AC
	 EQUIPMENT: There should be a centrifuge, an incubator, hot-air oven and glassware. More importantly, the blood refrigerator should be working without any external vibration. Or else, the red blood corpuscles may split
	 MANPOWER: There should be doctors, technologists, nurses and the lab should not have dated reagents. The available space should be at least 1,000 sq ft
	 STATUS: The blood bank should have a current registration
With reports of accidental HIV infection during transfusions at state-run blood banks pouring in and experts claiming that patients undergoing multiple blood transfusions are not safe, the state government has decided to take a hard look at the functioning of blood banks across the city. 																								The department has set up a 12-member team that will review the facilities at the state-run blood banks and suggest ways to plug loopholes. 																								Besides the joint director of the State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, the team will include haematologists, virologists and experts from a few medical colleges. 																								The team will submit its report to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. 																								The team will study the working of the blood banks and take stock of the infrastructure. We would also like to verify how many of the standard practices are being followed, explained S. Suresh Kumar, director, State AIDS Prevention and Control Society. 																								The blood banks will also be asked to inform the team how often they organise camps to ensure an adequate supply of the life-saving fluid.																								Officials dealing with blood safety were rattled when a three-year-old thalassaemic from Habra, Ananda Saha, contracted the dreaded virus during blood transfusion at Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital. 																								Forty-eight hours after the case was reported, health secretary Kalyan Bagchi visited the NRS blood bank and noted a few discrepancies. The blood bank had been keeping tested and untested blood in the same refrigerator, pointed out an insider.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Addressing a crisis
Kasba Arghya, in its first major production, presents Sankat, an experimental workshop-based theatre. The play revolves around the lives of the college going youth of today and the contemporary crisis of values and political ideologies. Sankat takes off in a college canteen where a group is seen to give a call for a students strike in protest of the killing of a fellow student during a peaceful rally. The plot develops with the students facing the ire of the politically inclined students union in the college. What makes matters worse for the young rights activists is the intervention of the principal who also echoes the politics of the students union. Apart from signalling out a strong political message to the young brigade that is temperamentally impressionable, Sankat also depicts two behavioral patterns amongst the present crop of students  the fun loving young guns and those with a greater concern for the turn of events around them.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Sankat, produced by Kasba Arghya																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Sisir Mancha

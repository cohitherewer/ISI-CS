The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 17, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Leander Paes Youre a good worker, practical and steady, with a constant quest for knowledge. Pangs of depression may leave you helpless. Theres a long trip likely with someone special, perhaps to settle down in a distant land. Health watch: digestion. Your gems: pearl and sapphire. Lucky colours: green and dark grey. Be sure you have legal matters under control. Kusum Bhandari

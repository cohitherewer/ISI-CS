The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 31, 2004 Drama ticks 
 Members of Dialogue at the play-reading session at Oxford Bookstore. Picture by Amit Datta																								 A public platform for theatre lovers was launched on Thursday evening. Dialogue, Oxford Bookstores drama club, debuted with a high energy play reading titled Shakespeare and the Mantle of Power.																								The club, conceived by Oxford, is starting off at its branches in Calcutta, Mumbai and Bangalore. The monthly meets, scheduled for the last Thursday of every month, will not only present an array of theatrical activity, they also hope to break down the barriers between audience and actor.																								Sumit Roy and Katy Lai Roy of The Red Curtain and critic, director and professor Ananda Lal are the team entrusted with putting together the monthly events, but ideation and participation are open to all enthusiastic members of the free club.																								The first evening was devoted to themes of political ambition. Theatre veterans read excerpts from three of Shakespeares great political plays  Richard III, Julius Caesar and Macbeth. The recent political drama in our country during the elections was so much like Julius Caesar. That is where the idea for the evening was born, explained Sumit Roy.																								The event could not but be a success after Roy hit home with his opening request. Is anybody expecting a message from Abdul Kalam? A stunned audience maintained a confused silence. No? Then please turn off your cell phones. After that, it was on to the reading, with Cyrus Madan as Richard III and Poonam Singh playing Queen Elizabeth.																								After each segment, Roy conducted an interactive session with the panellists  or the audience  provoking discussion on what was presented, drawing real-life parallels. Richard was compared variously to Saddam, Hitler and Bush.																								Before the Julius Caesar segment, the audience was inducted as players, too. After a first and second citizen were identified (though it later turned out that citizen two had been planted), everyone else in the room was given a line. Ave Caesar, they were to shout, following every Hail Caesar! 																								Who is more fickle, politicians or the public, was the theme of the discussion after the second reading. 																								Finally, Prabir Ghosh and Zarin Chaudhuri recreated the murder of Duncan, reading from Macbeth.																								But there was still one important task at hand: deciding the theme for next months evening. There was some enthusiasm about Indian playwrights, and the works of Tendulkar was finally decided upon.																								This will never be a full production, explained Roy, after he finished answering queries from a number of young people present and hoping to join in. It will always be a dialogue with the audience.																								Maina Bhagat, events consultant for the Park Street bookstore, said: This was a wonderful Calcutta opening to the club, which proves that there are still a lot of serious theatre lovers here. The flexible club will also be open to original scripts, she added.There will be more activity at Oxford soon, with design, film and photography groups on the anvil.Shape up 																								 Fuelling the keep fit mantra of the citys jet setters, Addlife, the premium health club on Camac Street, is coming up with lucrative fitness schemes for the corporate crowd. Called Addlife Corporate Wellness Programme, it will offer flexible, employee-specific packages for corporate houses of the city.																								We have a multi-dimensional approach towards corporate healthcare. Our packages are designed according to the fitness level, present medical condition and fitness goals of each employee of an organisation. The package may vary for each individual, said Hritika Kumar, co-director of Addlife.

Addlife could also set up multi-gyms at the office complexes, if the corporate houses approach them. 																								We also keep on conducting various health workshops to create awareness among the executives, she said.

Raima and Moon Moon Sen sweat it out at Addlife.

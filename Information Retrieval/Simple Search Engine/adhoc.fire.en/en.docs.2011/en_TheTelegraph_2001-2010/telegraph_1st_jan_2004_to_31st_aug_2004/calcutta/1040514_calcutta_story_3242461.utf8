 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 New-age nest to home in 
																								Sal and teak is out, iron and steel is in. Initiating Calcuttans into the nuances of new-age design is a three-day workshop organised by Exterior Interior Pvt Ltd at 13, Camac Street, starting Thursday.																								Its difficult to cover the entire technical aspect of interior design in just three days. But the workshop is interesting to those who would like to know about the various options available to make their living space a little more beautiful, says co-ordinator Ratna Banerjee.																								What started as an introductory class on how to renovate a room without drastically changing its contours, put a motley gathering of students, housewives and restaurateurs through the paces of colour schemes, flooring, furniture, electricals and plumbing.																								Such workshops are extremely helpful as not too many lay people know the difference between warm and cool colours or how to synchronise monochromatic and complementary colour schemes, claims branch manager Shantoshree Mondol.																								The talk on leaving the white primer on newly-built houses for a year or two for the walls to soak it up, lest the walls develop a crack, was just one of the useful info nuggets thrown up on Day One of the workshop.																								What hit home the hardest were the alternatives to mosaic and marble. Flooring is totally dependent on your budget but there are a number of unusual options available in the market today that gives you the freedom to think beyond the regular choices, says Ratna.																								While the use of vinyl and wood is well known in this regard, the use of terracotta tiles or glass in the form of bricks, tiles or slabs, seen mostly in discos, restaurants and hotels, was news to most.																								Furniture is another fixture being talked about in great detail. Ecological changes are factored in here as one learns about the economic and environmental disadvantages of using sal and teak furniture today, as opposed to rubber wood, wrought iron and steel that score in terms of expense, durability and aesthetics. Lending a touch of green will be the concluding session on landscape and Zen gardening thats sure to add a zing to the insiders take on interiors.						SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Teen murder accused cry not guilty
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The Kuntal Sain murder case might switch tracks, as prime accused Arijit Pal and Sampad Mukherjee have stated in the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court that there are two more persons involved. 																								The four accused  Jyotirmoy and Manjusha Mukherjee, Sampad and Arijit  were produced in court on Friday after the completion of 14 days in judicial custody.																								However, according to Arijit and Sampad, two other people had committed the crime and the burden had fallen on them. They claimed that during interrogation, the police had forced them to admit that they had killed their friend Sain on July 2.																								We have confessed to the magistrate in our statement  that we had not harmed our friend. The other two had killed him, said Sampad. He added the duo being referred to had been held in Bihar, though they lived in Howrah.																								When asked how they got to know these youths, Arijit said they would play together in a group and it never crossed their minds to ask after their friends antecedents. 																								It was this duo that had hatched the plan to fetch money from Sain, Arijit and Sampad said. And it was the same duo that had committed the murder.																								We have also disclosed the names of the two murderers in our confessional statement, Sampad said. The accused identified the duo as Mohammad Naseer and Sanjoy Jaiswal. Sampad added: the thought of killing our friend had never occurred to us. They did it, and that, too, in our absence. 																								Both Arijit and Sampad reiterated that after their arrest, the police had forced them to admit that they had killed 18-year-old Kuntal Sain.																								According to Sampads lawyer Sujit Chatterjee, the police had tortured the two youths to confess. 																								On Friday, it was also revealed that Kuntals family had filed a petition seeking to get back their motorcycle, allegedly used by Sampad and Arijit in the murder. The motorcycle had been impounded by the police. 																								But the magistrate ruled that an article mentioned in the seizure list could not be given away to the petitioner. 																								He also observed that it was not the owner of the motorcycle who had filed the petition for its return, but some others on his behalf. 																								The magistrate has remanded the four accused in judicial custody till August 27 and the bail petition, which was rejected on Friday, would be forwarded for hearing on August 17.

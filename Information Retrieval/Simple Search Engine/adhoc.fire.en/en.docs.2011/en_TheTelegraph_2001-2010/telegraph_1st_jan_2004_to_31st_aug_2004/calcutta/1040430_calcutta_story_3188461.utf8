The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Men in mufti regain stations
 SANJAY MANDAL 																								The motive had been to instil more discipline in the force, but the decision to disband the plainclothes squad of the Government Railway Police (GRP) at both Howrah and Sealdah divisions seems to have backfired. 																								The squad, deployed to net criminals at stations and on trains, was back in action on the Howrah division a week ago and on Thursday, on an order from a senior officer, the plainclothes men were back at Sealdah, too.																								GRP sources said the orders disbanding the mufti teams were issued some time ago. The men were asked to join duty in proper khaki uniforms. 																								The activities of these plainclothes personnel need to be monitored and organised, Nazrul Islam, special inspector-general (railways) told Metro on Thursday. On flying inspections at Howrah and Sealdah, I asked officials to contact these plainclothes men, but they could not be located. If they cant be found in times of emergency, then there is a problem, he said.																								But GRP officials said they were finding it difficult to curb crime at stations and on trains in the absence of the squad. 																								At Sealdah, there had been a 20-member team, while other stations had 10-member squads. 																								Dacoity, theft and other crime had gone up after these squads were disbanded, said a GRP official on Sealdah division. Dacoity on the stretches between Sealdah and Park Circus and Sealdah and Ultadanga had doubled last month, against figures earlier this year. 																								Also, criminals from other states choose Sealdah and Howrah as their base. They pretend to be passengers and steal others belongings, said an official. To keep a vigil on them, plainclothes men were ideal, he felt. 																								At Howrah, the authorities realised the importance of bringing back these men out of uniform. The squad was reintroduced a week ago, said Sunil Mullick, superintendent of railway police, Howrah. Admitting that the track record had been negative, Mullick said the present lot was a new-look one. We have only a few men from the earlier teams because they are experienced. Others have been drawn from the GRP pool.

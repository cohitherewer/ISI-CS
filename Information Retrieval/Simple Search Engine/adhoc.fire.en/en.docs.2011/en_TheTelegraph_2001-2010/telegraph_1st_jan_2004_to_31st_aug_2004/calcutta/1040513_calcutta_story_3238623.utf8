 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Through the looking glass: A student has fun with a distorted view. Picture by Aranya Sen																								A mirror where you can see the reflection of only your back, glasses which provide a clear side view but hazy frontal vision, talking pitchers, rotating mirrors with straightforward and upside-down reflections Enter the wonderful world of illusions, where nothing is as it seems.																								Its magic, but not quite, because for every seemingly unbelievable exhibit theres a very scientific explanation. And playing tricks are your own sensory stimuli. Illusions, the exhibition, is on till June 17 at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), to celebrate the Gurusaday Road museums 45th anniversary. 																								The attempt is to expose the logical reasoning behind various sensory illusions, in an interactive manner  first you see and delight in the unexpected, then understand what makes it happen. And its been drawing in visitors in large numbers, say authorities. The call get enlightened and entertained has struck a chord, with visitors, young and old, trying out the gadgets and smiling in surprise at what they learn. 																								So, the mirror that only gives a rear reflection is a result of four mirrors placed at 90-degree angles to each other. While the side-vision glasses are achieved with prisms instead of lenses, the rounded pitchers are placed behind a screen and rotated to give the impression of a person speaking.																								The mystery lies in the often misleading interpretations of the sensory organs. So, what we hear, touch, feel, smell or taste is not always what it is in reality.																								For instance, at the BITM exhibition, two halves of a white board  one a shade darker than the other  are bound by a thick, black frame. The dividing line is covered, so to the onlooker, it simply appears white. But when the partition is raised, the difference is obvious. The reason  the imposing border dominates the vision and overrides the rest.																								Also on at BITM, as part of its anniversary celebrations, is an Albert Einstein exhibition, in association with the Israeli consulate. Inaugurated on Wednesday, it is based on material housed at The Albert Einstein at The Jewish National and University Library of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in Israel. Photographed copies of the actual images of the physicist and his work in his own handwriting chronicle Einsteins life and times. It provides an insight into his personal and professional life.

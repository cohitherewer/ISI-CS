The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Twin deaths, zoo unfazed Space crunch at zoo
 															- Black Monday: rhino succumbs to age, deer to wounds DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Black Monday (August 9) at Alipore zoo claimed a spotted deer and 31-year-old Kadambini, a female Indian one-horned rhinoceros. 																								Zoo officials confirmed the twin deaths on Wednesday. If the reason behind the deers death on Monday evening was evident from the post-mortem report, it is still not clear how the rhino, buried around the same time in the zoo, had died.																								 The spotted male deer was severely injured on Monday during a fight with some of the other stags and later died, said S.K. Chaudhuri, director, Alipore Zoological Gardens, explaining the sequence of photographs carried by Metro on Tuesday.																								The preliminary report suggests that the rhino died of ageing, but we are yet to receive the final report from the disease investigation officer of the veterinary directorate, added Chaudhuri.																								Officials termed both the deaths natural, but experts and animal-lovers cried out loud for better conditions at the zoo.																								Over-crowding is a major problem in Alipore zoo and in case of deer, the numbers are much more than the enclosure can accommodate. That explains the high incidence of injuries, alleged Debasish Chakraborty, of People For Animals, a city-based NGO.																								The solution, he added, would either be translocation of the zoo from the 45-acre plot in the heart of the city to a bigger area or reducing the animal population to one-fourth of the existing number.																								As for the rhino death, Chakrabory asked what measures the authorities had taken when they first noticed the symptoms of ageing in Kadambini.																								G.S. Mondal, former principal secretary and the chief conservator of forest, pointed out the institutional problems plaguing the zoo.																								For one, the officials must be exposed to wildlife management before being posted here. In most cases, the veterinary doctors know only about pets and are clueless about the problems of wild animals, claimed Mondal.																								He added that Alipore zoo has a lot to learn from the modern zoos in Chennai and Hyderabad.

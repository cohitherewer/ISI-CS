 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Looking beyond the obvious
																								There have been several characters in history that were more sinned against than sinning. However the irony of the situation lay in the justification that was late in coming. It was left to posterity to look beyond that which met the eye. Shinjan Institution of Bharata Natyam and Creative Dance has selected two such characters from the pages of history and shown them as men who were deprived of the chance to stand by their actions. Anya Uttwiya takes a look into the character of Uttwiya from a perspective removed from that of the man who stole Shyamas ornaments. Suryaputra is the tale of the wronged hero from the Mahabharata, Karna. It shows Karna as the man who was never given his due, a man who lived a borrowed life and was cheated into death. Performed by Kohinoor Sen Barat.																								Event: Dance dramas presented by Shinjan																								When: Today at 6.pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

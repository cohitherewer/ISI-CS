 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Dogfight over canine control
 OUR BUREAU																								The Trinamul Congress board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is in the midst of yet another fracas. Only, its dogs, and not humans, that has sparked it.																								Mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh had, a few days ago, blacklisted some city-based NGOs, including the Calcutta Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (CSPCA). All of them were involved in the drive to keep the stray dog population in check. All, except the CSPCA, are funded by the Centre (the CSPCA, the largest of them, is funded by the state government). Ghosh, while blacklisting the NGOs, said they were not doing enough and lacked the infrastructure to handle the citys canine population.																								But many of his colleagues say Ghosh is wrong, and the blacklisting has very little to do with any genuine urge for action. It seeks only to clear the way for another NGO. And many of the colleagues still call up the CSPCA when it comes to providing relief to distressed animals in their neighbourhoods.																								The whispers against Ghosh appear to have the backing of an influential section within the Trinamul itself. The CSPCA is the oldest animal-welfare organisation in the country, Javed Ahmed Khan said on Tuesday.																								How can you say it does not have the infrastructure? he asked, citing the example of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation, which is successfully handling a canine sterilisation programme with expertise and infrastructure from the CSPCA.																								Recent requests at the CSPCAs Bowbazar Street office appear to support Khans contention. Pleas for help have come from mayoral council member Swapan Samaddar, Trinamul councillors Pabitra Biswas and Rajkishore Gupta, and officials of the CMCs borough II headquarters on Bidhan Sarani.																								Ghosh, however, insisted he was right and rubbished allegations about favouring any particular NGO. No CSPCA spokesperson would comment on a matter that concerns the CMC. But word has reached animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman and CMC leader of the Opposition Nirmal Mukherjee.

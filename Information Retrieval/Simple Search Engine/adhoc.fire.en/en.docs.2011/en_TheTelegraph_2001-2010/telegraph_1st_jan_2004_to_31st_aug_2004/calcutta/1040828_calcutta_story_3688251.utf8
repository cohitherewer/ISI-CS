 Uday
	At noon on Thursday, the streets of Mumbai revved up to a rally of superbikes. A day before the release of Bollywoods biggest bike film, the whole Dhoom team lined up two-wheelers in Andheri. Then, vvvvrrrroom went the Hayabusas, Bandits, Ninjas and Ducapis. There was John (Abraham), Rimii (Sen), myself, director Sanjay Gadhvi, executive producer Shanab Alam and some of our friends, said Uday Chopra, too tired to move after the day-long tour. 
	The plan was to travel straight to Nariman Point. But there was a last-minute change of plan that had Uday visiting his alma mater Sydenham College. We decided to stop by at a few colleges on the way  Mithibhai, Jai Hind, Sophiya, other than Sydenham  to increase the excitement. But I couldnt go into my college and meet the teachers as there was too much of a crowd wherever we were stopping. So we slowed in front of the gates, shook hands and gave away a few autographs. It was lovely to hear them sing Dhoom macha le and promise that they would catch the first show on Friday.
	 Uday , who had gone to London to learn how to man his 1200 cc Suzuki Bandit so that cop Abhishek Bachchan, riding pillion, could give robber John hot chase, said: The course was on basic motor manoeuvring, high-speed cornering and riding. These machines are so fast that if you make a single mistake, it can kill you.
	 Speed is what marks the film as well. Audiences who gathered to watch the special screening at 89 Cinemas on Thursday night found it to be all of an hour and 45 minutes  unlike the usual Bollywood slowcoach rides. Those who caught the making of the movie on Friday evening on Sony would be better equipped to catch the action (unleashed at INOX Forum, 89 Cinemas, Menoka and the rest).  Charlotte Church: Rear view
	The show is funny and theres no stiff upper lip in this British export. The cheeky comedy is brought to you by a bunch of Asians with an excellent track record of irreverent humour. Remember BBCs Goodness Gracious Me, a hilarious take on Asians by Asians living in the UK? The Kumars at No. 42 is a follow-up of sorts, with some of the same people behind it, including author and actress Meera Syal and actor Sanjeev Bhaskar. They once again have global audiences falling off their chairs with shock and laughter. You can catch it on Star World, on Sundays, from 7.30 pm. 
	This time, the theme is a chat show. The family of four  father Ashwin (Vincent Ebrahim), mother Madhuri (Indira Joshi), son Sanjeev (Bhaskar) and grandmother Sushila (Syal)  have ostensibly cleared out their backyard in Wembley and set up a studio to interview celebrities.
	 But nothing quite goes according to plan, as naughty granny is a raunchy young girl in an old womans body. Madhuri is keen to get her spoilt son married off and is the perfect Asian host as she enjoys feeding her guests and Ashwin loves talking about money and obscure facts. While Sanjeev fancies himself as a bit of a celebrity and thinks hes the only sane member of the loony family (ya, right!). 
	The best part of the programme is that very rarely do the actors stick to the script. The celebrities are equally entertaining and are usually sporting enough to handle the rude jokes, especially from Sushila. Stephen Fry, Helena Bonham Carter, Ismail Merchant, Jerry Hall and many, many more have had to bear the brunt of The Kumars at No. 42. 
	This Sunday, watch young singer Charlotte Church  famous for her crooning skills and her shapely behind (she was the youngest ever to be declared Britains Rear of the Year in 2002)  and TV star Martin Kemp  also a former member of the 1980s band Spandau Ballet  become targets at No 42. 
	A dose of laughter to cure everyday blues. Zee Network has recently launched a 24-hour fun and entertainment channel called Smile TV to do exactly that. The Hindi channel, that was in test-run mode on Zees direct-to-home (DTH) platform till now, made its debut on the cable network and will now be available across the country.
	 The family channel that aims to leave no room for gloom, will feature movies, cartoons, sitcoms, stand-up shows, joke sessions, music and game shows. Viewers today are tired of watching soaps that are never-ending, and they are looking for a break, feels Ashish Kaul, vice president, corporate brand development, Essel Group. Smile TV has the potential to provide novel entertainment to all age-group audiences. Five new shows have also been added to Smile TVs programming list  YO YO, Hasya Kavi Sammelan, Ek Minute, Kahaani Mein Twist and Hasne Bhi Do Yaaro. If Hasya Kavi.. will feature Hindi and Urdu rhymesters from all over the country participating in a friendly contest, Hasne Bhi Do will be a one-hour Hindi comedy theatre show performed in front of a live audience. 
	Smile TV has been made available to a section of Calcutta viewers for the past few months. Following a cable dispute earlier this year, SitiCable and Manthan had replaced the STAR bouquet with some of Zees DTH channels, including Smile TV. Once the dispute was resolved, Manthan stopped the beaming of the channel, while SitiCable  from the Zee stable  has kept it on.  Piu Sarkar: For arts sake
	Shes been on the ramp and on screen but its on canvas that Piu Sarkar really wants to make a mark. It makes me feel a full human being, says Piu about this self-taught discipline, back home from Delhi. 
	Last seen as Charulata in Sahara Manoranjans Shri Bimal Mitras Sahib Biwi Gulam, sharing small-screen space with Raveena Tandon and Rupa Ganguly, Piu held her first solo art exhibition, Species, in the Capital at Jaypee Vasant Continental. After actress-activist Nafisa Ali cut the ribbon, sports minister Sunil Dutt dropped in to encourage her passion. 
	Of the 15 paintings put up for the three-day-long display in mid-August, a few were in mixed media and the rest in acrylic. 
	The high point of the Delhi trip, however, was meeting painter Jatin Das in his studio. He advised me to do at least 50 to 60 sketches a day, gushed Piu after her rendezvous with Nandita Das father.
	 I am open to acting offers, but I am certainly not going to hunt for roles, promises Piu. The Species series will now be on display at Pius Passion, her studio in Hyatt Regency.

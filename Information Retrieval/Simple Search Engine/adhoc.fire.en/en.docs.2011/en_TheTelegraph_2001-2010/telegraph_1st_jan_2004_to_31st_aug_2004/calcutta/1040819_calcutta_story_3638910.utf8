 BYE BYE BIRDIE: Crows may soon be the only winged residents of the cityApropos the report Roadside orchards to woo back birds, July 20, seems like the mayor is trying his best to atone for his tree-felling spree.  After going on a construction binge at the cost of the greens, Subrata Mukherjee, a whole lot of criticism later, has come up with a novel idea  he has issued an order for only fruit-bearing trees to be planted on the side of roads in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area.  His logic is that the fruit trees will attract more and more birds to the city area . At the same time, the city will become greener and the verdant cover will do some damage control against the ever-increasing pollution. All these attempts will definitely improve the citys look.  But, the trees to be planted will need proper care and protection from the very initial stage for the mayors scheme to be successful. Usually saplings that are planted are left to wither or be chewed by cattle soon after.  So, adequate steps are to be taken so that all the trees planted are able to grow fully and bear fruits in due course. The fruits may help the CMC see an increase in its annual revenue as well.  As fruits have market value, there is every possibility that street children and other people, too, may start collecting them from the trees at the very initial stages. In such a case, birds will get the least chance to taste the fruits.  Unless the CMC watchmen see to it that the trees are properly nourished and cared for, the attempts of the civic fathers may not be fruitful. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
Behala. Apropos Pushed to brink, slay and perish, July 22, stress is affecting more and more lives today. People in both rural and urban areas are falling prey to this problem.  Squabbles over division of property, arguments over extra-marital affairs as well as political tension are the common causes of anxiety. In some cases, people who are born introverts, withdraw into a shell and become extremely self-centred and selfish.  In recent times people are bringing out their frustrations on others for personal causes like debt. Doctors associations should teach people how to detect the symptoms of paranoia and how to avoid tension. This will be a much-needed service to society. A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 
Hooghly Apropos the report Crusader and a popular prankster, July 19, it is really sad how a sensible person like Shibendu Saha committed suicide after murdering his near and dear ones. In this present age of economic complexities, people are increasingly falling victims to the tension of day-to-day affairs. Youngsters should be careful to put a leash on their temper and learn not to take things to heart. Rabindranath Kar,
Sankar Ghosh Lane Shibendu Saha committed suicide after killing six members of his family. In his suicide note he pointed to a financial irregularities committed by his uncle as the cause that drove him to the extreme step. The Saha family deaths bring out the true picture of the society we live in  where money controls everything, including life. Sachindra Nath Mitra,
Rakhal Ghosh Lane Apropos the report Lost deed and loose ends, July 20, the wiping out of an entire family came as a shock. The aunt of the one who committed suicide had covered her face with her sari while being taken to the police station. If she knows she is innocent why does she have to hide? Prahlad Agarwala,
MajdiaApropos the report City boy helps dish out space menu, July 22, Calcuttas youngsters should feel proud that Supratim Ghosh, an ex-student of Calcutta University, has discovered a special vegetable space menu for NASA. Kudos to him and his team in Pennsylvania. Bhupen Bose,
Dum Dum Park Apropos the report Market stall owners to gobble up park, July 20, the renovation of the College Street market is long overdue. But is it necessary to spoil the greenery of Marcus Square for the renovation of a market? Anil Kumar Sen, 
Ram Chandra Chatterjee LaneIt is heartening that Jadavpur University and the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy have joined hands to start a B.Ed course on teaching physically and mentally challenged children (B.Ed for teachers of special children, July 16). Govinda Bakshi, 
Budge Budge Apropos the report Czech that out in Tagores tongue, July 23, it was nice to read about Ondra Abonyi and Jakub Wolf who are not only specialising in Bengali in far-away Prague but have also come all the way to Bengal. Bengalis who are now indifferent to their own mother tongue should learn a lesson from the Czech youngsters. Kajal Chatterjee, 
Sodepur Apropos the report Car park in phases but late, July 17, it is unfortunate that parking arrangements are being delayed on one pretext or the other. In the absence of specified parking lots, owners have to park their cars on both sides of key thoroughfares. This attitude of the authorities has resulted in traffic jams on most roads of the city. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty RoadApropos the article Next Weekend you can be at  Gopalpur on Sea, August 15, the Oberoi Palm Beach hotel mentioned in the story as a place to stay at the tourist spot is currently undergoing renovation and hence will not be open to the public. Nazreen Haidar,
Communication manager, Oberoi Grand

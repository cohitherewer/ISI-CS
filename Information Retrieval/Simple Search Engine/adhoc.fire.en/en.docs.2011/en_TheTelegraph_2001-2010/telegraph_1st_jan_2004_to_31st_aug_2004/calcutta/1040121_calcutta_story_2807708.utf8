The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Ailing tot trapped by refusal and rage
 SANJAY MANDAL																								The taxi strike and the road rage near Bijon Setu combined to cripple commuters in south Calcutta on Tuesday, with schoolchildren and office-goers struggling to find a way out.																								Among the worst hit by the twin troubles was Sandipan, all of three months old.																								The infant was suffering from acute respiratory problems due to pneumonia, and his parents had been directed by a local doctor to rush him to hospital from their Dover Terrace home. That, unfortunately, was easier said than done on Tuesday morning, as Sandipans father and a family friend soon found out.																								First, they were refused by taxis, despite cradling an ailing child gasping for breath. They finally got hold of an auto-rickshaw, which soon got stuck in the spillover effect of the Bijon Setu roadblock. So, a circuitous route had to be taken to reach the Institute of Child Health, on Biresh Guha Street.																								By then, Sandipans condition had deteriorated and after daylong medication, he remained under close observation.																								Sandipan, the only child of Shasanka and Asha Hazra, had been suffering from a cold for the past few days. Asha took the child to her parents place in Kasba. He was taken to a local paediatrician the next morning. His condition deteriorated despite the medicines and we took him to another doctor on Tuesday morning, who advised immediate hospitalisation, said Shasanka.																								But when Shasanka and his friend Tarun Das tried to rush the infant to hospital, they were faced with one roadblock after another. The drivers at the taxi stand in Ballygunge refused to take us to the hospital, said Das. One of them, who claimed to be the leader of a union, told us that they could not take a risk because of the strike. 																								With the taxi drivers refusing to respond to repeated pleas, they arranged for an auto, which was slowed down and forced to take a detour by the Bijon Setu accident and its aftermath.																								Bimal Guha, president, Bengal Taxi Association, later said: The refusal of the child was inhuman In an emergency, taxi drivers should help commuters.

 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Kasba mourns its felled constable
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								A pall of gloom descended on the Mandal home at Purba Pally, Haltu, in Kasba, on Friday. 																								Alpona Mandal, 52, unaware that her only child Tarun was dead, could not understand why her daughter-in-law Indira was suffering fits. She decided to wait for some news from the local police station.																								Constable Tarun Mandal was one of the five Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel killed in an avalanche and landslide on Wednesday night in Uttaranchals Bhageshwar district. Nine others were injured. 																								The 14-member team had set out on a trekking expedition to the Sunderdhunga glacier on June 1 from the city, and was scheduled to return on June 13.																								Taruns body will probably reach home before June 13, said a tearful Ujwal Mandal, Taruns cousin. The late constables two-and-a-half-year-old son Souhardya was in a playful mood. A steady stream of visitors recalled the dead constables youthful exploits.																								Having joined the RAF in 1994, Tarun was the only earning member of the family after his fathers death. He was popular among acquaintances and was a good sportsman, excelling in swimming and athletics. He loved trekking. Only last year, he had successfully completed an expedition to Barasu Pass, in Himachal Pradesh.																								Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Sanjay Mukherjee said: Bhageshwar district magistrate L. Fania had informed us about the accident in a fax message, confirming that five were dead and nine were injured. The Calcutta Police team, led by deputy commissioner of police Jawed Shamim, reached Nainital at around 4.30 pm. A second team is on stand-by. 																								The RAF trekking team, on an unofficial trip, had camped in tents near Sukhram Cave on Wednesday night, when they were buried under an avalanche.

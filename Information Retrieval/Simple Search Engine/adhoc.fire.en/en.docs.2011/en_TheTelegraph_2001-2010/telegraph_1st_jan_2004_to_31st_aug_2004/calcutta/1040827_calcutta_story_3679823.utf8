 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Hospital in Rajnis crossfire
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Lawyers on behalf of the accused doctors in the Rajnis Patel death case on Thursday blamed the lack of infrastructure at state-run hospitals for the death of the budding cricketer.																								Defence lawyers Amitava Ganguly and Dipit Bose picked on the apparently contradictory statements made by Rajnis father Manoj Patel in a memorandum to the West Bengal Medical Council and the official complaint lodged with the police. They sought to make prime witness Patel admit that the lack of infrastructure at SSKM Hospital was behind his sons death.																								Rajnis, 17, died at SSKM on June 2, 2003, in the wake of five botched surgeries in four months after a shin-bone fracture suffered on the cricket field during a practice match.																								Patel, however, denied having any doubts about the hospitals role in his sons death. 																								Ganguly then asked Patel about the report he submitted to the medical council, alleging that Rajnis had died of negligence. A friend had drafted the memorandum... I had signed the draft and submitted it to the council, Patel said.																								He admitted having read the memorandum before signing it, but added: I do not remember all the points mentioned. I also do not recall if I deferred at all from any point in the two reports.																								The defence then started to read a passage from the report submitted to the medical council. At this point, public prosecutor Naba Kumar Das raised an objection: the defence cannot pose a question from a document that was not placed before the court as evidence. 																								An argument on the issue ended the days proceedings. Sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh adjourned the court till August 31.

 Sunday, June 27, 2004 Wow watering hole to woo family
Club SandwitchDuring the Second World War, the club offered relaxation to tired service officers on leave. In 1941, it was honoured when a fighter aircraft was named Calcutta Swimming Club (CSC) in appreciation of the clubs contribution to the war effort.The CSC has come a long way since the days of the Raj when it was known as The Calcutta Swimming Baths, founded by a group of city merchants headed by A.H. Willis and Walter Davis of Hamilton and Company. It was declared open by Lt-Governor Sir Stewart Bailey on May 24, 1887.A unique tradition at the Swimming Club down the years has been the almost automatic admission of members children to the club once they turn 21. The growing numbers prompted an extensive expansion in 1994, with a pub-bar, banquet room, card room and a large dining room.Circa 2004 has seen the rollout of a new-look Main Bar in a young and vibrant avatar, a salute to changing times. During the British period, the Main Bar had a more pub character, distinctly male-dominated, which was retained till the early 90s. We have tried to give it a bright and colourful look with a more spacious feel to draw the family crowd, explains club president Nandu Belani.The bar was rather drab and too simplistic earlier. Through conservative surgery, I have tried to instil a bit more life into the place and encourage the adda culture, says architect Dulal Mukherjee, who has drawn up the makeover design solution for the bar. The new ceiling has fewer folds, but has been dolled up to add to the spry ambience.Splashes of riotous red on polished wood, brackets with metal sheets, old wooden panelling to exude a floating effect, glass panels on windows with roll-top curtains, Lavante marble on the bar counter and frosted glass with concealed lights add to the drama.The entrance door has etched-glass panels from ceiling to floor, to lend an aura of vastness and grandeur, and I have also used etched glass on the mirror at the bar counter to add to the brightness, Mukherjee adds. The flooring is a rare combination of three different elements  polished ceramic tiles, wooden panels and thrown-in carpets.In keeping with the transformed mood at the Main Bar, the club management is ready to do up the banquet hall above it as well, with Mukherjee to anchor the renovation.

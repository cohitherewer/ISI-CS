 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 				 	 Revamped heritage hall Minerva will house an Utpal Dutt museum. A Telegraph picture																								With the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) buying back Minerva theatre at the chief ministers behest, there are lofty plans of renovation being drawn up. Also on the cards is a museum on Utpal Dutt.																								Following a discussion between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM parliamentarian Sudhanshu Sil, the CMDA, which wrested ownership of Minerva on Monday, plans to invite concepts from the world over on ways to renovate the decrepit playhouse and turn it into a state-of-the art theatre.																								It will be a Rs 2-crore revitalisation scheme for the 130-year-old rangamancha in north Calcutta. After renovation, it will be handed over to the information and culture department of the state government, Sil explained.																								Earlier, it had been planned that the CMDA, after buying the hall, would hand it over to the state government and the information and culture department would carry out the renovation. Now, a rethink later, the CMDA itself will carry out the job.  The Utpal Dutt museum is part of the rejuvenation process, elaborated Sil.																								The CPM state committee and the Calcutta district committee have directed the partys Rajya Sabha MPs to extend financial support from their local area development funds for the hall.																								Sil said that for the first three months after renovation, theatre groups would be invited for performances. They will only be charged for the air-conditioning. With 300-odd jatra troups in the vicinity, there is ample scope for good business at the revamped hall. 																								The Palkiwals and the Vinayaks, who had purchased the hall on a sprawling 23 cottahs at Rs 50,000 in 1940, handed it over to the CMDA for Rs 1.25 crore on Monday, following a court order.																								The move for the new-look Minerva was kick-started by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in December 2001, when he had entrusted Sudhanshu Sil, then chief whip of the CPM in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, with revamping the hall on Beadon Street. 																								Minerva is a heritage structure, set up in 1873. Currently there are 26 employees in the 750-seater hall, which is run by a trustee of employees, each of who earns only Rs 20 per show. 																								The hall lost its value in terms of landed property in the real estate market after it was declared a heritage structure. But once the structure is revamped, Minerva will look at sunnier days ahead, and theatre fans at a new destination.

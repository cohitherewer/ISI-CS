The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 Life - Social RegisterKnow your best friend 
SOMA BANERJEE, SANGITA S. GUHA ROY AND MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA Some of the glittering pieces at Trendsmith, where the session was held on Tuesday. Picture by Rashbehari DasDiamonds may be a girls best friend, but this pal may be keeping more secrets than most women realise. To dispel some common misconceptions, a coffee meet for the ladies of the Time  Talent Club, Calcutta, was held at the Trendsmith jewellery boutique on Loudon Street.And the results, for some, were less than happy. After the ladies lapped up tips on identification and upkeep of jewellery, some women decided to get their precious stones tested on the spot. For one, it ended with the unhappy realisation that the rock she believed was a diamond was actually topaz!Members of the club (which participates in social gatherings, organises fund-raisers and semi-educative talks) were all ears as jewellery designer Varda Goenka shared the knowhow on identification and upkeep of diamonds and precious stones.For those wary of buying diamonds for fear of being duped, a simple test was suggested. Draw a straight line on a blank sheet of paper, place the diamond on it and check if you can see the straight line through the diamond. If you can, the piece is a fake while if refraction renders the line unclear, theres your original diamond, explained Varda.And as every woman knows, the more carats, the better. Cuts may vary from round to marquee to polki. English cut diamonds with 58 facets are supposedly some of the best kinds of diamonds. But while Amsterdam is commonly believed to be the diamond hub of the world, apparently, Indian diamonds are in great demand for their cuts.Some easy tips on caring for those beloved stones were also shared. They should be stored separately to prevent the prongs from breaking and are best washed with warm water and soap.Precious stones like ruby, emerald and sapphire were also on the agenda. Sapphire can come in shades of white, yellow and pink as well as blue while opals change colour with time. Emeralds are very brittle and must be cleaned with a soft toothbrush dipped in warm water. Pearls, on the other hand, must be tied in a thin, muslin cloth and aired regularly. They should also be re-stringed at regular intervals and never kept sealed in polythene bags.The ladies, who were excited to learn that Amitabh Bachchan wears a blue sapphire on his finger for good luck at all times, had a number of questions about which stones can be unlucky, and which are believed to bring good fortune. One of the dishes at the Taj Bengal South African food festival. Picture by Rashbehari DasFreedom feast  When South Africans want to eat vegetarian food, they order chicken might be a common joke, laughs chef Anna Trapido, but that is about all it is. The South African food festival at the Taj Bengal till April 27 throws up a fair share of vegetarian dishes too, owing, apparently, to Indias influence on South African cuisine.The festival, part of a celebration of friendship between the African nation (celebrating 10 years of freedom as a democratic country) and India has more evidence of old ties. Nelson Mandela has always been inspired by Gandhi, says Desmond Monde Nxiweni, South African Deputy High Commissioner to India.Back to the fare, Durban food is a little on the spicier side owing to a huge Indian population settled there, adds Desmond. The mish-mash of many influences is also a result of deep divisions caused by apartheid and climatic and geographical differences.But we are basically big meat eaters, admits Desmond. Barbecue or braai is one of their specialities. We Africans are basically fun-loving people and a lot of our social events centre around braais, where we eat a lot of grilled meat and fish cooked on open fire, he explains.For the main course, a curious little white tower arrives along with succulent lamb and salmon dishes. The tower turns out to be a sort of dry porridge, a staple in South African diet, made from maize meal. The chef recommends mixing it well with the Lamb Tomato Bredie (lamb and tomato stew), as by itself it could be a little dry. The food, borrowing heavily from both Asian and European cuisine, is mildly spiced, and is on the sweet-and-sour side.Tropical fruits are also widely used. Most of the desserts served at the festival have a generous sprinkling of fruits and exotic herbs. The succulent Malva pudding with macerated fruits (baked cake drizzled with brandy sauce, served with sweet wine and fruits) for example, has some deliciously caramelised figs and apples.Most of the fruits, vegetables and herbs, as well as some South African wine (a glass of which comes complimentary with every meal), have been especially flown in for the festival. Some mellow Alto Rouge or a dry Chardonnay helps wash it all down very well. The kids perfume range at Paradiso. Picture by Rashbehari Das Kiddie cologne  Pint-size means power in todays market, and the first kids perfumes have hit the Calcutta market to prove it.Paradiso Parfums at Camac Street has brought in a whole new range of childrens perfumes, imported from Spain.Nancy, Snoopy, Smurfs and other cute and cuddly motifs make it onto the gift packs, that include more than what most grown-ups get when they buy their accessories. The perfumes from Segura come in soft, fruity scents and are complemented by toiletries such as mild shampoos, body washes and toothpastes in strawberry and lemon, too.The products, made mainly in Taiwan, have been selling fast since they were introduced a fortnight ago. These make for very good gifts, explains shop manager Hasmukh Shah.Franchisee of Bombay-based import firm MKP Distributors, Paradiso Parfums, the one-stop shop for exotic fragrances feels the best part about the range is the packaging. Children and their parents absolutely love the peppy, vibrant colours and cartoon motifs that make it very attractive, especially as birthday gifts, adds Hasmukh.Eye-catching bottles with fluffy tiger, panda and monkey caps, are kid magnets. Add ons like tiny FM radios, swirl lipsticks, lip gloss, glitter nail polish and tiny hair accessories like clips and bands make it even harder to resist. The gift sets are a little pricey, at between Rs 575 to Rs 850, but stand alone bottles are available for as little as Rs 100.Club call NRIs will soon have a home away from home. Coming up near the Salt Lake stadium is an NRI club, which promises to be the first of its kind in the city.Conceived by Indian and Bangladeshi industrialists, the project, to open in a year, is being executed by the Calcutta-based Harryson Estates and Plazas. Apart from providing a comfort zone for NRIs, the club will adopt social programmes, supporting and sponsoring good causes, said Dipankar Roy, president, Harryson, unveiling the club recently at the Hyatt Regency.Six years in Indonesia and Singapore convinced him of the need to bring non-resident Bengalis, settled not only in the US but also in southeast Asia, together under a single banner. And if the Bengalis of the world unite, why leave Bangladeshis out? The Bangladesh-based Crystal Hotels amp; Resorts has been entrusted with the construction of the 30,000 sq ft tower-shaped club. If all goes well, two similar clubs will follow at Dhaka and Dubai.An NRI panel will screen applicants and take in enrolments for memberships. While the organisers prefer to remain tight-lipped about the membership fees at so early a stage, they point out that all information will soon be available at their website www.harrysonplazas.com, still under construction. The site will also be a platform for interviews and cultural interaction among NRIs.Members will get access to elegant accommodation, a top-line executive health club and specialist doctors who will make regular visits and address health seminars. Reshmi with her Nobel replicas. Picture by Pabitra Das Ancient touch Sometimes copies are not rip-offs. Sometimes they are meant to bring the common man in closer contact with the often forbidding world of heritage. To this end, Halo Heritage started up almost a year ago, creating replicas of museum pieces, to bring history into peoples homes. Now, it is spreading its net to include schools, in a bid to educate children about Indian artefacts.Curated by Reshmi Chatterjee, Halo Heritage retails from Swabhumi. Museums give us pieces from their collections, from which we first make a master copy. Then, we reproduce them in plaster of Paris or fibreglass, explains Reshmi. While the collection at the store concentrates on deities of archaeological importance, the pieces to be created specially for school will have some relevance to the curriculum.Many schools nowadays dont take their students to museums. But this can be the best way to give them a touch and feel of what they are studying, feels Reshmi, currently in talks with schools including South Point to set up a museum corner. Here, fabricated models of fossils and historical objects can be devised in the form of a mobile exhibition. They will look as good as the originals, she promises.At the store, Reshmi not only makes replicas but also copies, inspired by pictures and research. She has also tried to recreate the most talked about relic of the day  the Nobel Prize. Others include a plaster reproduction of the character Patralekha, as seen in Khajuraho, with a sandstone finish. Prices range from Rs 50 to around Rs 2,500. Copyright  copy; 2002 The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 CESC unit trips, city in dark
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The city on Wednesday evening suffered widespread power cuts in the years first major disruption in supply, when a giant 250-mw unit at the CESCs Budge Budge generating plant collapsed after a mechanical fault.																								Sources in the CESC said the other 250-mw unit at Budge Budge had been shut down, as planned, for maintenance work from February 1. With no supply from the mainstay power plant of the private power utility, the shortfall in Calcutta and its adjoining areas rose to 165 mw around 6.30 pm.																								South Calcutta and large parts of central Calcutta were worst hit by the power crisis. Vast areas, including Golf Green, Jadavpur, Jodhpur Park, Ballygunge, Behala, Park Circus, Garden Reach and Entally experienced power cuts ranging from two to two-and-a-half hours. 																								Power cuts were also reported from north Calcutta, but their durations were less in comparison, because the CESCs power plant at Titagarh feeds a large belt of that part of the city. 																								To help the CESC cope with the crisis in its command area, the state electricity board supplied around 360 mw, which is about 140 mw more than usual. The CESCs own units generated 475 mw.																								Power department sources said if the two 250-mw units had remained inoperative during summer, the shortfall would have crossed 250 mw. The CESC sources said special precautions were taken to prevent power cuts at the Calcutta Book Fair.

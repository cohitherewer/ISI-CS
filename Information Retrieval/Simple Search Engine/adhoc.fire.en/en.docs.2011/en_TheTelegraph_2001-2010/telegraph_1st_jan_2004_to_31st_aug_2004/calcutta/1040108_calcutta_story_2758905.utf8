 A STAFF REPORTER																								Over 3,000 Rotarians, Rotaractors, Interactors and delegates from the UK, US, Australia and neighbouring countries will congregate for Sanskar 2004  the conference of values  at Nazrul Mancha from January 9 to 11. Organised by Rotary International District 3290, the three-day congregation will see Governor Viren J. Shah presenting a special award for vocational excellence to Padma Vibhushan Verghese Kurien. Among notable speakers at the meet are legal personality Abhishek Manu Singhvi, IIM Calcutta board member Aditya Kashyap, actor Victor Banerjee, industrialist Harsh Neotia, management guru and writer Arindam Chaudhuri and motivational speaker Harinder Singh.																								We are splitting the conference into 10 plenary sessions on topics of social relevance, said Feroze H. Ali of District 3290. Issues like corruption  eating into every sphere of our existence  and eroding family values will be analysed with critical inputs.																								Apart from the cutting-edge Rotary Narayana Sankara Nethralaya in Salt Lake, the Rotary district has set up several eye hospitals in and around the city, besides charitable clinics and schemes to provide artificial limbs. Under PolioPlus, Rotary Internationals global polio-eradication plank in tandem with WHO and Unicef, we have immunised thousands of children, said district governor Raj Kumar Rajgaria.																								The district has pledged 30,000 intra-ocular lens (IOL) implant surgeries under its avoidable blindness programme this year, of which Calcutta alone will get nearly 20,000 implants by June. A state-of-the-art blood bank is also coming up in Salt Lake, at a cost of Rs 5 crore, on the Nethralaya campus.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Ramananda Bandopadhyay, artist. Mercury and Mars make you intelligent, far-sighted and sharp. You are helpful and quiet by nature. You like changes in life  at work or recreation. You indulge in speculation and generally succeed. Money comes easily and goes easily, too. With you around, things generally get done quickly. Kusum Bhandari

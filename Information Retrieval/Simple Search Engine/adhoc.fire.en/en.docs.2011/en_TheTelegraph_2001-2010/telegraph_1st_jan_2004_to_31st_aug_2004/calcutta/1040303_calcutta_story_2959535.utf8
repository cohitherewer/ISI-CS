					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DASDancers perform at the inauguration of the Dakhshini food festival at The Kenilworth and (above) P. Govindan Kutty and Thankamani Kutty with some of the specialities from the same promotion 															Traditionally, Calcuttans have not been ones to shy away from trying out cuisines from other parts of India and in keeping with our penchant for experimentation, The Kenilworth is hosting a Dakhshini food festival at Saanjha Chulha and the Crystals. Eminent dancers P. Govindan Kutty and Thankamani Kutty did the honours at the inauguration of the 10-day long festival recently and a couple of dance performances were also put up to capture the flavour of the South in more ways than one. 																					Many believe that South Indian cuisine is essentially vegetarian. However, a stop-by at the Dakhshini food festival menu will dispel that myth. Theres a host of non-vegetarian delicacies on offer, including soups and starters. Those that deserve special mention are Kozhi Rasam (chicken flavoured spicy thin soup), Karai Kudi Yera Varuval (marinated prawns fried to perfection) and Kozhi Vartha Curry (tender chicken pieces tossed in pepper). Theres also Mutton Sukka Fry (pepper-fried lamb pieces) and Manoor Kozhi (deep-fried chicken seasoned with Chettinad spices). For vegetarians, theres Karuvapillai Podi Idli (mini idlis spiced with lentil powder and garnished with curry leaves) and Thenga Manga Pattani Sundal (peas with grated coconut and raw mango).																					The spread for the main course includes dishes such as Meen Polichadu (fish marinated and wrapped in banana leaves and grilled) and Kori Ghasi (chicken simmered in chilli-flavoured coconut milk). If you like prawns, you can go for Year Sura Masala (prawns and bottle gourd in sauce with South Indian seasonings) and Chemeen Moilee (prawn in tempered coconut milk). Traditional South Indian favourites such as Chicken Chettinad are also on offer for this course, as are vegetarian delicacies such as Kalan Pattani Melagu Peratal (mushroom and green peas tossed in pepper corn) and Vendaku Plusu (ladys finger cooked in tempered tamarind sauce). To end on a sweet high, theres a wide range of desserts, including Ada Pradhaman, a flat rice and milk preparation thats extremely popular in Kerala.																					l of this is whipped up by chefs specially flown in from Chennai. Lunch and dinner is served buffet style while snacks are a la carte. The buffet for both lunch and dinner is priced at Rs 349 per head (inclusive of taxes). The timings for the food festival, which is on till March 7, are: Crystals (lunch) 12.30 pm to 3 pm and Saanjha Chulah (dinner) 7.30 pm to 11 pm. 																					Those who enjoy South Indian dances are in for a double treat. The Kenilworth will showcase dances such as Bharatnatyam, Mohiniattam, Kathakali and Kalaripayattu at Saanjha Chulha between 7.30 pm and 10.30 pm every evening.

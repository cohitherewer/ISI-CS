 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								If the skipper of Bengals B-team has just bowled over industry captains in Mumbai, his deputy is padding up to do business in Dubai.																								Come October, state industries and commerce minister Nirupam Sen will lead a business delegation to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Put together in association with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), eastern region, the four-day trip will be the first such business mission from Bengal to West Asia.																								As the state has opened up to foreign investment, we think there is a need to explore new opportunities. Talks are on with the business communities in countries in the Asean, South Asian and European regions, so why not try out West Asia? asked Amitabh Khosla, regional director, CII eastern region.																								With chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee revealing his preference for foreign investment at various forums, strategists at Writers Buildings have realised the need to go beyond the boundaries with roadshows.																								We are looking at various options and we think there are opportunities in the UAE. Lets explore if they are interested in Bengal, explained Sabyasachi Sen, principal secretary, industries and commerce, who will accompany the minister on his trip to Dubai and Abu Dhabi.																								According to the CII-steered plans, the business delegation  a mix of government and industry representatives  will visit the free trade zones, hold meetings with the chambers of commerce, call on senior officials of multi-national companies and interact with the NRI community. The Indian High Commission is working with CII representatives to tie up the meetings. 																								Its an exploratory trip and we are looking at a host of sectors, ranging from manufacturing to IT industry, added Khosla, who has forwarded two more proposals to the government for similar trips to Singapore and Malaysia.

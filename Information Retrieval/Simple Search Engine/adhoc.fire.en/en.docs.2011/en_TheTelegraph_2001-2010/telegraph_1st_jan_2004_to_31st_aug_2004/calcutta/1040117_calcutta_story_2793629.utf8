																								It is to commemorate the anniversary of Saint Thyagaraja, for whom music was his muse, that Rasika Ranjana Sabha presents the Annual Music Festival every year. His innumerable kritis, composed in praise of Lord Rama along with Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Sastri, have been instrumental in enriching Carnatic music. The festival will be inaugurated this evening at 5.15 with a vocal recital by Sudha Raghunathan (photograph, left) who will enthrall music lovers with her ingenuous blend of tradition with what is termed modern. Over the next 10 days, Calcuttans will have the pleasure of listening to vocal performances by such stalwarts of Carnatic music as TV Sankaranarayanan (tomorrow at 5.30 pm), Anuradha Krishnamurthi (19th; 6.15 pm), the Malladi Brothers, Rama Prasad and Ravi Kumar (20th; 6.15 pm), the Saralaya Sisters, Kavita and Triveni (21st; 6.15 pm), MK Sankaran Namboothiri (22nd; 6.15 pm), Vijayalakshmy Subramanyam (23rd; 5.30 pm), OS Thiyagarajan (25th; 5.30 pm), Trichur V Ramachandran (26th; 5.30 pm), the Chennai Sisters, Meera Sivaramakrishnan and Latangi Jayamohan (27th; 6.15 pm) and a performance on the flute by the Sikkil Sisters, Kunjumani, Neela and Mala Chandrasekhar (24th; 5.30 pm).

 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Twin tax sops to vehicle owners
 SIMI KAMBOJ																								On the eve of the Calcutta High Court hearing on lifetime tax for two-wheelers and five-year tax for four-wheelers, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Wednesday issued two ordinances seeking to rationalise the contentious tax structure and provide immediate relief to vehicle-owners.																								The rationalisation of taxes is expected to cost the transport department Rs 20 crore.																								The West Bengal Motor Vehicle Tax Amendment Ordinance, 2004, and the West Bengal Motor Vehicle Additional Tax and One Time Tax Ordinance, 2004, that come into effect from Wednesday, also envision lowering of the penalty charged on late payment of the five-year tax on four-wheelers.																								In case of two-wheelers, the government has defined lifetime tax as what an owner will pay only once. 																								For older vehicles, the owners will have to pay the difference between the lifetime tax introduced last September and the one-time tax they paid earlier.																								Taking into account the popular resistance to the proposals and the courts critical observations, the government has also rationalised, in a graded manner, the penalty on late payment of one-time five-year tax on four-wheelers.																								Earlier, defaulters would have to pay an additional 25 per cent of the entire amount after the 15th day, 50 per cent after the 45th day, 75 per cent after the 60th day and 100 per cent after 75 days.																								Now, a defaulter will have to pay 25 per cent of the first years tax amount after the 15th day of default, 50 per cent of the first years amount after the 45th day, 75 per cent after the 60th day and 100 per cent after 75 days.																								If the default runs into the second year, the vehicle owner will have to cough up 100 per cent of both the first and second years outstanding amounts.																								In order to avoid legal complications, the ordinance clarified that it has a refund provision, both in case of removal of vehicle from state and for cancellation of registration.																								According to transport department officials, the trial court, which had declared the earlier ordinance ultra vires to the Constitution, had misinterpreted the language and construction of the rules, thinking they didnt allow for refund.																								The tax on four-wheelers, earlier charged at three per cent of market value, has been scrapped before Thursdays hearing.

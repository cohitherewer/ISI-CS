 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Escape from reality
																								EZCCs monthly theatre show for March 2004 features Kanch Ke Khilone, a Hindi play produced by Little Thespian. Based on Tennesse Williams famous play, The Glass Menagerie, it tells us of the fragile world of dreams we all inhabit, far removed from the trials and torments that reality confronts us with. The characters in the play form a glass menagerie, an assortment of glass trinkets and toy animals, who live in an imaginary world, living impossible dreams. Directed by SM Azhar Alam, Kanch Ke Khilone cuts across boundaries of time and space, offering us tragic insights into our own lives. It shows us how we persist in our efforts to escape from the pressures of the real world, clinging on to our futile hopes, that are inevitably extinguished in the end.																								Event: A play in Hindi, Kanch Ke Khilone, by Little Thespian																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, Salt Lake

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Umbrellas galore
																								Even as Calcuttans gear up to beat the oppressive heat with the oncoming monsoons, Gallery Kanishkas, in association with Hyatt Regency, Calcutta, presents Barsha  a celebration of the monsoons  with an umbrella-painting workshop featuring eminent artists of Calcutta. This unique workshop is being held in aid of Mentaid, an NGO working with mentally challenged children. The artists participating in the workshop include Suvaprasanna, Sipra Bhattacharya, Laluprasad Shaw, Prakash Karmakar, Wasim Kapoor, Sheila Kapoor, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Partha Shaw, Samit Dey and Madhuboni Chatterjee. The umbrella-painting workshop, with its cheerful connotations, is reason enough for celebration for a city that is readying itself to enter the drabness that is associated with the incessant rain that marks Calcutta monsoons. The workshop also marks the opening of a painting exhibition, yet again on the theme of the monsoons, showcasing the works of Subhashish Saha and Ashis Kirtania, whose painting appears above.																								Event: Workshop (today) on umbrella-painting, followed by an exhibition																								When: Till July 10; 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindustan Road

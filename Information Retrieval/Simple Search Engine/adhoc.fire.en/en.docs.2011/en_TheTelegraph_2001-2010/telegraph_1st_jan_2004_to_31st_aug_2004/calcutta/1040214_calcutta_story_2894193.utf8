 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Shyamal and Ananya (names changed on request) had a marriage negotiated by their parents last year. They moved to Pune, where Shyamal worked, and his parents followed suit. Soon, trouble started. Ananya, an MA in English, could not work and must only wear saris, her in-laws decreed. The couple is now on the verge of divorce, with Ananya telling marriage counsellors that she wants punishment for her in-laws, not her husband.																								Shyamal and Ananya are not alone. Legal experts handling such cases warn of a spurt in the number of broken marriages caused more by the in-laws than the spouse. At least six cases of every 10 are now turning out to be caused by friction between one of the partners and his/her in-laws, confirms Legal Aid Services (West Bengal) executive chairman Gitanath Ganguly. Most separations are now instigated and provoked by in-laws. So, counselling only the prospective bride and groom is of limited use, he adds, explaining why both sets of families should be involved in pre-marriage counselling.																								But the principal focus of pre-marital counselling remains the couple. Take a defence-sector doctor who beat up his wife, says counsellor Shampa Hazra. The doctor defended himself, saying a blow or two was a family tradition, adds Hazras colleague Anita Mukherjee. We later learnt that the family actually had wife-beating traits down a few generations. 																								It is here that pre-marital counselling can be of real help, says Ganguly. A history of marriages in both families, psychiatric disorders, medical (including genetic) problems and behavioural patterns can help couples understand each other better and know what to expect.																								Rita thought she knew everything about Pallab (names changed) as he lived a few blocks away from her Phoolbagan home. A few days into the marriage, Rita found out how wrong she was. Pallab would find some pretext to slip out at night and return in the morning. Rita later discovered that he was actually going back every night to his parents  and his first wife.																								With Calcutta High Court seeing around 2,000 petitions for divorce every year, counsellors say the stress must now be on pre-marriage counselling. 																								When couples come for post-marital counselling, the damage has often already been done, warns Ganguly.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Post-arrest martyr to mystery headache
 							 - Hospital switch by unwell Avtar A STAFF REPORTER																								Not cardiac pain, but an acute headache is bothering former national long-distance champion Avtar Singh, in disgrace after his arrest.																								Doctors and nurses, who have attended to him in three different hospitals during the past 24 hours, have expressed surprise that Avtar is not suffering from chest pain, the common complaint of almost all VIPs in police custody.																								It all started on Monday afternoon in court when Avtar complained of uneasiness and almost slumped. 																								He told the police that he was feeling unwell and rather weak and, hence, would not be able to answer their queries. He did seem fine, but suddenly he started complaining of uneasiness, said a senior police officer.																								Soon, Avtar was inside BN Bose Hospital, in Barrackpore, with a team of doctors dancing in attendance. 																								It seems that a bit of tension over his arrest and the subsequent prolonged interrogation got to him. We put him under medication and kept him under observation. A few medical tests, including an ECG, were carried out, said an attending doctor. 																								Nurses saw him speaking on his cellphone almost throughout his stay in the hospital, yet Avtar insisted that he was unwell. 																								When he demanded that all kinds of medical tests be done on him and that we should not give him a fit certificate without a thorough investigation, we decided to refer him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, the doctor added.																								Around 1.30 pm on Tuesday, Avtar went straight from BN Bose Hospital to the surgical emergency department of RG Kar Hospital. 																								There, too, doctors found nothing wrong with his health, yet decided to refer his case to the casualty block of the hospitals surgical department. 																								A team of medical practitioners failed to diagnose the cause of the strange headaches. Since his case was not related to surgery, doctors decided to refer him to SSKM Hospital, which has a proper neurological facility.																								Around 5 pm, Avtar was out of RG Kar Hospital, but only after making a few more calls and chatting with his friends over cellphone. He was soon shifted to SSKM Hospital, where doctors decided to make a detailed investigation of the mystery headaches.																								Around 7 pm, he was admitted to the hospitals Woodburn ward, usually reserved for VIPs. A team of neurologists will carry out specific tests tomorrow to determine if anything is really wrong with him, a senior doctor said.

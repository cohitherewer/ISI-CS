 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Justice and pay elude teacher
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Primary schoolteacher Pranab Sengupta, on a salary of Rs 21.75 per month since March 1973, is yet to get his rightful pay.																								Following the intervention of Calcutta High Court, the Basak Bagan Primary School teacher won his long-awaited appointment letter and was entitled to salary according to the existing pay-scale. There is no sign of that yet.																								His lawyer, Saibalendu Bhowmick, has moved a petition before Justice K.J. Sengupta of Calcutta High Court, alleging that the district primary school council of North 24-Parganas was deliberately flouting the order of the court, in order to harass the poor teacher.																								The advocate representing the council was not allowed by the judge to submit his version. Justice Sengupta made it clear that the order of the court should be carried out first.																								The judge then passed an order directing the chairman of the council to disburse the salaries of the teacher within a fortnight. The judge inquired how Sengupta was managing on such paltry pay. He is all but being forced to beg, said Bhowmick.																								And the chairman (of the council) is still getting the salary? How funny, observed Justice Sengupta.																								Bhowmick then informed the court that the former chairman of the council, Madhusudan Chakraborty, instead of carrying out the courts order, had written a letter to the headmaster of Basak Bagan Primary School in 2003, asking him not to allow Sengupta to take classes.																								Justice Sengupta asked the lawyer to file a supplementary affidavit on this matter.  I will look into the matter, the judge assured Bhowmick.																								Pranab Sengupta joined Basak Bagan Primary School, in Belgachhia, as a teacher of Bengali. Since then, he has been getting a monthly remuneration of Rs 21.75. In 1977, after the Left Front government came to power and the salaries of the teachers of the government-aided schools were raised, Sengupta was refused the revised salary.																								After waiting a few more years, Sengupta filed a petition in Calcutta High Court and the then Justice P. Mukherjee asked the education department to give him proper appointment.																								Later, an affidavit was filed by the secretary of the state education department, informing the court that the district primary school council had been told to give Sengupta his appointment letter.

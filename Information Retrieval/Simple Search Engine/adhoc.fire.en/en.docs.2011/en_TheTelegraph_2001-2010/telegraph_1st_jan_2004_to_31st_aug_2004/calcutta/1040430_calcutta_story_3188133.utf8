	Quite a few old trees were uprooted in the last Norwester in the city. This caused damage to kutcha houses as well as power supply lines. It is seen that if saplings are planted on an incline along the roadside, they grow at an acute angle to the road surface, leaning on nearby structures as they branch out. Their roots are not strong enough to withstand even a gust of wind. Authorities should be careful with the job of planting saplings along the roads.

	I have been buying milk from the Harin-ghata milk depot for three decades. In the past few months though, the price has gone up by 20 per cent but the quality has dipped to an all-time low. While the depot boasts of good infrastructure, why is the milk quality deteriorating? I have a hunch that this undertaking will very soon share the fate of many other state government firms that have been pushed in the red after neglect in management.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Curtains amp; encore
 A STAFF REPORTERThe lobby of the renovated Paradise. Picture by Aranya Sen																								One street. Two halls. Two destinies. One changing with the times, the other timed out by change.																								The multiplex boom has delivered a crippling blow to the cringing central Calcutta halls, and Orient, on Bentinck Street, has already bitten the dust.																								Yet, separated only by some eateries and shoeshops, another hall is rising from the ashes of fading footfall and mounting losses  on a revamp booty of close to a crore.																								And how. Step into the first-floor lobby at 39, Bentinck Street, expecting the dark and dank, and you are greeted by bright orange shades, complete with coffee corner, food counter, channel music and a lounge.																								Make no mistake. This is Paradise, not INOX. The Thursday matinee is going 65 per cent full and the audience is gaping at Preity Zinta pirouetting around Hrithik Roshan in new-found comfort.																								Discarding its familiar shabby, gloomy look, the 1,118-seater Paradise is sporting a chic interior washed in soft light. Next to the lobby is a lounge, with cosy sofas, where people can hang out before catching a movie.																								Apart from coffee corner Caf Paradiso, a food counter stocking snacks, pastries and soft drinks has also been readied. Work is in progress on the ground-floor lobby, and the authorities are also toying with the idea of introducing high-back seats with popcorn-holders, to give its audience the multiplex feel.																								The makeover move has been on in a phased manner for the past three years. A sum of Rs 40 lakh has been spent in the first two phases, in which we have installed Dolby digital sound, upgraded the screen, projection systems and air-conditioning, upholstered the seats, and revamped the first-floor lobby, says Arun Mehra, director, Paradise. We plan to pump in Rs 55-60 lakh in the third phase.																								And theres no doubting what the target audience for the turnaround is. The focus is on the young crowd, stresses Mehra.																								Paradise has indeed come a long way. The cinema that opened its doors in 1937 with the Devika Rani-Ashok Kumar-starrer Achhyut Kanya and screened it for a record 38 weeks, has had a chequered run. Business slumped drastically in the 1990s, with C-grade films the order of the dismal days. The past few years have been better, with blockbusters, a box-office boost and now the new look and feel.																								And the change with the times has already started yielding results. The footfall has increased and movies like family fare Baghban and dare-bare Murder have done well. quot;We are targeting the middle-class audience which does not have the spending power to catch a movie at INOX, quot; admits Mehra.																								 quot;The sound is good, the screen is great. You buy popcorn for Rs 10 and watch a film for Rs 50 in cool comfort. And there are car park facilities as well. In what way is Paradise less than a multiplex now? quot; demands Mehra.																								 quot;But if the market dictates, we might turn the hall into a multiplex in future, quot; he does add.																								Forget revamp, the faintest hope for resurrection has already been buried at neighbouring Orient. This May marked The End for the hall a decade younger than Paradise.																								 quot;We had 9,25,000 viewers in 1996-97, which dropped to 2,97,000 in 2003-04. We are not being able to meet the expenses of the AC plant, electricity and more than 30 employees. Our collections used to depend on the dress circle viewers who have deserted us over the past four to five years. We will not open the hall any more. Single screen theatres are a loss-making venture now, quot; says Lalit Kankaria, proprietor of Orient.																								 quot;Cinema going is not only about movies any more. Its the total entertainment that multiplexes provide that matter. My audiences are now flocking to INOX. We had also charted out an upgrade route and installed Dolby sound, new AC plant and improved projection system. But that didnt help much, quot; he adds.																								What will happen to Orient is not quite clear yet. quot;Perhaps we might turn it into a multiplex some day But nothing has been decided yet. We are busy settling our legal hassles, quot; says Kankaria.

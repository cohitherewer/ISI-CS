					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DAS Shreyashi Swaika (left) and Aditi Saraogi with some of their creations from the Bhukriti exhibition at Grain of Salt The desire to express her creativity in form and texture is what inspired Aditi Saraogi to pursue pottery, not only a subject of interest but as a profession as well. Abandoning her career in commercial communication, she first trained under a professional potter and thereafter, under the illustrious Mansimran Singh of Andretta Potteries and Delhi Blue Pottery Trust, founded by Sardar Gurcharan Singh, Indias first studio potter. In mid-2001, Aditi started Bhukriti, which held its fourth pottery exhibition recently at Grain of Salt, the multicuisine restaurant at 22, Camac Street. 																					The items on display at the exhibition are created by Aditi herself and Shreyashi Swaika, who joined Bhukriti last year. Specialising in pottery, Shreyashi graduated from the Apeejay School of Design in Delhi and went on to train at the Lalit Kala Academy. A stint at Ceradcor, Delhi was then followed by an internship at Delhi Blue Pottery Trust.																					The theme of the exhibition at Grain of Salt was the five elements and through their work the two designers have paid tribute to air, wind, water, earth and fire. Most of the artefacts including lamps, vases, bowls and platters are functional. Says Aditi, Theres no need to take special care while using the pieces. They are good enough for regular use and our plates are even microwave-friendly.																					Aditis creativity and passion are reflected in her creations. There are bookends shaped like flames, symbolising fire and depicting the power to purify and destroy. On the other hand, Shreyashi specialises in figurines and glazes. 																					The exhibition will continue till today and for those who miss it, Bhukriti creations can be found at such stores as Coriolis and The Address in the city. Chef Surinder Singh with a platter from the ongoing enchilada promotion at The Poolside Barbecue at The Taj Bengal												Viva la MexicoThere arent too many places in the city where one can sample authentic Mexican food. As a result, a Calcuttans knowledge of the cuisine doesnt extend much beyond the rudimentary tacos and nachos. All that, however, is about to change as The Taj Bengal is hosting an enchilada festival at The Poolside Barbecue, which provides gastronomes an opportunity to savour one of the most popular Mexican preparations the world over.																					Enchiladas are tortillas dipped in chilli sauce, stuffed with meat or cheese and then rolled up. All rustled up under the watchful eye of executive chef Surinder Singh, the choices on offer at the promotion include Road House Enchilada (made with grilled turkey, liberally garnished with ranch-style tomato salsa and seasoned with Serrano chilli), Enchilada San Marino (fresh river prawns with a dousing of Mexican barbecue sauce) and Country Side Texas Enchilada (ancho-spiced minced lamb and red salsa). There is also the slightly exotic Enchilada Pedro Lopez, which is made with lemon-flavoured fresh salmon tossed in cilantro sauce.																					Vegetarians are spoilt for choice as well with Phoenix Rising Enchilada (pan-grilled zucchini, pablano chilli, iceberg lettuce and refried beans), Dynamite Enchilada (jalapeno chilli and Monterey Jack cheese with green lettuce) and Sunrise Enchilada (American corn flavoured and spiced with Chipotle chilli and Mexican salsa) being listed on the menu. In addition to all these, weight-watchers can dig into the low-fat enchilada thats made with tofu, red Mexican chilli and salsa. 																					The non-vegetarian enchiladas are priced at Rs 500, while vegetarian choices would set you back by about Rs 450. You can even make your own enchilada and here, the choices take in prawn, steak, lamb, zucchini, babycorn, potato and more. In this case, however, the prices are upped slightly to Rs 525 for non-vegetarian enchiladas and Rs 475 for vegetarian options. All enchiladas are served with Mexican rice, guacamole, picode gato and red and green salsa.																					The festival will continue till February 29. For reservations, call 2223 3939. Hairstylists busy at work with clients at the all-new Sunflower 												In full bloom																					Sunflower is one of the oldest Chinese salons in the city, having been working wonders on listless locks for the last 28 years now.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Exploring dramatic forms
																								Since the beginning of the last decade, the Bengali stage has witnessed a revolution of sorts, offering experiences of a nature hitherto unknown to the audience. Breaking away from traditional theatrical forms, we find that newer, more flexible styles have been adopted, creating a livelier atmosphere on stage, replete with music, dance, rich physical movements and brilliant recitals of verse. Nandikars production of Jasimuddins Sojon Badiyar Ghaat represents a landmark venture in this direction. The dramatisation of a verse tale, it not only brings to the fore the histrionic skills of those on stage, but helps us understand and rediscover Jasimuddins poetic genius. Interpreted in context of the times we inhabit, this tragic tale of unfulfilled love depicts an even more bitter and cruel reality  it shows us how communal evil can wreak havoc on humanity with its furtive or blatant machinations. Directed by Goutam Halder and with Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta and Sohini Halder, amongst others, in the cast, this play, based on a folk poem, blends the simplicity of rustic life with profound meaning, providing a truly captivating dramatic experience.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Sojon Badiyar Ghaat, produced by Nandikar																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

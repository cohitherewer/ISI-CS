 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Blending ballet with kathak and samba
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Katy Barnard shows a few dance steps to participants at the Calcutta School of Music workshop. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The smudge of sindoor on Katy Barnards forehead belies her recent arrival in the city. But then, initiation into world culture  at age five, when the dancer expanded her repertoire to include samba from mere ballet  ensures she can find her feet in at least 20 countries with ease.																								Ballet, samba, flamenco, kathak, Russian folk and Afro-Haitian are a few of the 20 forms Katy has mastered. She was in town till Sunday, on a five-week visit to learn Odissi and share with children at the Calcutta School of Music a taste of world dance, as she sees it.																								Katy started ballet lessons at age three, samba at five, flamenco at eight and kathak soon after. The San Francisco-based Chitresh Das was her mentor for the Indian form. When I was two years old, I apparently stood up at my grandmothers funeral and started dancing. My parents put me in a dance school then, recalls the New Yorker, who looks far younger than her 26 years.																								Around 20 children from the Indian and western dance classes were present through the three-day workshop at Calcutta School of Music. Katy taught them the basics of a few techniques, including samba, the Brazilian capoeira and even the Chinese walk.																								Her background in Indian forms makes it easier to communicate with the kids. When teaching a form they arent familiar with I can tell them to hold their arms as they would, say, in kathak, explains Katy, who holds a degree in world dance from the University of California at Los Angeles. The students put up short segments on Saturday, when their visiting instructor also performed.																								The agile American, now in Mumbai for a series of workshops, is happy not specialising in any one form. I am best at doing everything, she admits. 																								Learning those dances that represent the most number of people is her goal, to be able to incorporate all elements to reach out to US audiences. American culture is a mix of so many cultures. But we are losing it, because pop culture is such a strong force, she says. If one can finally infiltrate the music video with traditional elements, this trend may be reversed, she smiles.

 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Melodies that motivate
																								To commemorate the auspicious occasion of the installation of Sri Aurobindos relics at Lakshmis House in 1977, Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture hosts a programme of songs by Nupurchhanda Ghosh. A popular singer of the devotional and patriotic numbers of Atulprasad Sen, Rajanikanto Sen, Dwijendralal Roy and Dilip Roy, among others, she has, for the last 20 years, sought to preserve the musical legacies of these aesthetically endowed poets through passionate and soulful rendering of their lyrics. Ghoshs emotive voice throw brings out the true essence of each song, whether it is one full of devotional fervour or one with strong patriotic sentiments or simply an ode to the beauty of nature. Her complete dedication and emotional involvement with the songs infuses life into the lyrics, vividly articulating the profound meanings and expressions contained in them. A deeply personal identification with the moods and emotions enables the rich lyrics and moving melodies acquire a depth of meaning and significance that transports them to a plane that is inspirational and sublime.																								Event: Songs of Atulprasad, Rajanikanto, Dwijendralal and Dilip Roy by Nupurchhanda Ghosh																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture, Regent Park

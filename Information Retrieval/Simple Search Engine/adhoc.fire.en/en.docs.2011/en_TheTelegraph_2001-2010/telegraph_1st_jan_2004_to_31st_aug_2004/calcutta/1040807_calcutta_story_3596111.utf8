The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 07, 2004 Naughty nooks for tiny tots
Baby's Day Out Little ones have a ball at Kool Kidz at Forum. Picture by Amit Datta I cant go. The kids are at home, is no longer an excuse to not have fun in Calcutta. Be it a workout in the gym or a splash in the pool, going to the movies, having a meal out with friends or just a shopping spree, there are plenty of places to leave the kids. They can mingle with others their own age  toddlers or teens  have some fun, freak out or learn, with attendants watching over them. Kids corners, kids zones or play zones, the names are many, the aim is the same. Let the kids be by themselves while the adults do their own thing. Although Pantaloons wrapped up the Kool Kidz corner at Gariahat, plans are on to restart it. There are several others around town, with more on the cards, including those at City Centre and Enclave in Alipore. One word of advice: not everythings available everywhere. To keep them busy for a few hours, theres an adequate amount of physical, creative and fun action. If you want your kids to brush up on their reading skills, chuck some books into the backpack.ForumThe second, and currently the only, Kool Kidz hangout in the city for 12 months to 14-year-olds. The theme is the jungle, with outdoor and indoor facilities and segregated areas for toddlers and the older children. Pride of place goes to the Jungle Gym, which has 25 different physical activities. Special flooring, a kids caf with a special menu featuring delicacies like teddy-bear cookies and alphabet fries, developmental toys made of safe materials for tiny tots, a crafts corner and computers with educational and entertainment CDs are the other offerings.OcioWhen it comes to a hi-tech playhouse, this is the destination. The members only tag should not put you off at Calcuttas only leisureplex, because day use of the facilities is open to all, at a cost. If the gym, spa and pool dont appeal to the youngsters, then leave them in the play zone. The toddlers have their own area, with plastic toys. But the older lot have a real feast  two 3-D play stations and three computers with LCD panels and high-configuration RAMs for high-speed games. The I-toy is a treat, requiring only hand movements in the air in front of a camera to play the game.Shoppers Stop The kids playpen in the anchor store of City Centre aims to keep the children occupied and looked after while the parents can shop till they drop. The play area is for children up to the age of 10, but is most suitable for three to seven-year-olds. The toys are a mix of cars, balls, blocks for various ages and both boys and girls. The Mamas Room provides special help for mothers with infants to enable them to shop freely.Clown TownThis is the ultimate family fun park, with something for all ages. But what about the little ones who are too young to go ice skating, go-karting or rifle shooting? Drop them off at Kiddies Kingdom, a play zone just for one to five-year-olds, so they dont feel left out. The indoor area has slides and riding toys, as well as large-sized soft toys to cuddle. The 3,000 sq ft bouncy is another option.Metro PlazaThis is where it all began in Calcutta, at the Megabowl, where the kids can freak out on coin machines and magnetic boards while the parents do their own thing. The bonus is prizes for winning the machine games, while the little ones can ride the scooters and cars.NISHA LAHIRI

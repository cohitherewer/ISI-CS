The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Speciality courses, topped with a job
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A two-year post-graduation course in financial or media management, with a years on-the-job work experience, plus a stipend, and the promise of a permanent placement at the end. 																								Too good to be true, perhaps, but thats exactly what a new institute in town promises. The International School for Business and Media (ISBM) has come to Calcutta after almost four years in Pune, and kicks off classes from July 1. Admissions are on.																								We want to expand to the other four metros in the next 12 months. We started with Calcutta because its emerging as a retail hub, so theres a need for the kind of courses we offer, says Pratap K. Gupta, ISBM director. But its not cheap, at Rs 1 lakh a year for the course, payable in two instalments.																								This year, 150 students graduated from our Pune institute (the total capacity is 300, with half in each year), and all of them are already in their new jobs. In fact, 140 companies visited our campus, as compared to 85 for our first graduating batch in 2002, adds Gupta.																								The specialisations for the full-time courses in the two fields range from retail management, sales and marketing, financial services and risk management and insurance, to media management and production, broadcast management and journalism and communication management and advertising. 																								And the companies that have shown willingness to provide students with work experience include HSBC, HDFC, Bajaj Alliance, Bata, ITC, UTI, ICICI, LG, HLL, Balaji Telefilms and even television news channels.																								The faculty, apart from in-house teachers, will comprise visiting lecturers from IIMC, XLRI and even respected names in Tollywood. 																								And the infrastructure, to be put in place by June 20 on the Salt Lake campus, in a leased four-storey building, will include a multimedia lab, studio, non-linear editing suite and digital library.																								For admissions, ISBM has a tie-up with XLRI for the XAT, CAT and MAT entrance exams. Those who werent in time  like many in the first Calcutta batch of 100  can sit for the institutes own test. 																								But we will emphasise on all-round development more than marks. So, there will be group discussions and personal interviews, too, adds Ranojit Lahiri, in charge of the Calcutta centre.

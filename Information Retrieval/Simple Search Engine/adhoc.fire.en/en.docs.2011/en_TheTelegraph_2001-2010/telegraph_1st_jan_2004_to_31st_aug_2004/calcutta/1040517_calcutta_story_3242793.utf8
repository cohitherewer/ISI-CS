The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 17, 2004 Social butterflies fly high 
				 	 June Maliah lets her hair down in the company of Bikram Ghosh at a popular hangout																								Pretty face or loads of attitude can help jazz up the dreariest of dos (and the party pages, as well), making instant celebrities of social butterflies.																								Things get even better when the party pin-ups are known in their own right (thereby rating high on the relativity factor).																								When it comes to food or freak out, cause or clowning around, theres a set celeb crowd that does the rounds of the city circuit. 																								There are some that are rarely seen, some who are often seen and a few who are seen everywhere. Again, there are some who are just no fun, some who are good to hang out with for a while and a few who are a riot.																								Were not saying where Bikram Ghosh and June Maliah figure on that party pecking order. But when The Good Life decided to crown a celeb couple of the week, the two won by a mile and a smile.																								For these past few days, theyve been spotted hair, there and almost everywhere worth mentioning. They do drum up quite a beat as a duo, but are seen going it alone more often than not, making way for interested hopefuls, if any.Drumming it upThe tabalchi sure doesnt believe in letting his fingers do all the talking. Gagman Bikram can be quite a horror when in the mood to pull a fast one (read: legs). Snappy one-liners to put people in a spot is his forte. So, if he happens to be gorging on mangoes he goes Dil mango more, and should you find that funny, he declares himself as a punny man. Polite small talk is quite a pain as well, for an inane how are things is met with a which things.																								Meeting up with old pals and fellow musicians for an impromptu jam session at informal gatherings are a few of the favourite things for this Xaverian, though. The addas may be missing of late but Bikram has not been far from the goodies that go with it, digging into exotic spreads on offer around the city.																								The seafood dinner at The Grand saw him in his elements, busy reading between the lines  or rather bed sheets  of Osho sermons or dwelling on the surreal sense of sinking into the bowl-like seating arrangements at a Japanese dining. The globe-trotter does love a nice helping of Japanese, Thai or Korean cuisine but goes for a half-baked meal in case thats missing, as he doesnt really have a tongue (when its not busy wagging, that is) for the staple Indian food.																								Bikrams taste in women is eclectic (or maybe electric). The musician recounts falling for this exotic looking lady from Guatemala dressed in loud colours, replete with a funky headgear. He wouldnt name the do where he bumped into this creature, so we cant pursue the fantasy trail of the musician whose tipple of choice is vodka.																								A drink too many gets his fingers going (toes snug in Blass and FireSide flats, as heels are an absolute no no in party dressing). Guests brace themselves for the ensuing racket, while waiters hurriedly clear the table, for plates, spoons and all kinds of cutlery make for good percussion instruments.																								Not one to fall for subtle gestures though, the indomitable party animal also makes do with chairs, tables or even a humble pencil.																								Its good advice to keep him at arms length when he is thus buzzing, for Bikram is highly taken in with body sound techniques these days, where unsuspecting cheeks, chests, shoulders and backs help him produce at least five or six different varieties of sounds. Live actRunning around trees is not enough, when in showbiz youve got to keep up the tempo off-screen as well.																								So even though June is tired of partying (!) and would rather spend quiet moments with kids back home, shes got to see and be seen at the hotspots around town, as you have to keep up your PR no matter what.																								Even if your heart bleeds for the frail actor, not too many parties can do without the glam quotient, and so if its January or July, Junes just gotta be there. 																								Not surprisingly, June simply loves the parties of Sanjay and Minu Budhia, Harsh and Madhu Neotia, Rita and Kishore Bhimani. We cant help believing her when she gushes they are the most brilliant parties around town, especially considering her rather exotic taste in refreshments.																								The lady, you see, only drinks red wines (French and Australian varieties being her favourites), with a stiff Margarita to boot. She does eat  or rather gulp  humble pie once in a while and go Indian, as its not always considered polite to go to a party and order the most expensive wine.																								When it comes to food, she would any day dive for Oriental and seafood, but doesnt mind settling for more mundane options on offer at most parties.																								The blandness bother extends to boys, as well. Calcutta is pretty sad where interesting men are concerned, June dares to declare. Shes kind enough to make a few exceptions, though. Whereas Bikram stands out due to his nice sense of dressing (oversized kurtas and frayed denim notwithstanding), Pepsi (Sabyasachi Mukherjee) is generally hot and Siddharth Basu is very charming.																								Like-minded people and old friends help set the mood for a chirpy evening when the night can be set on fire. Thus, the Tagore tribute organised at The Big Ben last week finds fond mention in her do diary, while the seafood dinner at The Grand put her on a trip down memory lane in the company of good friends Tota, Oindrilla, Tanusree and Bikram.																								Moody she may be, but June sure seems to have perfected her party act  sensuous drapes teamed with sexy bustiers or Priyadarshini Roa crinkled skirts merging seamlessly with long, shiny mane, and trademark dimpled smile.

 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Cops pin teenager murder timing 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								After extensive interrogation of the four persons arrested four days ago in connection with the Kuntal Sain murder case, police on Wednesday appeared more confident about the time span  four hours, from 5.30 pm to 9.30 pm  in which the murder took place on Friday evening. 																								Police suspect that Sain had a previous appointment with his friends, including Sampad Mukherjee and Arijit Pal, at a restaurant in the Kadamtala area, where he was to reach at 6 pm sharp. 																								He had also purchased some small gifts for his friends. It is possible the gifts were meant for a female interest, but we are not sure, a police officer said. 																								It is suspected that Sain had reached the restaurant with Mukherjee and Pal on his motorcycle. But they are not disclosing how they took away an asleep Kuntal from Mukherjees house. 																								According to sources, it is unbelievable that a person who has fallen asleep can be escorted on a motorcycle, and that, too, in broad daylight. It is also difficult to believe that the duo hired a Maruti van for taking Kuntal to Pakuria bridge. 																								Inquiries revealed that Sain reached the restaurant, met his friends, enjoyed a snack and left the place. Sain and his two friends may then have gone for a joyride on the motorcycle to Pakuria bridge, where they killed him, police said.																								The chopper used to kill Sain has been found and Mukherjee has confessed that it was provided by his mother Manjusha on Friday, police said. 																								It was also learnt that the fingers of Sains left hand were severed from his palm. 																								Police feel he tried to save his head from the chopper blow. That cannot be expected from a person who was asleep, a sleuth pointed out.																								Mukherjee and Pal have told interrogators that money was the primary motive of the murder, but that cannot be confirmed yet, said Howrahs superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya. 																								The Sain family has decided to send a petition signed by 25,000 Howrah residents to the President, Prime Minister, the Union home ministry and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seeking capital punishment for the killer duo.

 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Trucks collide, leave two dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons were killed and four injured, one of them seriously, when two trucks collided at the intersection of Rashbehari Avenue and SP Mukherjee Road early on Saturday.																								Police said reckless driving led to the mishap at around 2 am, even though the road was deserted on a holiday.																								Among those killed were pavement-dwellers Dipankar Halder, 35, and Santosh Saha. Sukdeb Sarkar, 38, also a pavement-dweller, was critically injured. 																								After the collision, one of the trucks, empty and belonging to a soft-drink company, overturned and was thrown by the impact on the pavement of Rashbehari Avenue.																								The other truck, laden with vegetables, was headed north along SP Mukherjee Road. The collision sent it careening to the right and it came to a stop some distance away.																								A group of people was sitting on the pavement near a tea-stall at the time, and the empty truck overturned on them. 																								Halder and Saha were crushed to death instantly, while four others were pinned under the heavy vehicle.																								A patrol van of Tollygunge police station was passing by just then. Using a Calcutta Tramways Company wrecker-crane, the policemen lifted the empty truck and rescued the people trapped underneath. 																								The policemen found themselves in a fix, since no other vehicle was available from the police station. 																								Luckily, a taxi was passing by, and the policemen flagged it down to rush the dead and injured to SSKM Hospital.																								Halder and Saha were declared brought dead, and three of the injured were released after receiving first-aid. 																								Sarkar, however, had to be admitted in hospital because of his critical condition. Police impounded both trucks.

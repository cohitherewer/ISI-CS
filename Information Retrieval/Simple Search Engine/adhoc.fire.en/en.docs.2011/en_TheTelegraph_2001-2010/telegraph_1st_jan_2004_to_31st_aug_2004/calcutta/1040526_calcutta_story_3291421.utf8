INOX Calcutta, on May 23, recorded the highest sales on a single day among multiplexes across the country. By the time the counters closed for the 10 pm show of Uff Kya Jaadoo Mohabbat Hai, the days box-office collections had soared to a cinematic high of Rs 6,54,180.																								The Sunday footfall pushed the citys lone multiplex to the top slot, nationwide, nudging out close competitor PVR Saket of Delhi.																								The rank was determined on the basis of trade collections from 22 multiplexes located in Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Pune, besides those in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Standalone theatres were left out of the numbers game.																								Delhis PVR Saket is tough to beat, as the multiplex has the highest average ticket prices and has often hit the Rs 7,00,000-mark in the past, disclosed an INOX spokesperson on Tuesday.

The INOX ticket slabs are flexible, varying with the timings and the banner of the movie. On Sunday, seats for Yuva were sold at Rs 180 for dress circle and Rs 200 for gallery.																								Calcutta has a very vibrant market for films. Our revenue is pretty high over the weekends and we have touched the Rs 5,00,000 mark on more than one occasion, revealed the INOX spokesperson.																								We hope to break our record this weekend, with the release of the Saif Ali Khan-Rani Mukherjee starrer Hum Tum and Twentieth Century Foxs The Day After Tomorrow, added Ravi Raman, general manager, INOX. 																								The week after, INOX would be banking heavily on the magic of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the might of Matrix Reloaded to better its record.

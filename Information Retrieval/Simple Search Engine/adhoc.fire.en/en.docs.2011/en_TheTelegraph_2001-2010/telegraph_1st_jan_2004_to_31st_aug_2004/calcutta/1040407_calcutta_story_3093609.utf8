 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Queen Mary II: History in motion																								Largest, longest, tallest, costliest. When Queen Mary II sets sail on its maiden westbound trans-Atlantic crossing on April 16, it will make waves for all the reasons a cruise liner can make history. And people round the world will be taken behind the scenes to witness the making of the historic structure on the same day on Discovery Channel. 																								The ship is luxury on water, explains Neeru Dhawan, corporate communications manager, Discovery India. With six restaurants, 14 bars and clubs, a basketball court, a planetarium-cum- cinema hall and a broadcasting studio, the liner is the first port of call for high living. And along with nationals of other countries, Indians have had a hand in setting up the lap of luxury. About 350 of them were engaged in air-conditioning the liner.																								The pleasures of the voyage are not just of the sensuous kind. It has $ 5 million worth of commissioned artwork. Cunard Line, owned by makers Carnival Corporation, has entered into a partnership with University of Oxford, to provide a programme of authors, historians and artistes to enrich the on-board experience, adds Dhawan. The experience, incidentally, comes at a price, with tickets costing between $ 1,500 and $ 30,000.																								The real-world entertainment channel has caught the trials and tribulations involved at every stage, from concept to conception, taking camera and crew on board as the ship was coming to life at the Chantiers de lAtlantique in St Nazaire, on the west coast of France. There were no lights, no fixtures when we started filming, Dhawan says. So the agony of pressing a wrong button during the speed test or the ecstasy of seeing the ship set sail for England at the end of three gruelling years are human moments that make the two-hour documentary. 																								Queen Mary II: Birth of a Legend is also a tribute to the engineering feat that the liner is. Its stabilisers and propeller shafts are designed to ensure that noise and vibration are at a minimum. Cunards earlier luxury liners, like Queen Elizabeth II, lost a lot of cutlery due to vibrations during choppy weather, smiles Dhawan. It is the first trans-Atlantic ship to use steel extensively, making up 52,000 tonnes of its 150,000 gross tonnage. Earlier, ships used aluminium, which may be lighter but ages fast. The $800 million ship has to last about 40 years for Carnival to recover costs, Dhawan adds. 																								For now, it is Queen Mary IIs maiden voyage, from Southampton to New York, that the crew and the passengers await. Those staying off board can watch the documentary at 8 pm.

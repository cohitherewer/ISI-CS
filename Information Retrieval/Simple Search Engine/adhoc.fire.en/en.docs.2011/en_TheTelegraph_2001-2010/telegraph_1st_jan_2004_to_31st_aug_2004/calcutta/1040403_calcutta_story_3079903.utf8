 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Court frown on Howrah water
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The green bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the Howrah Municipal Corporation to submit a report on the steps it had taken to supply bacteria-free drinking water.																								Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Bannerjee also directed the civic authorities to continue testing water samples collected from various public places.																								The court expressed its displeasure over a report, submitted on behalf of the civic body, on the quality of drinking water in the town.																								According to the report, water samples collected from several spots in the town, including Howrah General Hospital, were found not fit for human consumption. The method of the tests and subsequently, the report, did not impress the court.																								The bench, in its order, also asked the civic authorities to specify the time when the water sample had been collected. This part of the order was passed after petitioner Subhas Dutta told the court that if the water is collected during low tide, the possibility is that it will be of better quality. During high tide, sewage and drain water seep into the drinking water source.																								Dutta also sought an order asking Howrahs civic authorities to put up signboards at water sources, saying whether the water was fit for consumption or not.																								The judges told Dutta they would consider the prayer only after the civic body submits its report on water quality.																								The case relating to the quality of drinking water was initiated by Dutta in 1999, alleging that Howrahs civic authorities had failed to supply pure drinking water in the town.

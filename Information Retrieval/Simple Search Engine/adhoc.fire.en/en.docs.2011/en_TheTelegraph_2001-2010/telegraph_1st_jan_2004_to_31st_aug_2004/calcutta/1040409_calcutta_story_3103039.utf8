The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Witness to a war under cover against crime
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mouli Ganguly (centre) felicitates Dorjee and Kaur on Thursday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Adventurous, independent but committed to the family  shes all these and much more. The quintessential middle-class girl-next-door has taken up a career not too many women would dare dream of. 																								As Saaksshi in Sony Entertainments forthcoming serial, Mouli Ganguly will be a fair distance from what she has become famous for  bickering with her on-screen mother-in-law in Eakta Kapoors Kahin Kissi Roz.																								Happy to break off from her feminine and fragile image, the Mumbai-based Calcutta-born girl plays an undercover cop, chasing goons and even landing an occasional kick.																								At a city hotel on Thursday, Mouli met up with two real-life role models  deputy superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Jacqueline Dorjee and cab driver Jasbir Kaur																								Two women who have charted courses different from the run-of-the-mill. Both have chosen careers that often needs one to face stiff opposition from various quarters. Saaksshi is like them, too, said Mouli, who had earlier met a string of successful women from various fields in Mumbai and Delhi, as part of the Sony Entertainment-sponsored tour. 																								Nowadays, many women are eager to join the police force, but seats are limited, said deputy superintendent Dorjee, in charge of the immigration check-post at the Tetrapol.																								The perception of our male colleagues is also changing. Some appreciate our work, while a few others know we are good but would not like to admit it, added Dorjee, hinting at the challenges Mouli was likely to face while cracking a male bastion.																								The youth-oriented serial is in line with Sonys efforts to strengthen its weekend programmes. We were looking for a young face who could portray a lot of action but also be rooted to family values. Mouli was our first choice, said a Sony spokesperson.																								To play the perfect action cop, Mouli is taking tips on karate and shooting from professionals. I am trying to deliver the right kind of kick-box, not the type a tomboy would do. My trainers have asked me to do regular stretch-outs and avoid injuries, added the ex-student of South City College.																								For the time being, she is busy shuttling between Calcutta and Mumbai, juggling roles of two very different times and types  the other being Jaba in Sahara Manoranjans Shri Bimal Mitras Sahib Biwi Gulam.

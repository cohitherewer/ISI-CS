Picture by Amit Datta																								The real and the unreal play hide-and-seek in the works of New York-based artist Arun Bose, whose graphics and paintings from the Sixties up to the Nineties are being exhibited at the CIMA Gallery. 																								His canvases may depict the grimy walls of a Calcutta mansion that has sloughed off its coat of plaster, but a shaft of light being focused from the most unlikely direction could transport it to the world of shadows and fantasy.																								Jagged skyscrapers define the skyline of New York but time and again, Bose has returned to the scenes of his childhood and youth in central Calcutta, near Medical College. The mud walls of huts in Bengal and tiled roofs with roosting pigeons wander into his canvases.																								Brilliantly-coloured motifs from rituals appear in his viscosity prints. He is fascinated by the bizarre anatomy of Hindu deities. However, instead of yearning sentimentally for the milieu left behind, these images are rigorously structured with the severity of architectural drawings. One does not have to scrutinise his paintings to discover the geometric design that holds them together. 																								The 70-year-old artist, who is in Calcutta now, says: My paintings are apparently representational but they are actually non-objective. I like the way brick is laid asymmetrically. The rectangular shaft of light could have no basis in reality. The pigeon was added in the middle to improve the composition. Light and shade are two vital components of my work.																								His other inspiration is the splotches of grease and dirt left behind by the exhaust pipes of trucks. In New York, when you are driving behind a truck, you can admire the beauty of these designs and they have left their mark on my work, he says indicating the dark patches in his viscosity prints such as Bird, executed in 1996.																								After studying art in the Fifties, in 1962, Bose won a French government scholarship and learnt printmaking at Atelier 17 of William Hayter in Paris. He taught at the Indian Art College, but soon he left for New York with a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation. Now retired, for years he taught printmaking and painting at the City University of New York. Here, students like Bikash Bhattacharjee still remember Bose as their brilliant mastermoshai.

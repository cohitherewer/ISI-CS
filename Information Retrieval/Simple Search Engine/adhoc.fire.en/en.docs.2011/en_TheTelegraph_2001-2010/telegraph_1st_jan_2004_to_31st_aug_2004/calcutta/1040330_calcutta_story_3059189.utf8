Rahul Mohata																									Is Rahuls motto, as he believes in trying anything that comes his way, from tennis to academics, modelling to music. Giving 100 per cent is what matters most, as the 17-year-old strives to be the best. A born leader according to his teachers, he says his aggressive nature comes in handy. Of course, being the cool dude on campus, with a soft heart, helps.																									With substance is Stylo. The South Point student has been vice-captain of his house in Class IV, prefect in Class V and director of the school Interact Club in Class IX, and is now president of the club. Presi  another of his nicknames  also set up the nature club in school, and has just started walking the ramp at fashion shows in the inter-school fest circuit, winning a few laurels along the way.																									In his life are sports, studies and social work. Lawn tennis he plays regularly, winning tournaments for South Club, but cricket is the passion of the Sachin Tendulkar fan, as a member of the school team. Rahul can also be spotted in the swimming pool, sweating it out on the badminton court or being the cool cucumber at the snooker table. In the classroom, hes quite the teachers pet, ranking among the top ten for most of his school career. Not to mention his activities through the Interact Club. 																									Is what the Class XII student became on August 15 last year, with a phenomenal 56 community projects completed in one day, on the occasion of Indias 56th Independence, from donation drives to and eye check-up camps, winning the Interact Club a Green Kolkata Clean Kolkata prize. A great learning experience is how the Arian describes his voluntary duties, be it welfare work or organising the Interact fest, Udaan.																									Is not the only reason for his participation in acting and dancing at fests, since leading from the front is his slogan. His new-found passion for the drums is set to take a serious stage, as he gears up to join Calcutta School of Music. And while an MBA is on the agenda, a career in sports is what Rahul wants.

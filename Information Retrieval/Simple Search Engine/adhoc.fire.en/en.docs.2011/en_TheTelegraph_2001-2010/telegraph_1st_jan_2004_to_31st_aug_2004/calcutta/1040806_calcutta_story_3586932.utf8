The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Board a bus, dance with death
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY				 	 Peril point: The Howrah bridge approach road is a nightmare for commuter and pedestrian. Picture by Amit Datta																								Getting on a bus at Howrah station, the gateway of Calcutta, is a passengers nightmare.																								Non-existent traffic management, disorderly crowds, flowing filth The scene is a sharp contrast to what prevails at its twin station, Sealdah.																								Its a gamble with life for a passenger trying to board a city-bound bus or minibus on the approach road to Howrah bridge. Nothing unusual, given that more than 40 vehicles from 12 directions converge on the spot every minute.																								Earlier, people coming to Calcutta would prefer to take state buses, since they were considered faster than private buses or minibuses. 																								But now, getting a state bus is difficult during peak hours. 																								The reason: private buses of routes like 12C, 12C/1, 12C/2 and L 238 have been allotted stands in the terminus that block the channels for state buses. 																								It takes at least 20 minutes for a state bus to navigate the cramped lanes and come out of the station complex. 																								Passenger sheds have been occupied by encroachers, some of who have settled there with their families. They have even created makeshift mezzanine floors, with bamboo platforms. 																								The smoke-belching clay ovens of these squatters, as also of tea and snacks stalls  quite a few have sprung up on the left-over space  make the sheds unhealthy breathing zones for passengers who queue up for a state bus.																								People in a hurry are left with no option but to clamber on a running bus, state-run or private, on the Howrah bridge approach.																								We have repeatedly brought the matter to the notice of the police and sought their help to evict the encroachers, but nothing has been done, said S.K. Mitra, CMDA assistant engineer in-charge of the Howrah station area. 																								CMDA chief engineer Debasish Bhattacharya disclaimed all responsibility. Weve nothing to do with traffic movement in the area. The transport department looks after that. We maintain the subway and the bus sheds only.																								A CMDA engineer at Unnayan Bhavan, in Salt Lake, blamed the chaos on the local political leaders. Its because of them that Howrah hasnt seen any development over the years, while Sealdah has marched far ahead. 																								Deputy superintendent of police (traffic-I) Samir Mukherjee admitted that the CMDA had approached the district police for evicting the encroachers. But the squatters, vendors and the bus operators are being backed by various trade unions. It is not possible to take action against them without consulting the union leaders. 																								The encroachers and private bus operators were littering the station complex, he admitted. You can see for yourself how filth flows down the bus lanes. People have to wade through muck to get on to a bus, said CMDA assistant engineer Mitra.																								The CMDA has constructed a Sulabh public toilet complex that is rarely used. People find it more convenient to relieve themselves in the open.

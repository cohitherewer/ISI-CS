The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Social security for salaried
A.M. Raju				 	 A.M. Raju, regional provident fund commissioner, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Srabani Bose, Ranjit Chatterjee, G. Laha, Bimal Bhattacharjee, S. Chakrabarty and Amitava Saha				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Amitava Saha: What is the idea behind the introduction of provident fund (PF) for salaried persons?																																																			The concept of provident fund germinated way back in 1952 with the sole objective of providing social security to workers. It was later modified in 1971, when it was decided that the holder of a PF account could declare a nominee in case he dies or the amount in his PF account would be given to his immediate kin, for instance his wife. This increased the social security of the account-holders family. However the PF Act was again modified in 1976, when the insurance aspects were incorporated. Finally, in 1995, several other benefits were introduced for PF holders and their families. Children were granted nominee status for benefits like pension from the PF in case the account-holder died accidentally before withdrawing the entire fund amount.																																																									

Srabani Bose: I am a small employer. How can the few employees I have be brought under the PF scheme?																																																			To come under the scheme, you have to finalise a written agreement with the employees, citing the amount of contribution from both sides. The charter of your company should have a clause that the entire PF process will be regulated by the regional provident fund authorities, which empowers us to look after your case. There are also a few legal details that you need to look into.																																																									

Amitava Saha: The family pension scheme provided by the central government was globally rejected. Even the International Labour Organisation (ILO) recommended that the government drop the scheme. What is its present status?																																																			Yes, the ILO rejected the scheme because it gave children the benefits. It feared a crunch in central PF corpus. But the central government told the ILO that it could manage the burden of payment and continued with the scheme. As of now, the scheme continues and to date, we have not received any notice citing a change of procedure. Moreover, at present, life and health insurance and other monetary benefits are included in the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) scheme.																																																									

G. Laha: How many members does your EPF scheme serve?																																																			At present, there are 3.5 crore members. I must clarify that if the salaried persons are direct government employees, their PF is looked after by the auditor-general of the respective state. In case of central government employees, the fund is looked after by the auditor-general of the central government. We look after the rest, that includes employees of private institutions, semi-government offices and government undertakings. We also look after the PF of reputed private companies, who contribute to the employees PF. In West Bengal, there are nearly 35,000 such establishments with a facilitator strength of about 3.5 million.																																																									

S. Chakrabarty: Who regulates PF in the state?																																																			We look after the PF of companies where the employees are not directly recruited by the government. However, according to the law, we can handle the PF of a worker till his salary remains under Rs 6,500. This is creating confusion and we expect a way out soon by amending the guidelines.

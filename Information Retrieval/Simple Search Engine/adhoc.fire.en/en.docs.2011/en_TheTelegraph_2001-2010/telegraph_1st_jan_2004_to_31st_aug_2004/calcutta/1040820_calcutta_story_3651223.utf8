The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, August 20, 2004 On amp; OffScreen On amp; Off

	Goutam Ghose is going places  again. Impermanence, the film directors hour-long documentary on the Dalai Lama (picture right with celeb devotee Richard Gere), has been selected for the Venice Film Festival, starting September 1.
	 The film will be screened on September 7 and 8 in the competitive digital section. Impermanence is about love and compassion revolving around the Dalai Lama. I have tried to capture all his experiences against the backdrop of his Buddhist philosophy, said the film-maker who is preparing to attend the screening in Venice. 
	The film took off with the initiative of some of Ghoses friends who have funded the project as well. Between a host of other activities, Ghose has trailed the 74-year-old Buddhist monk since 1998, making a trip to Tibet and even canning some shots in Lhasa, where the Dalai Lama lived.
	 I had followed him to Europe and interviewed him in Dharamshala, where he lives in exile. And I have also tried to capture the latent contradictions between consumerism and faith in the Tibetan people which intrigues me a lot, said Ghose. I greatly enjoyed working with him. He is such a dynamic personality and yet retains a childlike innocence. Perhaps the film festival authorities will invite him, but I am not sure if the Dalai Lama will be able to make it to Venice. 
	Back from Venice, Impermanence may see a Nandan or a multiplex release.  Amrita Rao: A friendly turn
	Bollywood isnt that bad a place after all. When the Taurani brothers of Tips decided to produce another Ken Ghosh film after Ishq Vishk, they went right ahead and signed up the greater part of the dream team. Apart from Ken, they roped in Shahid Kapur, Anu Malik, Sameer, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan and Sonu Nigam to make Fida work as well as Ishq Vishk. But there was a glaring gap in the happy-family frame  no Amrita Rao. 
	But that didnt stop Amrita from going out of her way to help close friend Ken and the Tauranis in coming up with the film title itself: Fida. They were running short of titles and the one they were zeroing on had been used twice already  once in the 1970s and again in the 90s. So when I had gone with Ken for the recording of the song Balle balle, I told him, Dont worry, Ill think of the title. Then I consulted a friend of mine who knows Urdu and came up with Fida I think it really suits the film. If Amrita is upset about being left out of the Fida frame, shes not showing it. It really didnt matter. I am not on contract with Ken that he has to cast me in all his films. It all depends on whether I suit any of his characters in the film. At the end, the director is the best judge. 
	And if she didnt get to romance Shahid in Fida, she is doing just that in another film  Mahesh Manjrekars Life Ho To Aisi. Its really good to work with Shahid again. He has all the potential of becoming the next superstar, insists Amrita, echoing the line a certain Ms Kareena is known to parrot anytime, anywhere.  A still from Tumhari Disha
	Her father, Basu Chatterjee, created the first icon on Indian television with Rajani. His father, Dulal Guha, brought Raakhee to the limelight. No wonder Tumhari Disha, produced by the husband-wife duo of Rupali and Pintoo Guha, is being awaited with a lot of expectations. The serial is the saga of a girl who sacrifices her love in favour of her sister after she learns that she is not the biological daughter of the family. In fact, she is the daughter of a servant. Does the plot sound familiar? This is why. I was inspired by Bimal Roys Sujata. 
	It is my favourite film since childhood, says Rupali. But Disha, played by new-comer Chhavi Mittal, is not dogged by the stigma of untouchability like Nutan in Sujata. We have made the story a contemporary one. The issue here is of displacement, of how sudden revelations can change a life. Sujata can at best be called an inspiration behind the story, quot; Rupali clarifies.
	 There is something else in the serial that telly-watchers can look forward to. Dishas parents are Kanwaljeet Singh and Zarina Wahab, sharing screen space for the first time. We were batchmates at FTII, Pune. But in all these years we are working in the industry, we have not had a chance to act together. The only time was in a Nari Hira video film but that never saw the light of the day, recalls Kanwaljeet, who is balancing both big and small screen duties. 
	Rupalis earlier venture, Dil Na Jane Kyun, for the slot 64 Panne on Zee TV, dealt with the sudden disappearance of the man of the house, with a faint echo of another Bengali classic Ekdin Pratidin. 
	She had left the industry for academics and now she is back in films. It is her own decision, said Basu Chatterjee, who was assisted in his telly projects by his daughter. Tumhari Disha comes our way on Zee TV from Wednesday at 8 pm. 
	How long you last doesnt seem to matter anymore  on screen, that is. These days, ad films are packed with the best of talent from the world of films. Their screen life may be limited to less than a minute but the immediate impact is all. So, filmi technology at its finest is the need of the moment. And when LG CARE comes up with its first ad campaign involving its four flagship consumer brands  toothpaste, detergent, soap and shampoo  it goes on a tech talent hunt with a big shopper in hand. 
	To be aired in seven languages across all channels, the one-minute message  Lifes Good  is being churned out by the Chennai-based production house Tellywise. Designed by 850-ads-old art director Sabu Cyril, who was last seen bringing Calcutta alive inside the Chennai studios in Mani Ratnams Yuva, the film has been shot by cinematographer Manikandan of Main Hoon Na fame. 
	The jingle has been composed by veteran music director Anand and sung by Kunal, the voice behind Doodh Doodh Doodh and VIPs Bye Bye.

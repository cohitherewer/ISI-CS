 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Kaleidoscopic shades of life
																								Six young artists, who have worked on different media and variegated themes, come together for a painting exhibition at Academy of Fine Arts. They unfold various moods and images of mankind that, in recent times, have been relegated to the back of our minds. While Bhaswati Ghosh uses watercolour to lay emphasis on a world order achieved through meditation, Rupamala Singh experiments with colour and moods in her acrylic work on women. Sukanta Das displays realistic Krishna and women showing a surrealistic influence with a clear division and symbolic elements; Debashis Das talks about figures of daily lifestyle that are lost in the concrete jungle of modern civilization and a lifestyle that is elegant yet simple. Kakali Misras landscapes in oil show an element of mystique. Subrata Das uses charcoal for his cityscapes with figures of rickshaw-pullers. 																								Event: An exhibition of paintings by six artists																								When: Till August 8; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 LifeBehind the bar Mixologist / Irfan Ahmed Hot drinks give one a sense of warmth and security. They are a late-night drink, designed to calm the body down and prepare it for rest. Irish Coffee is indisputably the hot favourite!Legend has it that the original recipe for Irish Coffee was created shortly after World War II by Joe Sheridan, head bartender at Shannon Airport, near Irelands Atlantic coast. The airport was a refuelling stop for aircraft and passengers alike. Joe took the traditional Irish drink  whisky in tea  and made it more attractive to the American visitor by substituting coffee for tea, adding sugar and topping it all off with a layer of whipped cream.It is said that one of the passengers asked, Is this Brazilian coffee? to which Sheridan answered, No, thats Irish Coffee. Thus was born the famous beverage. The Buena Vista in San Francisco helped to bring this renowned drink to the United States. Owner Jack Koeppler made his way to Ireland to learn the secrets of Irish Coffee from Joe Sheridan. There is a bronze plaque outside the bar that records the fact that the first Irish Coffee was served there in 1952. Now more than 2,000 are served there each day!Irish coffeeIngredients: 50 ml Irish whisky, 200 ml black coffee, 2 scoops sweet double cream/ vanilla ice cream, 2 tsp brown sugarMethod: Over a low flame, place a non-stick pan and caramelise the brown sugar. Rim the Irish Coffee glass or brandy balloon by placing it upside down on the pan and gently turning it in one direction till the melted sugar holds on to the lip of the glass. Remove the glass and keep aside. Add coffee and whisky to the melted sugar in the pan and bring it to a boil. Transfer the liquid into the sugar-rimmed glass and float sweetened double cream or semi-liquified vanilla ice cream. Garnish with chocolate flakes or a pinch of coffee powder. Serve on a side plate with a teaspoon.There are several other after-dinner coffee combinations which can be made by simply replacing the whisky in the Irish Coffee recipe. Royale Coffee  with cognac Italian Coffee  with Strega Calypso Coffee  with Tia Maria Mexican Coffee  with Kahlua Caribbean Coffee  with rum

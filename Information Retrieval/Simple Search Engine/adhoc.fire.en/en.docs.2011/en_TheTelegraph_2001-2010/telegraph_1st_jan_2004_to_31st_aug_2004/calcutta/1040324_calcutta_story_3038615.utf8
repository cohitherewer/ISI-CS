 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Librarians of colleges win ruling
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Tuesday asked the state government to set up an expert committee to formulate the service rules for librarians of 160 colleges affiliated to Calcutta University.																								Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya also asked the expert committee to review the service conditions of the college librarians of other states and complete the job within four months.																								The order followed a petition by some librarians who complained to the judge that their job had no fixed service rules. Lawyers appearing on their behalf told the court: There are service rules for teaching and non-teaching staff of the university-affiliated colleges and these staff members enjoy all other benefits apart from their salaries. However, college librarians are not entitled to maternity leave or the liberty to encash their leave.																								The petitioners argued that as per the Calcutta University statute, college librarians should get benefits on a par with the teachers. College librarians in other states enjoy identical benefits, their lawyers claimed.																								When the judge asked what salary the petitioners draw, their lawyers said they are paid on the scale of non-vacation teachers (teachers not entitled to leave during college vacations).																								The judge expressed his surprise and asked the university lawyer why a service code had not yet been formulated. He described the matter as serious.																								A spokesperson of the association of college librarians hailed the court order as the outcome of a long movement.

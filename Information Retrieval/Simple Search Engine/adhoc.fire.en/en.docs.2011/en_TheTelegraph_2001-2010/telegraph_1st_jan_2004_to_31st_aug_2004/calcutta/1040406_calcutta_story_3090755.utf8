 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Wrist-slash son on way to recovery
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The condition of 40-year-old Debjit Mukherjee remained serious, mainly because of his suicidal tendency, two days after he had tried to kill himself.																								After learning on Saturday how critical his mother, a cancer patient, was, Debjit locked himself in his room on Dhakuria Station Road and slashed his right wrist with a razor.																								He was admitted to a private hospital hours before his mother, Shelley, died early on Sunday. 																								The news of her death was broken to Debjit on Monday evening.																								A medical team attending on Debjit said his condition was slowly improving, but was still serious. He had bled profusely before being brought to hospital.																								He will need time to improve. The good thing is that he is slowly responding to treatment, said attending physician Debasish Banerjee. Doctors attending on him said their biggest worry was the patients suicidal tendency.																								A psychiatrist was brought in on Monday to examine Debjit and assess his condition. Once the psychiatrist certifies him fit, we will decide when to release him, Banerjee added.																								Debjits father Prasanta Mukherjee visited his son during the day and said that he looked better.																								Sudip Roy, officer-in-charge of Jadavpur police station, said that the routine inquiry into the suicide bid was on. 																								We have learnt that he (Debjit) was very close to his mother and was in a state of depression. The news of his mothers condition proved too much for him to take, Roy added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Milestone gains in Turkey mission
 															- Istanbul willing to collaborate in sport, education and medicine sectors A STAFF REPORTER																								Sponsoring a football club in Calcutta, setting up a Bengali department at two universities in Turkey  both moves are set on the reality route, thanks to the efforts of members of Bengal Initiative (BI). The team returned to the city recently after a successful week-long trip to Istanbul.																								A 20-member BI team went to Turkey on May 3 to hold talks with the government, as well as corporate groups there, to convince them for making investments in Bengal and eastern India. The meeting was successful. We are definitely looking at Indo-Turkish collaboration in three sectors  sport, education and medicine  in the near future. Everything will be finalised when a Turkish team returns our visit, elaborated Amiya Gooptu, BI chairman and leader of the team that went to Turkey.																								The BI team was received by Turkeys top business houses, medical experts, educationists and members of the government as well as the Opposition. Mustafa V. Koc, chairman of Turkeys business group, Koc Holding, accorded the team a big reception and conducted an interactive session, at which the feasibility of business ventures was discussed. For years, Turkey has been very close to our heart. Bengali culture is admired there and Bengal is known as the land of Tagore. Former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit had even translated Geetanjali in Turkish. We never thought our visit would be such a resounding success, Gooptu added.																								The meeting got underway with the possibility of a football team visiting India in the near future. Governor of Istanbul Ergun Gungor was in favour of a prominent football team visiting Calcutta. BI member and football coach P.K. Banerjee also met Hagi, coach of the former UEFA cup winner Galatasaray Chula. The possibility of a Turkish corporate group entering the Maidan in the role of sponsor is also a major possibility, he said.																								The BI members sought closer links between Bengal and Turkey by starting a Bengali language course at Ankara and Bosphorus universities. This apart, the Eczacibasi group, Turkeys third largest industrial group, held talks on cooperation in pharmaceutical products, especially with Bengal Chemical.																								Turkey, at the moment, has a meagre trade link with India in the field of pharmaceuticals, iron and steel and plastics. During its mission, the BI team stressed that business ventures could be further increased and the Turkish government was also keen on bulk imports of buffalo meat from eastern India.																								Construction group Limak has expressed interest in infrastructure projects in eastern India. Since they already have a tie-up with Gail India, our plea for more investments received a favourable response. We will now present a detailed proposal list to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, as well as the central government, for necessary follow-up from their end, Gooptu added. 																								Various corporate groups also showed keenness to import agricultural products and Indian films and serials, which was very popular in Istanbul.

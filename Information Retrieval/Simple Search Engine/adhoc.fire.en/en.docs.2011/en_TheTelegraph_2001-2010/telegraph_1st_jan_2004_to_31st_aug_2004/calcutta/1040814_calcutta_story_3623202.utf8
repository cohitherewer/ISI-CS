 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Hangman drill in jail countdown
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Members of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights march down Judges Court Road to Alipore Central jail on Friday to protest the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee. Picture by Amit Datta																								Hours to go before Dhananjoy Chatterjee is sent to the gallows, hangman Nata Mullick went through a feverish, last-minute rehearsal of the role he would perform early on Saturday. 																								Nata repeated the drill many times over, amidst tight security on the prison premises since Thursday night. 																								Dhananjoy Chatterjee will be the 25th convict to be hanged by Nata, who has come to symbolise the avenger of Hetal Parekhs murder 14 years ago. Nata was brought to Alipore Central jail at 7.30 pm on Thursday.																								I went there with my son-in-law and stayed in a room, specially arranged for us, at the jailers quarters on the first floor. There, I prepared a list of the things I needed, Nata said on Friday evening.																								The list included items like pillows, pillow covers, mattresses, bedsheets, tooth paste and brush, biscuits and two cups of specially-prepared tea. 																								I made it clear to the authorities that I would not have food prepared by the jail staff. The food should be brought from a reputed eatery. So far, the officials have kept their word, Nata added. 																								According to jail sources, the hangman and his aide had mutton biryani and chicken curry on Thursday night. 																								The next morning was quite hectic for them. After a cup of tea, Nata visited the scaffold where Dhananjoy will be hanged. Then he had breakfast, around 8.30 am.																								My son Mahadeb and three others arrived on Friday morning. From 9, we carried out a mock trial for nearly two hours with the help of a sandbag of the same weight as that of Dhananjoy. I supervised the setting up of a shamiana atop the scaffold where the hanging will take place, Nata recounted. 																								Along with his helps, the burly octogenarian then went on to inspect the items to be used for the execution, including the Manila rope and the black cloth that will cover Dhananjoys face before the execution. It takes a lot of time to prepare the rope and has to be done at least a day before, Nata said.																								Detergent cakes were used to even the grooves of the Manila rope. Then, scores of martaman bananas were crushed and applied to it. 																								The job done, Nata and his five-member squad had lunch  rice, dal, fish curry and vegetables were on the menu. 																								After lunch, I took inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty and his deputy, Ramapada Bhattacharya, around to let them have a look at the arrangement. They expressed satisfaction, Nata said.

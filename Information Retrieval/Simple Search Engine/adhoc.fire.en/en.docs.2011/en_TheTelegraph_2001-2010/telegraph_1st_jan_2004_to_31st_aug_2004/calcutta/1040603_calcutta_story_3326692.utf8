 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Green board double nod to rein in builders
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Concerned at large-scale violation of pollution norms by some promoters in the city, the government has framed a new set of rules, giving more teeth to the environment laws .																								West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) officials said the rules would be applicable for construction of any residential or commercial complex built on or above 10,000 sq ft or having 100 flats.																								By the rules, promoters will have to obtain approval from the state PCB before and after completion of work. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will not sanction the building plan until and unless the promoter concerned furnishes the PCB approval. 																								To obtain the nod, builders will have to fulfil certain conditions. There must be a scientific solid waste management system in the complex. Builders will have to show where solid waste generated from the complex will be dumped or how will it be treated. 																								There must be a covered vat inside the complex and it has to be placed in a position where others are not affected. If there is a possibility of bio-medical or clinical waste, there must be a special arrangement for its disposal, the rules say.																								Builders will have to show the source of drinking water and also the source of water required for construction. 																								The sewerage and drainage system should be categorically indicated in the plan and in no case will any open drain be allowed. There must be a rainwater-harvesting system in the complex and provisions for recycling waste water. 																								Barring the built-up area, there should be greenery in the entire complex and there should be at least one park.																								For an industrial complex, any unit that emits smoke will not be allowed. Besides, no unit that falls under the Red category (highly polluting) can be built in any industrial estate in the city. 																								We will provide provisional approval to builders who satisfy those conditions. After construction of the complex is completed, we will inspect it to ascertain whether it was done as per the norms and then issue the final approval. The civic authority will provide the completion certificate only after obtaining the final approval given by us, WBPCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar said.																								Board officials had held meetings with builders engaged in large-scale housing. We will hold meetings and workshops with all the major promoters in the city to make them aware of the new rules. We will also provide them with technical knowhow for adopting the new norms, Sarkar said.																								The member-secretary said earlier, builders would have to obtain WBPCB approval only once, and that was before starting construction. 																								We have noticed that many promoters did not abide by the environment rules. But after we introduce the system of obtaining approval twice, the possibility of violating norms will be less, he said.																								The government move comes in the wake of allegations that some promoters are constructing housing and commercial estates without considering the environment and defying pollution norms. According to officials at Writers Buildings, some allegations reached chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who directed the WBPCB to take preemptive steps.

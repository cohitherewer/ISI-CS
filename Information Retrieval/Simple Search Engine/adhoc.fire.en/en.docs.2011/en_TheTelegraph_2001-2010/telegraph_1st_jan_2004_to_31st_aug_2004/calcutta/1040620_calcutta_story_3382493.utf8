The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, June 20, 2004 Yesterday once more
Give Me Red was the Dil Chahta Hai of ad films. Today, the feel is the same, but the look suddenly is 60-plus!adLIBA new Amitabh Bachchan movie has been released. No, I am not talking about Dev. This one has not been released in INOX. You can see it during the break in Euro 2004 soccer matches. It is a campaign for Eveready  Give Me Red (GMR).Rewind to the early Nineties. Batteries were slowly becoming part of the lifestyle of Generation X, thanks to gadgets like walkman and camera. This is when the first GMR campaign broke. And the rest, as they say, is history. The original GMR was made with a fresh cinematic idiom. It was the Dil Chahta Hai of ad films  bold, youthful, brash, macho and irreverent. The ad was a hit. The phrase give me red became part of the consumer lexicon. And, more importantly, became a mnemonic for the brand. The association of the brand with the youth was unmistakably established.A well-established mnemonic, in these days of high media cost, delivers a major benefit. A 30-second ad costs a lot of money to make and show. A mnemonic like GMR delivers a re-run of the same ad in the consumer mind at no or little cost.If one wishes to use a mnemonic over a long period, its associations need to be nurtured. GMR has done that over the years. All subsequent films have faithfully retained the original trait. Models have been young and trendy. The settings have been disco-ish. GMR has become a genre among ad films.That is what makes the recent one all the more interesting. Not that this one is off the beaten track in its execution. The setting is unmistakably GMR. So are the happenings in the film. The only difference  and a very crucial one  is that for the first time a 60-plus gentleman has graced this film as the protagonist. He does not look a single bit out of place in this under-30 setting. It is a testimony to his ability as a performer.Youth is the flavour at an Eveready niteThe surprise is the decision of Eveready to use AB in a GMR film. From where does the confidence emanate? How does one feel sure that the youth of 2004, who will possibly call the son Abhishekda or Abhishekbhaiya, accept AB in an ad that is so trendy? Sure, the value of the money paid to the brand ambassador has to be realised. But at what cost? Could they have used Sanjeev Kumar  another great performer?May be, and just may be, the answer lies in the psyche of todays youth. Did you get a chance to read the opinion poll carried in Metro on Sunday? The 18 to 25 of Calcutta, who read an English paper in the morning, voted Aparna Sen as the most beautiful celebrity of the city. The young are possibly more in love with the old than the old are with the young. Maybe awe. Possibly respect. Or simply a paucity of todays icons.Or have I got it all wrong? Is it all because of a phenomenon called Amitabh Bachchan?

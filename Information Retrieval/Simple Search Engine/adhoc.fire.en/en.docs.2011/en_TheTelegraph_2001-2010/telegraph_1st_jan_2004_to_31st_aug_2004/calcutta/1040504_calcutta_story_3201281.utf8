 																											- Govt directive to continue enteric care centres cleaves civic body A STAFF REPORTER																								Municipal commissioner Debashis Som and mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh have locked horns over a state health department directive to continue the special camps in the enteric-prone pockets of east Calcutta till May 15.																								Accordingly, Som advised the civic health department last Thursday not to withdraw the camps in the Entally-Tiljala-Topsia belt. He also ordered that the camps be kept open even on holidays, though the outbreak had been contained.																								But Ghosh refused to allow the medical camps to continue. An unnecessary extension would send the wrong signal to the electorate, he reasoned.																								The civic health department had set up six medical camps at Narkeldanga, Beniapukur, Masjidbari Lane, Darapara and Topsia after more than 80 people were admitted to the Beleghata Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital in the second week of April, following an outbreak of severe diarrhoea.																								The outbreak was caused by a contamination of the waterline, explained officer on special duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee. Clinical tests of the water samples collected from the affected areas confirmed a coliform count as high as 70-plus, he disclosed.																								I have visited the health camps and there havent been any new cases. Besides, we have chlorinated the water and the fresh samples tested in the laboratory confirmed that the coliform count was within tolerable limits, said mayoral council member Ghosh on Monday.																								The state health department had urged the civic authorities to continue the camps as the state machinery would remain busy with the Lok Sabha elections till mid-May, and it would be difficult to organise a new camp in case of a fresh outbreak of enteric diseases or diarrhoea in any part of the city.																								Finally, on the intervention of mayor Subrata Mukherjee, a way out was hit upon: instead of continuing the medical camps, the civic health department will continue surveillance in Narkeldanga, Beniapukur, Masjidbari Lane and Darapara area till the Lok Sabha elections are over. 																								Municipal commissioner Som, meanwhile, held a meeting with the civic health officials and engineers of water supply department, seeking steps to control the frequent outbreak of enteric diseases in pockets of east Calcutta. 																								When health officials pointed out that contamination of waterlines with sewerage had been the root cause of the frequent outbreak of enteric diseases, he directed the engineers to submit a status report on the condition of the water mains in the area.

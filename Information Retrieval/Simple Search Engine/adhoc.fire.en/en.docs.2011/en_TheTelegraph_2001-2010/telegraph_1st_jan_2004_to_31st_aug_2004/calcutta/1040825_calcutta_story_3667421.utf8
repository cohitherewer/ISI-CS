The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Tollygunge railway station on the Sealdah South section of Eastern Railway has a single platform, that too a narrow one. It caters to both Up and Down train passengers. The station, being the nearest railhead from a Metro railway station for Budge Budge line commuters, is busy throughout the day. But gradual encroachment by hawkers has eaten up much of the platform space, making it difficult for commuters to even walk during rush hours. The fruit vendors and tea stalls also litter the platform. Will the rail authorities please take notice? The vendors should be shifted outside the station premises at the earliest. Tapan Pal, Batanagar. 
	It is surprising that the State Bank of India, Budge Budge branch, charged me Rs 50 for endorsing my bank signature on a form, whereas UCO bank, Budge Budge branch, renders the service free of cost. Why are charges for the same service different in nationalised banks? Foreign banks are more forthcoming about their service charges. In the case of nationalised banks, it is only when the charges are debited from the balance that the account-holder comes to know of their existence. Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge. 
	Passengers find it difficult to board private buses because the footboard is usually too high above the ground. Women in saris are often seen struggling to board buses which often do not stop long enough to do so comfortably. Even a small nail or a metal strip protruding from the footboard can cause the passenger to trip and fall off the bus in a fraction of a second. Bus-owners should correct the faulty design of the footboards for the convenience of the passengers. B.N. Bose, Dum Dum. 				 																																									The Calcutta Municipal Corporation(CMC)s tree plantation drives along stretches of Sarat Bose Road defies logic. Not only is it a waste of the tax-payers money but it also makes the footpaths narrower. The entire stretch has enough full-grown trees. The CMC should restrict its greenery drives to areas which have been left devoid of trees.				 																																									Shiv Shanker Almal,				 																																									Lower Rawdon Street.
	It takes almost three hours to travel from Sealdah to Gede. However, the authorities have not equipped the compartments with lavatories. Long distance local trains should have attached toilets. Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia.

 															- AIDS awareness camp, clinic at truck terminal A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 The Dhulagarh truck terminal, where drivers will be told about the risks of AIDS. A Telegraph picture																								The Dhulagarh truck terminal authorities in Howrah have decided to set up a permanent AIDS awareness camp at the terminal, for truck-drivers fall in the the high-risk category.																								The terminal is a joint venture of a state government undertaking  the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC)  and the Calcutta-Mumbai Truck Terminal, the private company that constructed the terminal. It was inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on July 3.																								The largest of its kind in the state, the terminal is open now and trucks from other states and the districts park here to unload goods for Calcutta markets. Dhulagarh is only 19 km from Calcutta and it has been decided that the terminal will function as a bay for goods vehicles that will not be allowed into the city during the day. Commodities unloaded at the terminal will be ferried to the citys markets in smaller trucks.																								WBTIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee said on Friday that the AIDS camp will create consciousness among drivers about the killer disease. Setting up the unit is a wise decision and I think it will help check the spread of AIDS, Mukherjee added.																								The terminal has come up on more than 100 acres and can accommodate about 1,500 heavy vehicles. This apart, 200 small trucks, too, will be able to load and unload goods.																								Arindam Sanyal, general manager (marketing) of the Calcutta-Mumbai Truck Terminal Ltd, said on Friday that a petrol station had already been set up there to refuel vehicles. We have a small cinema at the terminal, in which we can screen documentary films on AIDS to create awareness, Sanyal said.																								The terminal will not only accommodate heavy vehicles, but will also provide night shelter to drivers, as the authorities have set up residential units, too, within the terminal compound.																								Indrashis Guha, another official of the company, said it will be easier to carry out the awareness campaign as drivers will be able to stay the night. 																								We will show them different documentary films on AIDS and try to create among them a sense of fear about the dreaded disease, so that they can take precautions, Guha said.																								A small hospital will be set up there that will offer minor medical care for drivers. 																								Leaflets on AIDS, in Hindi and some other languages, will be distributed among drivers.

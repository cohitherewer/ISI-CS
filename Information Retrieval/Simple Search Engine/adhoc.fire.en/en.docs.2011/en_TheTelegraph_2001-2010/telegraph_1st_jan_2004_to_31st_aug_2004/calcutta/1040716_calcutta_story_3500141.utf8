 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Global test to assess ability of student
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Critical thinking, comprehension, reasoning and problem solving, analysing the childs strengths, weaknesses and learning abilities, as opposed to textbook knowledge. 																								This is the aim of an assessment test by the Educational Testing Centre (ETC) of the University of New South Wales (UNWS), Sydney, Australia. 																								Although it has been available in India, publishing house Macmillan is now the universitys partner in administering the test through schools.																								Launched in Calcutta on Thursday, about 170 teachers and principals attended a two-hour presentation. The basis of the International Assessment for Indian Schools is to provide an objective, in-depth, external assessment of student skills, reflecting their learning and performing abilities from multiple angles at the international level, according to Uma Mani, chief general manager, school publishing, Macmillan India.																								The test, for Class III to Class XII students, is discriminating, to enable a student to understand what he cannot do and why. It helps the parents and teachers understand the child, and schools to understand the abilities of a teacher and to estimate their position at a national level. The purpose is to assess, diagnose, remedy and reward, by testing not the content but the ability to understand and apply knowledge.																								We have been conducting the test for the past couple of years, and it is useful, said Terence Ireland, principal, St James School. Students and parents are concerned about the children going in the right direction, because they know that grasping concepts is important.																								The tests will be administered in November. English tests literary and factual skills, from spelling and punctuation to interpreting ideas and points of view. Math assesses number, measurement, space, etc, while science examines observation and measurement abilities, interpreting data, analysing and drawing conclusions. 																								The test has been conducted by UNWS in other countries, and will be launched by Macmillan in another 11 nations, like Iran, Iraq and Bhutan. Over a million students take the test every year.																								At our centre, we research modern measurement theory, based on the relationship between student ability and item difficulty, explained Carol Cockburn, assessment manager, ETC, UNSW. The university does the scoring. The results are graded on an individual, school and national level, in percentile and mean grades.

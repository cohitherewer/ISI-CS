It is after a long and eventful cosmic journey that the human soul enters the temple of the body. Born out of an amalgamation of the five elements that are an intrinsic part of every creation in this universe  Fire, Space, Wind, Earth and Water  the soul gradually learns the ways of this temporal world before it finds eternal salvation. The most defining emotion that the soul feels in its expedition through life is that of Love; the love of a mother, a friend and a lover.

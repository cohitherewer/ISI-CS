 Sunday, July 04, 2004 The rough game gentlemen play
Club SandwitchA documentary film canned by BBC on the CC amp;FC turf that has nurtured rugby lovingly for 132 years was screened in the run-up to the Calcutta Cup tie between England and Scotland at Twickenham, UK, last year.And why not? The celebrated Calcutta Cup, fought bitterly between England and Scotland every year, is a legacy of the original Calcutta Football Club (CFC), which introduced rugby in India in 1872, and is the label under which CC amp;FC still plays the game.Back home in its Ballygunge cradle, CC amp;FC remains one of the two key patrons of the game in the country, along with Bombay Gymkhana Club, and the indigenous version of the Calcutta Cup is still an important dot on its calendar. But the scrummage, shorn of patronage from corporate sponsors, has been barely kept afloat thanks to the efforts of a small but dedicated following in Calcutta.Rugby has been through its highs and lows, but there was a time towards the late 80s when the game came to a virtual standstill in the city. Thanks to a concerted rearguard initiative, it has got a new lease of life, observes Dada Osman (in picture below), who at 67 has been witness to rugbys roll of the dice on the CC amp;FC greens for over four decades.Dada, the Mr Rugby of Calcutta, was very much at the heart of the revive-rugby push that cupped the flickering flame with care. After the expatriates left, there was little by way of local spark to ignite the game and fire the imagination of youngsters. Besides, rugby being a full body-contact sport, many kids stayed away for fear of injury, he laments.The club, of course, lent its might. A crisis-control conclave of CC amp;FC past presidents unanimously decided the show must go on, come what may. The CFC team was put back on the field and members were compelled to play.But we realised it was also essential to get the schools involved to revive flagging interest, Dada remembers. Timely help arrived from the Indian Rugby Football Union (IRFU), an association of clubs that play the game in India, originally founded in Calcutta and revived at CC amp;FC on August 16, 1997. The union decided to send in coaches to schools from the active clubs to train the boys. Die-hard teacher enthusiasts like John Mason of St James, Neville Macnamara of Apeejay and now Tim Grandage of Future Hope Foundation kept the cause alive.CC amp;FC president Arabinda Bose too is convinced that rugbys picking up. There were these barefoot quarterbacks from the Sunderbans running with rare gusto at the Under-19 meet the other day, which was so refreshing to watch, he says.Just let them run, feels the genial Dada, who values the fellowship and brotherhood rugby has given him. Its a rough game played by gentlemen, and it teaches you many virtues, he sighs. Subhro Saha

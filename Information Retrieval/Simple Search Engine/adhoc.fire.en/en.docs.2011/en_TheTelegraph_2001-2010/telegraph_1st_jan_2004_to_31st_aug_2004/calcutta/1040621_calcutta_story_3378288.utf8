 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Hotels are reaching for the skies
 															- Hospitality highs for airline crew British Airways flight crew display their new uniforms, created by leading fashion designer Julien Macdonald. (AFP) 																								They need them to fly high. And, if one may say so, them need they to stay grounded in style. Together, the mutual needs are creating pockets of specialised comfort in the citys star destinations.																								Be it Taj Bengal or The Oberoi Grand, The Hyatt or The HHI, the hospitality addresses in town are all busy making special arrangements to host, and retain, aircrew from national and international airlines.																								The reason for the scramble in the skies lies in the numbers game. After all, the sustained business that these hotels get from this segment keeps the occupancy rate pointer ticking through the year.																								So, if Taj Bengal has two major international airlines and three national ones to assure 18,000 room nights a year, the airline sector at Oberoi Grand accounts for 16,500 rooms. At HHI, the national aircrew on the guest list occupies at least 6,000 rooms a year, Hyatt gets business worth 5,500 room nights from airline personnel.																								Special clients look for personalised services, and these are some of the must-haves  or must-assists  for hotels hosting aircrew:																								(Drop and pick-up from the airport																								(Complimentary room service																								(Internet surfing																								(Fitness club and swimming pool																								(Nightclub																								(Shopping 																								When a crew lands for a stopover, the thing uppermost on its mind is relaxation. Most of them like to catch a movie, eat good food and shop, says Amitabh Rai, general manager, Oberoi Grand. Therefore, a DVD player and a bunch of good English movies are invariably close at hand.																								For the cockpit crew, de-stress is often synonymous with the fitness centre or the nightclub. They like to hit the nightclub when they dont have a flight the next day, thats why we arrange for them to be taken to one of their choice, since our hotel does not have that facility yet, points out a Hyatt spokesperson.																								Both Taj Bengal and HHI have special lounges for the aircrew to unwind, while Oberoi Grand has a whole floor dedicated to them. Extra care has to be taken with food for the aircrew. We even have thalis to allow international crew members to enjoy Indian food without going into the hassle of wondering what to order, says Rai.																								If an international aircrew has a normal stopover schedule of two to three days, a national crew might just stay the night. And the check-list for aircrew, followed almost uniformly, shows how their stay is not all fun n games:																								(Those flying international flights need to retire 18 hours ahead																								(No alcohol consumption 24 hours before a flight																								(Return to hotel at least five hours before heading for the airport for the next flight						 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Break-in and list order in Tagore case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Justice S.K. Mukherjee of Calcutta High Court on Friday directed Soumyava Bhattacharya, special officer appointed by him, to break open the strong room of Jorasanko Thakurbari and make an inventory of manuscripts, paintings and other memorabilia of Rabindranath Tagore and some of his family members, with the help of an expert.																								The junior standing counsel of the state government, Subrata Mukhopadhyay, said the special officer would go to Jorasanko Thakurbari on July 17 along with the police. Earlier, the officer had made an attempt to break open the lock of the strong room, but had failed to open it.																								The controversy over Tagores mementoes came to light after students of Rabindra Bharati University lodged a complaint against Rabindra Bharati Society that some of the valuables belonging to the Tagore family had been smuggled out. 																								The society moved a petition before Calcutta High Court alleging that the students of the university were preventing them from preserving the valuable articles. Intervening into the case, Rabindra Bharati University complained that some of the objects had been shifted to Victoria Memorial Hall from the strong room. The court, then, had appointed a special officer.

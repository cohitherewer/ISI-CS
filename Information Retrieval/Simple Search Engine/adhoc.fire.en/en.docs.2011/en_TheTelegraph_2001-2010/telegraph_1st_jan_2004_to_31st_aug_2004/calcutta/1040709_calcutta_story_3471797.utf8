The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 For those who dabble in Scrabble
 															- Weekend war of words lined up for learning, earning, having fun NISHA LAHIRI																								Souparno Ghosh, a Class X student of Don Bosco Park Circus, hops cities for the holidays to engage in a war of words. Hooked on to Scrabble from age five, he stood ninth at the Pune nationals in 2003, and is happy to add a competitive edge to his hobby.																								Theres not much in Calcutta, so I usually play against myself. In the Puja holidays, I have been to Bangalore twice, where I ranked 11th and 12th, and in the winter, I take part in the world championships in Mumbai. This is after I won the national juniors tournament in Chennai in 2001, at which point one graduates to the senior league, whatever the age, explains Souparno.																								For the Souparnos of the city, this weekend offers a chance to unscramble words known and new at a competition in the run-up to the nationals. While around 150 grown-ups play the game in India these days, the corresponding kids figure is 10,000. Children dont realise that while they are having fun, they are also learning, says V.R. Damaraj, founder-member of Zygo Scrabble Club.																								Damaraj travels around the world visiting other clubs and contests, and then does the same here, from city to city. He has also put together a support dictionary of additional words, other than the official Scrabble book of words, adds fan Souparno.																								Now in Calcutta, Damaraj has organised a competition on July 10 and 11 at Saifee Hall School for adults and youngsters, ahead of the national championships on July 24 and 25 in Pune. I am interested in grooming the children. In the West, they cant believe that students so young play this game professionally here. There are about 120,000 words in the dictionary and children, if they start in Class V, can pick up 60,000 before college, feels Damaraj.																								Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Pune have either clubs or associations, but Calcutta, sadly, lacks organised Scrabble. So, moving out with the Scrabble board is the only option.																								For Abhimanyu Das, Class IX student of St Thomas School, parental support comes easy  his father Shibshankar is also a Scrabble enthusiast, and regularly plays with his son, for practice and relaxation. 																								The tournaments can be a real grind, involving on an average seven 50-minute matches per day, with almost no intervals. Abhimanyu, a bookworm, is already a regional champ of Zygo. We always accompany him, and are very happy with his pursuit, smiles the proud father.																								The top prize in the world championships is Rs 1 lakh, and in the nationals Rs 10,000, with consolation prizes thrown in. The money is just a bonus, insists Souparno.

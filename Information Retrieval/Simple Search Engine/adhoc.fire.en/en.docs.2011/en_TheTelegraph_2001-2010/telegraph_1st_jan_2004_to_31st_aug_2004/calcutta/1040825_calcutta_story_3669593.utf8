 															- 1000-sq-ft design-centric store aims at reviving traditional best, both tribal and mainstream A STAFF REPORTER				 	 At one level of CIMA Design: The biggest names, the best of styles. Picture by Pabitra Das																								If craft has got a bad name with the over-abundance of poor-quality goods in town, here comes a platform rich in artistic promise.																								The biggest names in design and the finest rural artisans have been brought together to display Indian craft and modern trends at CIMA Design. 																								Set to open formally on August 27, the design-centric store, on the fourth floor of Forum, boasts a handpicked selection of the best traditional styles, in original form as well as modified to meet changing needs.																								This is the first foray that CIMA Gallery has made into retail. Inspired by the response to Art in Life, an annual exhibition of affordable artwork and lifestyle products at the Ballygunge gallery, the Elgin Road address brings the same aesthetic sensibility to an accessible platform.																								Attention at the close-to-1,000 sq ft store is on the finishing and the exclusivity, which have been killed by the mass production dictated by the need of emporiums. We have cut out the middlemen, so the advantage goes to the craftsmen and the consumer, explains Rakhi Sarkar, executive director, CIMA. 																								Reviving dying traditions from around the country, both mainstream and tribal, is a priority at the two-storey outlet.																								Visitors are greeted by the designer lines created especially for CIMA by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Raghavendra Rathore, Sonam Dubal and Rajesh Pratap Singh. We asked them to develop pret lines using colour and textiles they associate with India, explains chief administrator, CIMA, Pratiti Basu Sarkar.																								Silver tribal jewellery, mainly from Rajasthan, is also available at reasonable rates. A higher-end collection from Raj Mahtani with precious and semi-precious stones is due to arrive. Striking metal work by the Delhi-based Michael Aram, blown glass, brass artefacts from south India and other artefacts complete the first level.																								A wealth of textiles in the form of bedspreads, carpets, wall-hangings, shawls and scarves can be found one flight up. The CIMA team has worked with professional weavers and tribal artisans to create a rich collection that brings contemporary utility to rare weaves and embroidery.

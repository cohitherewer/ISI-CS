The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 How you live is the key to how you die
 															- Lifestyle disease spurt alarms medical experts BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Metabolism may be a menace, but lifestyle is the biggest pitfall to staying healthy today.																								Lifestyle diseases in the city are on the rise and doctors, cutting across medical specialities, are urging Calcuttans to change the way they live or face fatal  or near-fatal  consequences.																								Medical experts in the city have been expressing grave concern about the growing cases of lifestyle ills, especially cancer, with more than 64,000 cases being reported every year, compared to 40,000 even three or four years ago.																								The diabetes count is equally bad, with a recent National Urban Diabetes Study report stating that one in every eight Calcuttans above 20 years of age is diabetic. The scenario is much the same in cities like New Delhi and Mumbai.																								The same applies for cardiac ailments, where acute stress at work seems to be taking a huge toll. Its not just cardiac problems, but hypertension, stress and all kinds of other problems that we encounter every day that has started to jumble our lives. They require immediate attention, says cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar.																								As far as fighting the AIDS menace goes, till the other day, Bengal was considered to be a low-priority state, but an increase of 747 cases of HIV in one year (2002-03) has forced AIDS experts to review the threat to Calcutta and other parts. The government has also made it clear through its new rules that AIDS patients be cared for by doctors and hospitals as any other lifestyle disease.																								One pointer to the disconcerting scenario in Calcutta is the expansion of lifestyle clinics by healthcare major Apollo Group of Hospitals.																								With patients flooding its solitary lifestyle diseases clinic on Shakespeare Sarani, Apollo Health and Lifestyle Ltd, part of the larger Apollo Group of Hospitals, has decided to set up five new lifestyle clinics in the city shortly, including one in Howrah.																								These mini hospitals at Garia, Baranagar, Salt Lake, Behala and Howrah would promote preventive healthcare, officials said.																								With the chain of clinics coming up in the city, Calcuttans will be able to get specialised healthcare whenever they want, said Ratan Jalan, chief executive officer of Apollo Health and Lifestyle.																								The focus of the clinics will be preventive health check ups, especially to control the soaring cases of lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, cancer and cardiac ailments.																								We have seen cardiac ailments reaching alarming proportions, with Calcuttans adopting a general lifestyle  and the wrong diet  that is adversely affecting their health, says Anjali Kumar, senior manager of Apollo Health and Lifestyle. As a result of increasing incidence of these diseases, preventive health check-up has become top priority, mainly to prepare a benchmark to ensure that all general health parameters are within permissible limits, adds Kumar.																								Apollo will also open similar clinics in Malda, Burdwan and Kharagpur in the near future.

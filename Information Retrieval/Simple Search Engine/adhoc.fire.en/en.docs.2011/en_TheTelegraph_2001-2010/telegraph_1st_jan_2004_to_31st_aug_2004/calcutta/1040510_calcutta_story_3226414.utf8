 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Emergency wing beef-up in hospitals
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ambulances to fetch doctors from home and special teams in the emergency wings of state-run hospitals are measures the state has taken to meet any crisis during Mondays elections.																								Health department officials said on Sunday they were bolstering the emergency wings of hospitals and asking a majority of the staff to remain on standby.																								The decision was taken after the government said it would shut down outpatient department services on Monday to enable hospital staff to cast their votes. 																								Hospitals have been put on alert, in case of any poll violence, said a health official.																								At Medical College and Hospital, doctors from the surgery department, along with interns and senior teachers, will monitor the emergency department, apart from the designated staff, said Medical College and Hospital superintendent Rabindranath Chattopadhyay on Sunday.																								At SSKM Hospital, the emergency operating theatre will remain open on Monday. Two senior and two junior doctors, along with a contingent of nurses and ward masters, will be on duty round-the-clock in the emergency department. The in-patients department will remain fully functional, said superintendent Santanu Tripathi.																								In the cardiology department of RG Kar Hospital, the resident medical officer has been kept on standby, along with several other doctors. I have asked my department staff not to treat Monday as a holiday, asserted Abhijit Banerjee, RG Kar cardiology department head.																								Calcutta National Medical and Hospital and NRS Medical College and Hospital, too, have beefed up their emergency wings.

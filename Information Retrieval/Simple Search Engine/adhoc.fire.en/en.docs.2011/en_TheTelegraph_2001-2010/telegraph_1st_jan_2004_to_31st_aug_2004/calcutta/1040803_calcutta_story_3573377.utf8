 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI VISITS ART CONNOISSEUR SUNITA KUMAR TO ADMIRE HER COLLECTION AND PICK UP SOME TIPS																								Sunita Kumar is known best as a lover and ardent collector of art. The walls of Kumars Middleton Mansion residence are wreathed with a wealth of art. Jamini Roy, Ganesh Pyne, Paresh Maity, Bikash Bhattacharjee, Sunil Das, Manjit Bawa and, of course, M.F. Husain are a few of the names that can be spotted in this stellar collection.																								I started collecting art at the age of 19. Today, I dont even know how many canvases I have, it may be a 100 or a 130, I really have stopped counting, she smiles.																								Even if such a plethora of paintings is out of reach for most, a few tasteful works can go a long way to make your house a home. A month after Kumar travelled to Buckingham Palace to present two of her paintings of Mother Teresa to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, she shares some tips on how to display your canvases to best possible home advantage.Perfect a passion																								To build a collection, the first rule is to go to reliable galleries, or take the help of trusted people who understand art, to avoid being saddled with a fake. The rest, says Kumar, is all about aesthetics.																								Pick something you can live with all your life, she stresses. Its not enough to choose a work with a big name tag. Not everything they churn out is a masterpiece. You have to personally like the subject of the painting.																								Paintings should bring happiness to a house. Ensure everyone in the family likes it before you make a purchase. Dont let anyone else (like a friend or an art dealer) buy a painting for you. Tastes are bound to differ.																								Placement of a painting is of the essence. The colours of the walls and picture frames are two crucial factors. A dark wall is likely to kill any painting. I dont use frames at all for Husain canvases to keep the original feel. For watercolours, I use wooden frames with non-reflective glass, so it can be seen clearly from all angles, she points out.																								Lighting is also important. I dont like stark light on the paintings, Id much rather have muted yellow light that doesnt change the natural colours, Kumar adds.																								The rest is common sense. Like you cant have a huge painting in a small room with a low ceiling, just as tiny paintings wont work in a huge room. The painting must go with the colour scheme. The carpet, walls, linen all have to be kept in mind.Friendship framesThe story of Kumars enduring friendship with Husainsaab is almost as famous as her enviable collection. The maverick has painted some of his best canvases sitting in her Calcutta residence, some while attending a party and others while chatting with the Kumar family. This is what M.F. Husain had to say about his larger than life presence in the Kumar household:																								I think Sunitas house is a museum of my work. Many people around the country have a large body of my works, but I think the one Sunita has is by far the best. She is a great lady with very refined tastes and whatever she does she does with great dedication. So whether its working with Mother Teresa or preserving art, everything is touched by her sincerity.																								For me, its difficult to point out a favourite from my work, but I think it might be the canvas I created on the eve of the new millennium when the Kumars were hosting a party at their house. It has historical value.My favouritesA few glimpses of Kumars prized possessions (clockwise from right): A large red canvas hangs on the wall on the corridor leading to the drawing room. After the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, Husainsaab wanted to dedicate one canvas for the victims and raise money for them through an auction. He was in Calcutta and painted a lovely canvas. It was auctioned at Taj Bengal and I wanted to support the cause. The six-foot tall canvas that adorns one whole wall of the Kumar drawing room is Husains millennium creation. He began to paint on the morning of December 31, 1999 and painted through the night even as people partied all over the house. The canvas that adorns the wall at the head of the bed is a family portrait. In 1984, one evening, Naresh, myself, our three kids Geeta, Preeya and Arjun were chatting in our bedroom. Suddenly Husainsaab got this canvas. In no time, he had a family portrait ready.Pictures by Pabitra Das

 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Pak traders at Salt Lake fair
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After the Industrial India Trade Fair, the traders from Pakistan have set up stalls in Bidhannagar Fair, in Salt Lake, inaugurated on Friday by Jyoti Basu. Boosted by the development in Indo-Pak ties, the number of stalls is up from eight last year to 14 this year at the mela, which entered its 14th year.																								This is the eighth year I have come to the fair and all of us are overwhelmed by the warmth weve received, said Md Iqbal, Karachi-based owner of Saleem Associates. Iqbal and his fellow-traders have brought their traditional items of onyx, garments and dry fruits to the fair.																								Basu welcomed the Pakistanis and the Bangladeshi traders at the fair. A number of traders from Pakistan and Bangladesh have joined the fair, he said. There are so many fairs being held in Bengal, and I am happy even foreigners are taking part in them in large numbers, he said. 																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta proposed that a permanent structure be erected for the mela, on the lines of Delhis Pragati Maidan.

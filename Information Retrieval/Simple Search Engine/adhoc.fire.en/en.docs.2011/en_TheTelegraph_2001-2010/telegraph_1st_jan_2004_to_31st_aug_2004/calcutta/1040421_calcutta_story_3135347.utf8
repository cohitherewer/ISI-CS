A Telegraph file picture																								The pale-yellow building on AJC Bose Road used to be Satyajit Rays favourite venue to preview his films. It was also where the maestro could sometimes be spotted on a settee, immersed in deep thought. Or you could spot Mrinal Sen chatting with M.F. Husain and Shabana Azmi in the lobby. Suchitra Mitra and Ruma Guha Thakurta, too, have fond memories of their singing days here some three decades ago. 																								Enriched by associations of all hues, Gorky Sadan  the Russian centre for science and culture in Calcutta  turns 30 this month.																								The fortnight-long anniversary celebrations kicked off on Thursday with a cultural festival, featuring an orchestral presentation of tabla by the Jnanprakash Ghosh Tabla Foundation. 																								Saturday evening is reserved for Russia-returned Indian engineers, doctors and sociologists who will take a nostalgic trip to the land of romance and memories.																								But the spotlight of the anniversary agenda is on April 23 when the celebrations will be formally inaugurated by Russia ambassador to India Mikhail Kadakin. Mrinal Sen, Amala Shankar and a host of dignitaries will share the dais.																								An art exhibition showcasing the works of around 40 artists from Bengal will be unveiled as a tribute to Rabindranath Tagore, who had fostered Indo-Russia friendship ties. 																								The works have been sourced from the artists or from their relatives who have given us a chunk of their collections to put up for the public to see, says programme officer, Gorky Sadan, Goutam Ghosh.																								The speciality lies in some rare works by Abanindranath Tagore, Upendrakishore Ray, Sukumar Ray and Satyajit Ray. Sandip Ray has provided the Gorky Sadan authorities with the works of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather. 																								We have, for instance, one of Satyajit Rays illustrations on the Kanchenjungha which he wanted to use for the films title card, says Ghosh.																								We even have a line-drawing by Abanindranath Tagore when he was more than 75 years old, probably done on his deathbed, and a portrait of Rabindranath by Prokash Das, he adds. 																								The exhibition also features Jamini Ray, Nandalal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij, among others.																								The other major draw would be the film section, organised by Eisenstein Cine Club. The five-day long festival, starting April 20, will open with Tarkovskys Andrei Rublyov, to be followed by Tareque Masuds Matir Moina, Subhadro Chowdhurys Prohor, Gautam Haldars Bhalo Theko and Malay Bhattacharyas Teen Ekke Teen.																								A commemorative brochure carrying write-ups by film-makers, writers, poets, theatre personalities and artistes on their long association with the institution will be brought out.																								The curtains come down on April 30, with a rendition of puratani Bengali songs by Ramkumar Chattopadhyay.

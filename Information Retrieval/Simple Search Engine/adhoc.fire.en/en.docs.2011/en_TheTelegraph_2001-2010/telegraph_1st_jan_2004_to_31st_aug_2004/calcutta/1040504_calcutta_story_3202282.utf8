 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Revival module for ailing botanical garden
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Guided by the green bench of Calcutta High Court, the Botanical Garden, in Shibpur, Howrah, plans to look beautiful once again. The high court-appointed expert committee has suggested several measures for the development and beautification of the largest flora and fauna centre of southeast Asia.																								Former head of the marine science department of Calcutta University Amalesh Chowdhury, former chief environmental officer of the West Bengal government Dhrubajyoti Ghosh and former deputy director of the Botanical Survey of India Dulal Chandra Paul, who are on the committee, have identified a number of factors responsible for the gardens pitiable condition.																								Already, the committees recommendation for the introduction of an entry fee into the garden has created a stir and prompted the garden authorities to provide morning-walkers with monthly admission cards.																								In its 11-page report, the committee says the interconnected water supply system of the garden is not functioning properly. 																								As a result, the lakes are often weed-infested. The soil has become loose, leading to the weakening of the roots. 																								The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the authorities looking after the garden, are not paying enough attention, the experts remarked.																								The committee suggested introduction of more mangrove trees along the riverbank to maintain the greenery and to check soil erosion. 																								Experts said repair of the buildings would be a costly affair. The buildings inside the garden were beyond economical repair. The quarters of the Group-D staff should be shifted to Andul Road and modern amenities be provided to the staff to keep in touch with garden officials, the committee said. 																								It criticised the Indian Botanical Garden authorities for not trying hard enough to declare the Roxburgh building inside the garden a heritage building. 																								The authorities should ask the CPWD to complete the renovation on a priority basis so that the historic building is transferred to the proposed museum and opened to the scientific world at the earliest, the experts said.																								The committee suggested that a battalion of the Central Industrial Security Force and the Central Reserve Police Force be deployed under the command of the current security officer to maintain law and order inside the garden.																								An entry fee should be introduced soon to check intruders in the garden. Morning-walkers and senior citizens should be provided with photo passes at a concessional rate, the committee opined. 																								The deplorable condition of the garden was first highlighted in court when green activist Subhash Dutta filed a public interest litigation demanding the judges intervention in the matter. 																								He told the court that a good number of rare flora and fauna of the garden were lost forever. He sought an order urging the authorities to maintain Roxburgh building in the garden. The matter will come up for hearing in a couple of weeks.

 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 SSKM gets college status
 																											- 100 students from this academic session, 100 more in Midnapore A STAFF REPORTER																								The Medical Council of India (MCI), the apex body deciding on recognition for new medical colleges, on Friday granted permission for 100 under-graduate medical seats at SSKM Hospital.																								The decision, taken at an MCI meeting in Delhi, was preceded by hectic lobbying by health department officials. It will soon be officially communicated to the state government. 																								Fridays meeting in Delhi was attended by health officials from Bengal, including P.K. Sur, director of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research.																								We have received information from Delhi that we will be able to start MBBS classes for 100 students at SSKM from this academic session. However, it will take some time for the official letter of permission to reach us, said director of medical education C.R. Maity.																								The MCI has already granted permission for 100 seats at the Midnapore Medical College. 																								With the additional 200 seats, the total number of medical seats in Bengal rises to 1,105. 																								Health officials said that during earlier inspections at SSKM, the MCI had pointed out an overcrowded emergency ward and an inadequate number of teachers in the gynaecology, medicine and surgery faculties.																								Lack of proper facilities at the emergency ward and the absence of a hostel for boys were also noted. The authorities told the inspection team that the boys hostel was located outside the hospital premises.																								To obtain the MCIs permission to start the MBBS course at SSKM this academic session, the health department moved quickly and recruited 11 teachers exclusively for gynaecology, medicine and surgery. The departments of physiology, anatomy and microbiology, too, were expanded.																								On July 9, a three-member MCI team, led by M.C.R. Vyas, visited SSKM for the final phase of inspection. The team visited almost all the departments, including surgery, medicine, gynaecology and paediatrics. 																								Being aware of the MCIs reservations about the absence of a boys hostel on the premises, the authorities renovated three old and vacant staff quarters  two of which were earlier occupied by well known physicians Mani Chhetri and Ajit Maity  that can accommodate 62 students.																								Senior health department officials said at Fridays meeting that the MCI members reportedly expressed their satisfaction over the arrangements at SSKM. 																								They said those among the 135 candidates selected last year in the enhanced fees scheme, who still wish to study MBBS, will be accommodated at the SSKM and Midnapore medical colleges.

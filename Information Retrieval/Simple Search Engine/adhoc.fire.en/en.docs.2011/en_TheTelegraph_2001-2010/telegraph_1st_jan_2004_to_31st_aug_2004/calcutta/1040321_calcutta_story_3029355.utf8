 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Councillor aims gun at CMC
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A mayoral council member of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is bent on dragging mayor Subrata Mukherjee to court. Member, mayor-in-council (slums), Javed Khan, along with some others, has filed a case in Calcutta High Court against Mukherjee and the civic authorities, claiming adequate compensation for the land Khans father was forced to part with at a nominal rate for the Science City complex, off the EM Bypass. 																								Justice P.K. Roy admitted the petitioners claim to be valid, but fixed the matter for hearing to give a chance to the civic authorities to make a submission on their behalf.																								In 1971, the state government had acquired vast stretches of land off the EM Bypass and handed them over to the CMC. The civic body was empowered to sell off the acquired land to the Science City authorities and compensate the people who were forced to give up their plots. Accordingly, the CMC sold off the plots and paid the land-owners Rs 3,000 per cottah as compensation. But dissatisfied with the amount, the land-owners, including Javed Khans father Karim Bux, filed a petition before the Land Acquisition Judge (LAJ), Alipore.																								The LAJ, after hearing the state government and the petitioners, observed that the compensation doled out to the land-owners was not adequate. The court directed the state to pay them more, but as the revenue generated from the land sale was with the CMC, the government asked the civic board to carry out the order of the LAJ. The CMC allegedly did not comply with the order. 																								After Karim Buxs death, Javed Khan took over as his legal heir. Along with a few others, he filed a court petition alleging that the civic body had not complied with the courts order. 																								When contacted on Saturday, mayor Mukherjee said: I have heard that a case has been initiated. But I am not aware of the details. The previous board had dealt with the matter. But if the court asks us to pay the due amount to the land-owners, we will certainly carry out the order.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Waking up to reality
																								To raise funds for sponsoring its various charitable activities, the Inner Wheel Club of Calcutta South East presents the Bengali play, Winkle-Twinkle, by the Sansriti. Written by Bratya Basu and directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay, the play revolves around the conflicts and contradictions that its protagonist Sabyasachi Sen is confronted with, when he returns home after vanishing mysteriously from police custody 20 years ago. An idealist to the core, Sen experiences grave moral dilemma in interacting with his family and friends who, he feels, have changed inexplicably from what he knew them to be in the past. His inability to relate to and accept his present surroundings is touched with realism and pathos, heightening our awareness of the loss of human values in the present day.																								Event: Play Winkle Twinkle by Sansriti																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

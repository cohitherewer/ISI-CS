 																											- From Bangla to Mumbai, largest haul of pirated DVDs, blue films A STAFF REPORTER																								Officers of the Calcutta zonal unit of the Central Directorate of Revenue Intelligence have unearthed an international video-piracy racket with the interception of a consignment of digital video discs (DVDs) and compact discs (CDs) from Bangladesh, en route to Mumbai, on April 19. The disclosure was made on Friday. 																								The consignment consisted of 2,000 pirated Hindi and English feature films and 9,000 pornographic films, the largest haul of its kind made by any agency in Calcutta to date. Its worth has been pegged at more than Rs 16 lakh in the black market.																								Two persons were arrested, though the intended recipient of the consignment, a person based in Mumbai, is yet to be rounded up.																								We received a tip-off about the consignment, and we raided the office of India Courier, at 124B, Rabindra Sarani, on Monday. Employees of the courier service could not produce the valid documents, so the consignment was seized immediately, said Narayan Basu, additional director-general of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.																								Officers then initiated a probe into the incident, and in the course of the next two days, arrested two persons, from whom they learnt more about the consignment, how it reached Calcutta, and the name and address of the man who would ultimately receive it in Mumbai.																								Abodh Sharma, owner of India Courier, was picked up from his office on April 20. On being questioned, he revealed that the consignment had come from Bangladesh. A man by the name of Arvind Baheti had arranged for the consignment to be sent to Mumbai to his boss by air.																								Further investigation led the directorate officers to Baheti, who admitted that he represented the Mumbai kingpin, and had brought the consignment from Bangladesh by road, crossing the border at Bongaon. 																								Baheti was arrested on April 21, and is being interrogated about the detailed route taken from Bangladesh, the mode of conveyance and the whereabouts of his employer.																								The consignment has been sealed and stashed away in the directorate office. Both Sharma and Baheti were produced in court and remanded in jail custody till May 5.																								We have the name of the Mumbai kingpin, though we cannot reveal it at the moment for the sake of the investigation. A team will soon leave for Mumbai to pick him up, Basu added.																								He conceded that he was not sure whether an organised gang dealing in video piracy was at work or not. However, the formidable size of the consignment left no room for doubt about the flourishing blackmarket in pirated videos across the region.

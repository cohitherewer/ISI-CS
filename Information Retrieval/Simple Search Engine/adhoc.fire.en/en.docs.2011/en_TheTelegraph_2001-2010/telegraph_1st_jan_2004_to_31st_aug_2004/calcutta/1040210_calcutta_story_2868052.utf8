The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 All for AB, actor or leader
 Amitabh Bachchan  (top) and Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Faces for the future India may be shining bright,  but who does Generation Y see as its natural leader? Is  a change of guard in order, or are we happy with the powers  that be? Young Metro suggested that it was Time to Talk  about politics, asking the question: Who would you want  as Prime Minister (politician/non-politician) and why? A common man, who would understand  our views and needs. He or she would work towards the betterment  of the country by wiping out illiteracy and helping everyone  become financially stable. He would also deal with foreign  affairs efficiently. Above all, he has to be honest. But  Im afraid I am yet to meet such a mettlesome person.				 				 																															Shreya Bose Amitabh Bachchan would be my ideal  choice for Prime Minister of India. He is the quintessential  Indian ambassador, possessing a dignified and cordial personality  with just the right dose of aggression and enthusiasm. He  will surely be able to steer India to a position of leadership. Md Tarique Nisar,
 IInd year, St Xaviers College The most suitable Prime Minister  would be Atal Bihari Vajpayee. A country of one billion  people fraught with numerous problems needs a dynamic leader  to tackle the issues. Vajpayee is one person who has handled  all of Indias problems with dignity and wisdom. Not only  has Indias relations with neighbours improved considerably,  the country has performed well in terms of economic growth,  too. Now, in the 21st century, we need a leader like Vajpayee  to guide us down the path to economic development. Roshni Sengupta,
 IIIrd year, Lady Brabourne College Its true that the common people  cant trust politicians. Whenever we have backed someone  who says they wish to do something for the betterment of  the country, they dont keep the promises made before the  elections, and seem to spend all their energy on corrupt  practices. But if we say a non-political person could be  a better choice than what we have so far, we may be grasping  at straws. This could prove to be more of a threat than  what we now have.				 				 																															Tanmoy Ghosh, The elections are nearing and  all the candidates are gearing up. But one person need not  indulge in all such activities, and that man is our reigning  Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He has proved his worth  well enough to satisfy his critics. The nuclear test, the  refusal to bow down to the CTBT, the Kargil face-off and  negotiations with Pakistan assure us of his political skill  and intelligence. The BJP has a powerful candidate in him  and my vote will always go to the man who has successfully  upheld the dignity of our country. Shreya Chakraborti,
 Class XII, G.D. Birla The only name that comes to mind  for the post of Prime Minister is Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  No one else is as able or competent as he is. His policy   national or foreign  is praiseworthy. He is the only  reason why relations with Pakistan have improved. Opening  the new bus route has brought the people closer. He has  achieved excellence even in economic policy, accelerating  growth. He has kept a strict vigil on his ministers performance.  His ability has kept the members of the NDA in check as  well. Sharmistha Dan,
 Class XII, Shri Shikshayatan School				 				 																															Peace talk				 				 																															The Telegraph in Schools peace ambassadors held an interactive session with students and teachers of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy on February 5 about their recent trip to Pakistan.

The delegates wanted to clear  misconceptions about Pakistan. Questions came up about the  lifestyle and the attitude to education there. English teacher  Mr Routh asked if, given a chance, they would settle in  Paksitan. Ankita was quick to reply that she wouldnt leave  India at any cost. The peace ambassadors shared anecdotes  and sang a dosti song learnt in Pakistan along with  the audience.

Language constraints were removed from the creative war. Creative writing, slogan-and-poster-making, elocution and extempore competitions saw participants display talents in Hindi, Bengali and English. Fib-2-Minutes, an event that required participants to continuously lie for two minutes brought much humour to the programme. The quiz and antakshari drew the most participants. But the choreography competition was, predictably, the best attended, with the audience spilling out of the auditorium at the Open Air Theatre.				 				 																															Emphasis was laid on music, with contests in many categories. Netajinagar College won most of the solo vocal events. The group song laurels went to the home team, as did all the first prizes for the team events of quizzing, antakshari and choreography.				 				 																															Guest performers entertained the audience in the evenings. A Bengali play was performed to end the first day, with Dohar concluding Day II. Indrani Sen and the band Saptak charmed the crowds the following night. The finale on January 30 featured bands Lakkhichara and Bhoomi.				 				 																															The arts faculty also hosted some sporting action, with ESPN-Star Sports and Unish Kuri magazine bringing in the Soccer Rocker contest. Competitions and quizzes earned several students English Premiere League calendars and Unish Kuri T-shirts. A student sextet chanted its entry, ManU Rocks, dedicated to Manchester United, while Lakkhichhara provided the music.  Adwaita Das,
 English, Jadavpur University				 				 																															Rhythm rage				 				 																															Loreto House presented an annual show on January 31.

Not really, and to cater to the modern womans changing jewellery needs, Trendsmith, a relatively-new designer jewellery outlet on Loudon Street, has recently launched the signature collection of Nirmal Zaveri, the design legend from Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri.

Named the N7 and N8 Europa collection, the line is an evocative tribute to the contemporary woman. It takes in exclusive hand-crafted pieces fashioned out of pure 18 K white and yellow gold, brilliant diamonds and a host of semi-precious stones such as peridots, amethysts, onyx, yellow topaz, mother of pearl and more. The designs are bold and contemporary  chunky white gold pieces sprinkled with rose-cut diamonds, colourful stones churned into earrings and bracelets, intricate gold filigree and granulation on gold are some of the unique statements.

This landmark event saw new ideas, styles and designs meet under a single roof to showcase the latest that the market offers in furniture, upholstery, lights, paintings, floorings, wall hangings and home appliances.

Also available at each stall was a large volume of product information including sizes, prices and installation procedures, down to the last detail.

Unicon combines leather and upholstery with wrought-iron, the Metallica DArt range of furniture consists of plain wrought- iron beds, tables, flower stands and lamps. A bedroom package at S.T. Unicon costs Rs 23,000 and that at Metallica DArt, Rs 20,000. Both manufacturers stressed on the need for checking the authenticity of the wrought-iron according to the weight of the furniture to avoid being duped. Taag Lifestyle impressed with its youth furniture made of cherrywood, leather and teakwood.

Italian chef Alex Bignotti conducts a cookery class for city socialites at The Hub, The Taj Bengal												A taste of Italy																					The Hub, the Italian eatery at The Taj Bengal was an area of hectic activity recently. As the gas oven was lit, vegetables chopped and spices added, Italian chef Alex Bignotti demonstrated his cooking skills before an eager audience. Assorted socialites peered over the cooking counter to catch Alex in action and to pick up invaluable tips about Italian cuisine. Armed with notepads and pens, Shamlu Dudeja, Mallika Varma, Nilanjana Chakraborty, Threety Irani, Nilufer Babycon, Maina Bhagat, Maina Kakkar, Alka Jalan and Rita Punwani, to name a few, took keen interest in the recipes handed down by Alex. 																					Marvelling at the speed and ease with which Alex worked at his recipes, the women kept the chef engaged with their queries on Italian cuisine and styles of cooking. Executive chef Surinder Singh and Alex selected three of their favourite Italian recipes to teach at the cookery class. Those fond of pasta went away feeling pleased with themselves after learning to cook Rigatoni with Spring Onion, Cherry Tomato and Mozzarella. This Italian delight tastes heavenly with that dash of extra virgin olive oil and sprinkling of fresh basil and crushed pepper. 																					Rice is an integral part of Indian cuisine. Bearing this in mind, Alex imparted his cooking skills so as to include a rice dish namely, Risotto with Porcini Mushroom. The Risotto cooked in vegetable stock and white wine with a generous amount of Porcini mushrooms was an instant hit with the women. They promised to try it at home and prove a point to their families. 																					ian tomato sauce adds flavour to most dishes. And the skill to make authentic Italian sauce is easy to acquire, according to Alex. His recipe included such ingredients as fresh tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, fresh basil and finely-crushed black pepper. The result was a sauce ready to be used with all Italian recipes. Keen to preserve its taste, Alex advised his students to refrain from refrigerating the sauce for more than three days.																					An important point of the cookery session was the suggestion of alternatives for expensive and rare Italian ingredients. At the end of the session, the guests seemed eager to put their newly-acquired Italian culinary skills to test at the earliest.

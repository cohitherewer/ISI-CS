 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Father blocked drug use: Doctors
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hours after eight-year-old Antarleena was rushed to Suraksha hospital, a medical team overseeing the treatment of the girl suffering from Downs Syndrome had recommended Ofloxacin, a superior antibiotic usually given to patients suffering from diarrhoea. 																								But Debapriya Mallick, her doctor-father, stopped the doctors from administering the drug, alleged the Suraksha authorities on Wednesday.																								I still have the prescription with me. Even our nephrologist Ranjan Sarkar had recommended that the drug be given to the girl to check any secondary infection, but Mallick stopped us from doing so, alleged Somnath Chatterjee, CEO of Suraksha.																								When Antarleena was rushed to hospital last Thursday, she was suffering from acute diarrhoea, accompanied by vomiting, prompting the doctors to prescribe the antibiotic. 																								He constantly refused to allow us to give her that particular drug. We had no option but to go for an alternative, which might have failed to control a hidden infection, Chatterjee said.																								He was echoed by paediatrician Debasish Roy, who had been treating Antarleena from her birth eight years ago. Roy said: He thought the antibiotic could cause rashes, but we tried to reason with him without any success.																								However, both Debapriya Mallick and brother Jyotipriya, a Trinamul Congress MLA, said the allegations were baseless. They are experts in the field of medicine and have far better knowledge than I. They are cooking up stories to save their skin, said Debapriya.																								Hospital authorities said Mallick, himself a general physician who treats many children, was always beside his daughters bed. 																								We always kept him informed about the prognosis of the case and told him that it would be very difficult to save her, said Chatterjee. 																								Even after Antarleenas death, Debapriya did not allege negligence, but called up on Saturday to say that he would like to sit with the doctors on Tuesday to find out what exactly went wrong.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Himachal plot given to robust IT firm
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Get going or get out  the message is clear from the Buddhadeb do-it-now Bhattacharjee government.																								In what can be seen as one of the most pro-active measures initiated by the Left government, the information technology (IT) department has asked the Himachal Pradesh government to shift out of the three acres of prime land in Salt Lake Electronic Complex (Saltlec). 																								The land was allotted by the urban development department to the Himachal Pradesh government for construction of a cold storage. But the land has been lying unutilised for the past 20 years, explained G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT. 																								The plot will now be transferred to Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), which has its campus on a three-acre plot adjacent to it.																								We had to release the land for CTS, as the company wants to expand its operations in the city and set up another building. There are a few issues that need to be resolved before the land is transferred, but we want to do it as soon as possible, explained Gautama. 																								The state government is in search of another plot, which will be given to Himachal Pradesh. 																								According to Gautama, the government  along with its nodal IT agency Webel  is trying its best to utilise the plots lying vacant in the states IT hub. 																								Siddhartha Mukherjee, vice-president, CTS, welcomed the governments initiative and said that the company will not spend much time in adding to its capacity in Calcutta. 																								CTS plans to take its headcount at its Calcutta centre from 1,100 to 1,600 by the end of the year. 																								With the IT industry showing signs of another take-off, we are drawing up major expansion plans, explained Mukherjee. 																								We have a lot of good projects in the pipeline. We are growing very fast, but the space in our facility is not adequate. We can house only 950 people here, he added. 																								Saddled with space constraints, the company is operating out of two rented premises Decon and Vishnu Solutions  with around 250 techies logging on to their work at these two leased properties. 																								Mukherjee said CTS would start construction at the site once all the commercial aspects of the transfer are completed and resources earmarked for the project. 																								He, however, declined to comment on the financial outlay for the project, which is yet to be finalised. 																								The company, which employs around 10,000 people in its offices across India and abroad, will take the number to around 14,000 by the turn of this year.

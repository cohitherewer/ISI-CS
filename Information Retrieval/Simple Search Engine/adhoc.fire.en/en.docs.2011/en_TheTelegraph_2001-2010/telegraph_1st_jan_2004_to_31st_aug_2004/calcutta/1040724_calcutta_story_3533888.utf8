	The malaria scare has assumed worrying proportions in some parts of Calcutta and its suburbs with the advent of monsoon. Stagnant water accumulated at roadsides are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. What is appaling is the fact that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is not undertaking awareness drives during these months. The CMC seems to have stopped the spraying of disinfectants in drains and sewer outlets in the city. The civic body should not be a passive spectator to the malaria menace at this crucial hour.Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town. 
	The structure of the bus-shed at Quality stoppage, in Salt Lake, is supported by two pillars on either side of the shed. Now, a bamboo divider has been erected connecting the pillars, reducing the floor area of the shed by half, and a political partys newspaper is pasted on the bamboo partition. A few flags of the same party have also been hoisted there. How long should the commuters suffer silently? Madhabi D. Ghosh, Kankurgachi.

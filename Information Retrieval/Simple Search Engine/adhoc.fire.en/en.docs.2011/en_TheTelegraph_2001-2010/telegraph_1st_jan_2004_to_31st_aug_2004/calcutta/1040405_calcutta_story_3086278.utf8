		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Water-bound in every season
								Nilotpal Mukherjee: Pockets of the ward remain waterlogged round the year. Cant something be done to rectify the situation?																																																													Excess drainage water at Basudevpur, Sarkarhaat, Subhaspally, Khudirampally, Anandanagar and Debinagar causes the waterlogging. In the past, these low-lying areas stayed water-bound for eight months annually. But the condition has improved with repairs to the drainage system along the road. 																																																													The roads at Anandanagar have been restructured with concrete pads. However, this is only a temporary solution. A 150-ft concrete footbridge has been constructed after removing a temporary log-bridge recently, so pedestrians dont need to wade through waterlogged roads.

 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Pensieve for Potter facts
 (From left) Emma Watson, JK Rowling, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe arrive at the premiere of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban at Leicester Square, London. (AFP) Want a glimpse into the sixth book in the Harry Potter series? Or chat to J.K. Rowling herself? Or maybe get an insight into how the boy wizard was born?				 				 																															Its possible now, with the usually reticent author willing to share her views with her young readers. Although not known to give too many interviews or speak openly about herself, Rowling, in a drastic revamp of her website, is now offering all the information that her fans so desperately seek and a look into her own life. 				 				 																															Just log on to www.jkrowling.com and get your answers. 				 				 																															The entrance to the site is a recreation of her worktable, with computer, diaries, pens, scribbled notes and even family photographs, complete with a crawling spider and fluttering butterfly. But heres the crunch  there are hidden clues, which regular visitors can find and get hints to the sixth book, upon the discovery of which they get a page dedicated in her scrapbook. 				 				 																															With the release of the third film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban almost upon Harry Potter fans and speculation about the next book rife, the mother of two has decided to take it upon herself to counter rumours  Harry is most definitely not Dumbledores or Voldemorts son/grandson, and neither is Lily Potter alive nor was she a death-eater (how dare you?!).				 				 																															And she also gives relevant information through the Daily Prophet  she has never done a book-signing for Order of the Phoenix, so signed copies are very rare. Theres a section of FAQs where she answers letters sent to her. But if you want to actually speak to her, tune in to the chat room at www.mugglenet.com (an unofficial Harry Potter fan site created by students), and watch out for the user Squidward. 				 				 																															The extra stuff section deals with miscellaneous details, which were never used in the books but which are dear to her, like Dean Thomas background and a poem by Nearly Headless Nick explaining how he died  he grew a tusk on Lady Grieve instead of straightening her teeth and was executed with a blunt axe.				 				 																															But perhaps whats most interesting for fans who have regarded Rowling as an enigma is that she talks about her family. Nuggets abound in the site like the fact that her parents met on a train and fell in love, she and her younger sister Di fought like cats and dogs and her mother died of multiple sclerosis which made Harrys loss more personal to her.				 				 																															Although she reiterates that for the most part the characters in the books are fictional, she admits that she was a little like Hermione when she was younger, but despite being a right little know-it-all, under that swottiness is insecurity and a great fear of failure. And Gilderoy Lockhart is the only one based on someone she knew, who used to tell whopping great fibs to show how wonderful, brave and brilliant he was.				 				 																															Oh, and she conceived of Harry in a train, and although she didnt have a pen, she thought for three hours during the journey and wrote it later. However, her first letter from a publisher was one of rejection. Wonder whether that person is howling louder with every addition to the series.				 				 																
	 Taking em to task				 				 																															Every morning, right after breakfast, little Aishi races up the stairs to the roof. To do her holiday homework. They have a chapter on different parts of a plant and how seeds grow. This year, they have to grow a plant rather than just answer questions on it, her mother Chaitali explains. 				 				 																															South Point School has devised ways to take the drudgery out of holiday homework with innovative tasks that add dollops of fun to the learning exercise. I am watering my plant every day. It is still very little, Class III student Aishi says of her new pet. 				 				 																															The change in the schools stance is spelt out right at the beginning of the homework book. Rename the English Holiday Homework exercise book My Book of Activity and Fun. 				 				 																															Says principal Madhu Kohli: Parents have long been complaining about the continuous pressure that kids are subjected to, which leaves them with hardly any time to relax. That made us think of a way to ease the load. The school had taken the first step in this direction in 2003 when the half-yearly exams were shifted before the Puja vacation, allowing children to enjoy themselves during the festival without worrying over preparations. 				 				 																															When the teachers sat down to devise the tasks for the summer, they had twin considerations. We got rid of much of the written work. But there are certain things like tables that children tend to forget if they are not in touch. So we had to make sure that there was a balance between the work and the play elements, Kohli explains. 				 				 																															What has come out is a mix of both. Instead of the mandatory essay, Class IV students have been given a situation and asked to develop a cartoon character with special powers and develop a storyline. With the current craze for Pokemon or the alien Jadoo in Koi... Mil Gaya, we thought they would enjoy this. 				 				 																															With two weeks gone and two weeks more to go for the school to reopen, the tasks are in various stages of completion. Class V students have to surprise their mother at the breakfast table. Debmoy wants to cook Maggi, but never having tried his hand at the kitchen, he has left that adventure for the end, concentrating on the more conventional parts like arithmetic for now. But for Anandi, who has been dishing out instant noodles since age seven, this was a cakewalk. I prepared grilled sandwich one morning even before my mother woke up. She was very happy, she gushes, rattling off the recipe in one breath. 				 				 																
	 Fun designs				 				 																															Invited by Landmark, Ranjan De of National Institute of Design held a summer workshop for students aged six to 15 years at the shopping mall from May 12 to 22. It was divided into two sessions  the morning was for six to 10-year-olds and the afternoon was for the others.				 				 																															The students were taught to make pop-up cards, puppets, paper animals, clay modelling, matchstick figures and Chinese paper dragons. In rural India, I have seen a lot of recycling but in the urban areas rubbish is just thrown away. I want to teach people how to reuse things, said De.				 				 																															The 34 participants made models of animals from plastic glasses and also learnt to make figures and shapes through finger shadows. Subhajoy Roy,
Class XII, Mitra Institution  High fives: Kids have a rocking time at Greenage summer camp on Southern Avenue. Picture by Pradip Sanyal				 				 																															Career cruise				 				 																															The 13th career fair held at the Ice Skating Rink in May was a great place to get information on career options and job opportunities. There were over 100 choices, from engineering, hotel management, media studies, advertising and mass communication to the merchant navy, jewellery designing, beautician and air cabin crew. 				 				 																															Representatives of foreign institutions from the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Singapore were an integral part of the fair. Institutions like Arena Multimedia, ZED CA, International School of Business and Media and many others drew youngsters to their attractively decorated stalls.				 				 																															Spot-counselling, free career guide books, free psychometric tests and interactive seminars were on offer. For those who missed this summers event, watch out for the next one. Asif Salam,
1st year, Asutosh College				 				 																															
	 Trip to Tagore home				 				 																															Mitra Institution celebrated Rabindra Jayanti with a trip for its students to Jorasanko Thakurbari on May 18. The initiative to pay homage to the bard at his home was taken by some ex-students. Youngsters from Classes IX to XII were taken on the trip. 				 				 																															Students placed garlands in the room where Tagore breathed his last. They were then shown round the Rabindra Bharati museum. The thakurdalan, the permanent stage where plays and other cultural programmes were staged by the family members, and The Japan Gallery, which opened this 25 Boishak, featured on the tour itinerary.				 				 																															The clothes Tagore used to wear and accessories used by other family members were also shown. Viewing the room where the Nobel laureate used to write and meet people was exciting for the students. The highlight was going past the Dakhin Duar into the area which has many a mention in his writings. But neither the banyan tree nor the pukur exists today.				 				 																															The heat notwithstanding, the students traipsed from one side of the house to the other, tracing all the inroads to the andarmahal, enjoying every moment.  Subhajoy Roy,
Class XII, Mitra Institution

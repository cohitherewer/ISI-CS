 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Rajnis father under fire
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Manoj Patel was in tears after defence lawyers ended their grilling on Tuesday in the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrates court. On Wednesday, when the lawyers took him on again, the father of budding cricketer Rajnis, who died in SSKM Hospital in June last year, was tense.																								The defence team alleged that whatever Manoj had said before the judge as well as the police was false. The lawyers claimed that far from being a promising cricketer  as Manoj had said in his complaint with the police  Rajnis was just like any other boy in the city who played the game. 																								The proceedings started at the behest of public prosecutor Naba Kumar Das after a delay of over half-an-hour as senior defence counsel Amitava Ganguly could not make it to the court. 																								Appearing on behalf of accused physician Nirmalya Basu, Tapan Kumar Choudhury told Manoj to answer queries keeping in mind whatever he said could go against him. 																								Firing his volley of questions, Choudhury asked Manoj: Did Nirmalya Basu visit your son when he was profusely bleeding from his wound after the fourth surgery? Did Basu come on his own or was asked by his seniors? Did he press on the pin  placed to repair the fracture on Rajnis shinbone  to stop the bleeding? Did he force you to sign any paper during the fifth and final operation? What did he tell you after that? 																								Taking time to ensure that he understood the questions properly, Manoj replied: It was doctor D.K. Majumdar who had asked Basu to attend to my son. He came and pressed on the pin and the bleeding stopped for a while. 																								After urging me to sign the document  while my son was being operated upon for the fifth time  Basu had told me that Rajnis condition was deteriorating by the hour. One of the nurses, too, had made similar observations and asked me to shift my son to another hospital. 																								Choudhury shot back: All that youre saying is false. You are trying to falsely implicate the five accused doctors. Basu had not forced you to sign any paper, nor had he told you anything about your sons deteriorating condition.																								Dipit Bose, appearing on behalf of prime accused Dilip Kumar Majumdar, then took over from Choudhury and asked Manoj whether he had placed the necessary documents before the court to prove that Rajnis was a promising cricketer. If you could not produce the documents, how can you say that he was a good player? 																								The proceedings will resume on Thursday.

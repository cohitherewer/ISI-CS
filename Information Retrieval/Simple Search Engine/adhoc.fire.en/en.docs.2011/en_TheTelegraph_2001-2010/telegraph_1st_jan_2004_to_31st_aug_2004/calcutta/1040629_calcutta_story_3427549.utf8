 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 The goddess of harvest
																								From time immemorial, the seeds of folk culture have been sown in the ideas and imaginations of the people dwelling in our villages. Over generations, these ideas have gained popular acceptance and have gradually become an intrinsic part of our rural culture. In fact, some of the more popular folk customs and traditions have also found their way into literature in the form of folk tales and legends. Based on folklore originating in Panchakot, located on the fringes common to Bengal and Bihar, Bhadreswarir Galpo tells us about the origin of the festival of Bhadu which is shrouded in mystery. It tells the story of the transformation of the gracious princess Bhadreswari into a cult figure. In the play, Bhadreswari or Bhadu is invoked by villagers through the singing of songs, seeking Her blessings for an abundant harvest. Conceived and directed by Rishi Mukhopadhyay.																								Event: Bhadreswarir Galpo, play in Bengali by Naba Mayukh Nattya Sangstha																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Sisir Mancha

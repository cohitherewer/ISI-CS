Victor BanerjeeMove over, wasabe. Its true. I season my articles with a sprinkling of obtuse observations and a pinch of piquant social commentary. I try and put my ideas across with the sort of cryptic chicanery that my wife hates, simply because it goes over her puritanical head, and a handful of cynical geniuses who blew their minds with magic weeds in the 60s, love.The only feedback that is important, I suppose, is that a whole lot of people who are accustomed to watching Balajis soaps, where the characters are all finely etched with bludgeons and made up to look like a selection of inorganically grown and genetically engineered clones of vegetables, actually end up reading my recipes and cooking them. Not true. I have on record some rather illustrious folk who read my socio-economic recipeaic tirades and then proceed to cook and adore the stuff I recommend.But every now and then, writing becomes a task. Writers block be damned, I simply dont have the discipline that it takes to sharpen pencils or tap at a key board while missing out on Julia leaving her husband for an older Undertaker at her father-in-laws funeral. Thats what happened this last week.Then into my lap landed a gift parcel from Norfolk, in England. Thats where I shoot pheasant with one hand and swig sloe gin with the other, at a friends farm, every time I visit him in winter. I opened the package to find the most sensational array of Colmans mustards I had ever beheld. Also in the bag was a leaflet. Plagiarism being the soft option to writers cramps, I am taking the liberty to divulge the contents of what will be an educational experience for all of us who love sorsh (Bengali) loathe Dijon (French) and adore Colmans (English) mustard. So, here goes.When mixing Colmans Mustard, always blend with a little cold liquid to form a smooth paste; never use hot liquids as this will result in a bitter taste. Traditionally water should be used but white wine, wine vinegar, cider vinegar and even beer or spirits can all add that extra taste. A little milk or cream will create a richness of flavour and texture...To add flavour and bite to dressings, blend some mustard with a little honey and then add oil and vinegar  delicious for tossed salads. Alternatively make a creamy dressing of Greek-style yoghurt and fresh chopped herbs, season with mustard and stir into a crunchy carrot and cabbage salad, or one of raw mushrooms and prawns.Powder mustard enhances a basic white sauce and is ideal for a base for fish dishes, vegetable gratin or souffl... Even cottage cheese is transformed by adding just a teaspoon of Colmans Mustard, which will pep up both flavour and appearance. Alternatively, spread Colmans Whole Grain Mustard mixed with a little honey over chicken drumsticks or pork chops for an easy, especially tasty coating.For an easy variation on garlic bread, slice a French bread stick at intervals to the base, then spread with liberal helpings of any mustard and butter mixed in equal amounts. Wrap in foil and pop in oven for about five minutes. Vegetarian dishes particularly those with beans and chickpeas get a flavour lift from a spoonful of mustard.When you are next frying bacon, sprinkle a little mustard powder on the bottom of the frying panMustard, when combined with wine, beer, citrus fruits or olive oil, makes a delicious basting medium for grilled meats and poultry. To make the baste, combine half a cup of the mustard with half a cup of olive oil and one-third cup of wine, beer, fresh lemon, lime or orange juice. One or two cloves of crushed garlic and two tablespoons of fresh herbs or spices will also improve the flavourDieting doesnt have to mean a succession of dull and dreary salads For a low fat dip try mixing a spoonful of mustard with Greek yoghurt or fromage frais.For something different, try Colmans mustard powder on your roast potatoes. Part-boil your potatoes, drain and sprinkle over two teaspoons of mustard powder, replace the pan lid and toss. Roast the potatoes in a baking tray with hot oil and they will come out with a lovely crunchy skin.To spice up new potatoes, boil them until cooked but still firm. Make up a dressing of three tablespoons of Whole Grain Mustard, two cloves of crushed garlic, one tbsp of lemon juice, one tbsp of vinegar, three tbsps of olive oil, five finely chopped spring onions and some salt and pepper. Mix all the ingredients together and toss the potatoes in the dressing.For a delicious pan fried steak or pork, mix some Dry Peppercorn Mustard with a little water, spread all over the meat and saut with a few onions and mushrooms. Once cooked, add a little white wine and cream to make a lovely peppercorn sauce. For roast meats, mix some Dry Mustard with Chives with a little water; spread all over the joint of meat and pop it in the oven This also works well with lamb steaks, chops and kebabs. Rub Tarragon amp; Thyme Mustard Powder into a lightly oiled whole fresh chicken and put a little mustard powder inside the body. Roast to get a lovely flavour in the chicken and gravy.So the next time you go to England, dont just waste time in Selfridges or Harrods buying silk underwear. Walk into the grocery section and fill your shopping basket with mustards that will revitalise your kitchen and give you a nose-tingling kick-start to life in the new millennium.

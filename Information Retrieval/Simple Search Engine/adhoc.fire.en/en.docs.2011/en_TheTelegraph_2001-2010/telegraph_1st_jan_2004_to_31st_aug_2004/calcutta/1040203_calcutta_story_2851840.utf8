 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 To sir, a call of defiance
 PRONAB MONDAL																								Call me Sir...And dont forget to stand up when you see me  a written circular to this effect was issued by an officer of inspector rank to his subordinates at Lalbazar police headquarters.																								The officer-in-charge (OC) of the telephone cell, Lakshmi Kanta Mishra, felt his subordinates  women telephone operators and other clerical staff  were not respectful enough. But in spite of issuing the written order and complaining to superiors, his subordinates were in no mood to oblige, saying: There is no reason to call him sir and we are not bound to stand up.																								Mishras ego was hurt a few weeks ago when he joined as the OC, telephone cell, where 50 women operators work. The first day when Mishra went to the wireless building at Lalbazar on a routine visit, he was taken aback when the women addressed him as Mr Mishra without making an effort to stand up. They casually acknowledged his presence but beyond that, there was no sign of respect. Mishra was not pleased at all.																								A few days later, Mishra called all his staff members and told them that they must address him as sir and stand up whenever he entered the room, said an official of the telephone cell, adding: When no one paid any heed to the instructions, Mishra issued a written note.																								But, as the official explained: We are ministerial staff and are not supposed to follow the rules laid down as police regulations. We dont address anyone below the rank of IPS as sir.																								Mishra then put his case before an IPS officer. I have heard about it. I have spoken to both Mishra and his subordinates. It is a fact that clerical staff are not supposed to call their bosses sir. However, the matter is being sorted out, said the IPS officer, on condition of anonymity. 																								When Mishra was contacted, mum was the word for the policeman, who feels his subordinates have not treated him right.

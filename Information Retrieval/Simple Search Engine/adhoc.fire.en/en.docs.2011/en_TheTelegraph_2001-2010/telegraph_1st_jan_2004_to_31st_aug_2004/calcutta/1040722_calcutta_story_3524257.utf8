The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, July 22, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Don Henley, singer. You are by nature non-interfering, but never fail to seize an opportunity. Your mental calibre is quite high, so avoid depression. Dont give up after just one try. Check extravagance. Family offers mental and moral support. Friends are few but dependable.  Kusum Bhandari

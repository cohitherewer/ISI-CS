The richest Indian visits Rajarhat early in the morning, before heading for Writers Buildings to meet chief minister Bhattacharjee and roll out big plans for Bengal.																								Yes, we are interested in acquiring land in the New Town, but that will be Phase III of our operations, said Premji, without divulging the details. 																								From checking out the work in progress at Wipros facility in Salt Lake to meeting Bengals information technology (IT) officialdom to addressing students at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) function  Premjis Friday schedule was packed.																								Our operations will start by the end of May and in the first phase, we will be employing around 1,500 people, he said, after his 35-minute meeting with the chief minister.																								We will invest another Rs 25 crore in a years time and have plans to recruit around 4,500 people in all our facilities here, added Premji.																								The over Rs 5,000-crore company has already invested Rs 50 crore in setting up its own facility at Salt Lakes Sector V.																								As per Premjis plans, Wipro will kick off its Calcutta operations with both business process outsourcing and software development.																								The chief minister seemed satisfied with the Wipro progress report. Their development centre on 12 acres in Salt Lake is ready.

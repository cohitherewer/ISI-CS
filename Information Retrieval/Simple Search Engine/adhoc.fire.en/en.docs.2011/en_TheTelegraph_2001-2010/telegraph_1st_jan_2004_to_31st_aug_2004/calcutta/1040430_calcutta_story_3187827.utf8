The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, April 30, 2004 Pure pageantry and a purrfect after-party 
 Contestants during the ethnic round of Tilottama on Wednesday night at the ITC Sonar Bangla. Pictures by Pabitra Das 																								 They started out nervy, but by the end of an evening of surprises, the 20 finalists of Godrej Renew Hair Colour Cream Sananda Tilottama pageant owned the stage, even those who didnt make it.																								Though there was only room for three winners  Grace Gomes was named Tilottama, with Cheena Vyas and Sonali Sehgal following as first and second runners-up  Wednesday night belonged to them all. In fact, the judges panel (with out-of-towners Rahul Khanna, VJ Anushka, aroma-therapy expert Blossom Kochar and danseuse Aruna Mohanty; Tollywood faces Indrani Halder, Jeet, Goutam Ghose and former Tilottama contestant and model Reshmi Ghosh) was so busy watching, they forgot to grade them in one crucial round!																								The action-packed finale, held at the ITC Sonar Bangla, started off with filmmaker and Sananda editor Aparna Sen introducing the pageant. Beauty is something you also create, she said, before welcoming the judges.																								All eyes were on the stars of the show when the 20 finalists, who have been groomed for a few weeks by experts after being chosen at a preliminary selection, floated on to stage in a splash of colour. The girls, wearing dazzling lehngas, walked the catwalk as an AV flashed a little bit about each.																								After the girls left the ramp, (they do need time to doll up between rounds!), host Barry Brien introduced the first entertainment act  Manipuri Natyanalaya.																								The contestants were ready for round two. Looking at ease, they strutted on in a range of red and maroon gowns.																								But that was when, unknown to the audience  including chief guest first lady Anjanaben Shah, singer Usha Uthup and actress Raima Sen  a bit of unscripted chaos occurred. The judges were supposed to have given in their scorecards after the western wear round. But since they had forgotten to do their bit, the girls had to do the sequence once again!																								While an M.P. Jewellers show kept the crowd busy, the marks were tallied and the final eight narrowed down. Then, as things were being worked out behind the scenes, Barry put his quizmaster skills to good use, throwing questions to the audience about the judges. The first few awards of the night were also given out, for the sub-category competition, with the help of Usha Uthup. Grace Gomes bagged the best smile sash. Kaustavi Sarkar won the Most Beautiful Eyes award and the Viewers Choice Award (voted on Alpha Bangla). Most Beautiful Skin went to Sonali Sehgal, as did the Most Beautiful Hair and the Miss Bedazzled titles. Cheena Vyas was named Miss Congeniality.																								The second entertainment capsule came in the form of singer Hariharan. He opened with a song from his album Kaash, which he categorised as Urdu jazz, before moving onto film songs  Chhai Chhapa Chhai and Hai Rama in duet with Calcutta-based singer Chandreyee, and Yaadein.																								The finalists were declared and two question rounds followed  one serious, with judges shooting questions, and then a comic departure with Barry and team pulling the girls legs. Grace was quizzed by Rahul on which was more important, faith or science. A balance of both. Science rules the head and faith, the heart and soul, was Graces winning answer.The top three names were finally announced, with last years winners, Jyoti Brahmin, Kimberlene and Sayantani, handing over their crowns. Time will tell whether these new queens will go the distance, as so many before them have done.Star chatterThe gala logically gave way to a party at the banquets where the citys A-list had converged to raise a toast to the ladies in red. Spotted digging into the sumptuous buffet spread were a bevy of stars who indulged in some friendly banter and purred on about the pageant June Maliah and a model at the M.P. Jewellers sequence.Raima Sen exuded calculated calm in a blue chiffon drape that was precariously tied (Im just not used to this, she moaned tucking in those slippery sari pleats). The actors heart warmed to the quiet confidence reflected by the contestants. I attended a Tilottama pageant after many years and it felt very good to see that finally Calcutta girls are as confident and well-groomed as their Mumbai counterparts, smiled Raima. A dash of humour injected into the proceedings, with funny skits performed in between rounds was another winner, apart from the newly-crowned queens, of course, for the Chokher Bali girl.																								Ex-Tilottama Reshmi Ghosh stuck on to add some sparkle to the after-party in a blue crepe sari studded with badla work. Its a Ritu Kumar creation, she announced with careful carelessness. The dusky beauty has gone places since she first tried her luck on the Tilottama stage. Now she takes time off from her busy schedule to judge the pageant. The nostalgia was palpable and the model, who will soon be spotted on screen with a Bollywood debut in the offing, was thrilled that Bengalis are finally coming out of their shell and that the pageant has been growing from strength to strength and the crown is getting more beautiful by the day. Well, youve had your share, baby!																								Her co-judge Goutam Ghose, the serious filmmaker known for his no-nonsense views, looked a little out of place at the gathering. I just joined the jury because the request came from good friend Aparna. Ive known her for many years and couldnt refuse, confided Gautam.																								The force behind the gala, Aparna Sen, looked stunning in a yellow and maroon kanjeevaram. The filmmaker looked happily flushed and a little tired after what had obviously been a very hectic day. We had some interesting side-lights this year like the Manipuri dance sequence, she said. The editor is already planning a pageant for men some time soon.																								Tollywood darling Jishu Sengupta looked chic as he casually worked the room flirting with starlets, in a casual white shirt, denims and white shoes. Even though men have (sadly) been left out of the Tilottama loop, Jishu shouldered it well. Its good for Calcutta that such events are taking place. The pageant has discovered many famous faces in the past and we can expect some of the winners to do Calcutta proud this time around as well, gushed Jishu.																								His colleague Jeet, looking flashy in a translucent black embroidered shirt and corduroy pants, was obviously pleased with his eye-candy quotient as judge. It was a fabulous show. I plan to come here every year, that is if they invite me! he grinned.

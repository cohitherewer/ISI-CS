The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Day of saplings amp; roadshows
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the pollution peril crossing the point of tolerance in the city, the cry for more greenery in Calcutta is getting louder. 																								In a bid to raise awareness on the importance of maintaining an ecological balance, various city organisations are planning a host of programmes on June 5 to mark World Environment Day and kick-off a year-long campaign.																								The bouquet of events at the 184-year-old Agri Horticultural Society of India (AHSI) will range from tree-planting sessions for schoolkids to a round-table with experts and people from various walks of life. 																								Normally, we observe the day every year by planting trees on our campus, but this year, we have decided to observe the day on a larger scale and roll it out beyond the Society, says Deepak Erasmus, secretary and CEO, AHSI. 																								The programme will be kicked off early in the morning with the beautification of roads around the society with planting of avenue trees, flowering trees and green shrubs. 																								Students from Laxmipat Singhania Academy and St Thomas, Kidderpore, along with National Cadet Corps (NCC) members, will plant trees in the presence of US consul-general George N. Sibley. 																								The days programme will end with a round table on environmental challenges facing society. The list of speakers will include Meera Bhattacharjee, wife of the chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and Yogesh Barman, minister in charge of forests. 																								To reach people in other areas, four trucks  two each for north and south Calcutta  will roam the city, distributing leaflets, with celebrities and NCC volunteers on board. Roadshows play a crucial role in raising awareness and we want to organise more such events in the city, adds Erasmus. 																								Another fleet of five floats will do the rounds of the city, with mayor Subrata Mukherjee flagging off the vehicles from Victoria Memorial. Part of a daylong campaign, organised jointly by the east zone wing of the International Association of Human Values and the Art of Living, the trucks will play audio-visual presentations on responsible civic life, display eco-friendly products, and distribute awareness leaflets across the city. The youth wing of the Art of Living, jointly with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, will launch a programme to plant 5,000 trees. The programme will end with an award ceremony in the presence of Governor Viren J. Shah.

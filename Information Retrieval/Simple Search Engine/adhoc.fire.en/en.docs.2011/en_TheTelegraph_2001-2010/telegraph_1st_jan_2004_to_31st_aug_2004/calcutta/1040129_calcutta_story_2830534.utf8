 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Howrah bridge safety holds up new terminal
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The proposed passenger terminal at Majherhat, to ease the load on Howrah station, has rammed into a safety speedbreaker. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has voiced concern over increasing the number of platforms at Howrah to cope with the additional trains till the terminal is ready. 																								The CMDA authorities have said that Rabindra Setu (Howrah bridge), the link between the city and the station, is already overburdened with vehicles and more pressure on it, that will follow if the number of platforms is raised, will be a safety risk. 																								More platforms at Howrah station will mean more vehicles on Rabindra Setu, a CMDA official reasoned on Wednesday. Any increase in the number of vehicles will mean compromising on the security of the bridge. A decision had been taken by the state transport department and the CMDA not to increase pressure on Howrah bridge, he added.																								The Majherhat mega terminal proposal was forwarded by the South Eastern Railway (SER) to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in December last year. On December 31, at a high-level meeting between then SER general manager V.N. Garg and the chief minister, the proposal was discussed in detail. 																								The existing proposal of a combined passenger terminal at Shalimar and Puddapukur was not viable, as neither station had an adequate road network. As per the original plan, local trains would terminate at Shalimar, and long-distance trains at Puddapukur. So, the authorities offered an alternative passenger terminal site at Majherhat. According to initial plans, the line would be diverted near Santragachhi through a mega rail and road bridge over the Hooghly, connecting Santoshpur station, on the Sealdah-Budge Budge section, with Majherhat. 																								The project will take approximately 10 years to complete, but the number of trains will increase in the interim. So, the government was asked to lay four or five more platforms at Howrah, the SER official said. The new platforms could be constructed next to the goods shed of the new complex, the official said. 																								But for construction of platforms, a nod is required from the state government. Dispersal of buses and taxis will also be planned by the government, the official said. Besides, for laying new tracks, government land under Chandmani bridge, near Howrah station, will have to be acquired by the railways. We are awaiting the governments response, the official said.

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Chronicler for stages of the stage 
				 	 Sandhya Roy 																								For those wanting to dig into the treasures of Bengali theatre, a guide like Sandhya Roy is hard to come by. Her modest Golf Green flat is a goldmine of rare papers, photographs and audiotapes on theatre spanning five decades in Bengal, collected and collated through years of diligent research. 																								From the stacks, she would probably fish out Tripti Mitras last recorded interview, or some faded freeze frames of Utpal Dutt caught in a rare moment. Or, just the titbits one always wanted to know but never knew whom to ask.																								Roy intends to share all that knowledge with posterity, to spare future researchers the difficulties she had faced while searching documents and sifting through the matter. So, at age 46, she has taken up the arduous task of compiling a dictionary on the history of Bengali theatre. 																								Containing entries on around 4,500 productions (commercial and group) from 1948 to 2000, the natyakosh will chronologically dwell on the history, cast, backstage hands, costume, light, sound, date and venue of debut performances. Roy is busy putting finishing touches to the book to be published by Sahitya Samsad.																								Researching the rich heritage of our theatre has become a passion for me, says the one-time actress who was propelled to the stage by theatre stalwart Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay. He had spotted me doing a bit role on stage in Habra, where I hail from. I landed the lead in his Paap Punya, an adaptation of a Leo Tolstoy work, and shifted base to Calcutta much against my parents wishes.																								Paap Punya went on to become a milestone  with 33 shows in 31 days  marking out Roy as a talented actress. But as my acting career didnt quite take off, I branched out to researching the subject closest to my heart, says Roy, now armed with a PhD. The thesis took me 10 long years to wrap up as the matter lay scattered and there seemed no end to collecting it.																								It was then that Roy started interviewing the likes of Shambhu Mitra and Tripti Mitra. I would also visit theatre groups across Bengal and collect leaflets, folders and souvenirs. I still keep on doing this.																								The curious strain has yielded volumes of documents which Roy wants to preserve in an archive. Under the aegis of the information and cultural wing of the state government, she has put up some of the items at several exhibitions. Chief minister Budhadeb Bhattacharjee has shown a keen interest in my collection. I have sought financial aid from the government to help preserve these documents, reveals Roy.

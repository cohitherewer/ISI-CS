The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Cat-and-mouse with sports channels
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Beckham training for Euro 2004: Will he be on beam?																								A Beckham bender or a Zidane sole-drag could set Luz in Lisbon on fire. But over 3.5 lakh households across the city and the suburbs may miss out on the magic moments of Euro 2004  which kicks off on Saturday night  in the cable conundrum.																								Sports channels ESPN and Star Sports, beaming the second biggest soccer tourney after the World Cup, went off-air in homes under multi-system operator (MSO) Manthan, ranging from Golf Green to Baguiati, Ballygunge to Howrah, Mahestala to Midnapore on Friday.																								The whiff of a crisis in football-crazy Calcutta prompted police to step into the action. Representatives of the four MSOs  RPG Netcom, SitiCable, Manthan and CableComm  were summoned to Lalbazar in the evening and asked to ensure that there was no disruption in the soccer beam.																								They should sort things out mutually and ensure all viewers get to see the matches, Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (I), detective department, told Metro after the meeting.																								Trouble began when ESPN Star Sports (ESS) ran a scroll in the morning, informing Manthan viewers that the two channels were liable to go off-air any time due to the outstandings that Manthan owed the broadcaster. Manthan officials promptly blocked the channels. For the rest of the day, the cat-and-mouse game continued, with the sports twins going off-air and returning for brief durations. ESS finally switched off the channels in the evening.																								Weve spent 30 per cent of our Euro promotion budget on Calcutta and would certainly not want a single viewer to miss any match, said an ESS spokesperson. Though both Manthan and ESS refused to divulge the outstanding figure, according to sources, the MSO owes the broadcaster around Rs 50 lakh in dues over the past three months. Manthan, however, claims the problem is regarding revamp and not outstandings.																								We have paid in full till May, said Gurmit Singh, a director of Manthan. The dispute is regarding an increase in subscriber base that ESS had demanded in December 2003 that our operators did not accept, he added.																								That sports is the trump card to extract cable dues was proved last weekend when Ten Sports, then beaming the French Open finals and the World Cup football qualifiers involving city favourites Brazil, was blacked out on Manthan.																								The MSO also came under pressure from broadcasters STAR and Sony on Friday, which demanded dues of around Rs 45 lakh and Rs 42 lakh, respectively, from the network.

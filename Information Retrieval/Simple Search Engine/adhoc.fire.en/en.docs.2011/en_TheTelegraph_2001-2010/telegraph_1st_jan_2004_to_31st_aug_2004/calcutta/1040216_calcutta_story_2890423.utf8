The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Come Calcutta, live London
 															- Citys first service apartment block set to rise on Bypass SUBHRO SAHA				 	 The kitchen in a Fraser suite at Kensington, London. The serviced residences chain, in collaboration with Pragati, will be bringing around a hundred such apartments to the city																								Features: Fully-furnished apartments with separate living, dining and bedroom areas. Gourmet kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, rice-cooker, dishwasher. Washing machine, personal safe, Internet-ready PC, satellite TV...																								Amenities: Laundry, baby-sitting, medical assistance referrals, theatre and restaurant bookings, rent-a-car, airline ticketing, health spa and swimming pool, business centre																								Comfort: Five-star, with premium add-ons.																								Cost: 65 per cent of five-star rates.																								People coming into Calcutta to set up temporary base (read: IT professionals, consular diplomats, insurance and foreign bank staff, medical tourists) can look forward to a new cheaper and more personalised accommodation alternative.																								The citys first block of service apartments  in London, Manila, Seoul and Singapore style  is coming up on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, beside Ruby General Hospital.																								Pragati Growth and Development Ltd, a city-based innovative infrastructure solution provider group formed last year, is bringing to town a concept popular in Europe and Southeast Asia, but introduced only in Mumbai among Indian cities.																								The 18-month project on the 125,000-sq-ft development is set to begin by the middle of this year, according to Pragati vice chairman Partha Ghosh. The facilitator has entered into a strategic business alliance with Singapore-based Fraser Serviced Residencies Pte Ltd, an international serviced residence chain, for the Rs 45-crore project.																								We are looking at 85-100 service apartments of various sizes on the 85,000-sq-ft floor space earmarked for the units, with Fraser deciding on the eventual product-mix. The remaining 40,000 sq ft of developed area, taking up the cylindrical base of the structure, will house a mall, says Ghosh.																								The mall area will include a departmental store, food court with coffee shop, branded retail and an evening bank branch, according to the project developers who bought the 1.2-acre plot from Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.																								Anyone with a staying tenure of two weeks or more can move into the service apartments.																								With so many overseas and outstation professionals moving into the city and a steady flow of medical tourists from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, there is a well-defined need for such service apartments, which offer many advantages over star hotels, observes Pragati managing director Raj Shekhar Agrawal.																								While Fraser will provide its internationally standardised design norm and be responsible for operation and management, the project will be implemented on the ground by another Singapore agency, SembCorp Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd. The unit is a wing of SembCorp Industries Limited, a leading infrastructure company involved in the renewal of Curzon Park with Pragati.																								The catalyst group, which has brought in the Singapore duo SembCorp and Surbana (a leading consultant in city planning and township development) for the Curzon Park project of the public works department, has also pitched strongly for the West Howrah township. We will provide total package solutions including funding for proper MIG and LIG housing on a mass scale, promises Ghosh.

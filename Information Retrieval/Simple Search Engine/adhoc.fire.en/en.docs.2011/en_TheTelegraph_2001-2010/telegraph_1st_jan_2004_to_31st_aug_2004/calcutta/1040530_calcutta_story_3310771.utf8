The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, May 30, 2004 Life - Party Hopping Single in the city Sehnaz Treasurywalla. Picture by Rashbehari DasThe MTV Fling Singles Night was the perfect setting for party hoppers to bid goodbye to their single status. It was a wild night with all the ingredients of a footloose Friday fiesta, with the lofty objective of spicing up the evening and lives of those single and ready to mingle. And with the baby-faced VJ Sehnaz Treasurywalla as anchor, the nite was the talk of town the whole weekend.															The fun began with five single men and women being picked from the crowd at random. In a pleasant role reversal, the women, for once, were asked to have a go at the men. What is the colour of your underwear? giggled the girls, clearly enjoying the upper hand, with the audience bursting into peals of laughter. The men were not intimidated, giving all the right answers.																					The women were luckier when it was their turn to face the question-firing squad. Which part of a guys body would you want to smell? gave them the opportunity to keep answers safe: neck, chest, hands, hair																					By this time, Sehnaz, dressed in an orange flowing skirt and a black sleeveless top, found that the goings-on at the nightclub were turning out to be a wee bit hotter than herself. She screamed: I love Calcutta, getting the attention of a few guys and shaking a few hands. But most were still more caught up with the fate of the five waiting to be ragged.																					You can kiss them wherever you like, the anchor instructed the girls, the excitement-meter shooting through the roof. But Calcutta girls stuck to the expected conservative approach  aiming for the cheek, hand and (a little more adventurous) neck.																					The game over, it was time for some real fun. Though impossible to keep a tab, it would not be surprising if the singles count in Calcutta comes creeping down post the Friday-night fun. Cricketers Saba Karim and Rajiv Seth with actor Jishu Sengupta 												Red hot night of revelry																					The asli masti party happened at Dublin on Friday night. The first anniversary bash of Red FM was a real blast. Name a city celeb, and he or she was likely to have been there.																					So eager were the guests to be part of what turned out to be a red hot night, that the do took off by 7.30 pm (a tad early by city standards).																					Industrialist Harsh Neotia came in by 8 pm as did actor June Maliah, who had another event to anchor later in the night. But she couldnt miss being part of a happy occasion, even if it is only for 10 minutes, she cooed.																					Actor Arjun Chakraborty, now busy shooting for Shri Bimal Mitras Sahib Biwi Gulam, found time to relax with wife Nilanjana, happily hitting the floor and working the room together with elan. Magician P.C. Sorcar and family tried to weave some magic into the evening. The two younger Sorcar daughters, Moubani and Mumtaz, gave the dance floor a miss though they are usually the first to shake a leg, and with some style.																					Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh made up for the celeb quotient on the floor, matching steps with adman Anurag Hira and his wife Bhavna. Golfer Indrajit Bhalotia and wife Ruby preferred a quiet time in a corner while cricketers Saba and Ravi hogged the limelight.																					It was actor Jishu Sengupta who drew out the autograph hunters. Are you Jishu? Im a big fan of yours, a young girl squealed, darting forward, leaving a distressed boyfriend alone on the dance floor.												Cocktail boysThree flair bartenders from London  Miki, Perry and Ugo  are lighting up the bar at Tantra, filling glasses with fantastic cocktails, setting bottles ablaze. On Friday night, the flames and the twirling bottles were dazzling enough to prompt bar-side regulars to move their chairs back a bit. On the first day of their one-week stint here they fell in love with the nightlife. The guests are eager to experience new things and are receptive and friendly, smiled the trio.												Party Pooper																					The Dylan dream had one fan dazed at Someplace Else last weekend, when one man mistook a tribute night for live action from the guru himself. Bobbys in town, he gushed. Sure man, check him out, egged on another.

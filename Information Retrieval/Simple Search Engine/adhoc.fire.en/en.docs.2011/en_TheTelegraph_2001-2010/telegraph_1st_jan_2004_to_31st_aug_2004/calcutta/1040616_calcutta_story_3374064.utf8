 Wednesday, June 16, 2004  Golden paletteSMITA ROY CHOWDHURY Bikram Ghosh unveils a lightweight Tanishq range. Picture by Rashbehari Das												A variety of shades intermingling with the glow of gold has been the main theme at jewellery exhibitions round the world this year. 																					In keeping with the trend, Tanishq launched a new collection of colourful gold jewellery, pitched as the lightweight colour collection, in Calcutta on Tuesday. 																					The collection boasts 500 design variations across the range of neckpieces, earrings and bracelets. The designs are essentially traditional but stylised, says designer Anjali Lal from the Tanishq studio. 																					Indeed, the light-weight pieces help a working woman match her jewels with her outfits as she would match her hand bags. But the essentially Indian look of the collection is best paired with Indian ensembles like saris and salwar kameezes. 																					No matter how independent and modern a woman becomes in her outlook, deep within she still harbours Indian values and likes to dress Indian for those special occasions, feels Harish Bhat, COO, Tanishq. 																					The pieces, all in 22 karat gold weigh 10 to 70 grams. The designs look heavy because of the spacing and the use of colours, but are actually very light, stresses Lal. 																					The user-friendliness extends to pricing as well with a 10 gram neckpiece available for Rs 10,000. Affordability is one of the key points of this collection, points out Bhat. Jewellery, however, is not to be taken lightly according to Bhat. Since the jewellery is in 22 karat gold, it is not just an accessory, but also an investment, he stresses. 																					The jewellery features three basic colours of red, blue and green. Beads, synthetic and semi-precious stones and enamel work add some more shades.

Thus when the skies opened up on Saturday night the artificial sprinklers put up for the party at Hotel Hindusthan International were deemed quite unnecessary. The party, however, was an instant hit. 																					The rain dance and fashion show presented by Hints and Allegations got off to a late start, but spirits refused to be dampened by the two-hour delay. 																					The show comprised five sequences featuring designs by Tejas Gandhi, Leather World and Mams Footwear. 																					It started with a line of clubwear shoes from Mams and moved on to Leather Worlds range of structured western eveningwear. 																					This was followed by Tejas Gandhis collection of daywear in linen. 																					The show-stealer of the evening, however, was Tejas beachwear collection  bikini tops with sarongs in vibrant hues, quite in sync with the mood of the evening.																					e the crowd sat through the show patiently, things really perked up with the rain dance. 																					arge throng of party-goers, comprising mostly of corporates and regular disc-hoppers, rocked to the beats of DJ Nasha from Mumbai, with the rains synchronising the rhythmic gyrations. 																					The fun fervour reached a fever pitch in the end with the swimming pool doubling up as the dance floor with more people inside the pool than outside.

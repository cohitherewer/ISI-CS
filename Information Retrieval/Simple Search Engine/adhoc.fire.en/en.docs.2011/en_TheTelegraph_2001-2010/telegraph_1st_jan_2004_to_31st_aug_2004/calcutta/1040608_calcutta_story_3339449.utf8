 															- Heritage urgently in need of prop  SOUMITRA DAS				 	 The 250-year-old Shiva temple in Kenderdine Lane suddenly stands exposed. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								The temple with nine pinnacles towering above two others with five pinnacles each on a rectangular plot in Kenderdine Lane, next to Yogayog Bhavan, on Chittaranjan Avenue, stands revealed in its full glory, perhaps after a century or even more. 																								But this is not because either the state government or the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has suddenly become very concerned about heritage conservation, but entirely because of their callous indifference.																								This red navaratna (nine jewels) Shiva temple between two pancharatnas (five jewels), over 200 years old and the most ancient in Calcutta, is hemmed in by buildings on all sides save its entrance. Till about a month ago, it was wedged between two houses, one of them pretty old itself, on its left. That was when a promoter started demolishing it, leaving the temple exposed, for both structures were conjoined.																								In a letter dated May 27, Debabrata Mukherjee, sevait of the temple, drew the CMC commissioners attention to the demolition of building No 19, adjacent to the temple (premises No 18/1, Kenderdine Lane), which was declared a heritage structure by the CMC in a notice dated August 30, 2001. Mukherjee wrote that the rear of the temple (the northern side) was earlier concealed behind the wall of No 19. 																								This side of the building had not been repaired for the past 100 years or so, as there was no gap between No 19 and No 18/1. The demolition work has damaged the temple. One arch on the upper reaches is scarred. What is worse, the exposed temple wall is without plaster and the promoter has piled huge chunks of debris against this side. The building department of the CMC has, at last, been informed about the demolition and its repercussions. At the CMC, one department is never aware of what is happening in another. Or else how was the demolition sanctioned when that could endanger this heritage structure?																								Inside the rectangular plot are the three temples, within which are three lingams, each five feet high  Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram. A plaque on the temple wall reads: In 1785, this Navaratna temple of Moheswaram has been founded by Dewan Trilok Pakrasy the ancestor of the present Sevait Satish Mukhopadhyay BL of 61 Wellington Street, Calcutta, who has repaired the temple in 1940.																								Wellington Street is Nirmal Chunder Street now, where Debabrata Mukherjee lives. He is one of the dewans descendants. The temple has no debuttar property and family members take pride in maintaining it. Before it was demolished, No 19, Kenderdine Lane had a plaque with an inscription in Bengali, which in translation meant that Kusumkumari Dasi is the sevait of Radhakrishna. 																								Mukherjee says there should be a gap large enough to allow repairs between the temple and the new building at No 19. According to the recommendation of the heritage conservation committee of the CMC, set up in 1996, there should be a gap of 200 m between any new building and a Grade A heritage structure. Such a heritage structure should be clearly visible, and development around it should be kept under control. But heritage structures in Calcutta are yet to be graded.																								G.M. Kapoor, convener, West Bengal and Calcutta chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, says: We must make all effort to keep the temple intact. I am sure people in that area would help.																								Biswadeep Sen, who has restored the Jagannath and Lingaraj temples in Orissa and currently repairing Metropolitan Building and Queens Mansion, says the CMC should allow further demolition only after making sure that the temple remains stable.

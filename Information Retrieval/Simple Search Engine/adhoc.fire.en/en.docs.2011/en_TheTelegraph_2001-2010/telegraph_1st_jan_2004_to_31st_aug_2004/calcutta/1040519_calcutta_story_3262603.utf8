 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 An evening with Odissi
																								Odissi as a dance form has come to acquire its contemporary structure after having passed through numerous aesthetic changes. It was originally known as Mahari Nritya and was performed as a devotional dance before Lord Jagannath and was primarily reserved as a presentation at temples by special dancers. It was under the artistic patronage of Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra that Mahari Nritya was introduced to the world as Odissi. Utkalika Pahadsingh, a protege of the Guru himself, is in the city with her troupe to enthrall dance lovers with her rendition of this age old dance form. Some of the items that she will present to brighten up the evening include Mangalacharan, Geetagovindam, Dashavatar and Dheere Sameere Yamuna Teere.																								Event: An evening of Odissi dance featuring Utkalika Pahadsingh and her troupe																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Jishu and Nelanjana: Winter wedding bells																								Ami tomar meyer haat chai (I seek your daughters hand), pleaded Jishu Sengupta, with yesteryear Tollywood actress Anjana Bhowmick, at her Sinthee home on Sunday night. 																								Besh to, nao na (Fine, take it), pat came the green signal from mom, while daughter Nelanjana was left stunned by the very filmi-style marriage proposal.																								The reel-life pair has decided to tie the knot by the year-end, giving Tollywood its first twin-star wedding of the millennium. The engagement will be a low-key, private affair on March 15.																								I was sure of her (Nelanjana) and so took the plunge, said Jishu on Monday, recounting how he met his sweetheart a year-and-a-half ago on the sets of telefilm Basundhara. 																								They have been the best of buddies since  sharing screen space in a string of telefilms or hanging out at The Atrium and Someplace Else or having a quiet dinner at Marco Polo.																								If a passion for cricket, Pink Floyd and old English films cemented their friendship, love blossomed when the two were on a stage-show tour in the US and UK last autumn.

 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Postmen drafted for error-free voters list
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Next time the postman rings your doorbell, he may not have come just to deliver a letter. 																								Instead, he may ask the resident her/his age, the number of voters in the house, how long s/he has stayed there, whether s/he is moving out of the present address permanently, if a voter has recently died in the house, if theres a new voter in the house this time and so on. 																								The next time the electoral rolls are revised (between September 15 and October 15), about 12,000 postmen from across the state are expected to be drafted for the verification process. 																								The Election Commission is now discussing with postal department officials in New Delhi the guidelines for the job. Officials will also check whether or not the additional responsibility will hamper the routine work of postmen, said state chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee. 																								We often receive complaints of fake voters and minors names being included on the list. Door-to-door verification is essential to investigate the allegations, and who could be more eligible for the job than our postmen? They are already familiar with the postal addresses and the residents in their own areas of work, explained Banerjee. 																								Preliminary discussions have already been held with Election Commission officials, and Banerjee is expecting a detailed guideline on the job from the commissions New Delhi office in the next 10 to 15 days. 																								A draft electoral roll will be published on September 15. From this date to October 15, people can make any change on the list  addition or deletion of names, change of address, and so on. The final list will be published in January 2005. 																								To make it easier for voters, post offices will also be made more accessible. Each post office  there are 143 pin codes for Calcutta and parts of North and South 24 Parganas  will contain names of voters under its jurisdiction. 																								The total number of postal delivery offices in the state is approximately 8,000. 																								A voter can drop in at his local post office to check if his name is on the electoral roll. And if he doesnt find his name there, he can immediately apply, asking for its inclusion. 																								This scheme applies to all kinds of changes that a voter may want  like exclusion of the name of a family member in case of a persons death, change of postal address and inclusion of a new voter. 																								At the same time, Electoral Registration Office staff will continue to take complaints as they have been doing.

 SUBHRO SAHA LOUNGE LUXURY: A Park Street restaurant is targeting corporate meetings, birthday and anniversary bashes and any small get-together with a new lounge on its first floor. Picture by Rashbehari Das 																								The Mixed Grill Sizzler  cooked with ham, bacon, chicken liver and chicken patty, with a portion of roast chicken thrown in and served with a piece of garlic toast  remains the same, as do the Chicken Tetrazini and the Baked Fish in White Sauce with Cheese.																								Nothing much had changed at this traditional eating house at 33 Park Street since it first stoked its wok in 1973. Not till this week. And on Wednesday, when Oasis throws open The Lounge 33 on its first floor  the first of its kind in the citys original F amp;B hub  it could well act as the Pied Piper of Park Street.																								Park Street has always been a trend-setter and we wanted to do something out of the box, which would give our clientele more reasons to come back, says Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis. The plush arena with frosted-glass faade, tapestried ceiling, diffused lighting and theme music provides neatly upholstered lounge seating for 35-40 people.																								At a time when Park Street has lost almost 50 per cent of its clientele, mostly to new-age restaurants further south, The Lounge 33 is a most significant value-add and could act as a catalyst for the revival of the once-capital corridor, feels Nitin Kohli of Shenaz. Kohli, who has recently renovated his restaurant, has recorded an instant 15 per cent jump in business.																								Lack of enterprise, a palpable inertia towards change, an ageing and inflexible labour force, hackneyed cuisine and musty, uninspiring interiors have combined to squeeze the restaurant trade in general on Park Street. While there have been exceptions like Bar-B-Q, Peter Cat, Mocambo and Kwality, which have continued to do well through constant upgrading, overall business has slumped around 20 per cent over the past three-four years.																								Today, you cant take the customer for granted and continue to live in the past, because there are so many options outside Park Street. Its also not right to always find excuses like parking for not doing well. The initiative to do something different to bring the crowds back has to come from within the fraternity, stresses Kohli.																								Nitin Kothari of Peter Cat/ Mocambo agrees. The Lounge 33 is a new concept that should inspire others on Park Street to do some value addition of their own. T.K. Sengupta, leader of Oasis Citu-affiliated labour union, too, has welcomed the project.																								Daryananis wife Reena, who has done the lounges dcor, has used a profusion of brown, black and yellow, with a bit of steel thrown in. Ive also given it a fabric-and-earth feel, with the wooden flooring and the artefacts evoking the ambience of an oasis, she says. 																								Targeting corporate meetings, birthday and anniversary bashes and any cosy get-together, The Lounge 33 has a special menu with items like Prawns in Thousand Island Dressing, Pan Pasta and Brownies with Ice-cream.																								Lounging is in these days and people seek exclusivity. If they get that on Park Street, theyll keep coming back. Its important to change with the times and give patrons what they want, sums up Rajeev Kothari of Bar-B-Q, which has added Flavours of China and One Step Up to its arsenal.

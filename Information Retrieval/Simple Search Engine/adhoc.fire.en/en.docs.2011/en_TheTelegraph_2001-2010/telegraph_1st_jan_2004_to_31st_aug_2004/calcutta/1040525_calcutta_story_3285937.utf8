The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Subrata perceives no threat
 															- Congress-backed no-trust move by CPM stillborn under mandarin glare A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee: Daring rivals to foment dissent in the house. A Telegraph picture																								The Trinamul Congress-BJP board in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is stable and will complete its term, asserted mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Monday.																								Ruling out any threat to the board from either the CPM or the Congress, he declared: However, if the Left Front government attempts to topple the elected board, it is welcome to do so.																								The CPM lobby in the CMC, meanwhile, has abandoned its plan to table a no-confidence motion on Wednesday against mayor Mukherjee. The shift in plan follows a glare from Alimuddin Street, still flush with its coup in the recent Lok Sabha election.																								We dont want to make a martyr out of Subrata Mukherjee. The civic poll is due in May 2005, anyway, Alimuddin Street mandarins are reported to have told the CPM leaders in the CMC.																								So, despite pressure from the Pradesh Congress, the CPM has decided not to disturb the Trinamul-led board, claimed Congress leader of the Opposition in the civic body Sailen Dasgupta. 																								However, he admitted that immediately after the Lok Sabha results, seven Congress councillors who had defected to the Trinamul sought to return to the Congress fold.																								At present, the Left Front is a minority in the CMC. Of the 141 seats, it holds only 61. The Congress had 13 seats, but the Trinamul weaned away seven.																								In the civic house, resentment is reportedly simmering among a majority of Trinamul councillors against mayor Mukherjees centralised policy of administration. 																								While borough chairmen have started voicing strident demands for ward-wise allocation of borough development funds, some CPM councillors have taken a covert move to unite all the councillors of north Calcutta to demand development schemes for the northern part of the city.																								The mayor is expected to allow more financial freedom to the boroughs in this years budget, since most of the councillors have pointed out to him that without financial freedom, it would not be possible for them to nurse their respective wards on the eve of the civic election.																								The civic councillors are demanding financial freedom though 15 borough offices had failed to utilise a fund totalling Rs 3.75 crore, allotted to them to carry out borough-level development, the mayor pointed out.																								Each borough office was given a fund of Rs 25 lakh and on condition that it would be utilised for project work that would benefit at least three wards under the borough.

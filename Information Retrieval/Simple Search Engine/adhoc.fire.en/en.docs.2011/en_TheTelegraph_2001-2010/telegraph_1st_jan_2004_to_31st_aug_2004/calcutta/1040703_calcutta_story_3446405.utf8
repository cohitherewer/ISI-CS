 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Tax sop plea for childs play
 															- SOFT OPTION BEFORE TOUGH ACTION  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee inspects the display at Toy Biz 2004, at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee promised representatives of the toy industry on Friday that he would try his best to ease the tax burden on the industry, reeling under the pressure of imports from China. 																								Bhattacharjee was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of Toy Biz 2004, an exhibition-cum- buyer-seller meet, organised by the Toy Association of India. 																								We will take up the matter and give it serious thought, said Bhattacharjee, to the demand for a cut in taxes on electronic toys from Vishnu Swarup Agarwal, president of the association. 																								As the audience broke into applause at Bhattacharjees assurance of a closer look at this, the chief minister hastened to add: Dont clap. I have only said that I will try.																								The chief minister went on to set a target before the industry representatives, from manufacturers to buyers and distributors to raw material suppliers. 																								Our share of the international trade in toys is only Rs 130 crore and we will have to improve our export performance, said Bhattacharjee. 																								The chief minister also donned the role of a marketeer as he tried to hardsell the Toy Park, on the eastern fringes of the city. A number of units have shifted to the park and we want you to visit the place and check out the facilities. The construction for the second phase will start shortly, mentioned Bhattacharjee, who also visited the stalls. 																								From stuffed toys to mind games and school bags to various gift items, the 55-odd exhibitors have put together an assortment of a childs dream playhouse. 																								But on Friday the mood at Netaji Indoor Stadium, the venue of the exhibition, was far from fun-filled, as a pack of overzealous security personnel around Bhattacharjee spoilt the show. 																								What started as a mild altercation between the media and the security personnel during the chief ministers conducted tour of the exhibition arena turned into a full-fledged physical assault of reporters and camera crew once Bhattacharjees convoy left the stadium complex. 																								Some officials from the Special Branch beat up cameramen, with some women journalists also not being spared. Later, the reporters filed a complaint with the Maidan police station, seeking immediate action against the high-handed officials.																								Speaking to representatives from the Press Photographers Association in the evening, Bhattacharjee blamed the television camera crew for the episode and also sought a report from the association by Saturday. 																								Bhattacharjee said he had asked the police commissioner for a report, too. Mediapersons forced their way into the stall I was in. They smashed the glass panels and a few shards hit my feet. There was much pushing and shoving by the cameramen, explained Bhattacharjee.

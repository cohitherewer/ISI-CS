 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Health and hi-tech drill for the cops
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Additional director-general of police Ajay Prasad at the computer networking programme for the state police on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta																								It was back to class for cops on Wednesday. 																								While the morning found traffic personnel of Calcutta Police attending a workshop on basic trauma support, for the state avatar it was a detailed presentation on the new and improved computer networking of its police stations and courts in the afternoon.																								Teaching Calcutta Police the invaluable lesson on trauma management was Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, which had approached the police for conducting the workshop. 																								We were thinking about doing something on trauma management, but its to Apollos credit that they approached us first, said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), who was present at the inauguration of the workshop. The first batch comprised only 25 men, but Pandey assured others would follow soon. 																								The number of traffic accident-related deaths is much higher in India, compared with most developed countries. A lot of deaths occur while taking the patient to hospital, and some as soon as they reach there. To change this situation, training through such workshops is essential, felt Pandey. 																								For Apollo, it was a novel way of marking World Health Day. Doing the basic things right in case of an accident  such as keeping the body straight, stopping the bleeding and airway management  would comprise the crash course for the cops.																								These things were touched upon briefly during our police training, said a participant. Also, during the traffic safety weeks, we teach the very same things to the children who take part. But in this workshop, the topics are being dealt with in detail, he added.																								For West Bengal Police, the lessons were more hi-tech. With a little help from Webel, the state governments nodal IT agency, a seemingly impossible task of networking 411 police stations and 52 police courts, including 45 thanas of Calcutta Police, has been managed.																								Apart from providing 2GB optical fibre connectivity, Webel has helped develop software for tracking criminals, for managing personnel, inventory and fleet of West Bengal Police. Using a central database, case details, criminal records and other important data can be accessed by each of the police stations.																								The staff at the police stations had to undergo a training programme, said Ajay Prasad, additional director-general of police. Webel also helped us by developing police-friendly software, he added. Funding for the project, estimated at Rs 4 crore over the past three years, was done by the state government.

Keep it short and sweet (From top) Schooler Bagta Baddo Bhari, Aami and Winter Light 				 																																																											Sixty-three films, four days. The numbers dont quite match in the conventional sense of the term but the combination is possible if the fare is short and sweet. The First Calcutta Short Film Festival is being screened at Nandan in association with Chitrabani from August 17 to 20.				 																																																											Featuring eminent names in short-film making along with budding film-makers, the meet is primarily meant to provide the much-needed platform to showcase their work and dispel myths about short films. Contrary to popular belief, short films are not always academic in nature. We want to show that it is possible to tell interesting stories in a very short period of time. You dont necessarily have to go on for three hours to make a point, said Father P.J. Joseph, director, Chitrabani.				 																																																											A documentary on wooden dolls of Burdwan by Ratan Khanna, the Gujarat genocide and militarisation of the Northeast by Soumitra Dastidar, fictional work like suicide being a temporary solution to a permanent problem by Amit Trivedi, one on national integration, a degree film by the students of St Xaviers, a surreal saga on dreamscapes by Avishek Gupta, an experimental work that tackles moral and artistic issues in the life of a girl by Vasudha Joshi, and a docu-feature on a love story contrasted by a communal riot in the backdrop by Arnap Roy showcase some of the varied themes being explored.				 																																																											There are a lot of short film-makers in the country who are doing really good work but rarely get an opportunity to showcase their work. We got an overwhelming response and it was quite a tough job to select 63 films, said Father Joseph.				 																																																											Two films from London are also being screened at the festival. Apart from English, Hindi and Bengali, there are films in Tamil and Marathi as well, shot in DVD, VHS, 16 mm and 35 mm format.				 																																																											Nitindra Gangopadhyay, deputy director, Nandan, is certain of the festivals success and hopes to make it an annual feature. Apart from showcasing quality and alternative work, such meets also help like-minded people get together and exchange ideas and experiences, he said.				 																																																											I would consider the festival successful if it succeeds in making audiences favourably disposed to documentaries, which can be as interesting as fiction, if not more.There will be three shows daily at Nandan II during the festival at 2 pm, 4 pm and 6 pm. Free passes are available on first-come-first-served basis at Chitrabani, Caf Coffee Day (Park Street) and Regional Institute of Film and Television. Daily passes will also be available at Nandan an hour prior to the shows.Experiments with stage truth				 																																																											When the curtains went up on the event for the first time in 2002, it was essentially an effort to connect with home-seekers on a cultural plane and indulge in one of Calcuttas pet passions. Now, as the Greenwood Park Theatre Festival enters its third year, the focus has widened to embrace troupes from the districts as well.				 																																																											We are inviting theatre groups from the districts to perform at the festival as a mark of inclusiveness and recognition of the depth of talent in Bengal. There wont be any barriers on form, and the troupes can bring in any kind of production, from one-act plays to street theatre to a full-fledged narrative or any other experimental genre, says Rahul Todi, managing director, Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd.				 																																																											The housing company, a joint venture initiative of the West Bengal Housing Board and the Shrachi Group, hosts the annual theatre festival. Starting last year, there are two awards associated with the Greenwood Park Theatre Festival  the Utpal Dutta Samman (lifetime achievement award) and the Tripti Mitra Samman (best production award).				 																																																											The 2004 edition of the theatre festival will be held in two stages and Bengal Shrachi plans to institute the District Award this time. The first phase, to be held at the St Xaviers auditorium, will have groups from six to seven districts performing over two-three days in a competition. A jury comprising eminent members from various fields of arts and culture will pick the best two productions, to be enacted again during the final phase scheduled for early October.				 																																																											We will probably have it at GD Birla Sabhagar like last year, says Todi. While the final line-up of productions to be staged during the second phase is yet to be finalised, it has been decided to have two short plays in the concluding part of the festival. Picture by Pabitra Das Todi, who feels it has been a great learning experience to hold the festival over the past two years, is confident in 2005 the event can be shifted to the groups own community theatre centre being built in its Greenwood Park housing project in Rajarhat. Once we are settled there and the brand equity of the festival develops, we may consider expanding the format and taking it national. Long-distance reign: Rituparna rules in Tricolour wave Holding ones fort from far-off US is no mean feat, but Tollywoods reigning queen is doing fine. With three films running in the citys cinemas, Rituparna Sengupta gets into the patriotic mood on I-Day eve. I am an Indian at heart, always, though I am always on the move, says she, shuttling from Singapore to Washington, Calcutta to Bangalore with hubby Sanjay.

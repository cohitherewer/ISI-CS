The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 When Calcutta is the muse
Blind Bagger, oil on canvas																								Kolikata Sthanchitra is the first solo exhibition of the paintings of Amitava Malakar, a largely self taught artist. It is an artistic expression of his sympathetic perception of society and its impact on its citizens. Through his paintings on exhibition, Malakar has tried to evoke the sensibilities of a people that has had, since time immemorial, to sacrifice its originality in thought and action. The so-called vanguards of society have for long set a paradigm for the coexistence of societal beings. It is a rigid parameter that requires a numbing of the inner fire that burns in human hearts. It is an unyielding structure that binds the free spirit and stultifies growth, be it spiritual, psychological or aesthetic. Kolikata Sthanchitra celebrates some of those lost faces, cultures, minds, critiques, women and men, actors and moments, not in idle nostalgia but as active springs of motivation for creative insurrection.																								Event: Paintings on Calcutta by Amitava Malakar																								When: Till March 7; 11 am - 8 pm																								Where: Akar Prakar, P-238 Hindustan Park

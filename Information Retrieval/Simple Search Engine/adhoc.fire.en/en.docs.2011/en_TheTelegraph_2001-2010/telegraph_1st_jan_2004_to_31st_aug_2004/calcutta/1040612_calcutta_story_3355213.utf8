 Saturday, June 12, 2004  Charm with China A child at the porcelain exhibition on Friday. Picture by Rashbehari Das (Below) One of Chhutis outfits												For those wanting to add a touch of the Oriental to their drawing rooms, the Nirvana Pilgrim Society exhibition is a great opportunity. Its not everyday that one gets to see such wide variety of original Chinese objects d art under one roof in town. 																					The Orissa-based non-profit organisation engaged in promoting South-east Asian art and culture, is holding an exhibition of Chinese porcelain at Senbati in Gariahat. The month-long exhibition, called Nirvana China Porcelain Bazaar, was inaugurated on Friday afternoon.																					The exhibition is showcasing Chinese porcelain from Jingdezhen in South Chinas Jiangxi province, known as the porcelain capital of the world. The artisans of Jingdezhen have, apparently, produced some of the best pieces of China which have adorned the palaces of Chinese emperors over the centuries. The exhibition provides a glimpse of this tradition. 																					The fare on offer includes vases, paintings, crockery, statuettes, show-pieces, lanterns, Feng Shui items and other artefacts. There are more than 2,000 varieties on display, the price ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 2 lakh. 																					pture and pottery are two very related arts and it gives me great pleasure to see these excellent creations. What I am really liking is how the artisans have maintained their traditional designs and yet have combined the contemporary, said sculptor Uma Siddhant, while checking out the pieces on display.																					e the exhibition gives an opportunity to do some porcelain picking, a workshop conducted by artisans from China during the last week of the fair will provide a peek into the art of Chinese pottery. 																					Neeraj Padhi, secretary of the West Bengal chapter of the Society, informed that artisans from Jingdezhen will come to Calcutta during the last week of the exhibition and display their art. The workshop will be open to all.																					The exhibition is the first in a series of initiatives planned by the Society in its bid to build cultural bridges among south-east Asian countries by promoting pilgrim tourism (to mainly Buddhist tourist spots) and exchange of art and culture. 																					We have adopted two craft villages in Orissa where we are trying to revive traditional art forms, especially the ancient tradition of stone sculpting. Next, we want to develop craft villages in many small towns, said Padhi, adding that the Society had organised a similar exhibtion in Orissa a few months ago. 																					The next on the anvil is a similar exhibition in Calcutta with the art forms of Thailand. We will also promote Indian artisans in other countries. For that, we are planning an exhibition in Bangkok with Indian craftsmen, he added.																																														Fusion focus																					And while on the subject of exhibitions, Identity Gallery recently hosted a display of fashion apparels designed by Chhuti. The two-day show, which concluded on Friday, offered a selection of Indo-western and ethnic ensembles. 																					Lots of floral prints, hand-painted motifs and patchwork dominated the garments, along with Chhutis trademark vegetable dyes. The colours were bright as well as pastels and the fabrics used were khadi, cotton, crepe, georgette and silk. While there were some salwar kameezes, the major part of the collection comprised kurtas with trousers, stylised with scarves.																					so provided glimpses of Chhutis new summer line. This range includes Indo-westerns and salwar suits in georgette. Tie-and-dye and hand paint have been used extensively, and the motifs are floral as well as abstract. The highlight of the line, however, is the striking black, white and red combination. The new spread at the Waterside Caf. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Mixed pot																					Chinese, Thai, Lebanese, Continental and Indian  the new menu at Waterside Caf at Hyatt Regency is bound to appeal to the global traveller and the citys discerning foodie alike. The 24-hour caf serving European bistro-style cuisine and Indian specialities, stirred up at interactive show kitchens, has revamped its daily menu on popular demand.																					We call it menu sales engineering. Based on the likes and dislikes of the guests, we have retained old favourites and introduced new dishes. Seasonal preferences have also been kept in mind and thus most of the food is very light, says executive chef Deepak Bhatia.																					ong with chef Tanmoy Mazumdar, he has lined up new items like Tomato Cappuccino Soup and Clear Thai Soup with noodles and vegetables and chicken for non-vegetarians. Assorted Vegetable Salad with Peanut Dressing, Lebanese Falafel with mint and garlic yoghurt dressing (chickpea dumplings) and Vegetable Spring Rolls make for ideal starters in the sultry weather. 																					Vegetable Lasagna, Chicken Ravioli, Prawn Pizza, Grilled Jumbo Prawns, Murg Malai Kebab, Zafrani Paneer Tikka and Thai Chicken Curry feature in the main course along with steamed rice and breads.																					Weve introduced Asian food for the first time at the caf, owing to its popularity, adds Deepak. But the Bengali palate continues to be pampered like never before. The new menu features age-old favourites like Chingri Malai Curry that even Vajpayee freaked out on the last time he was in town, Aloo Posto and Kathi Rolls.																					In the new menu weve attempted to take care of all needs, be it light snacks with drinks, quick bites and, of course, meals, stresses Deepak. Saving the best for the last, the chef proudly serves some authentic Tiramisu and chilled Mango and Lychee Parfait for dessert.

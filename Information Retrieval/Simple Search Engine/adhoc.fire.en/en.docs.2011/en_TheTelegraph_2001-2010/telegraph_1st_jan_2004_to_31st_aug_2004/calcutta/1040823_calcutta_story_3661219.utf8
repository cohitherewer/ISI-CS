 																											- Poor results rattle organisers of schoolbus operators exam A STAFF REPORTER																								For the first time in recent history, around 230-odd schoolbus drivers and 200-plus helpers operating across the city were put to a test on Sunday. 																								They were handed over a question paper, in Bengali, on the fundamentals of driving and road safety. The objective test, with 10 questions, was to be completed in 25 minutes. The results were shocking.																								According to the organisers, the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners and Operators Association, only about 25 to 30 drivers and around 20-odd helpers managed to clear the test. The rest failed. 																								This was the first attempt to test the basics and the outcome is, indeed, disconcerting. The results point at the abysmal level of awareness and there is no denying that both drivers and their helps need intensive training, admitted Himadri Ganguly, general secretary of the organisation. 																								Some of those who took the test could not read Bengali. Some others were illiterate. Rattled, the organisers have decided to hold an awareness camp next week at Salt Lake.																								At a south Calcutta girls college, drivers learnt the ropes from traffic officers and interacted with them for the first time informally, keeping in mind the fact that novices become drivers after picking up a point or two from seniors. 																								Not many of us are aware that an accident can occur even after both the parties have abided by the rules. For instance, a driver can see up to a certain angle in a mirror and not everything. So, if another vehicle is approaching from the side, the driver may miss it while taking a turn, explained Probir Gangopadhayay, officer-in-charge of the Traffic Training School, while speaking to the participants. 																								Others clarified the meaning of different marks on roads  yellow, black and white. It was all in good humour.																								However, joint commissioner of police (traffic) Banibrata Basu was in right earnest when he announced that all operators will have to comply by the 10-point guideline issued by the Supreme Court within September 15 or face penal action. 																								The directive by the Supreme Court on schoolbus operators has already been enforced in a few other metros, and we want to implement it here at the earliest, joint commissioner Basu asserted. 																								From now on, schoolbus operators will have to follow a strict colour code with the name of the bus-owner and the school prominently displayed, and even carry fire extinguishers inside. 																								Besides, no bus operator will be allowed to carry more students than the exact seating capacity of a vehicle.

 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Helen HuntYou like everything around you to be in harmony. Dont be moody. Pump in more capital into business to avoid stagnation. Long-standing plans now have a better chance of materialising. Watch out for ailments of the ear, nose and throat. Emerald and turquoise are your lucky gems. Wear pink for good luck.  Kusum Bhandari

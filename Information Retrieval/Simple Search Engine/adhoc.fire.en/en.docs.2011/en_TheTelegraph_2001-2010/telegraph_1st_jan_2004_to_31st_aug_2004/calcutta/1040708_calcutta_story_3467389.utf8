 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Cell-call report belies wife claim
 PRONAB MANDAL 																								Four days after gynaecologist Sushil Pals mud-caked body was found near a canal at Sankrail, Howrah, sleuths on the case secured the first lead on Wednesday, when they got hold of the statement of calls received or made from his cellphone.																								Investigators said the list displaying incoming calls received by Pal confirmed that no call had been made from his Bright Street residence on the day of his murder, contradicting his wifes statement of having called him thrice. He had, though, received a number of calls from a landline in Serampore and the time of last incoming call was 3.30 pm, said an officer of Criminal Investigation Department (CID). 																								A group of CID sleuths visited Serampore Walsh Hospital, to which Pal was attached, and questioned doctors and staff. 																								Pal had left home on Friday around 8 am, according to his wife, for the hospital, while the investigators said he had not attended hospital at all. The next morning, his body was found lying in the Saraswati canal, 40 km from his residence.																								Wife Kanika claimed that she had called her husband thrice between 9 am and 2.30 pm. The last time I spoke to him, there were noises in the background. He said he was in the operating theatre, Kanika told both Serampore and Karaya police, while lodging a missing persons diary. 																								As soon as the post-mortem confirmed that Pals death was homicidal in nature, the CID took up the case. We were looking for the call statement. We knew it was the only route to the culprit, said a CID official, adding: Now, we will have to cross-examine Pals family.																								The investigators, after examining the nature of wounds on Pals body, confirmed that the murder had been deliberate and committed by killers who knew their business. There were only two spots on Pals larynx, where the killer had applied force, they said.																								Pals black leather bag, that the police said was missing, was found on the bank of the Hooghly at Ballyghat on Wednesday afternoon. A fisherman found it, said an officer of Bally police station. The notebook, stethoscope and water-bottle were intact. It was dumped there because the contents were wet. Had the bag been thrown into the river somewhere else, the notebook should have been damaged.

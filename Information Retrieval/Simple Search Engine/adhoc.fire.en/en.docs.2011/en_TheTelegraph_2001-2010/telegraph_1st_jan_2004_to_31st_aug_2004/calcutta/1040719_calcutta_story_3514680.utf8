 Monday, July 19, 2004  Master the mix SANGITA S. GUHA ROY
 The DJ workshop in progress. Picture by Rashbehari Das 															 The deafening loud  and getting louder  sound of music at city discos has prompted Bhawanipur Education Society to conduct a DJ workshop in association with veteran DJ Jimmy Tangree. So far 15 students have enlisted for the workshop, on till July 25, on the Elgin Road college campus. The group, including four girls, can be seen bringing the house down, spinning heady mixes on the latest equipment worth Rs 3 lakh, purchased by the college.																					The music buffs start off with basic mixing techniques before moving on to showbiz styles like scratching, looping and interacting with the crowd. 																					Apart from giving the students a chance to work on state-of-the-art equipment, the workshop aims at making them more confident by inculcating the right attitude, said Tangree. 																					Gursimran Singh, the young owner of Spice Garden, one of the participants, couldnt agree more. I have been DJing for a while and have the basic know-how. So I am just here to gain more confidence on the mike, he shrugged. Coming up next is a radio jockey workshop. With early success, such courses are set to become part of the permanent offering at the college.																																													Action auction																					 Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Imran Khan, Dennis Lillee, Tony Greig, Sunil Gavaskar followed by Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. One may not have the opportunity to meet the cricket giants in person but their presence will be felt nevertheless at the charity auction of cricket memorabilia to be held at ITC Sonar Bangla on July 25.																					The treasures were on show at a preview recently, where collector Nishant Singhal displayed a part of his collection to go under the hammer. 																					A cricket lover and an autograph freak since the age of seven, Singhal has lost count of the number of autographs he has collected on 12 mini bats and a linen bearing the words of Douglas Jardine, captain during the Bodyline series in Australia in 1932-33. The linen is crammed with 97 autographs and has a total of 2,75,712 runs, 5,502 wickets in 4,980 test matches and 1,66,640 runs, 3,141 wickets in 7,133 one-day internationals (compiled by a statistician adding up the score cards of each cricketer featured). 																					Organised by Lions Clubs International, District 322 B1, the proceeds will go to the signature programme of the club, Bless a Child, that aims to provide free medical and educational assistance to 500 underprivileged children in Calcutta and Nadia. 																					Co-ordinator Kishore Bhimani promised a glittering evening that will enlist the whos who of the city apart from special guests like former India captain Bishen Singh Bedi, who is to conduct the auction, and Navjot Singh Sidhu with cricket girl Mandira Bedi notching up the glam quotient.

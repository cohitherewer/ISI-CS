 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								A demand-supply mismatch of the skilled manpower kind is slowing down Sector V.																								With tech downturn now a thing of the past and the market showing signs of recovery, the companies are back to the drawing board, mapping out expansion plans, only to a hit a human resource hurdle.																								We are moving up the value chain and entering the consulting space. But for that, we need people with relevant industry experience and we are finding it difficult in getting them, says D. K. Chaudhuri, chief executive officer of Skytech Solutions, a joint venture between The Chatterjee Group and United Airlines. The company has set a target of taking its headcount to over 1,000 by the end of the year, but is struggling to recruit right.																								Almost all companies planning a strategic shift from low-end volume business to top-dollar assignments are facing the same shortage.																								Just a year or two ago, IT was the most favoured industry to work with and was attracting a bright batch. Today, the number of disposable people available with the industry has dropped with growth in other sectors as well, explains a TCS spokesperson, which employs around 30,000 people. 																								According to Chaudhury, the competition from the erstwhile East European countries in the low-end job segment is putting pressure on margins and more and more Indian companies are exploring opportunities in high-end IT consulting, in areas ranging from banking to airlines, retail to health.																								As the level of engagement with the clients rises, the demand for people knowing specific markets goes up. There has always been a shortage of such talent, feels Siddhartha Mukherjee, vice-president of Cognizant Technology Solutions, one of the largest IT outfits in the city.																								Industry observers point out that the problem is a nationwide phenomenon, but hasten to add that the Saltlec conundrum is more complex. The kind of people we are looking for are the real professionals and they are not available in Calcutta. Most of them have either left the city or moved out of the country, explains Chaudhury.																								With the industry feeling the pressure the National Association for Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) has sprung into action. After all, if the manpower issue is not dealt with seriously, say some industry experts, the Nasscom target of revenues over US $50 billion by the next three to four years will remain a distant dream.																								We are trying to attract people from abroad, as many of them are willing to come back. We will start a programme shortly, says Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom. The apex body of IT companies is creating a window on its site to give both companies and IT professionals a platform to facilitate true exchange benefiting both.																								Karnik, however, adds that the demand-supply mismatch will phase out along with the evolution of the industry, which is still young. It is also in talks with universities to structure industry specific curriculum.

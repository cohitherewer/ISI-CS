The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, August 07, 2004 Cool at the console
DJs are the lucky guys who make you dance to their tune, and quite literally. Zeeshan Jawed listens inMUSIC ZONE DJ Pre-Anjana works her moves at Tantrar. Picture by Rashbehari Das A semi-lit smoky room, free-flowing spirits (of all kinds), an interactive crowd, thumping beat and rocking rhythm. Ever spared a thought for the guy dishing out the tracks one after the other? Here is a closer look at the disc jockey hiding behind the console:A cool professionEven around five years ago, being a DJ was looked down upon, but times are clearly a changing (though Dylan is not likely to be on the usual disco song-list). Now, there are lots waiting in the wings. And in the days of the remix raj, fame and big bucks are equally likely.Not a bed of rosesAt first glance, it might seem like the easiest thing to churn out one happening track after the other, and have just about everybody dance to your tune. But there is a flip side, too. It might seem glamorous, but you have to bid goodbye to your social life just to ensure everyone else has a good time. I struggle hard to spend time with my mom and dad, confesses Girish, who plays at the Shisha Bar.Change is constantThe party scene in Calcutta is turning out to be quite colourful with a growing number of nightclubs and pubs. But the biggest no-no is repeating the same number on any given night. The crowd is very interactive, making requests and showing appreciation of a good piece of music. But dare repeat a track and face the wrath. Thats why I keep juggling between retro, trance, hip-hop and others, explains Harish of Dublin. DJ Girish at Shisha Bar. Picture by Rashbehari Das Whats rockingWhile the remixes seem to rule the soundwaves, Calcutta also loves its share of international music. The most happening tracks now are Milkshake by ???Kelis and Turn Me On by Kevin Lyttle. But Not In Love by Enrique Iglesias is the winner all the way, says DJ Vicky of Winning Streak. Bollywood always has its takers. Reigning remixes are Kabhi Aar Kabhi Paar, Bin Tere Sanam, Dekh Le and Bheege Honth Tere.Wanna be one yourself?Do not get swayed by the glamour, advise the song spinners. It is quite a task to make a name as a DJ. There is stiff competition and you have to be a master at your work. Be prepared for a struggle on your way up. If you are good at your console, you can earn up to Rs 5,000 per night.The hit list Harish (Dublin): A former band singer, he started as a freelancer in 1997. Being a DJ gives you a lot of freedom to experiment with music, says this St Xaviers College graduate, who personally likes to play retro and hip-hop. Girish (Shisha Bar): This businessman by day and DJ by night loves experimenting with international music on Wednesdays and Fridays. Saturdays are reserved for Bollywood. Saranjeet (Big Ben): Winner of the War of the DJs 2002, the Big Ben job just landed on his lap. A tabla player, too, his personal favourites are hip hop and R amp;B. Logical Lloyd (Tantra): One of the oldest on the circuit, he sticks to the call of the crowd. I have been DJ-ing for the past 14 years. I came down to Calcutta in 1994 when there was almost no party scene here, explains the former Incognito DJ. Akash: DJing happened just by chance to this freelancer who circulates around the top clubs. Nowadays he is busy churning out remixes of sings like U amp; I by Rishi Rich and Superstar by Jamelia. Pre-Anjana (Tantra): Trained under DJ Lloyd, she is the only female DJ playing in Calcutta. This first-year college student bagged the top honours at a prestigious DJ competition earlier this year, but had to give up the offer for being under-age.sound scanHe had a struck up quite a rhythm for a share in Pandit Ravi Shankars Grammy glory; he is now working up a charm for the maestros sitar-playing daughter. Tanmoy Bose is shining bright among the handful of musicians Anoushka Shankar (right) has roped in for her maiden, yet-untitled album (she is composing all 10 tracks without her fathers aid). The city musician is Anoushkas first choice on the tabla, while the others include Vishwamohan Bhatt on the mohanveena, Pedro Eustache on the flute and Ricardo Mino on the piano.I have been accompanying Anoushka on the tabla almost ever since she started playing the sitar. So, I am thrilled working for her maiden album, said Tanmoy, who had assisted her father in his Grammy-winning album Full Circle.
Tanmoy had finished recording for half of Anoushkas compositions during his last US tour, which also found him performing at the opening session of the Biswa Banga Sammelan in Baltimore. This was followed up by a demonstration at the Indian Music Society in San Francisco. Presently, Tanmoy is camping in London for a concert with the father-daughter duo. On the cards is a recording of the sitar maestros next album, which will even feature Tanmoy lending his voice to one his compositions. Next up, a global tour with sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan.All that jazz

The all-star band will have Carlton Kitto on guitar, Nondon Bagchi on drums, Soumitra Das on piano and Jessie Elloy on bass.

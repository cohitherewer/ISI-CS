 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bus operators on Friday decided to move high court next week, challenging the government order to scrap all commercial vehicles registered before 1975.																								According to the transport department order, permits for all commercial vehicles registered before 1975 will not be renewed. If any operator wants the permit renewed, he will have to replace the vehicle with a new one. Buses, minibuses, taxis, trucks, autorickshaws and small and medium goods vehicles fall under the purview of the order.																								Bengal Bus Syndicate has decided to challenge the order in court after a day-long meeting. The Joint Council of Bus Syndicates decided to follow suit. According to the operators, over 40 per cent buses and minibuses would go off the road if the government implemented its order.																								The government has no authority to issue an order to scrap vehicles if they comply with the motor vehicles rules and conform to the automobile emission norms, said Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.

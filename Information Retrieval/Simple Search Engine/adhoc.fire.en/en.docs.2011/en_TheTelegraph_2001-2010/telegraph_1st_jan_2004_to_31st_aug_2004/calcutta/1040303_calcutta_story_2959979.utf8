	Lakhs of men, women and children from the suburbs pour into the city centre to participate in rallies organised by various political parties. But often there are no proper toilets along the rally route. This results in the streets being soiled and the stench is for us citizens to bear for days to come. Hence, rally organisers should take the initiative to build temporary toilets and help keep the city clean. Since they are responsible for clogging the roads, the least they can do is not to add to the inconvenience.

	Most public sector banks are not following the Centres recommendations on customer service in public sector organisations. Assurances of payment within 10 minutes and issuance of demand drafts in 15 minutes are not kept despite the banks being fully computerised. Many of them dont even start functioning normally till half an hour past the opening time. I appeal to the bank authorities to address these issues.

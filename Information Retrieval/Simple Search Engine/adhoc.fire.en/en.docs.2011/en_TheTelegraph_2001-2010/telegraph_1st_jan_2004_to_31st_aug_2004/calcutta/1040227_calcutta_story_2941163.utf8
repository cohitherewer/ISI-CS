					PIX BY RASHBEHARI DASArpita Chatterjee and Pinky in saris from Srijonis new line, at the inauguration of the exhibition and (below) Pinky strikes a pose in another sari from the same boutique															With the weatherman predicting a boiling summer ahead, its a good idea to get a head start on replenishing your wardrobe with clothes that are cool, comfortable and oh, so chic. Your first stop then, on your seasonal shopping spree, should be Srijoni, a cosy ethnicwear boutique thats holding a special exhibition of its latest Spring-Summer collection. 																					Owned by designer Arpita Chatterjee, Srijoni is a little over three years old and has already made quite a name for itself when it comes to ensembles that stand out by dint of their superb block-printing and hand-work. For her new collection, Arpita has once again dabbled in block-printing, various types of embroidery and also newer techniques such as spray-painting to come up with a range of saris, salwar-kameezes and dupattas that are strikingly beautiful. 																					though the designer has flirted with voiles for earlier lines, this time around, Arpita has gone all out to create visions in voile using everything from spray-painting, dual tones, gold and silver printing, embroidery and pretty sequin-work to dress these up. Pretty printed versions in colours ranging from luscious oranges and ochres to tropical turquoises and aquamarines, are also available. Prices hover around the Rs 550 mark while a simple block-printed voile sari would cost just about Rs 350. 																					so a great way to step it up this summer would be togging up in one of Srijonis printed cotton saris or crisp Dhakais in soothing pastel hues. Dhakais (Rs 1,700 - Rs 7,000) at Srijoni come in a different avatar as well, being woven from cotton and silk for a richer, more dressed-up look. Besides these, there are flowing crepes, chiffons and georgettes in block-printed, spray-painted and tie-and-dye styles. 																					Arpita doesnt disappoint all those ladies who swear by silk too. Her silk saris are an elegant fusion of different types of work including block prints, embroidery and zardosi. The blending is innovative and the results are stunning. There are pure silk saris in black with intricate kantha pallus in green and matching block-printed kuchis. Rich kanjeevarams in shades of scarlet and ivory are worked over with kantha and given broad zari borders while new-age Benarasis in handwoven crepe and georgette come adorned with resham and zardosi-work. 																					Those who prefer the easy comfort of a salwar-kameez would do well to nose through Srijonis collection of these along with its range of dupattas. The latter comes in everything from tussar and pure silk to chiffon and georgette and embellishments include intricate kantha-work and interesting block-prints. A salwar-suit would set you back by at least Rs 450 while embroidered dupattas range between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000. 																					The exhibition at Srijoni will continue till March 10.

Russian pole dancer Alena gets ready to heat things up at The Blues at The HHI												Pole vault 																					Ever since Malaika Arora Khans stirring pole-dance number Mahi Ve in Kaante had hot-blooded males hooting and hollering across the country, pole-dancing has caught on like never before. And The Blues at The HHI is only the latest hot-spot in town to groove to the moves of a hot and heavy pole dancer. 																					l the way from Russia, blonde bombshell Alena will be the main attraction at the hotels restobar right up till March 15. Starting her career in dancing at 16, Alena has performed in several countries including France, Poland, Thailand and Saudi Arabia. This is her first tour in India and although the 24-year-old has specialised in belly dancing, pole-dancing sequences remain her favourite. Thus even as sensual jazz music on the saxophone or funky disco beats boom in the background, Alena launches into her act  a high-kicking, leg-twisting and back-bending routine that only goes to prove that this young lady is in the right profession. 																					l that pole-dancing helps you build up an appetite, a look at the menu is in order. World cuisine is what you get at The Blues. So, apart from regular Indian, Chinese and Thai, you could have a go at such Lebanese staples as hummus and falafel, Mexican enchiladas and tostadas, Italian pastas and French specialities be it Poisson Grenbloise or Oulet Roti with Roast Gravy. Delicious desserts, lovely cocktails (we recommend the True Blues) and musical mixes from DJ Akash round off the list of offerings at The Blues.  Chef Thomas Huang with some of the specialities from the ongoing lamb festival at Treats												Treat yourself																					Treats, a short walk from the Park Street-A.J.C. Bose Road crossing, has come to the rescue of those dedicated non-vegetarians who have lost their appetite after the bird flu scare. The Chinese and Thai restaurant is currently holding a lamb festival featuring some unique dishes from China, Thailand and other parts of the Orient. Executive chef Thomas Huang, who is also a partner of the restaurant, is the guiding light in this endeavour to provide food-loving Calcuttans with an alternative to chicken and mutton. 																					 For those who prefer to start with soups, there is Lamb Tread Soup and Yellow Lamb Soup, prepared with cornflour, onions, eggs and lemon juice. If digging into a salad appeals, try the Crispy Lamb Salad and Kimchi Lamb Salad before moving on to such starters as the Lamb Satay Stick, Lamb Korean Stick and Sesame Toast Lamb. Especially recommended by Chef Huang is the Treats Special Starter, an innovative kebab-style item. 																					For the main course, you could go with the Steamed Mei Foon, Burnt Ginger Rice, Shanghai Rice or the Me Guri, the last of these being a perfect pick for those with a penchant for the exotic. Team this slightly spicy Malaysian flat-noodle dish with the other specialities available such as Muku Lamb and Drunken Lamb and satisfaction is guaranteed. 																					Besides the lamb preparations on offer, one can also order from the regular menu that throws up such preparations as Prawn in Oyster Sauce, Satay Stick, Prawn Wafers and Cantonese Mei Foon. On request, Treats also prepares special dishes including Peking Duck and Saucy Crab. Sign off on a sweet note with Dates and Fried Wanton or darsaan with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream. 																					Says Imtiaz Qasem, one of the owners of Treats, We do not use artificial colouring or preservatives and stick to only fresh ingredients in order to provide our patrons a healthy eating experience. Located centrally on Park Street, Treats, a family restaurant is frequented by foodies with a taste for Tangra-style Chinese food. The pricing is easy on the wallet with an average meal for two costing about Rs 250. 																					The Oriental lamb festival will continue at Treats till March 19.

Tinku Das, Lars Ahlstrand, Babita Das and Peter Bjorn Franceschi with some of their paintings at the Birla Academy 												Art of the matter																					The Birla Academy of Art and Culture, a hot stop for art lovers in the city, is hosting an exhibition with a difference. Two well-known young Indian painters, along with two like-minded Danish artists, are holding an exhibition of abstract art, which according to art critic Samir Dasgupta, highlights the commonality of cross-cultural aesthetic visions which, arguably, can show up only in abstract terms.																					Interestingly, the paintings on display by the Indian artists  Tinku Das and Babita Das  were all done in Vermont, USA, while the paintings by Dutch artists, Lars Ahlstrand and Peter Bjorn Franceschi were done in Santiniketan. Says Das, What emerges from the exhibition is how much four artists with totally different styles, have in common.																					l the paintings on display on the first floor of the Birla Academy are non-representational and are characterised by bold strokes and vibrant colours. The influence of Santiniketan can be observed in the works of Lars Ahlstrand and Peter Bjorn Franceschi, who spent a considerable amount of time capturing the flavour of the place and its people. Colours have a life of their own in Ahlstrands pictorial constructs whereas Franceschis canvases seem to be an attempt to study abstract motions. 																					Babitas paintings, which she says are one-sitting affairs, explore shapes and forms and have distinct emotional cores. Husband Tinku Das works on the other hand, are more introspective and aims at bridging the gap between different people and cultures. 																					The exhibition which will continue till February 29 (from 4pm - 8pm), was inaugurated by Dr Martin Waelde, director of Max Mueller Bhavan after which a cultural programme enthralled one and all present. Even as Kasturi Mishra danced to mellifluous renditions of Rabindrasangeet by Nupurchhanda Ghosh, musicians Dipankar Acharya on rhythm and Anjan Basu on esraj ably supported the performance. Adding another dimension to the affair was Babita Das who captured the performances on canvas.

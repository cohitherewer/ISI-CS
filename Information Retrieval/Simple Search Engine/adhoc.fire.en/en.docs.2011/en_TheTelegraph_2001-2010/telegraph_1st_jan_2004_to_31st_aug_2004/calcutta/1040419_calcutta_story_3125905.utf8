The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Food checks amp; gastro rage
 															- FOUR-MONTH LULL IN ANTI-ADULTERATION DRIVE DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								The civic authorities on Sunday imparted a new twist to the uproar over the outbreak of gastro-enteritis by confessing that they had neglected over the past four months a quality check of the prepared food sold in thousands of eateries across Calcutta.																								According to a senior official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) health department, the CMC drive against food adulteration and sale of cut fruit has been suspended since December as the state government failed to publish a gazette notification on the 29 newly-recruited food inspectors. Food inspectors collect samples of edible items for laboratory tests and file a case against an offender.																								Explaining the situation, mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh said on Sunday that earlier doctors were recruited to the post of food inspectors. In 2003, the civic authorities decided to lower the essential qualification required for the post to a bachelors degree in science, with chemistry as a subject.																								The CMC then recruited 29 graduates as food inspectors in December, while the four doctors working as food inspectors were promoted to the posts of medical officers.																								Soon after the recruitment, municipal commissioner Debashis Som wrote to the state government for a gazette notification. But the notification has yet to be issued.																								Meanwhile, with the onset of summer, diarrhoea has broken out in several pockets of the city. 																								More than 50 people from Entally, Tiljala and Beleghata had to be hospitalised in the past 72 hours. More than 100 people were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital at Beleghata over the past four weeks. A three-year-old from Beniapukur succumbed to the disease at the Institute of Child Health last week.																								According to officer on special duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee, consumption of cut fruits, cheap ice cream and roadside food is the root cause of diarrhoea outbreaks during summer and monsoon.																								Complaints of contamination in the filtered water pipelines are also pouring in from both CPM and Trinamul Congress councillors of areas like Park Circus, Beleghata, Tangra, Tiljala and Topsia. In some pockets of Tiljala and Topsia, roadside taps are reportedly spewing water with a blackish tinge and foul smell. 																								The councillors alleged that despite several requests, the water supply department has not taken care to protect the 32-inch-diameter water mains running along the northern side of Bridge No. 4.

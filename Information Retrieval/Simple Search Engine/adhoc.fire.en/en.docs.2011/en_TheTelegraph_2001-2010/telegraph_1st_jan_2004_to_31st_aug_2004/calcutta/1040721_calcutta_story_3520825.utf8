		 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 H. Mohan								Director, Public Vehicles Department, and joint secretary, transport department, government of West Bengal																																							The penalty should depend on the cause of the accident. If the cause of the accident can be clearly attributed to the owner, he should be penalised. For instance, if it is a problem related to maintenance, the owner should shoulder responsibility. In cases where a bus runs over someone while trying to overtake another bus, both the owner and the driver should be penalised. Of course, the police have to act fast to bring the guilty parties to book.

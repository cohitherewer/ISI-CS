																																																		A 26-year-old housewife, Mithu Debnath, was arrested along with five of her associates on Monday at her Sonarpur residence on the southern fringes of the city on charges of murdering her husband, Chandan Debnath. Police said Mithu had approached the Government Railway Police to lodge a missing complaint but came up with contradictory statements during the filing of the report. She was detained at the police station and after two days of interrogation she gave in and confessed that she had helped her former husband, Bapi Haldar, kill Chandan. Mithus friends, Sumitra Naskar and Bibha Naskar, and two local criminals, Rahul and Kalua, were later picked up from their homes.																																																		Three persons were injured on Monday in three separate accidents in the city. Amit Shaw, 26, was injured at around 10 am when he was hit by an ambulance  belonging to the eighth battalion of the state armed police  on BT Road near Chunibabur Bazar in the Chitpore police station area. Shaw was admitted to RG Kar Hospital. The vehicle was impounded and the driver was arrested. In the second incident, 52-year-old Uttam Roy, an employee of Calcutta Medical Research Institute, suffered serious injuries when he was hit by a private bus on route 1B at the crossing of Sahapur Road and Diamond Harbour Road in the New Alipore police station area. The bus was impounded and the driver was arrested. Another man, Sudeb Banerjee, 35, was admitted to RG Kar Hospital after he was hit by a bus on route 211 on Ultadanga Main Road. Banerjee, a resident of Baduria in North 24-Parganas, is said to be in a serious condition. The driver of the bus fled with the vehicle.																																																		An eviction drive was conducted in Salt Lake on Monday. Officials said about 300 illegal hutments were removed from around tank number 12 of the township. The drive was conducted jointly by Bidhannagar Municipality and police.																																																		The state government has decided to introduce self-employment schemes for unemployed youths in Calcutta, state transport and youth services minister Subhas Chakraborty said in the Assembly on Monday. The government would set up a new corporation under which several self-employment schemes for unemployed youths would be introduced. Many of these schemes will be meant exclusively for city youth. According to the minister, the existing system benefited only unemployed youth in the rural belts. The schemes will be introduced in collaboration with nationalised banks. 																																																		Mayor Subrata Mukherjee opposed the collection of land tax from landlords residing in Calcutta proper (wards 6  95) calling it double taxation.

The restricted run is due to non-interlocking work on the Samuktala-Kamakhyaguri-Jorai section of the North-East Frontier Railway. The Kanchenjungha Express leaving Sealdah on July 27 will terminate at New Jalpaiguri, and the down train will start from there the next day.

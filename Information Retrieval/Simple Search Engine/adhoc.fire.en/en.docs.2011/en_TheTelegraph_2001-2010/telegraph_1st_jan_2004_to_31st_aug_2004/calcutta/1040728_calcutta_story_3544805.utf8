																								Spandan, IPTA presents two short plays, 16 Millimeter and Operation Flush. The former, an investigative drama, begins with the arrest of Professor Gellani, main accused in the Parliament attack. While none of the lawyers comes up to his defence, young Soumi Pancholi accepts the challenge. The day before the judgement in the POTA case was to be delivered, she reveals vital information to the CBI officer which gives a new turn to the whole story. The second play, Operation Flush, is based on the theme of brutal torture on Iraqi prisoners of war. It revolves around a young girl, Sajida Makhmal, who is abducted a few days before she was to get married. Inside the cell, she and other prisoners were subjected to physical as well as mental torture by secret service agents.

 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Taxi stand din sullies library ambience 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								In spite of being no-parking zone, the road in front of the Howrah district library is always chock-a-block with taxis. And with the district police doing little to stop the practice, an increasing number of taxis now block the entry to the library.																								Inquiries revealed that the district administration had decided some time ago, at a meeting with library officials, that parking of vehicles other than government cars should not be allowed in front of the library. 																								As per that decision, a No Parking board was erected on a stand in the area. Within 24 hours, however, it was found lying smashed on the ground, said librarian Amit Kumar Pal. Who pulled it down, and why, is something that none of us knows, he added.																								Library officials blamed the taxi drivers with destroying the peace of the zone with their shouting and abusing. 																								This is terrible for visitors to the library, especially those who come here to study, they lamented.																								The officials pointed out that some students who are taking the IAS and WBCS exams also come to the library for their preparations, but the din makes things unbearable.																								Since the district administration had decided to make the road a no-parking zone, the responsibility is also its to implement the decision, said Nisith Sarkar, convener of Howrah Citizens Forum, a social welfare organisation. 																								Forum members complained that the taxi drivers flout the law under the protective eye of a section of police officers.

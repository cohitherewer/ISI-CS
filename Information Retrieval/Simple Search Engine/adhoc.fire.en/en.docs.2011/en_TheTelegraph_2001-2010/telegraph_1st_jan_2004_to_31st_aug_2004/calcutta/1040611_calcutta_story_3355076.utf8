The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, June 11, 2004  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The footpaths on Lord Sinha Road and Ballygunge Circular Road are very narrow. To add to the problem, phuchkawalas and other hawkers make it almost impossible for pedestrians to walk the stretch in the evenings. As the roads are home to many upmarket shops, eateries and residential buildings, vehicular traffic is high throughout the day. Cant the Calcutta Municipal Corporation take steps to rid the narrow footpaths of encroachments? 				 																																									Prantik Sanyal, 				 																																									SP Mukherjee Road.				 																																									I purchased a few National Savings Certificates (NSC) from Lake Town post office in the month of February. A kutcha receipt was issued to me with the assurance that proper certificates will be given at a later date. I have not received the certificates yet. As a result, I have not been able to file my tax returns along with photocopies of the NSC certficates. I request postal authorities to look into the matter. Customers should be not be harassed in this manner.				 																																									Rabindranath Kar,				 																																									Sankar Ghosh Lane.

 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Gunshot motive foxes cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Twenty-four hours after a woman was shot at in Santoshpur, the police are clueless about the motive of the crime. No arrests were reported either.																								Arati Mukherjee, employee of a private hospital, was seriously wounded by the gunshot on Saturday night. She was returning home with husband Asoke. Two men on a motorcycle drew up, opened fire from close range and drove off in the darkness. 																								Arati was removed to a private hospital, where she was operated on to remove the bullet from the back of her neck. Hospital sources said she is out of danger.																								The incident has sparked local concern because police have failed to make headway in the case even after a day has elapsed. 																								Swapan Roy, resident of the area, said Asoke, after taking voluntary retirement from a nationalised bank, was into real estate. We were quite surprised, because this is the first time such an incident has taken place in our locality, he added.																								Additional superintendent of police (industrial) R.K. Singh said: We have just started investigations. We will check if Asoke had any professional rival. We will ask the couple if they recognised the gunmen. 																								Singh has asked Purba Jadavpur police station officer-in-charge Anjan Ganguly to conduct raids in the area.

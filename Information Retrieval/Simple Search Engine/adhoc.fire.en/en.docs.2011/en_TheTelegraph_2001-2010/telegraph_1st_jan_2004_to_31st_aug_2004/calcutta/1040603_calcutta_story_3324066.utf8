 Prosenjit with Goutam Ghose at Conclave on Wednesday. Picture by Aranya Sen.																								A year after Abar Aranye, film-maker Goutam Ghose is back from the wilderness. After leapfrogging to a sequel of Satyajit Rays Aranyer Din Ratri, he is rewinding to a feudal patriarch in the times of partition.																								In Banshi, Ghoses camera will trace the grandeur, the arrogance and the decadence of a babu and his bygone era. 																								The film goes on the floors this September and is targeting a 2005 Cannes Festival premiere. 																								But Wednesday evening at Conclave found Ghose announcing his forthcoming project a little too early, with a two-fold purpose  sharing info nuggets about the story and clearing confusions about the banner of the film. 																								Ghose has backed out of the project supposed to be produced by Jhamu Sugandh, citing difference of opinion on the star cast. 																								The decision to withdraw was a conscious and professional one. I wanted to part ways as those handling production here had started intervening in deciding the cast. I think thats the directors prerogative, Ghose explained, unwilling to disclose the other big banner that has stepped in to back the film. 																								A few strains from the Banshi...																								The setting: A bustling palace with its resident babu, his family, subjects and concubines. A rich dose of classical music and dance, varied characters and a vast range of conflicting emotions. But behind the human drama, people might find a socio-political allegory in Banshi, said Ghose.																								The outdoors will be shot in Hooghly and Purulia, while portions of the palace will be recreated indoors.  Irrfan Khan will play a horse-rider in the film 																								The plot: Is about a young girl, raised abroad, returning to her roots. Her search ends in a decrepit palace, an old man playing a flute and a horse-rider. What is conjured through her grandmothers diary, the flute and the flashbacks is the life and times of her great-grandfather. The script has been based on and freely adapted from writer Kamal Kumar Majumdars Kayedkhana. 																								Kamal Kumar had extraordinarily presented the elements of destruction  the power, greed and ego  embedded in the feudal set-up. I want to recreate that period, elucidated Ghose.																								The star line-up: Prosenjit as the babu and the girls ancestor, Soumitra Chattopadhyay as the old man playing the flute and Irrfan Khan as the horse-rider. Ghose promises an interesting new face in the female lead, for which he has screentested several, plus a bevy of Tollywood beauties. 																								Casting Prosenjit was pretty much decided when Ghose had conceived the plot. And Tollywoods leading man is also gearing up to essay the most difficult and complex role that has ever come his way. 																								I have to work very hard on this. I will have to change my look and my attitude for this, but I am sure Goutamda will extract that out of me, said Prosenjit.

 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 When human borders crumble
																								Embellishing the citys school literary circuit with yet another original theatre production is Theatrecians Us and Them. A play that essentially focuses on the many-hued complexities of human relationships, it also points out how the borders between our personal and professional worlds are increasingly becoming blurred. In such a scenario, we fail to clearly communicate our ideas and opinions to others, with the result that relationships suffer and we ourselves become victims of utter isolation. Offering a fresh perspective on the theme of loneliness and despair as effects of modern, urban lifestyles, this play also tells us how to deal with these problems. Produced by Gargi Sen and directed by school students Jhinuk Sen and Aditya Vikram Das, this play is specially interesting in the way it shows us how hope and fear, love and jealousy, friendship and animosity are but different expressions of the same feeling.																								Event: Play in English, Us and Them, presented by Theatrecian																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Drizzly send-off for Holi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcuttans woke up to an overcast sky and unseasonal drizzle on Sunday, the day after Holi. The city recorded 5.7 mm of rain till Sunday evening, with chances of more till Monday morning.																								The regional meteorological office said the rain was caused by an upper-air circulation that brought in moisture-laden air from the Bay of Bengal. The process started around 2 am on Sunday. 																								Officials said the sky is likely to remain cloudy, with some rain on Monday morning, but chances of brightening up later in the day. 																								 Two days ago, a big band of cloud had drifted from an intense cyclonic storm near Madagascar, crossed the Arabian Sea, passed over Gujarat and Maharashtra and lay extended up to Arunachal Pradesh. An upper-air circulation formed 2.1 km over Jharkhand, Orissa and south Bengal early on Sunday and brought in a lot of moisture from the Bay. The rain occurred under the impact of the two systems, said an official.																								Sunday remained cloudy and remarkably cool. The maximum temperature plummeted to 24.6 degrees Celsius, eight degrees below normal. On Saturday, the maximum temperature had shot up to 35.3 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. 																								The days minimum temperature was pegged at 21.1 degrees, one degree above normal. Mondays minimum temperature is likely to be low, too.

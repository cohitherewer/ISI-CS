The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Guard the gate, open doors
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should public access to sites housing heritage artefacts be restricted to once a week? More letters will be printed next week On alert: Sleuths on the Parashwanath temple premises after the recent theftK.L. Ghosh,
																		Kalindi																																																														If the authorities have no faith in the security arrangements, public access to sites housing heritage artefacts should be totally restricted. If they think that the guards are honest and the surveillance infrastructure is adequate, they should keep the gates open seven days a week, providing a fillip to culture tourism in the country.									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Beleghata																																																														Access to structures housing heritage artefacts may be restricted once a week. On the other days, security should be strengthened to protect these assets. 									

Kanai Saha, 
																		Gauri Bari Lane																																																														Proper maintenance of the valued relics is the need of the hour. So, the proposal is most welcome. Alongside, a separate register should also be maintained in which visitors can put down their remarks on the condition of the heritage sites. The authorities in charge of the site should convene a weekly meeting to discuss these remarks, especially those by foreign tourists. A watch should also be kept on staff members. 									

Manasi Chakrabarty, 
																		Behala																																																														Yes, public access to sites housing heritage artefacts should be restricted six days a week. The artefacts are rare items that will inspire our future generations. They will be under threat if the public is allowed to visit these places daily. After all, it is not possible to keep watch on every visitor to the site. 									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia, Nadia																																																														Art-lovers are fast dwindling in our country. Very few are interested in visiting heritage sites. Therefore, the sites should be open on all days of the week, at least for those who are interested in viewing the artefacts. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore																																																														Visitors to heritage sites contribute a large sum of money towards the upkeep of the sites by way of entry fees. So, under no circumstance should common people be denied the rights they have been enjoying so far in the name of security. Instead, vigil at the sites should be beefed up using the latest gadgets and proper cataloguing of all artefacts. 									

Sandhya Banerjee, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														Only if the heritage sites are open to the public throughout the week can the management raise a part of its maintenance cost by means of entry fees. The visitors will also get better services and facilities at these places. Last but not least, our future generations will be more conversant with Indias history, art and culture. 									

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury, 
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														Burglary and thefts take place mainly due to negligent security arrangements. Hence, that area needs attention. Modern security gadgets should be installed and more guards should be deployed at these sites. Reducing public access will not serve the purpose. The government should take special measures, especially after the theft of Tagores Nobel and other belongings from Santiniketan. 									

B.N. Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														The theft at Santiniketan has heaped shame on the people of Bengal. Now there is no choice but to protect the sites housing heritage artefacts. However, there should be no restriction on the public to visit heritage sites except on Sundays. Imposing any restriction will prevent hundreds of visitors, especially students of ancient history, from adding to their knowledge on our past. 									

Debashis Chakraborty, 
																		Cossipore																																																														The heritage sites are the greatest treasures of our country. So, they should be under tight security. It is a matter of deep regret that the citation and the Nobel medal earned by Rabindranath Tagore in 1913 was stolen from the custody of Visva-Bharati at Santiniketan. In view of this recent theft, public access to sites housing heritage artefacts should be restricted to once a week. 									

Tapash Chakraborty, 
																		Nabagram																																																														Access to heritage sites should not be restricted to once a week as many take their children to these places to teach them about Indias history and culture. Even foreigners flock in large numbers to get acquainted with our past. A nominal fee can be charged from visitors for maintaining the site. Surveillance cameras can be placed in the building for keeping a vigil on the visitors. In other countries such gadgets are widely used at important monuments. The Santiniketan episode should teach us a lesson.									

Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna																																																														The proposal is not worth implementing. Instead, it will be better if heritage sites are kept open till 7 pm every day of the week. This will attract more tourists, especially in the summer months when days are long. Random security checks at the gates by efficient securitymen and optimum utilisation of closed-circuit cameras and metal detectors are essential for the safety of the heritage artefacts.									

Seraj alam, 
																		Bansberia																																																														No way. The heritage artefacts are the pride of a nation. Under no circumstances should people be denied access to them. Restrictions will mean overcrowding on the single day when the gates are thrown open to visitors. The best way to protect our treasures is to tighten security. The onus is on the government to take action.									

Anil Kumar Sen,
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane																																																														Heritage sites are not places of amusement or merry-making. They impart education. So access to these sites should never be denied to the public. There is no way to distinguish a genuine visitor from a thief. So the authorities must take strict security measures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Script for survival hope
				 	 Korak Day Could he be a Hindu, or is he  a Muslim? No, a Christian perhaps. Most people in Rajabazar  are confused about Korak Days identity. But the 33-year-old,  diminutive frail frame clad in lungi-kurta, is happy  to be rid of a religious tag. For Koraks only concern are  the underprivileged women and children of the Muslim-dominated  Rajabazar belt, who cling on to him for hope, for inspiration,  for a lifeline.																								Amaar Nijer, the charitable trust Korak had set up a year and a half ago much against the wishes of his parents, is where around 200 children learn the alphabet and their mothers attend vocational courses. 																								From a rented space in Narkeldanga, Korak runs separate classes for primary school-goers, dropouts, older girls and extra coaching. The women are trained in painting, embroidery, zardosi, flower and bonsai-making. A no-loss business scheme, improvised by Korak, helps them use their creativity to earn a living. With raw materials provided by him, the women conceive designs that are later used on greeting cards, T-shirts, kurtas and saris.																								To the citys film fraternity though, Korak is also known as a filmmaker, with two titles to his credit. The student of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) quit the direction and screenplay-writing course midway to make his first short Kolkatar Kali. The second venture, My Karma, fetched him laurels from far and wide  it was screened at the New York International Film Festival, Las Vegas, and the Los Angeles Film Festival last year. 																								I left SRFTI as I had to make a lot of compromises. I felt a mere degree would not add any value to my sense of being, comes his candid confession.																								Films, for me, are a medium  and by far the best  to reach the people for and with whom I have been working all these years. The pain depicted by the actors (Moon Moon Sen, Arjun Chakraborty and himself) in My Karma is a reflection of what I have seen in these people, says Korak, who drifted towards his roots in Calcutta, leaving behind a childhood and college days in Agra. 																								The Masters degree-holder in maths had a stint in the Indian Navy, too, before working as a volunteer with the Missionaries of Charity and enrolling at SRFTI.																								As a social worker, Korak has charted a difficult path for himself. At Amaar Nijer, donations are a no-no; it survives with profits from Koraks films and by selling a couple of audio albums for which he has penned and composed songs. I do not believe in charity, is his final word.

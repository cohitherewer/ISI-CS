The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Apartments a class apart
ALAPAN BANDYOPADHYAY, chief executive officer, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Archak Bhaduri, Biswajit Mitra, Sudhanshu Dutta, Amrita Mukherjee, Mihir Dutta, Jitendranath Das, P. Bhattacharjee, Santashree Guha, Nirmalendu Dutta, Rajnarayan Gupta and Swarupa Mukherjee				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Swarupa Mukherjee: The CMDA is building many housing estates. Some, like Sourav Abasan, are beyond the buying capacity of the middle class.																																																			I admit that the present housing estates are a trifle expensive. We, too, would be happy to offer these estates to the middle class. But at present, we are only playing the role of a property developer. Naturally, we are in stiff competition with the private sector. If we have to maintain the quality of our buildings, we cannot lower the sale price. At the same time, we have to maintain a huge overhead expenditure for running the agency. But I can assure you that if you manage to buy one of these apartments, you will get a high-quality product.																																																											To keep a self-check, we have already declared in the information booklet that if we fail to deliver the flats to the buyers within the stipulated period, we will pay them interest for the number of days that we fall behind the projected date. This is the first time a state-run agency is offering such incentives to its customers.																																																									

Swarupa Mukherjee: How many such residential estates are coming up and how does one apply for an apartment?																																																			The second phase of Sourav Abasan is ahead. Another housing estate, Purva, is coming up near the Rashbehari connector to the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. To expedite the distribution of application forms and information brochures, we have tied up with a private bank and the booklets are already on sale. But it is priced a little dear for the middle class.																																																									

Archak Bhaduri: The CMDA had taken up many projects in housing and infrastructure development but the roads, especially in Salt Lake, are in very bad shape. 																																																			The problem is that multiple agencies are involved in the process of repairing roads. Apart from the CMDA, the urban development ministry and the Salt Lake municipality are also responsible for maintaining the townships roads. The CMDA maintains only the road from the PNB island that leads to the swimming pool. The road has been repaired recently. As it is an arterial road in the township, we keep an eye on it and repair it whenever we notice any damage. Frankly speaking, the constraint of funds does come in the way of repairs at times. We work on a tight budget.																																																									

Sudhanshu Dutta: We, on behalf of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghathan, want to set up a teachers training institute in Salt Lake. Can the CMDA help us?																																																			The CMDA sells land according to some norms and to select organisations. The normal procedure is to apply for land, with details of the plot and the spot required. The application is discussed by our review committee and it is the final decision-making authority on whether the land is to be allotted or not. 																																																									

Jitendranath Das: Garbage piles up on the streets and stays there for a long time before it is cleared. And not only above the surface, garbage chokes the underground sewers, too. How do you plan to tackle this?																																																			You have pointed out a very serious problem. We are desperately seeking measures to tackle the solid waste that is increasing in volume due to rapid urbanisation. Union minister for urban development B. Dattatreya held a meeting with us to frame a strategy for handling solid waste. The programme entails the waste to be removed and reused to generate some other necessity. We have selected eight towns in the state to carry out a trial run of the project. 																																																											Japanese agencies are being consulted to draw up the project. They have conducted a survey to make the project compatible with the present trend of urbanisation. In this matter, a Japanese bank has agreed to fund us.

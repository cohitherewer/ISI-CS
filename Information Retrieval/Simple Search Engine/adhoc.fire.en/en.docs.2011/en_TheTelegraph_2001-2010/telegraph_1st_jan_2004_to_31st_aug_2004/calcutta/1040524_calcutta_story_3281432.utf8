The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Raving about filmi favourites 
 Raveena Tandon chooses her style stars 																								Out there in Singapore, her friends are having a real cool time. Back here in Calcutta, Raveena Tandon is stewing in the furnace they also call Technicians Studio. The calls from the IIFA Awards committee are pouring in, shes feeling under the May weather, but work is work.																								So, Raveena is resigned to shuttling between Tollygunge and ITC Sonar Bangla.																								The layers of makeup peel off under the harsh lights and the weight of junk jewellery and zari-bordered sari hangs heavy on her frame. But the radiant smile remains right in place and she remains a real sport.																								When Reshmi Sengupta caught up with the Chhoti Bahu of Shri Bimal Mitras Sahib Biwi Gulam on the sets on Saturday, Raveena settled down for a freewheeling adda on a few of her favourite filmi things. Here are some things and some stars that Ravs raved about. Tom HanksJulia RobertsAmitabh-Rekha pair in SilsilaFavourite male actor (Hollywood): Jack Nicholson, Robin Williams and, specially, Tom Hanks. Whether its Catch Me if You Can, The Green Mile, Castaway or Forest Gump, he (Hanks) was just brilliant.																								Favourite female actor (Hollywood): Julia Roberts, looks and performance-wise. No one else among the current crop has been able to sustain herself in the industry like her.																								Favourite male actor (Bollywood): Shammi Kapoor. He was the absolute Mills amp; Boon man you swooned over. Then, Rishi Kapoor. Among the new generation, Hrithik Roshan is good.																								Favourite female actor (Bollywood): Madhubala. She was probably the most natural actress in the industry but people only noticed her breathtaking beauty. Her smile, her looks, everything was so effortless and spontaneous.Shilpa Shetty Jackie ShroffDiya Mirza Favourite screen pair: Rekha-Amitabh, more than Raj Kapoor-Nargis. We grew up seeing and hearing stories of their on-screen and off-screen chemistry 																								Best-dressed man: Jackie Shroff, who experiments with clothes and sets trends. He and Sunjay Dutt look the most manly. Its strange that very few men in the industry really dress like men these days.																								Best-dressed woman: Diya Mirza. She has a fine sense of dressing and wears very decent and elegant clothes. Also, Shilpa Shetty, who has the most gorgeous body and height. I also like some of the outfits Manish Malhotra makes for Kareena Kapoor.Favourite director: I have to name three  Raj Kumar Santoshi, Shekhar Kapur and Ram Gopal Verma for making different, experimental films all the way through. Santoshi can pull off a comedy and a thriller with equal ease; Ramu is always eager to take a lot of chances, without worrying about the box-office; Shekhar (who directed me in Time Machine, which was never completed) has got a lot of style.The other director I would have very much liked to work with is my father Ravi Tandon.																								What makes a man attractive: Upbringing and behaviour. But most importantly, personal hygiene. I first notice the shoes he is wearing. Well-kept footwear shows what he will be like.So guys, go polish those shoes, while Raveena wraps up her Chhoti Bahu act before heading off with film distributor hubby Anil Thadani for a world tour to promote Farhan Akhtars Lakshya

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Its time to turn the waning tide of interest in football
Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								Football commentators on television are yet to get over their hangover with the radio. Their voices quiver and the pitch rises to an octave each time something momentous on the field is to be reported to the viewers. 																								It did not come as a surprise, therefore, when the commentator went overboard as soon as the full whistle was blown in the East Bengal-Indian Bank match in the National Football League. 																								It was a one-sided game and the men in red-and-gold had netted the ball thrice to make sure that East Bengal (EB) emerge champions in the National Football League. 																								EB officials and players on the reserve bench of course invaded the ground and hugged the players. The EB footballers themselves went through the routine, running a victory lap, taking off their shirts and raising their clenched fists to the galleries. 																								More than half of the huge Salt Lake stadium appeared vacant, though, as the camera panned over the galleries. But the commentator had worked himself up to a controlled frenzy. Torches have lit up the galleries and Calcutta will erupt in celebrations tonight  there will be fireworks and people will dance on the streets, or words to that effect came gushing over the wire. 																								Residents, of course, know that nothing of the sort followed. Football no longer drives the city to a frenzy, prompting horse-riding policemen to wade into the crowd and restore order. 																								Celebrations rarely spill over to the streets and seldom does the city come to a standstill because of a football match. Obviously, the national obsession with cricket has converted even the Mecca of Indian football. 																								The waning interest in domestic football is, at least partly, due to the opportunity to watch on television high-quality matches of the English Premier League or the Spanish League. It no longer appears worth making the effort to cheer local teams. 																								So much so that football legend Chuni Goswami was forced to lament in an interview: My son plays golf; my grandson plays cricket and poor Chuni Goswami travelled thousands of kilometres to play football.																								While each of the three big clubs is now supported by one company or the other of the UB Group, controlled by industrial baron Vijay Mallya, the golden age of Calcutta football remains more in memory. 																								No wonder, then, that young footballers of the Tata Football Academy are quoted as saying: Calcutta mein khaali dadagiri hai (Calcutta can boast of only bullying) and, therefore, voicing their preference for playing in Mumbai or Goa. In the western part of the country, they felt, football is taken more seriously and professional footballers are treated with more dignity and respect.																								It is hard to miss the citys growing indifference to the football legacy. Although Bhaichung Bhutia, appropriated by the city, has revived some interest in football, try buying a shirt with the picture of Bhutia executing a bicycle kick. 																								Shirts with pictures of football icons like Bhutia have the potential of not just being a money-spinner for the clubs but also of being excellent souvenirs that visitors can take back with them. 																								But it is not easy to buy any kind of football souvenir in the hub of the city, at least  balls with the signature of footballers, shirts, boots and accessories, pens and pen-stands could also reinforce the citys reputation as the football capital of the country.																								Nor has any serious attempt been made to set up a football museum in the city. With over-a-century-old Mohun Bagan club and East Bengal in its 80s, there are enough memorabilia, photographs, literature, video clips, accessories and anecdotes to be culled for different galleries in the museum. 																								There could also be a record room to revive the memory of East Bengal drubbing BCCI Railway XI by 11 goals to nil in the Rovers Cup of 1945  the record for the highest number of goals scored in a first class tournament; or the feat of the Anglo-Burmese centre forward, Pagsley, scoring eight goals in a single match  the record for the highest number of goals scored by an individual; or the phenomenal victory of Mohun Bagans barefoot footballers against a British side way back in 1911.																								There is a churning in Indian football, with the big nine clubs forming the IPFA (Indian Premier Football Association). And while the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is reported to be negotiating with Zee for exclusive television rights, another channel, Sony, appears to be interested in a tie-up with IPFA. 																								The Indian under-17 team is expected to play in the world championship in Japan later this year and more flood-lit matches are being planned to attract sponsors and television viewers. 																								This, therefore, appears to be just the right time to take a long, hard look at football in Calcutta and revive the worlds most popular spectator sport.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Bank officers named in flat break-in case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Gouri Shankar Arya, tenant of a flat at New Alipore, has named Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) as respondent in a case filed before the additional chief judicial magistrate of Alipore court. 																								Arya has charged executives of an HSBC branch, located in the same building as his, of having forcefully entered his area, tapping his electricity meter and damaging a portion of his flat by making an illegal construction.																								The petitioner has further alleged that he was not in his flat when branch manager Clement Philip, in connivance with the owners of the building, Pawan Kumar Arya and Babulal Arya, had tampered with his meter by breaking into the garage of the building hired by him.																								Arya claimed he had received electric bills varying between Rs 4,600 and Rs 6,100 for power consumption between August 2002 and November 2002 though he was out of Calcutta during that period. The CESC, Arya added, has asked for Rs 10,000 for a new connection. 																								His list of HSBC respondents in the case include Brampton Mundy, head of the banks eastern region, Ashish Srivastav, head of the banks human resources wing, Yentem Lama, manager, banking services, and Kaushik Sen, estate officer.																								When contacted, Tamal Mukherjee, counsel for the respondents, said: The accused have all obtained bail in the normal course. The original petition will be heard at a later stage. 																								The owners of the building, too, have filed a petition surrendering before the court and have been granted bail. The matter comes up for hearing soon. Two-wheeler thief: Jahangir  Mollah, in his mid-20s, was arrested from BB Ganguly Street  on Tuesday evening. He was carrying a loaded revolver when  the cops rounded him up. Mollah, police said, was the mastermind  of a gang of criminals involved in stealing motorcycles. 																								The gang would smuggle out the two-wheelers to Bangladesh, where they would be sold. On interrogation, Mollah revealed the names and whereabouts of two accomplices. They were subsequently arrested.

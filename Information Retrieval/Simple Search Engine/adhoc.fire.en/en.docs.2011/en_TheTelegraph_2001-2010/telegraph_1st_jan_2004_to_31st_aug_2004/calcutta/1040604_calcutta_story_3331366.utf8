 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 The bigger, broader picture
 With CAS in cold storage, the way out of the cable chaos is some regulation. Subhajit Banerjee says self-checks by operators and a mindset change among consumers could do the trickViewers Choice: All they want is everything The polls ARE over, and with a new government at the Centre, any immediate chance of conditional access system (CAS) being revived and implemented seems remote.																								With state governments also preferring to look the other way as far as regulation is concerned, conflicts and turmoil continue to plague the cable industry, particularly the local one.THE PROBLEMS																								Carry on, with around 60,000 households in different parts of the city under multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCables Calcom network continuing to go without over 20 channels of the STAR and Sony bouquets. The reason, according to RPG Netcom (the city distributor for the bouquets, which switched off the channels) is non submission of subscriber listing report (SLR)  containing the number of operators and connections  by Calcom. Untrue, cries Calcom, which feels the real reason is pressure tactics for a revamp and do-as-I-please by RPG Netcom, with the report clamour only an eyewash.																								Whatever the reason, the fact remains that over 60,000 homes are unable to avail of a service for which (hopefully) all of them make monthly payments. Due to the non-availability of the channels, not one of the cable operators would settle for less.																								In case of the ongoing Calcom battle, endless rounds of meetings among operators, MSOs and broadcasters failed to bring out a solution. Several other and older issues were raked up. A section of operators demanded that RPG Netcom give up its distributorship, since, according to them, the number of conflicts rose after the MSO turned distributor.																								RPG Netcom, however, maintains that distributorship has nothing to do with the issue, and it is essential to conduct business with everyone on a single platform. Among the MSOs, only SitiCable has not been submitting the SLR traditionally, something that RPG Netcom feels must change now. It is also one of the steps towards regulating the industry.																								A larger switchoff in protest and solidarity on other MSO networks was narrowly averted on Tuesday. A sudden prevailing of good sense wasnt the cause, instead, it was lack of organisation and ego hassles that ruined this revolution.THE WAY OUT																								Is certainly regulation. Something like CAS, that the last government initiated but made a complete mess of in the end and had to shelve for what now seems like forever. Lately, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the government appointed central regulatory body for telecom, has stepped into the cable scene, but only as a consultant.																								The mantra for a way out, therefore, must be self-regulation. The market has reached a situation where the MSO is not making money, broadcasters are not getting as much as they should, and operators are complaining that they are being squeezed dry, feels Zee Television president Sunil Khanna, who was in town last Sunday for the city finals of Zees Indias Best Cinestars Ki Khoj. 																								And since we dont know when CAS will finally come in, the only way out is self-regulation, Khanna adds. Some operators in Delhi and Mumbai have already started taking steps towards this.																								But it cannot happen overnight and without opposition. Let alone opposition from operators, MSOs and broadcasters, regulation would also mean the viewer having to shell out more for expensive media content, which most of us are still not ready to. Lets analyse the opposition in more detail.																								Under-declaration is a phenomenon that exists across the country and Calcutta is no exception. Some cable operators pay the broadcaster less than one-fourth of what they collect in subscriptions. Regulation and any means of addressability would hit them hard. Broadcasters too, arent too hot on regulation. Channels are mostly sold in packages or bouquets now, where weaker channels are bundled with stronger ones. For instance, the STAR package contains the hugely popular Star Plus channel, but an operator must take a bouquet that also contains History Channel and Star Gold, which are not exactly on the right side of television ratings. 																								Viewers getting to choose and pay for only the channels they want would mean an end to the bundling by broadcasters, perhaps even jeopardising the prospects of some channels.																								But consumers must share the blame for the raw deal that they often get. Mega-serials, exclusive live sporting action, and blockbuster movie premieres cost a lot of money in production. Internationally, cable television is expensive. In Germany, for instance, monthly subscription for 30 channels is 30 Euros or around Rs 1,400. Monthly cable rates in and around Calcutta, on the other hand, vary from Rs 90 to Rs 250. The mindset of the consumer must change to include the concept of paying more for quality content.THE FUTURE																								Looks a little bleak for both the industry players and the consumers, unless mindsets change and regulation is introduced.																								Conflicts will continue. More switchoffs cannot be ruled out either. One can only hope all those involved set aside vested interests and try to look at a bigger and broader picture, and move towards a structured setup.

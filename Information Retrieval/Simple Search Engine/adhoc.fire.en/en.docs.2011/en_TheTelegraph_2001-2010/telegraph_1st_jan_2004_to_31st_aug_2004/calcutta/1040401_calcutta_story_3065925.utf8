 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Redress forum chief in dock
 																											- Proceedings okayed on charges of non-cooperation, duty evasion SUNANDO SARKAR																								The state consumer disputes redressal commission has initiated administrative proceedings against the president of its Howrah unit after receiving a complaint of non-cooperative behaviour and dereliction of duty against him.																								A full bench of the commission  the apex consumer court in the state  passed the order, unique in itself, against the judge last week and ordered the Howrah forum to address the grievances of the complainant.																								Forum president S.B. Muhuri, against whom the order was passed, claimed he was yet to be informed of the proceedings and charges. But I have heard something to the effect, he admitted on Wednesday. Muhuri also said he could guess why the complaint had been lodged. This is the result of my decision to uphold the norms of the court and refuse to accord anyone any special favour, he explained.																								According to the allegations lodged with the state commission, advocate N.R. Mukerje, representing a client, went to the Howrah consumer court on November 28 last year to inspect the records of a case. But the court had already retired for the day, though the time was around 12.15 pm, Mukerje alleged, forcing him to approach the clerk.																								The clerk, however, refused to show him the details and said the presidents permission was required. Mukerje says he expressed his willingness to seek permission but was told to return some other day, as the court had retired for the day.																								The advocate then tried to meet Muhuri in his chamber but was prevented from doing so.																								Mukerje went to the same court on March 17 this year and filed a petition for an information slip (containing details of the case). But the court, according to his allegations, sat for business only around 11.15 am. And it did not heed his plea, he added, prompting him to file the complaint with the state commission.																								The three-member state forum heard the complaint last week and ordered for a separate file (to deal with the matter) administratively. We shall call for a report from the president (of the Howrah consumer court), it decided, before directing him to provide Mukerje with the information slip.																								Muhuris account, however, differed. There was an advocate who came to meet me. I do not remember his name, but I told him not to enter my chamber as that could be perceived as being unfair and improper, he said.																								Information slips may not be available as easily in consumer courts as they are in a civil or criminal court, Muhuri said. Besides, I have to be in my chamber during office-hours to conduct administrative matters or consult with the other members of the court, he added, explaining his absence from court during office-hours.

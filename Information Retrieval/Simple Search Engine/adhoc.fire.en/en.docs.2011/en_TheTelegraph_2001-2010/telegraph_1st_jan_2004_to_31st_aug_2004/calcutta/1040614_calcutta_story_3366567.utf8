The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 PAN pains and late refunds
				 	 N.P. SENGUPTA, chief commissioner of income-tax (Calcutta), met readers of The Telegraph at his Ayakar Bhavan office to answer their queries. Participants included S.M. Chakraborty, Saileswar Chakraborty, Samir Bhattacharjee, K. Roychoudhury, Diptimoy Ghosh, Sailen Bhattacharya and Ranajit Basu				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Ranajit Basu: We faced a host of problems getting the Permanent Account Number (PAN) form this year. Apart from having to buy the form and the requisite stamp from the black market, we had to wait for hours to deposit it. Why dont you increase the number of counters to cope with the year-end rush?																																																			We do not look after the distribution of PAN forms or stamps since July 2003. The investor service (IS) cell of the Unit Trust of India (UTI) is entrusted with the process of distribution and collection of these forms. After receiving the applications, the UTI forwards the forms to us for assigning the PAN number. We register the PAN number against the application and send it back to the UTI. They contact the applicant to hand over the PAN card. As we do not interact with the applicants directly, we are not in a position to explain the long queues. As far as I know, there was a rush at the year-end but now, things are smoother.																																																									

Ranajit Basu: The Tatkal scheme for PAN has not started, though we are ready to pay a higher fee for it. 																																																			One should get a PAN number in 15 working days. But in reality, it takes a month to complete the process. If the case requires further inquiry, it may take another month. Then, it could be that a few agents and sub-agents entrusted with the job are not performing well, resulting in the delay. We opened a special cell for grievances related to PAN in the income-tax office. In case you face any difficulty getting the number, you may contact the grievance cell. 																																																											Regarding the Tatkal scheme, as I said earlier, the IS cell of the UTI is handling it and we have no role in the matter.																																																									

Samir Bhattacharjee: In case we apply for a PAN and file an income-tax return the same year, will there be a problem?																																																			You may face a problem if you file a return without a PAN. In case you have applied for one, enclose a photocopy of the application receipt as proof.																																																									

Diptimoy Ghosh: Is the outsourcing of some of your services resulting in a delay?																																																			No, the process does not affect the general tax-payer. We have just added external agencies to perform the non-core functioning of the department, like collecting the applications and distributing them. The main work of processing the applications is still done by our officers. As we are heading towards an electronic tax-paying solution, we are just extending our services through these agencies. The appointment of the agencies is decided entirely at the ministry level.																																																									

Saileswar Chakraborty: In case tax is not deducted at source for a salaried person, will this be considered as a fault of the companys?																																																			The company can be charged for failing to go by the norms of tax-collection and deducting it at source. However, there are some technical details on the nature of the company that can be discussed if a problem arises. 																																																									

Samir Bhattacharjee: I am running from pillar to post in your department to get my refunds. I find that some records are not updated properly. 																																																			I admit the problem exists. Actually, a large-scale restructuring is underway in our department. A few thousand files are pending. I had instructed my officers to complete the process by May 30. As most of them are working on a war footing, I expect that by June 30, the entire assessment record will be processed and the dues settled.																																																									

K. Roychoudhury: I am not getting my refund for a return submitted three years ago. 																																																			According to the guidelines laid by Central Board of Direct Taxes, one should get a refund within four months of filing the return. But in practice, we are not in a position to follow this strictly, as the volume of files is very large in our circle. Though we distribute the workload among our officers, each of them has to handle as many as 10,000 files, making it nearly impossible to maintain the stipulated deadline. However, returns filed till March 2004 have already been processed and cleared. 																																																									

Ranajit Basu: In case the total income of a person does not come under the lowest ceiling for paying income-tax, is he liable to pay any tax?																																																			Yes. If the income of a person does not cross the lower ceiling, but if he is a member of a premium club, has travelled abroad or owns a telephone or a car, he has to file a tax. We often advertise in the media to raise awareness among people to pay taxes. If any person fails to abide by this and the matter comes to our notice, he or she may be penalised for it. (Concluded)

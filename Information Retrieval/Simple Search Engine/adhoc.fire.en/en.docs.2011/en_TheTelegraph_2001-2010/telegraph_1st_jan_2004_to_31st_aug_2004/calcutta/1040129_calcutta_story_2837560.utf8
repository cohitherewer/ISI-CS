 Thursday, January 29, 2004  On a high
 CONTRIBUTED BY JANINE WYNNE-PETERS Anangsha (left)  and Debjani chill out with a selection from the coffee  and liqueur promotion at By The Way Pix by Rashbehari  Das  The next time a craving for caffeine  kicks in, you could give all the usual coffeeshops a miss  and head towards The Taj Bengal for some five-star satisfaction.  Thats because By The Way, the coffeeshop-cum-lounge on  the lobby-level of the hotel, encircled by shadowy palms  and with soft Arabian carpets is turning the spotlight on  some spirited brews.  With the bill of fare listing  some of the finest coffees and liqueurs in the world, its  all about giving in to the good things in life. The beans  being used for the various concoctions come from world-famous  coffee-makers Illy and along with these, a selection of  some of the finest blends from Jamaica, Nicaragua, Columbia  and Kenya have also been imported. Offering an even greater  high is the range of premium liqueurs available including  Kahlua, Benedictine, Tia Maria, the perennially-popular  Baileys Irish cream, Drambuie, Cointreau and Amaretto to  name a few.  If youre at a loss for what to  order, you could try the Caf Grande (a delicious blend  of espresso, chocolate and sweetened cream) with an aside  of Tia Maria, the Black Jack with Jamaican Blue Mountain  Coffee or the All-time Wonder brewed with Nicaraguan full-bodied  Robusta. Another great way to kick back and de-stress after  a hard days work is the Caf Charlemagne, delicious with  the zest of lemon reduced with mint and perfectly complemented  by a shot of crme de menthe. Then again, there are such  concoctions as Caf Calypso, Zorro and Pernod rounding off  the menu.  The coffee and liqueur promotion  will continue till the end of the month and enjoying the  treats here could set you back by anything between Rs 225  and Rs 325.

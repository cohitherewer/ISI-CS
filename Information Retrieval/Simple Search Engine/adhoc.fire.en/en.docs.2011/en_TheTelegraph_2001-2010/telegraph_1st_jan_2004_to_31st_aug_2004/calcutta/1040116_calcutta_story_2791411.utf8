The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Transporter threat to block court
 A STAFF REPORTER																								When the Supreme Court had directed the transport operators of Delhi to convert to compressed natural gas (CNG) four years ago, the operators lobby had tried to take the fight to court by laying siege with their vehicles. The show of protest had come a cropper, as the court stuck to its clean-air stand.																								Now, transport operators in Calcutta are planning to do a Delhi by dumping their vehicles at the Calcutta High Court door to force it to roll back its decision to enforce Bharat Stage II norms by April.																								We have to take all buses, minibuses and taxis off the road in April, following the high court order, as most of the vehicles do not meet the auto-emission standards and we do not have the money to replace the engines. So, we have decided to park our vehicles near the high court, said Bengal Taxi Association president Bimal Guha.																								Madan Mitra, president of the Progressive Taximens Union, added: The vehicles will also be parked near Writers Buildings, the New Secretariat, Assembly House and Raj Bhavan.																								A formal announcement of the court gherao could come through during Fridays mahamichhil to be brought out by taxi operators, luxury and private taxi operators and owners of motor training schools.																								To press home their protest point over high taxes and police harassment, the operators plan to flood the streets with alternative and cleaner modes of transport  bullocks, horses and hand-pulled carts.																								The taxi operators have already called for an indefinite strike, beginning January 20. Bus and minibus operators will observe a days token strike on January 21.

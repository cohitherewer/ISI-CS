 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Arati Shaw, 23, was allegedly killed by her in-laws on Tuesday night in the Golabari police station area of Howrah. 																								Police have sent the body for post-mortem. Aratis brother-in-law Anil and mother-in-law Kamala were arrested on Tuesday night. Husband Rajkumar is absconding, according to Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of police, Howrah.																								Aratis brother and mother, who alleged that she used to be tortured physically and mentally by her in-laws, lodged a complaint with police on Tuesday. Brother Harishankar Shaw claimed Arati came to them in Liluah 20 days ago, to convey her in-laws demand for a hefty dowry.																								Neighbours chanced upon Arati in flames in her bedroom at the 10, Rosemary Lane house. By the time they could break open the door, she was dead.																								They told police that Arati was subjected to severe beatings quite regularly. There were times when they had tried to intervene, but the Shaws would have none of it.																								Aratis mother Asha said her daughter had a son, three years old, and was pregnant for the second time. That did not stop her in-laws from killing her, Asha lamented. Morgue officials confirmed that Arati had received 70 per cent burns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, June 16, 2004  Calcutta Column

	Till the sixties, most cinema halls in and around Chowringhee, like Metro, Lighthouse, New Empire, Globe and Elite, were well-maintained. It was a pleasure to watch old English classics at these cinemas. This was true for even Paradise, Orient, Roxy and Hind, which generally showed Hindi movies only. The situation has changed in many of these halls now. Seats are broken and the halls are infested with bugs, cockroaches and mice. Owners must put in efforts to maintain the halls in good condition and give the movie-goer his moneys worth.

	The fare slabs in Metro Railway have not been fixed according to the distance travelled. Instead, it is based on the number of Metro stations that fall on the way. Since the distances between any two pairs of stations definitely vary, it is unfair to charge the same fare in both cases. There should be more price slabs for the convenience of those who regularly travel short distances in Metro.

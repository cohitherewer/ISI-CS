 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Bridging the cultural divide
Creativity knows no barriers; it breaks all rules to bridge the divide between countries, people and cultures. This is precisely the thought behind Between, an art exhibition by the Thai students of Kala Bhavan, Visva Bharati. Sponsored by the Royal Thai Consulate-General, Calcutta, the show portrays how their art has been influenced by their exposure to Indian culture. Depicting mostly religious themes that are common to both Thailand and India, the use of rich colours and warm textures in all the works bear testimony to the Indian influence. The show includes art works in various media, like sculpture, print making, ceramics, textile designing and painting, that have been created by these 12 young artists during their stay at Visva Bharati.																								Event: An exhibition of paintings amp; sculptures by the Thai students of Kala Bhavan, Visva Bharati																								When: Till May 18; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

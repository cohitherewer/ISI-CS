They have recently launched a new range of womens wear in natural fabrics, called Only Cottons.The New Alipore store used to stock a limited number of garments before. Now, a 700 sq ft area has been devoted to the line designed by proprietor Vineeta Gupta, who is also supplying to Shoppers Stop.Salwar kurtas and kurtis are the focus, in six different looks. An amazing variety of cottons has been used for the collection, including handloom cotton, khadi, kota, mangalgiri, tussar and dupion. Patch It Up, the printed look, has patches of prints stitched on to solid colours. Flower Shower has embroidered floral motifs in bold colours. Tuck Ins constitutes pintucks combined with hand-painted beads. Tie-and-dye has been used for a cool, summery look in the Waves collection while kantha work is the idea behind Running Lines.Perfect for office wear and evenings out in summers, the outfits can also be teamed with bags fashioned out of water hyacinth, cane, straw and chataai and ceramic jewellery.Kurtis begin from Rs 295, going up to Rs 850, while salwar-kurta sets range between Rs 750 and Rs 2,750.Light delightsThe shared culinary tradition of the Mediterranean region was the theme at Conclave last week. The Stallion, its continental restaurant at the corporate club brought a taste of southern European cuisine to Calcutta.Wines and herbs are central to Greek, Spanish, French and Italian cuisine and though they may taste a little bland, health wise, they make for a sensible deal, explained executive chef Narayan Chatterjee, who was previously attached with the Taj Bengal and Oberoi Grand.Robust and clear flavours were the toast of the festival, unfettered by complicated sauces and cream or butter. While a live pasta counter had vegetarians scurrying to sample Gnochhi, eggless pasta made of potato with different vegetables and sauces, a dinner buffet had nine items on the main course, with three choices of soup. The chicken steak, Fish Nicoise, Aubergine Zorba and French Onion Soup were the hottest draws. Zucchini, a Greek dessert, also found many takers.We usually hold food festivals once a month to bring the rarest culinary styles to the city, said Rajkumar Fenn, senior general manager. A Portuguese buffet is being planned next. Dokra figurines at Aavishkar.

Lee Alison Sibley at the talk. Picture by Rashbehari Das  Juggling rolesTeetotaller Lee Alison Sibley doesnt mind playing designated driver to US consul-general George, her husband, on Saturday nights. But entrenched in patriarchal values, educationist and fashion designer Heena Gorsia cant enjoy a drink without guilt pangs.While Indira Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto, Begum Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina and Margaret Thatcher may be modern-day role models, the humble housewife or the average urban working woman is still struggling to prove her versatility. That was the drift of the panel discussion at Rotary Sadan on Monday titled Versatility, thy name is woman.The meet saw Lee and Heena share the dais with sportswoman and director of Selvel Prochy Mehta, professor of English and president, Alliance Francaise, Sudeshna Chakraborty and mediator Kishore Bhimani. The panelists agreed that in modern times, women cant help but be versatile jugglers, with the multiple roles they have chosen to play as breadwinner and homemaker.What lent a twist to the discussion was the real-life versatility displayed by the women on the panel. For Heena, versatility is when shes struggling to direct her maid and cook, pack her kids off to school, all the while keeping up with a 16-hour work shift. Despite such hardships, the dictates of the patriarchal society dont allow her to enjoy a drink at a party without feeling guilty.Women who drink in public are looked down upon in our society, she stressed. Lee, who comes from a very different society, plays designated driver every Saturday night because her husband drinks. But she still has to play the versatility game back home. Every working woman in the US has to come home from work, scrub toilets, cook, do the laundry and just about everything, as domestic help is just unaffordable, she rued.Things came out of the kitchen cabinet when the moderator threw in a teaser, saying that in the first world there has not been too many women rulers. Lee was quick to interject: In Indira Gandhis time she was the only man in her government! Women, she stressed, when in power, have to fight so much to assert their authority that they end up wearing the pants more than the men.Sudeshna seconded her views, with Benazir Bhutto, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasinas examples, who were criticised by the feminists in their own country for downplaying the cause of women. But they stood their ground as they didnt want to come across as just women rulers, but as politicians in their own right. Italian aromaA new perfume from the Dolce amp; Gabbana stable is now available. The musky floral bouquet with a trace of vanilla is called Sicily and can be found at Shoppers Stop. The scent also comes as shower gel and body lotion. The perfume for the passionate woman has Italian actress Monica Bellucci as its face.SOMA BANERJEE AND SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

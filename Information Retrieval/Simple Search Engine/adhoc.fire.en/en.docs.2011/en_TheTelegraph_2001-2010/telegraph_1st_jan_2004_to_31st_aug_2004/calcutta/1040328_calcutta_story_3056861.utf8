 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Servant of 12 yrs cleans off employers house
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Sangrajka family in Nafar Kundu Lane never had a complain against young Uday Rai in all the 12 years of his service. But on March 1, finding himself alone in the house, the youth opened a cupboard with a duplicate key and made off with jewellery and cash. 																								Pieces of the tale of betrayal fell in place as the first round of the arrested servants interrogation came to an end on Saturday.																								He confessed to having robbed his employers of jewellery worth about Rs 6 lakh and Rs 1.47 lakh in cash from their Bhowanipore residence. 																								Yet such was his employer Ajit Sangrajkas faith in him that for two days after the theft he did not lodge a complaint against Rai. It was only on March 3 that he reluctantly reached the Bhowanipore police station.																								The trail led the police to Bihar. Three days of joint raids with the Bihar Police in Rais native village Himmatpur went in vain, investigating officer S.S. Roy said. 																								On March 18, the police were tipped-off that Rai was in Patna. He was picked up on Wednesday when he was preparing to sell off a portion of the booty. We recovered about 60 per cent of the jewellery from him. The local bank account where he had deposited the money has been frozen. During interrogation, Rai has revealed that the remaining jewellery is with his brother-in-law in Patna, who is absconding, said Roy.																								Rai was produced in court on Thursday and remanded in police custody till April 2. Rai has stated that he was instigated into the theft by his brother-in-law, an officer of the Bhowanipore police station said.

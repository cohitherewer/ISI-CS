 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 A journey through life
																								It is indeed sad when people with vested interests disrupt the communal harmony of society. But what saves the day for simple, peace-loving people against such mischievous doings is their honest and courageous response to the situation. This is the theme of Jion Pala, a play that celebrates the victory of human values like tolerance and forbearance over social vices like bigotry and prejudice. It tells us of the crusade of a Muslim woman, Amina, who, due to the demands of her circumstances, assumes a Hindu identity. Breaking free from the shackles of a life lived in ignominy, she begins her quest for a life of freedom and honour. However, she has to contend against forces much stronger than herself that threaten to upset her dreams for a better future. In the end, her solitary saga becomes a concerted effort by the whole community, with whose support she can once again embark on her journey towards a meaningful existence.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Jion Pala, produced by Gobardanga Naksha																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bharatiyam, IB-201, Salt Lake

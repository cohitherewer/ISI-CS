																																																																																		Union health minister Sushma Swaraj on Monday unveiled the Vande Mataram Scheme (VMS) in the city. Under the scheme, all pregnant women will be given a free health check-up, medicines and treatment on the 9th of every month. On the eve of the inauguration of VMS at the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre in Calcutta, Swaraj said all hospitals had been asked to implement the scheme and ensure that pregnant women, especially from the poorer sections of society, could get free medicines. The VMS scheme was launched by the Centre to counter the increasing mortality rate of pregnant women around the country. A District Household Survey conducted a few years ago had revealed that 33 per cent of the countrys pregnant women did not have access to ante-natal check-up.

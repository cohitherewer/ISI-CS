The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Mass transit in cold storage
				 	 DHIMAN MUKHERJEE, managing director of the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC), met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included G.G. Bhattacharya, Manas Ghosh, G. Laha, Diptimoy Ghosh, Arun Hazra and Nikhilesh Chatterjee				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Nikhilesh Chatterjee: Can you elaborate on the monorail and other forms of mass rapid transit systems on the anvil? 																																																			Roadspace is abysmally low here for the number of vehicles. Only six per cent of the citys total area is reserved for vehicles. The mass rapid transit system proposals were submitted to us by some foreign companies. But, frankly speaking, we are yet to give them any serious thought. Actually, we had checked all those projects but they do not match our commercial viability standards. So, as of now, there are no plans to initiate any of the projects. Some of the schemes were hyped up by a section of the media. They were not even discussed seriously for planning or execution.																																																									

Diptimoy Ghosh: What do you propose to do with the underpass you are building at Dum Dum railway station?																																																			The station and its platforms are the property of the central government, but its immediate outskirts belong to the state government. It is our responsibility to make the station accessible. We are setting up a passenger dispersal system at Dum Dum, which will include provisions for moving platforms to ease the congestion. We are consulting our traffic engineering cell on how to tackle the problem of the heavy traffic on the spot. Moreover, we have to take into account the autorickshaw stand and the market. We have chalked out a blueprint and will soon start remodelling the area adjacent to the station.																																																									

G. Laha: What about the river traffic system that we heard was taking shape in Bengal?																																																			We have constructed some jetties in South 24 Parganas but no other infrastructure related to the river highway. Fortunately, the Centre has selected us for making the first national waterway. It will be between Triveni and Farakka, and we have received all of the Rs 24 crore earmarked for it. The state government is providing Rs 2 crore for the project. Altogether, 54 jetties will be constructed on this stretch so that large vessels, carrying goods and passengers, can ply on the route. The jetties will serve as disembarkation points.																																																									

Diptimoy Ghosh: We often see overloaded trucks plying in the city and damaging the roads. 																																																			Actually, were fed up with the damage to the roads caused by these trucks. The core of the problem lies with a section of corrupt inspectors of the motor vehicles department who monitor the carriage capacity of the trucks. Suppose a truck is carrying 10 tonnes above the specified carriage limit. The officer enters into a deal with the truck-driver and lets his vehicle enter the city. The government, too, is losing revenue because of this.																																																											Now, we are connecting the weighbridges with the regional transport offices. Once a goods vehicle is weighed, the reading is simultaneously displayed in the office of regional transport officer, who then checks the weight with the cash collection. This will check corruption. 																																																									

Arun Hazra : The infrastructure you are building will need to be maintained well.																																																			Generally, we handle the maintenance of our projects. In build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, too, there is a legal provision for takeover in case of improper upkeep. There is also a penalty clause for the private parties who, after the BOT process, fail to maintain the asset. 																																																											(Concluded)

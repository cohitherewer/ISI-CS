The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, March 13, 2004 Communist casualty in barge block 
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Bengals communists, unwittingly perhaps, have ended up blocking cargo to communist China in their efforts to arm-twist the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation (CIWTC) into allegedly paying contractors labourers more than they deserve.																								A 10,000-metric-tonne shipment of fly-ash bound for China, valued at over Rs 60 lakh, is now among the other multi-crore cargo waiting for the CPMs labour arm  the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu)  to see reason.																								The consignment to China, say officials, is much more valuable than its worth in money. Central to the drama is the transport corporations perceived inability to honour its commitment made to international agencies, they explain.																								The CIWTC is not a subsidised undertaking and we have to earn our keep, a senior official told Metro on Friday. We have not been getting our salary for the past three months and this Citu blockade seems to have done enough to force us to go without salaries for the next couple of months as well, he added.																								The Rs 60-lakh shipment was supposed to have sailed for Haldia, on its way to China, a few weeks ago. Repeated failures to honour our commitment do not send out the right signal, said a CIWTC official.																								But it is not the shipment to China that is the only sufferer because of the Citu shenanigans. There are other perishable goods, worth crores of rupees, lying on board.																								For instance, two shipments of wheat (on DB Vogabati and DB Pranati)  each worth around Rs 30 lakh  have been locked in by the Citu blockade. Both were destined for Pandu, in Assam, and were supposed to have used the rivers of Bangladesh.																								Even if the barges set sail this moment, much of the stock will have fungus growth (because of the absorption of moisture) before it reaches its destination, complained an official. How do we explain the loss?																								DB Rapti is not the only one with a fly-ash consignment. Another barge, DB Bulan, is awaiting a green signal from Citu to take a similar consignment (worth around Rs 50 lakh) to Mangala, in Bangladesh.																								Again, absorption of moisture may lead to the solidification of the fly-ash, rendering it unfit for use in cement factories. Altogether, fly-ash worth around Rs 9 crore is  either aboard or in godowns close to the water  suffering this fate, said officials.																								Citu, however, showed no sign of relenting. It is demanding that the CIWTC pay 300 workers owing allegiance to the union even for the days they have not lifted a single kg of goods.																								First, they are men belonging to individual contractors and we, therefore, should not come into the picture at all, a CIWTC official said. Second, why should we pay them for the days when there was no work? he demanded.																								A police officer provided the answer. The union collects about Rs 600 every month from the labourers (at Rs 20 a day). If they (the labourers) are not paid, how does the union get its loot? he asked.																								CIWTC Contractors Workmens Union spokesperson Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, however, insisted that workers were being denied their rightful due.																								You should ask the CIWTC why it is not paying its workers regularly, he said, refusing to take into account the fact that the labourers were not employed by the CIWTC.

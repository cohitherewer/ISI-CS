 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Eros redefined
																								Erotic art is a pervasive phenomenon the world over and though not entirely free from stigma, has come to be an accepted idea in India as well. Laxma Gouds collection of the two-dozen odd etchings presently on show, marks an effort to redefine eroticism in a manner whose effect can best be described as magnetic. What fascinates the viewer about his drawings is their utter rawness and direct appeal, which appear almost primitive and animalistic. Gouds treatment of his subject is, on the contrary, quite complex and artistically intricate. A unique style allows him to shape forms in harmony with an artists extraordinary vision. Beneath the exterior grimness of his works, one can also discern a subtle but palpable wit, revealing a conscious and ingenious play of fantasy. The artists rudely obsessive Ananga is not muted by art, but deepened by it.																								Event: Drawings and etchings																								When: Till August 15 (except Monday)																								Where: Akar Prakar, P-238 Hindustan Park

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Harness power, cut pollution
S.P. Ganchaudhuri				 	 S.P. Ganchaudhuri, director, West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA) and special secretary, power department, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Sanjana Basu, Subhasis Chakraborty, G. Laha, P.N. Dasgupta, Angshuman Majumder, D. Ghosh Choudhury, A.Sen, Debashree Chakrabarty and S. Mondal				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Sanjana Basu: Does renewable energy mean solar energy only? Where do we get the gadgets to harness this energy?																																																			Strictly speaking, renewable energy includes all sources of pollution-free energy that can be renewed, like solar energy, wind energy, bio-mass energy and gases from animal dung. To generate solar energy for household use, you need a few gadgets that are easily available. The WBREDA has set up shops in several parts of the state to sell these gadgets. If you fail to locate one, you can call our office and well direct you to the nearest centre approved by us. If you want gadgets for large-scale use, we can direct you to our approved manufacturers. Soon, we will post all the information on our website and you can browse through it to meet your need.																																																									

Subhasis Chakraborty: Apart from electricity, what other benefit can be availed of from solar energy?																																																			The government has drawn up an excellent policy to boost the use of renewable energy. The announcement cannot be made immediately because it is a populist policy and will violate the election code of conduct. The incentive is that solar energy helps reduce pollution. 																																																									

G. Laha: What is the success rate in using these forms of energy in the rural areas?																																																			In villages, the use of solar energy is rising by 40 per cent. The main reason is that fuel such as kerosene that the villagers used earlier has become costlier, in comparison to the solar lamps. Apart from the economy, solar lamps also emit brighter light and can be used without problems in rain or storm. The only hitch is the storage battery, which is a pollutant after it is exhausted. But, at the same time, one such battery lasts for six to seven years. We are planning to introduce a system jointly with the pollution control board to recycle these batteries. If this system can be effectively put in place, it will bring about a revolution in renewable power generation in the urban and rural areas. 																																																									

P.N. Dasgupta: We often read in newspapers about power being generated from garbage. How is this possible? 																																																			We can use garbage in several ways. We can produce bio-gas from the bio-degradable portion of garbage and can produce methane from it, too. We can heat the non-bio-degradable portion of the garbage to get steam out of it, that can operate micro-turbines to generate electricity. We do not have such turbines in our country. However, within a couple of months we will be getting such a turbine here in Calcutta. This will be the first micro-turbine of its kind which will be operational in the city. 																																																											Such power can be used in two ways. First, such a unit can be installed in any house as a standalone unit. The entire operation of the unit will be conducted by the user. 																																																											In the other case, arrangements can be made for community-based power generation. Though solar generators are ideal for individuals, micro-turbines operated on methane or natural gas cannot be run individually. As the capital cost and operating cost is higher, such projects are ideal for a cluster of residences in the city or for a number of houses in a village.

Now, vying for a piece of the health-freak pie, so far hogged by Amorettos, is Enerzy Freshness Caf. Hello, can I get you a papaya-honey cooler? is what a cheerful voice will greet you with at the recently-opened bar on the fifth floor of the Elgin Road mall.The choices at Enerzy range from the basic sweet lime, orange, pomegranate and strawberry to the more unconventional beetroot, spinach and black currant. The menu includes fruit cocktails, fizzies, smoothies, Enerzy Tea Tails, boosts, and snacks.Try your luck battling ailments with some of these potions: the Liver Cleanser is a combo of carrot, apple and beetroot, while the Skin Cleanser blends carrot, beetroot, spinach and apple. Vibrant C, made of freshly squeezed orange juice, guava, pineapple and honey is a potent dose of Vitamin C, known to drive away colds.For those in search of fizz, there is Pink Berry Bang, an electric concoction of mixed fruit juice, ginger juice and strawberry or Purple Rain, a mix of grape, blackberry crush, vanilla and chocolate, and Spicy Fruit Smasher, which is guava, mango and pineapple juice spiked with spices. The fruit smoothies  in guava and mango, black currant and apple, coconut and mixed fruit  are soothing options.Tea drinking is encouraged at Enerzy, but with a difference. Tea Tails will tickle your tastebuds. The Energizer Hot Tea (tea liqueur flavoured with apple and strawberry) and Choco Tea (strong tea liqueur with lichi, vanilla and chocolate) are at hand for the adventurous, and can be topped off with juices and vanilla ice cream.If you feel flat without coffee, try out a different kick for once  a small shot of Wheatgrass is billed to boost immunity and energy.Prices range from Rs 10 for an energy boost to Rs 59 for strawberry juice.

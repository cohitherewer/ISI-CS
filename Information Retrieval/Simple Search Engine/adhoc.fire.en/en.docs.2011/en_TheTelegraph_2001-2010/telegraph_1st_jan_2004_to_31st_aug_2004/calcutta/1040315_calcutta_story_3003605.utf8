The newly-installed network of Calcutta Telephones ensures hassle-free STD and ISD facilities for customers. Pictures by Kishore Roy ChowdhuryAnirban Roy: We have heard of the intelligent network system that has recently been installed in Calcutta Telephones. Please explain how it works.																																																													When you use an India Telephone Card (ITC) in a normal landline, you can avail of both STD and ISD even if your phone does not have the facilities. Earlier, our network suffered some hiccups when STD and ISD calls were routed through normal landlines. But now, when a call is routed through our specialised, 10-digit number of the ITC card, our newly-opened intelligent network switching system identifies it and directs it accordingly, though the basic telephone may not have these facilities. The new network will help you make calls faster and without hitches.

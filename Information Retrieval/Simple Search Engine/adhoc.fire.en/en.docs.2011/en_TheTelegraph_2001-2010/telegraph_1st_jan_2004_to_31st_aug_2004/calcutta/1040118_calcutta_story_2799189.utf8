 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Tuscany eyes state leather pie
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tuscan minister for industry and handicrafts Ambrogio Brenna expressed interest in furthering ties with Bengals leather industry on Saturday.																								His statement followed a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings. Brenna and members of the Italian delegation visiting the city had also visited the Calcutta Leather Complex at Bantala on Friday.																								A team from Tuscany with expertise in the gems and jewellery and food-processing sector is to visit Bengal soon, announced Bhattacharjee after the meeting which was also attended by Italian consul-general Agostino Pinna.																								We think the Calcutta Leather Complex is a good point to start more exchanges, said Brenna. The fashion sector includes not just clothing, but also suitcases, handbags and other leather products, and the visit is hopefully the first step towards a long-standing relationship, the minister added. 																								The leather complex would be an ideal place for technological exchange and there could be tie-ups for technical assistance and trade of products made at Bantala, Brenna said. State director of industries Malay De and officials of M.L. Dalmiya and Company had showed the team around the 1,100-acre leather complex at Bantala.																								The quality of products and technicians in Bengal are appreciated, said the Italian minister, adding that it was a very important visit which established a number of possible areas of collaboration, with the leather industry at the focus of business-to-business or district-to-district alliances.																								The Italian delegation, including director of Toscana Promozione (Economic Promotion Agency of Tuscany) Mauro Ginanneschi, president of Ceseca Shoe Industry Service Centre Giovanni Cordoni and Toscana Promozione official Marta Javarone, also discussed collaborations in the jewellery, textile, handicraft and food-processing sectors.																								The two-day visit ended on Saturday.

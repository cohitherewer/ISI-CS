 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Cellphonetheft with chilli in the eye
 A STAFF REPORTERThrowing red chilli powder to momentarily blind and disorientate a shop-owner, one of two young men on a motorcycle escaped with some expensive cellphones in the Phoolbagan police station area, opposite VIP Market, at 2 pm on Tuesday. 																								One of the duo, Manoj Sharma, a resident of Bihars Purnea, was nabbed by a police patrol that was in the neighbourhood. The other young man fled with the booty.																								Ashish Agarwal, the shop-owner, was alone when the motorcycle stopped outside. While Sharma remained on the two-wheeler, leaving the engine running, his accomplice entered the shop. Agarwal greeted the youth, mistaking him for a prospective customer. 																								When the youth suddenly flung a fistful of red chilli powder into the shop-owners eyes, he realised this was no customer at all. Unable to react for a few moments, Agarwal squirmed in agony, while the youth helped himself to six or seven expensive mobile phone sets and Rs 3,000 in cash from the till. 																								The shop-owner, unable to bear the pain any longer, started screaming for help, just as the youth walked out of the shop.																								An assistant sub-inspector of police and a constable on patrol duty were drinking tea at a nearby stall. Hearing Agarwals screams, constable Lakshmikanta Mitra, in his mid-forties, leapt at Sharma.																								The two-wheeler fell on its side, pinning Sharma to the ground. As the policeman pounced on the goon, the pillion-rider, who was carrying the booty, sprinted off to safety. 																								During interrogation, Sharma revealed that he and his accomplice were residents of Purnea and had put up in a lodge at 165, Mahatma Gandhi Road. A revolver was found on Sharma, said an officer of Phoolbagan police station. A hunt is on for the accomplice.

 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Teacher in salary freeze sequel
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A court order for each months salary. That, it seems, is what Pranab Sengupta will need to get his meagre schoolteachers due.																								The mastermoshai at Basak Bagan Primary School  paid Rs 21.75 as a monthly salary for over 31 years  had won a 12-year legal battle in June when, following a Calcutta High Court prod, the district primary school council finally handed him a pay cheque for Rs 8,390.																								On Thursday, he was back in courtroom no. 7 for his June salary and recognition as a permanent teacher of the government-run school.																								Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta issued a directive freezing district primary school council chairman Biswnath Roy Chowdhurys salary till further notice.																								Senguptas lawyer Saibalendu Bhowmick claimed his client was yet to receive his cheque for June. It doesnt feel right returning to you every month. Last month, after you intervened, my client received his salary. But this month, it has stopped again, said Bhowmick.																								The council was under the impression that the court had cleared Senguptas salary just for the month of May. We probably got it wrong, was the defence lawyers reasoning.																								On May 22, the high court had stopped Roy Chowdhurys salary only till Senguptas was disbursed. This time, the judge took more stringent measures. Even if mastermoshais June dues are cleared, Roy Chowdhury will have to wait his turn till the court gives the go-ahead.																								The council has been given six days to get its act together and pay up. On Wednesday, when the court session begins, the case will be the first to come up for hearing. The poor mans paycheque has been prioritised, in court at least.																								Justice Sengupta did not take the councils line of defence lightly. You mean to say the court ordered only a months salary? Do I need to pass an order every month? he thundered. The court asked the council to pay Senguptas salary once again and to look into clearing his arrears.																								Sengupta started work at the Basak Bagan school in March 1973 as an assistant teacher. His post was not made permanent till May 2004, till which time, he had to be satisfied with his starting salary.																								While justice may now be on his side, the teacher from Patipukur seems perilously close to break point. Sengupta may have won the battle, begun way back in 1992, for the right to work with fair pay, he continues to wage the war for the respect he has been denied.																								I am still not sure how long this will continue. I just hope I can pull through, sighed the 56-year-old. Even after the courts intervention, I have to fight for my monthly pay cheque. And how much more time and money will I have to spend for the fight?

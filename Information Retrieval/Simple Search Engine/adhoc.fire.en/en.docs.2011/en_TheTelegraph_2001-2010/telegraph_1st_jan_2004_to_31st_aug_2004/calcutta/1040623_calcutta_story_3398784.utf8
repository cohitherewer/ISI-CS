 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Treading a blind lane
																								We live in a world that has an involuted sense of success and the ways to get there. So deep are the roots of materialism that the man within is smothered in its tentacles that gradually eat into his system and annihilate the last vestiges of humanity in him. The language best understood by todays milieu is that of money and the means to get there may well be unscrupulous and amoral. Meghnad Bhattacharyas Andha Gali is a play that deals with this unquenchable thirst for money and its manifestations on the lives that are forced to live under the burden of this sinful indulgence. As age-old values are shamefully disregarded to make way for a mechanical life that revolves around profits and losses, natural relations are sacrificed at the altar of greed and malice to make way for a distorted system of values that have no regard for either propriety or morality. Andha Gali explores the possibility of a detour from the blind lane that threatens to blind the psyche of a confounded man.																								Event: Play in Bengali, Andha Gali, produced by Sayak																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

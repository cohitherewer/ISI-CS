The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Big B back in Bangla
An angry old man? Yes. An army-man haunted by fear at home? Never. Think again. For Amitabh Bachchan has seldom looked so confused and scared, as he does in Ravi Shankars Hum Kaun Hain?, playing a family man grappling with a chain of eerie events at home.																								And there seems to be a Bengal connection between every line. For one, the double-version film has been made in Hindi and Bengali. It stars Dimple Kapadia as Mrs Bachchan (her second Bengali film after Mrinal Sens Antareen), Mousumi Chatterjee as the nanny, with special appearances by Dharmendra and Suhasini Mulay thrown in.																								Its a suspense thriller revolving around a Christian family consisting of a couple and two kids, a nanny, a cleaner and a gardener. On returning home after a long time, Amitji finds something amiss. Then, a chain of strange incidents happens at home and he is rattled But why dont you see the film to know the rest? asks Shankar.																								Though his first film Mulaqat (2002) with Jackie Shroff and Madhoo sank, Shankars second has already caused a ripple with a high-voltage cast and spooky promos. But Hum Kaun Hain? has got nothing to do with ghosts, clarifies the film-maker who has honed his skills by assisting Yash Chopra.																								The Big B has dubbed his dialogues in Bengali for Ora Kara? (two decades after Anushandhan) and the Bachchan baritone has even recited some Bengali poetry. 																								For the nannys role, quite a few actresses were in the fray. But the charm in her face clinched it for Mousumi, explains Shankar, who whisked his star cast away to Mahabaleshwar to shoot the outdoors. 																								The Bengal connection of Hum Kaun Hain? doesnt end with the dialogues (and the nanny). The editing is by Rabiranjan Moitra, while Dimples dialogues have been dubbed by Rupa Ganguly. It was very difficult to translate Dimples Hindi lines and re-do every sentence matching her lip movements. But Dimple liked it and I, too, am satisfied, said Rupa.																								Theres some more of Bengal. Calcutta boy Abhijit Lahiri plays the gardener and the producer (Soni Juneja) hails from your city as well, reveals Shankar.																								The Bengali version, Ora Kara?, releases this September at Priya, Globe and Mitra.						RESHMI SENGUPTA

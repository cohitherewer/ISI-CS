The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Shut out thieves, not visitors
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should public access to sites housing heritage artefacts be restricted to once a week? More letters will be published next week Trail of theft: Search for the missing Nobel at the Uttarayan complexNirmalya Biswas, 
																		Hridaypur																																																														Who should the authorities try to protect the mementos from  the common man or the robbers? They should not discourage the youth from knowing their cultural heritage. There are many who are ignorant about our glorious past. No wonder, the building on Sudder Street, where Rabindranath Tagore composed the poem Nirjharer Swapnobhongo, is being being turned into a hotel. This ignorance will only take deeper root if access to heritage sites is restricted. Instead, the authorities can charge a nominal amount from visitors for the upkeep of the countrys prized possessions.Diptimoy Ghosh, 
Salt Lake It is not possible for tourists to keep count of the days when a heritage site is closed to the public. The whole point of displaying artefacts at heritage sites is lost if visitors do not get to see them. During my visits to the Southeast Asian countries I found the museums and heritage sites open on all days. Closures attract the attention of burglars as in the case of the recent theft at Santiniketan which took place on a holiday.																																																														

Rimli Datta, 
																		Salt Lake 																																																														The proposal seems absolutely ridiculous. The public should not be deprived of regular access to sites housing heritage artefacts. The particular day of the week when the artefacts are on view may not be a holiday for all. The rule will also inconvenience visitors who would not be aware of the timings and affect our tourism industry. Heritage sites elsewhere are open through the week. If authorities are concerned about thefts, they should provide adequate security instead of making the common man suffer. 									

T.R. Anand, 
																		Budge Budge 																																																														Yes, public access to sites housing heritage artefacts should be restricted and stringent security checks need to be enforced to stop theft of historical assets. The Santiniketan episode should be a lesson for the authorities. Close-circuit cameras and metal detectors need to be in place in historical buildings. The government should issue circulars to heritage houses to follow prescribed security measures. Better late than never. 									

Tapan Pal,
																		BatanagarThe proposal is good, but with the dwindling footfall, how can such organisations generate funds for the maintenance of the sites? Furthermore, there will be a mad rush on the day entry is allowed. Perhaps, a minimum level of qualification may be made a criterion for entry at the sites. Not all visitors to a museum understand the worth of the artefacts. Heritage sites are not fairs on the Maidan. Arunava Dey,
Ganguly BaganThe proposal seems somewhat undemocratic. These days security is of paramount importance everywhere, but in a few cases it clashes with cultural issues. The very fact that foreign tourists in Calcutta have to pay higher entry charges to visit some of the heritage sites is disgraceful enough. It is a pity that the state cannot provide the minimum security to these sites. Pritha Sen, 
JadavpurIt is better to restrict access to the public if the authorities are unable to provide proper security during and after visiting hours. But entry should be restricted only on public holidays and on Sundays as these are the occasions when unruly crowds visit the sites. This will help the authorities to protect the artefacts. 									

Shiv Shanker Almal, 
																		Lower Rawdon Street 																																																														Letting visitors in once a week may overcrowd the site on that particular day. 									

Sounak Chakraborty,
																		Baranagar																																																														This will not be a successful plan. Tourists visit places with a set itinerary. So, if all tourist spots are open only for a day, it would reduce the number of places they can visit. 									

Tanmoy Das Lala, 
																		Salt LakeThere should be an increase in the number of securitymen and the authorities should ensure that they are competent enough to ward off hoodlums. At all the tourist spots of Calcutta, securitymen are like marble statues, inactive and even invisible. They keep themselves away from situations that test them physically or mentally. Curtailing the number of days the sites are accessible would put the tourism industry in trouble. Vivek Mukherjee
Address not givenOur museums and heritage sites should be open for more than just one day a week. Tourists coming from the world over should never be denied entry. Besides, nowadays people have a hectic schedule and it is only once in a while that they are able to go out with family and friends. Museums and heritage sites should also be seen as sources of recreation and should be made economically viable. Heritage sites are a vital source of revenue and create job opportunities. 									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Beleghata																																																														Restrictions may be imposed once a week and on other days, security should be strengthened to protect the heritage artefacts. 									

Sandhya Banerjee, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														Public access to heritage sites should not be restricted. If the sites are open to the public on weekdays as well then a part of the maintenance cost can be recovered from the entry fees. Guides can be employed for public assistance. Our children will be more conversant with the history of India and her culture through visits to such places.

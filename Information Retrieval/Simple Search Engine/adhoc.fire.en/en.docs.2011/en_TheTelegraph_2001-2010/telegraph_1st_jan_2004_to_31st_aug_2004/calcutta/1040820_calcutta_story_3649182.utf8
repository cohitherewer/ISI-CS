Sleuths probing the Saha family killings said on Thursday that Nabendus eldest son, Shibendu, had used strong doses of a sedative to drug his parents, brother, wife and elder son. Police had earlier thought that Shibendu had used mercury chloride to kill his family. The chemical test of the stomach contents of the victims revealed that the drink served to them after dinner was spiked with powdered sedative.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Subhas envisions Maidan in trade hub
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There is hope yet for the congested thoroughfares and bylanes of north and central Calcutta, but maybe not as much as the transport minister would have us believe.																								Subhas Chakraborty on Friday, in true characteristic hyperbole style, promised to turn Burrabazar into a Maidan.																								The key to the ministers decongestion drive lies in the four truck and two bus terminii being planned on the citys outskirts to reduce traffic load and regulate heavy vehicular movement in the citys trade hub.																								The terminii, claimed Chakraborty, would ease the crippling burden on Burrabazar and enable it to mirror the mood on the Maidan.																								The first terminus is slated to come up at Dakshineswar, near the new Vivekananda bridge, and the second on Delhi Road, near Serampore. The transport department is planning the third terminus at either Barasat or Rajarhat, while the fourth, catering to trucks carrying vegetables, will be near Basanti.																								An estimated 50,000 to 60,000 trucks enter the city every day, laden with fruits, vegetables and other perishable items and merchandise. At present, entry of heavy trucks is limited to between 8.30 pm and 8 am.																								Once the four termini move into gear, the heavy-vehicle count entering Calcutta should drop to around 8,000 or 10,000, the minister claimed.																								Earlier this week, one of the countrys largest truck terminals was inaugurated at Dhulagarh, off National Highway 6, by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The Rs 40-crore terminal for 7,000 trucks is a joint venture of the state government and Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation. This would help make the city off limits for thousands of trucks, the chief minister had asserted.																								Another truck terminal at Budge Budge is almost ready, Chakraborty said on Friday.																								The minister, however, played safe on the matter of relocating wholesale markets from the heart of the city. It is not possible to relocate the Sealdah market elsewhere because of its proximity to the railway station, he admitted.																								The minister also unveiled plans to decongest the Maidan by relocating the Central Bus Terminus from Esplanade. Some 1,600 short and long-distance buses converge on Shahid Minar every day, often clogging the central business district.

 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Fake textbook haul in three-day raid
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Enforcement Branch (EB) of Calcutta Police carried out raids in and around the city for three days and unearthed more than a lakh fake textbooks. 																								These were used in schools affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. Two persons were arrested but the kingpin is yet to be traced.																								According to H.P. Singh, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), 10,000 English texts of Class VII, 48,000 math texts of Classes IX and X and 25,000 history texts of Classes VI and VII were recovered from two printing presses. The books seized are worth over Rs 30 lakh. 																								Ten printing presses in and around Calcutta have been certified to print the textbooks by the Paschim Banga Madhyamik Parshad. Following a complaint by board secretary Swapan Bhattacharya a few days ago, about sub-standard and fake replicas of textbooks flooding the market, EB officers raided several places, Singh said.																								The raids were simultaneous and we sealed quite a few presses where we found copies of these books. The major haul was from Jorabagan, in north Calcutta, and Behala, in the south, said deputy commissioner (EB) R.K. Adhikari. 																								Debaprasad Sau, owner of Nilima Art Press, in Jorabagan, and Sheikh Sajjad Ali, an employee of the press on Haridas Dawn Road, in Behala, were netted.																								They were interrogated separately. When we asked them who had placed the order to print these books, both of them came up with the same name  that of Achintya Ghosh, a middle-aged man. They have not been able to give out any further information. We feel Ghosh is the mastermind, Adhikari added.																								The forged textbooks look similar to the originals, complete with holograms. The only difference is in the colour of the cover. Ghosh had supplied the presses with these holograms. For anyone buying the books, it would be difficult to differentiate them from the originals, the EB deputy commissioner added.																								Other major differences lay in the quality of paper used and that the forged books had no list of corrigenda. The fake books have been printed on newsprint acquired from the black market, said an EB official.																								Further raids are likely and a search has been launched to arrest Ghosh and his associates.

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND SAMARPAN DUTTA				 	 Nata Mullick: Notations, nosegays and nooses																								He is a master-designer of floral wreaths and an accomplished singer too. But Alopiya Mullick earns his livelihood as a hangman. 																								The name doesnt ring a bell? It will when you are told his more popular name: Nata. Yes, hes the man wholl execute rapist-killer Dhananjoy Chatterjee any day now. 																								Even Natas younger son, Mahadeb, came to know of his fathers formal name a few days ago. 																								My grandmother used to call him Nata because of he was short and the name stuck. Some time ago, he told me his father had christened him Alopiya. That was how I came to know of my fathers formal name, Mahadeb said.																								As a hangman, Nata has mastered the art of suppressing his emotions and carrying out executions in a matter-of-fact way. But the one hanging that still haunts him was that of Osman, his friend and companion at soirees.																								I once regularly visited a spot near the railway tracks at Park Circus. After enjoying a drink or two with friends, I would walk to the burial ground and start a majlis. People used to throng the place to hear me sing, Nata said.																								 It was at this burial ground that I first met Osman. He started accompanying me on the dafli (small drum), and we soon became good friends. Little did I realise what a tragic end was destined to our friendship, Nata recalled. 																								Osman was later convicted in a rape-and-murder case. Stepping on to the scaffold, he came to know that the hangman was none else than his friend. 																								Nata bhaiya, mujhe bacha lo, Osman had screamed on seeing him. Zaroor, the hangman replied, before covering Osmans face with the hood and pulling the lever. 																								Osman comes back in my sleep. His last words haunt me, Nata said.																								The hangman then went on to narrate another episode of his life  his brush with bouquet designing. 																								Early in my life, I prepared garlands for pujas. I loved the soft touch of the flowers. One day, seeing me at work, someone asked me to decorate the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. I was very nervous the day I went to the club, fearing how people would react to my decorations and designs, Nata recounted.																								Proving his apprehensions wrong, he was soon flooded with offers. They liked my work. I subsequently had several opportunities to create designs with flowers. But now, I am too old and cannot work. The last time I decorated my house was on my granddaughters marriage, Nata recalled.

 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Law failure cries foul
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A law student of Calcutta University (CU) who, according to the gazette, had passed the examination nearly seven years ago but had been put down as unsuccessful in the marksheet, moved Calcutta High Court on Tuesday. 																								She accused the registrar of misleading the states governor when he had inquired about her case.																								Petitioner Mahua Nag alleged that she had appeared for Part IV of her Ll.B examination in 1997 from South Calcutta Law College with special permission from the pro-vice chancellor (academic) of CU.																								According to the official gazette and Syndicate regulation notification, dated February 2, 1998, I had passed the examination. Seven months later, the marksheet handed over to me showed I had scored a zero in my taxation paper and I was declared failed, said the petitioner.																								Nag dashed off a plea to the governor, who is chancellor of the university. A few rights organisations rallied behind her.																								After three years, Nag filed a fresh petition before the human rights commission in 1999. On March 2003, D.K. Gautam, joint secretary to the governor, filed a report before the commission, informing it that the governor could not proceed with the case as it was pending in high court.																								Nag went to the governors office and found that he had asked the university registrar to produce her answer-script so that he could settle the matter.																								But, according to the Raj Bhavan memo no. 1200S, dated February 13, 2002, the registrar informed the governor that Nags script could not be produced for him because her case was pending in high court, she alleged in the petition.																								Nag affirmed in her petition that she had never moved the court against CU and the report submitted to the governor was baseless.																								Nags lawyer Supradip Roy said the registrar of CU had furnished wrong information to the governor wilfully. It is a criminal offence, liable to be prosecuted in terms of the CrPC, claimed Roy. The matter comes up for hearing soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Mums the word in murder belt
 																											- Cops and leaders gag neighbours, family of slain tease protester SUNANDO SARKAR AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA																								Its the silence of the scared. And nowhere does it speak louder than at the six windows in front of which Shankar Pals near-lifeless body was dumped on Saturday. They have been shut to the outside world ever since.																								The first thing the family did on Saturday, after seeing Shankar being left on the road to die, was to flee home. 																								They returned on Monday life has to go on, they explained  but their life seemed to have changed forever.																								They hear little, they speak even less (nothing at all about Shankar) and they dont dare open the windows, through which they witnessed Saturdays horror story.																								But they are not alone and this is no isolated case. 																								Numbed by years of police inaction and political interference in the law-and-order machinery, the entire belt between VIP Road and Jessore Road (under Lake Town, Dum Dum and Rajarhat police stations) has learnt not to see, hear and  above all  speak any evil.																								Not far from where Shankar Pal died lives Subrata Pal. A year ago, he spoke out against the promoter-criminal nexus gripping the locality. 																								Word went out and, a few days later, Subrata was beaten up by Manik and Dick. 																								Before he could lodge a case, word reached him from the Dum Dum police station, advising him to settle the matter to mutual satisfaction. Subrata followed the advice.																								On Monday, even Shankars in-laws  despite helping Kamala Pal file an FIR stating that her husband was murdered (and that he did not die in an accident)  were reluctant to speak. 																								We have told the police what we had to say, said Kamalas mother, Uttara Naskar.																								A neighbour explained that party leaders visited the Naskars on Sunday. The polls are approaching. You can understand that 500 votes are more important for us than five, was what Shankars widow and in-laws were told.																								Local CPM leaders explained that the party depended on those heading the suspects list in the Shankar case for polling-day activities. 																								The murder had taken place at the wrong time, they added.																								The clubroom of Milan Sangha, which organises the biggest Durga puja in the area, was firmly shut. 																								And members of the club, close to which the assault had taken place, were inside a nearby shop. 																								We dont want the police visiting us here, asking for names, one of them said. Experience has taught us to keep quiet.

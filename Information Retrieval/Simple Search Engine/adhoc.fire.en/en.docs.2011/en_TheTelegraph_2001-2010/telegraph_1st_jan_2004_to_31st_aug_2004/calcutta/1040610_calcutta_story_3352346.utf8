Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Prasanta Roy lives in a mud hut with his mother in a village called Kalyannagar, near Joka, in South 24-Parganas. His mother earns a living by sewing at home, and his father passed away nine years ago. 																								The 17-year-old student of a nearby government school has never been beyond the borders of Calcutta. In two days time, Prasanta will be on his way to Kansas City, Missouri, USA.																								As will 16-year-old Rahamat Bux. The Class IX student of Kidderpore lives with his mother and three sisters  two others are married  ever since his father walked out on the family years ago. 																								Both boys were taken under the wing of local NGOs  Prasanta was helped by CINI and Rahamat by Council for Social Development (CSD). They were then sponsored by the NGO Sahay, which works with 26 partner organisations in the state like CINI and CSD. Sahays funding body is Children International (CI). 																								The two teenagers will depart on June 11 to attend CIs International Youth Conference, held every alternate year, in Kansas City. 																								From June 14 to 18, the duo will participate in a series of physical training camps, group activities and discussions with their peers from similar backgrounds, from nine other countries that CI works in, like Chile, Columbia and Philippines.																								As part of the cultural programme, they will stage a dance to a Bhupen Hazarika song about palanquin-bearers and a mime show  you dont need language for either. 																								Selected through a long and arduous process with nominations, interviews and question papers, conducted by their own peers from para clubs to the Sahay council, candidates were tested for leadership and communication skills, as well as for confidence.																								Both admit to being nervous  can we live up to everyones expectations?  but are confident of their abilities  we are capable. But Prasanta and Rahamat are proud about representing the youth of India. Language is no barrier. We all share the same problems, hopes and dreams, adds Mantu Mandal, one of the two first-time participants, who went to Kansas City in 2002.

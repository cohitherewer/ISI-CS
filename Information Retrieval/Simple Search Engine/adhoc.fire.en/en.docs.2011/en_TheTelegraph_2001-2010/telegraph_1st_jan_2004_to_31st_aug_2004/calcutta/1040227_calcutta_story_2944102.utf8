The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Add-on fuel in Lighthouse flicker
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE				 	 NOT SHOWING: The closed counters of Lighthouse, shut down by the police for unauthorised changes. Picture by Aranya Sen																								One, a hub of activity with an Oscar-nominated film showing above and a busy restaurant below. The other, reduced from a movie-going landmark in town to a bleak house with counters closed and a shop open but hardly happening																								Lighthouse remained shut for the sixth day on Thursday, following police action on the evening of February 20, over unauthorised changes made to the premises.																								Last Friday evening, we received a notice from Calcutta Police that we have flouted Rule 12 of West Bengal Cinema Act, 1954, and were asked to close down, said John Mantosh, owner of Lighthouse and the adjacent New Empire.																								But on checking, we found that the rule prohibits a hotel, lodging house, workshop or manufacturing unit on the hall premises, none of which we have. We even called up senior police officers to ask where we have violated the law, but we have not been able to meet them yet, he added.																								The problem is regarding Citimart, a shop on the ground floor of Lighthouse. Though the shop has been functional for about two years now, its not clear why the powers-that-be have decided to take notice of this violation now.																								But what is becoming increasingly clear is that running a movie hall solely on the steam of the movies screened is mission illogical, if not impossible. Ticket sales are just not enough and with movie-plus dictating the movement of the film-going crowd, the more miscellaneous activity at the hall, the merrier.																								Of course add-ons are needed, asserted Arijit Dutta, owner of Priya and Globe. There is so much threat to the movie halls these days, that to make the business proposition viable, these opportunities must be explored, added the president of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association.																								Though Priya, at Deshapriya Park, has not gone beyond the cola-and-popcorn lure, Globe has a pub, a bar and a restaurant as value additions.																								According to G.S. Mishra, general manager of Metro cinema, Cinema halls really cannot do without having other income avenues. Despite low hall occupancy, our fixed costs continue to rise. Metro, already crippled by the cordon of hawkers around it and lack of proper parking space, has only a food and beverages counter to supplement its earnings.																								The threat of multiplexes looms large, forcing some halls to look at screening four different films a day. That is a possibility, admitted Mishra.																								Back at Lighthouse, almost 100 employees are sitting idle as the losses mount. Lighthouse loses about a lakh per month but we have retained it for nostalgic value, said Mantosh, still hoping to open in time to screen Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ.

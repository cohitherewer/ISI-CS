The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004  We Ask You Answer				 Slash prices, push up sales
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should buying at least one book be made mandatory for every visitor to the Book Fair?Mahadev Mandi,
																		Kidderpore. 																																																														I dont think its fair to force people to buy books. The Book Fair is also a platform where one gets to know about recent publications. Besides, several people prefer to buy books from shops offering more discounts. 									

Koel Basak Saha, 
																		Masjidbari Street. 																																																														Most people queuing up for the fair are passionate about books. Here, they have the advantage of stepping into the stalls of their choice and browsing through books which they can scarcely afford. So, the proposition of a must-buy is not acceptable.									

Chandan Ray,
																		Sarsuna. 																																																														A book bought from the fair has a charm of its own. Besides, the purpose of spending so much on hosting the fair and bringing in writers from abroad will be defeated if people dont buy books. But enforcing a must-buy on visitors cant be recommended. The organisers can consider increasing discounts to attract buyers.									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park.																																																														What does every visitor mean? If a family of three visits the fair, should each of them buy a book? Or in other words, 15,000 people entering the fair on individual tickets will have to buy the same number of books. This is absurd. Any such mandate will be unconstitutional. How can the Publishers and Booksellers Guild be so aggressive? Will such coercion ever be introduced in Expo, Lexpo, Industrial Fair or Handicrafts Fair? I am not sure if such a practice prevails in any part of the world. 									

Sunil Banerjee,
																		VIP Road. 																																																														The basic objective of hosting a book fair is to display old titles and new. Its a place where people brush up their knowledge on the latest entries in the literary and academic circles and pick up those they find interesting. I know some people who simply love to flip through pages and breathe in their smell. All this is perhaps possible only at the Book Fair and the organisers must not deprive us of this pleasure. 									

Virendra Shah,
																		Amratala Lane.																																																														It is a very impractical idea. This will spoil the purpose and meaning of the Book Fair. Rather, the organisers can think of introducing lucky draws to increase sales. 									

Seraj Alam,
																		Hooghly. 																																																														In todays world, people no longer have the opportunity to browse through books at their leisure. For many though, dropping in at the fair has become an annual affair, which also provides the chance to get in touch with the world of books. The fair will lose its true spirit if buying books is made mandatory.									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge. 																																																														Compulsion of any kind in any sphere leads to revolt. Good business at the Book Fair is always desirable and more discounts will perhaps boost sales.									

Gabriel Gomes, 
																		Park Street.																																																														Why should a family of five or six buy books per head? Moreover, if there is any sort of coercion, it shouldnt be called a fair. Terms like a business-oriented meet would be more apt. I agree that a lot of people visit the Book Fair just for fun, but even that lends so much to the vibrancy on the ground. Without the food and recreation stalls, the fair would have been so monotonous.									

Sounak Chakraborty,
																		Baranagar.																																																														High prices and low discounts are the two main handicaps at the Book Fair. If one can get the same books at College Street at a lower price, why would anyone buy from the fair? Isnt it simple logic?									

Saurabh Bhalotia,
																		Lake Town.																																																														People buy a book only if they are satisfied with the content and the price. So, the proposal does not hold ground. Besides, have the organisers forgotten that they pay a fee to enter the fair? 									

Susobhan Sarkar,
																		Sonarpur.																																																														The Book Fair is a much-awaited yearly event. Although the attraction is not confined to books anymore, the fair still retains an irresistible charm of luring people to the ground in hordes  something that is never possible in a bookshop. Mandatory buying of books will ruin the colourful atmosphere. 									

Priyanka Dawn,
																		New Alipore.																																																														The Book Fair provides ample opportunity to the visitors to browse through books and make their decisions, which is seldom the case at bookshops. The organisers should also be given a chance to boost their sales  by making at least one buy mandatory, if that helps.									

Arundhuti Bakshi,
																		Kalyani.																																																														The Book Fair is a place where people from across the city and the districts pour in. Forcing visitors to buy books will result in less people coming in, which is surely not what the organisers are thinking of.									

Asif Nadeem, 
																		Serampore. 																																																														I do not approve of the idea for three reasons. First, visitors pay an entry fee to the fair. Second, there are many first-time visitors who do not have any previous idea about book fairs. And third, people from different sections of society visit the fair to buy books solely because of the highly-discounted prices. If they cant find books that are affordable they are forced to return empty-handed.

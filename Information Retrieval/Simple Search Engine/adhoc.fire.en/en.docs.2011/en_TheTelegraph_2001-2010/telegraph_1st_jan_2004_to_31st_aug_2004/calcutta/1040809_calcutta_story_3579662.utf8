 															- First SARS case yet to square up dues, scenario worse in other health centres BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SANJAY MANDAL																								Remember Asitabha Purakayastha, the first suspected SARS patient from Calcutta who, for months, had struck terror? Purakayastha has quit his home in Madhyamgram and may have buried the past, but the authorities at AMRI Hospitals have not forgotten him. And for good reason, too. Purakayastha is yet to pay dues of Rs 52,000 in medical bills, incurred during his eight-day stay there last year.																								From April 22 to April 29, 2003, before Purakayastha left the hospital, a medical team was beside his bed day and night, but when he left, we were left high and dry. He had promised us the money, but nothing really has arrived till now, said S.B. Purokayastha, president of AMRI.																								This is not a solitary case. The scenario is far worse in the state-run SSKM Hospital, where one patient leaves the hospital every day without paying his bill. In the past month, 30 people have left the hospital (some of them just disappeared) without paying bills totalling Rs 1.5 lakh. We lodged complaints with the police and I guess it is up to them to look into the matter, said Santanu Tripathi, SSKM vice-principal.																								 In Purakayasthas case, AMRI had first tried to contact him by writing to his Madhyamgram home, demanding the dues. Later, they sent a representative. We learnt the Purakayasthas have left the place. The house was under lock and key. We did try to locate him, but have failed. Now, we have given up hopes of ever getting back our money, AMRI president Purokayastha admitted. In the past year, AMRI has lost a whopping Rs 23 lakh through unpaid bills. Our letters go unanswered most of the time, he adds. Then, there are others who ask for discounts, once treatment is over. 																								In the last fiscal, Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute, on Rashbehari Avenue, gave a discount of Rs 3.5 lakh to patients who could not pay the final bills. Ours is a small hospital, yet we do get patients who say they are from poor families, but will be able to pay the bills. Once the treatment is over, however, they throw up their hands, admitted Rupali Basu, general manager of the hospital. This year, the hospital is yet to recover Rs 1.5 lakh in unpaid bills. Some said they will pay up later, but havent shown up till now, said Basu.																								Pradip Mitra, superintendent of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, sent 100 letters in six months to patients who did not clear their dues. I despatch 15 letters a month to patients through the local police, he said.																								Basanta Khan, superintendent of NRS Medical College and Hospital, has sent an SOS to the government, urging it to look into the problem. We have found that 80 per cent of the treatment is conducted free, says Khan.

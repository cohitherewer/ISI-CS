				 	 M.P. RozarioHes a teacher and an administrator on the surface, but much more beneath. Being the principal of a school is just the tip of the iceberg for this multi-faceted educator. M.P. Rozario gave up the idea of going abroad to study further over two decades ago, and neither he nor those who know him have regretted it.																								He has received several awards in the past few years and is also known for his many social service activities in school, his neighbourhood and in aid of anyone who needs his help. 																								The son of the founder and rector of St Sebastians School in Tangra has been associated with the educational institution for the past 20 years. My younger brother passing away at an early age was a big motivator for me, because I didnt want to leave my father behind, says the 41-year-old.																								The former Park English School student passed out of St Xaviers College, and instead of pursuing an MBA in foreign lands, he stayed back. A few years later, he had an MA and B.Ed, as well as a PhD in education from Allahabad University. And then began his life-long association with education and St Sebastians School.																								My father had started the school in 1980, when I was in Class IX. I wanted to continue his work, recalls Rozario. It is that dedication which earned him the Gem of India and Bharat Jyoti awards in 2002, and the Shiksha Ratan Purashkar in 2003. But his proudest achievement is receiving the Rajiv Gandhi Shiramoni Award in 2003 in Delhi, from former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and chief minister of Delhi Sheila Dixit. 																								Although the father of two daughters had to give up teaching English and history to concentrate on running the school, he hasnt entirely stopped tutoring, at least by example. Rozario helps deserving under-privileged children by providing them with materials like books and stationary, as well as scholarships  he sponsors four students each year in St Sebastians.																								Be it occasionally volunteering with the Missionaries of Charity or providing food to orphanages at Christmas, easing the sufferings of the elderly through HelpAge India or sponsoring the trophies for the sports events of para clubs, the principal of the 1,000-strong ICSE and ISC school believes in doing his bit.																								The self-described researcher of students has another hidden talent that has brought his work into classrooms all over the country  authoring numerous English, maths, history and science ICSE and CBSE textbooks. He is just happy to be able to help educate.

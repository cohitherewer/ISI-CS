 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Vacation cry shuts courts
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Summer holidays in high court; ceasework in the lower courts.																								With Calcutta High Court shutting doors for a fortnight-long break, lawyers of the citys main subordinate courts  Alipore court and the City Civil and Sessions Court  have ceased work for an indefinite period.																								The cause: demand for summer holidays and other facilities enjoyed by their high court colleagues.																								The effect: Thousands of litigants in and around the city being left in the lurch.																								If the Alipore Court Bar Association has decided to convene a meeting to review the situation, lawyers at the City Civil and Sessions Court have set May 31 as the date when the situation would be reviewed and a decision taken on how long the ceasework would continue.																								The lawyers ceasework decision comes in the wake of a Calcutta High Court decision rejecting a demand by lawyers to allow the subordinate court authorities to go on a summer holiday.																								In a judgment delivered in December 2001, the Supreme Court had held that the legal practitioners have no right to cease work.																								The discriminatory attitude of the high court administration has forced us to take an unlawful step, said Dibyendu Biswas, a member of the executive committee of the West Bengal Bar Association, representing Alipore Court.																								The three-member committee of the high court judges has said that whether subordinate courts would be allowed to enjoy summer holidays from next year would be decided later, alleged a member of the Alipore Court Bar Association.																								West Bengal Bar Council executive committee chairman Uttam Majumdar said: Its not just the disparity in the number of holidays. Advocates of these courts are also fed up with the regular scarcity of drinking water, poor maintenance of court buildings, inadequate seating arrangements for lawyers and vacancies in the posts of judges.																								Majumdar claimed repeated representations had been made in vain on behalf of the state Bar Council before the chief justice of Calcutta High Court. The lawyers of subordinate courts should not feel discriminated against, he stressed.

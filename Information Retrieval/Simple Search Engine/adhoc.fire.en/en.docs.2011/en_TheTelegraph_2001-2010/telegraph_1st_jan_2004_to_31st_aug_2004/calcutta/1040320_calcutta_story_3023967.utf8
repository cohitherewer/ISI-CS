 															- Summit on ending the curse of Trafficking  A STAFF REPORTER																								Rising numbers and shrinking age. That is the emerging trend in human trafficking in India, and globally.																								How corporations and NGOs can join forces to combat the growing problem was the topic of discussion on Friday at Corporate Social Responsibility: Addressing Trafficking in Persons, organised by the American Center, Apne Aap Women Worldwide and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), eastern region.																								The packed Hyatt Regency ballroom was evidence that the issue, acknowledged as long ignored, is finally being given its due by stakeholders, other than the NGOs who have been grappling with the problem.																								Consul-general George N. Sibley chaired the inaugural session, saying trafficking was a terrible and devastating problem and the time for pretending and ignoring has passed. He asked: What can we do together  corporations and NGOs, citizens and government? Recently-appointed US ambassador David C. Mulford delivered an address over videophone from Delhi, reinforcing his commitment to collaborations with Indian agencies on an issue as important as ending the curse of trafficking.																								Sanjay Budhia, director, CII, eastern region, stressed that friends in the business sector should do more for the rest of society. West Bengal, that shares borders with three countries, he added, is particularly susceptible to the problem.																								An estimated 150,000 people are trafficked annually in South Asia, said founder of Apne Aap Ruchira Gupta. Most of these are women and minor girls, many of whom then fall victims to commercial sexual exploitation. Ashley Verghese, from the International Justice Mission, Mumbai branch, shared findings of the international NGO that reflect the profile of women and minor girls they have rescued from the sex trade in Mumbai. In 2002-2003, around 27 per cent  the largest group  of the girls rescued by the mission were from West Bengal. This number went up to 30 per cent the subsequent year.																								The Bush administration has announced a fund of around $50 million to fight trafficking globally. I would guess that about $5 million of that should come to India, said Deedee Donavan of USAID, which has been funding anti-trafficking programmes through UNIFEM. Digvijay Singh, Union minister of state, external affairs, scheduled to attend the meet, was called back to Delhi on Friday morning.

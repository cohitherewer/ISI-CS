Picture by Rashbehari Das 															The latest leg of the local round of the Blenders Pride Magical Night series took place at Big Ben, the pub at the Kenilworth hotel, recently. The designer on display for the evening was Abhishek Dutta who showcased his range of creations, from western to ethnic, aglow with vibrant colours and exquisite zari and embroidery work.																					Saturday being the big night of the weekend, the turnout for the show was huge. The eye-grabbing designs and the classy catwalk act choreographed by Ashish Banerjee in the cosy confines of the pub turned out be a winning formula.																					The four sequences of the show were titled Envy, Jealousy, Josh and Grand Finale, which saw models Tina, Jessica, Babla, Ishika and Jenny strutting around the wooden dance floor of the pub in fluorescent pinks, yellows and peacock blues.																					Most of Abhisheks creations are in chiffon and georgette. His western outfits, particularly the backless evening dresses, have clean cuts that make for a smart look. The saris are embellished with crochet work on the pallus. The straight skirts see the same work on the base. Bikini cuts are a clear favourite with the young designer, used in both cholis and uppers, teamed with side-slit skirts.																					For the crowd, most of whom were already familiar with Abhisheks work, the occasion was a dual treat. Not only could the party people check out the new additions to his repertoire, they also had the chance to chill out on the dance floor with some hip-hop and popular numbers, as DJ Saranjit sent the temperature soaring.

Artist Shuvaprasanna inaugurated the one-day event, held in association with Spandan Art Gallery, by sketching a crow on canvas.																					Painters presented their various interpretations of nature, which was the theme of the display. We cannot appreciate anything in life if we are not close to nature. The connection between love, peace and nature is what I have tried to portray through my work, said Samir Paul, one of the participating artists.																					Such exhibitions should also act as a platform for budding talent. Hence a mix of the established names with some upcoming artists, said Doel Sen, executive director, Spandan Art Gallery.																					Part of the proceeds from sale of paintings was earmarked for a charity.																																													Green preen																					A country-wide hunt has been on since early April to zero in on youngsters conscious about the environment they live in. The search, led by Wigan and Leigh College in association with Bengali teen magazine Unish Kuri in eastern India, has seen some serious responses flowing in, and the results were finally announced recently.																					The Think Green contest invited college and class XI and XII students to send in entries with ideas on how best nature can be preserved. 																					Entries were invited in four categories  management, fashion, media and design. Those who opted for management were asked to draw up a plan regarding what corporates could do to preserve the environment. Fashion freaks were invited to design environment-friendly outfits. Those with a mind for media had to create a photo-essay depicting environmental conditions in the country. The designers made posters and graphic campaigns on green issues.																					The prize distribution ceremony at Vidya Mandir on Saturday evening saw excited groups of youngsters  some participants, some curious spectators  waiting to hear the verdict. Finally, Pratiti Home Chowdhury walked away with the honours in the management section. Banani Singh topped the fashion charts. Debasish Nandis photo-essay bagged the media award and Neena Gupta aced the design department.																					A performance by Krosswindz and radio jockey Mirs comic compering made sure that even those who failed to grab an award went home in high spirits.																																													Design dream																					If you think you have a flair for design, there is another professional institute to check out. Exterior-Interior launched its Salt Lake centre recently. Archana Kapoor, deputy general manager, Salt Lake, explained at the opening that the location was chosen keeping in mind the large number of students in north Calcutta.

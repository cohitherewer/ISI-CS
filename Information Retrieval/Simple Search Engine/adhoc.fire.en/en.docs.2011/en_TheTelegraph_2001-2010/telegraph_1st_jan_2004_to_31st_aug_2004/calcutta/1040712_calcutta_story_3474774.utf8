 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Plastic pick-up drive at every doorstep
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								After the postman, its the turn of the plasticman to ring your doorbell  though only once a month  and ring in changes in the way you live.																								Close on the heels of the battle against PET bottles reaching your doorstep in select belts of the city, comes the clarion call for the war against plastic waste to start at home.																								Indian Plastic Federation (IPF), the apex body of plastic goods manufacturers, has an ambitious plan to develop a plastic waste management system in collaboration with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) by buying and then recycling the huge amount of plastic waste generated by the citys households.A pilot project will be flagged off on August 1 in the New Alipore-Chetla zone by IPF, with an initial target of 5,000 houses and shops.																								Our move is aimed at keeping the city free from plastic waste. We may start with a small area, but our plan is to extend the system to at least two CMC wards every month. We are sure that the new system will benefit both the users and the citys environment, said IPF secretary Jayanta Banerjee.																								By the project plan, IPF will provide a container each to every house, shop and eatery in the target area to store plastic waste. These containers will be collected at least once every month, for a fee of Rs 4 to Rs 6 per kg.																								All kinds of plastic waste will be collected and recycled. The pick-up list includes plastic carry bags of all kinds, toys, household goods, polythene sheets, cups, mosquito nets, shoes and cookware.																								The containers will be stored in a specially-made vat and from there the waste will be sent to recycling units, where it will be converted into big plastic balls. 																								These will then be used to make plastic goods and toys, but not carry bags or cups, emphasised IPF officials.																								Apart from door-to-door collection, we also have a plan to collect plastic waste from the citys streets, pavements and even corporation vats, the officials added.																								The earlier PET bottle collect-crush-and-recycle project has been termed a relative success by the pollution control board. While pointing out that the waste-collection project could be helpful to curb the plastic menace in the city, WBPCB member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar added that IPF is yet to intimate us about the details and the deadlines.

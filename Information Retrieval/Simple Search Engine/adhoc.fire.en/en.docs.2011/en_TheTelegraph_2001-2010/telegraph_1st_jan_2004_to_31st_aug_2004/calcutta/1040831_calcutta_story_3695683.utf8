 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Safety checks for taxi drivers
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND SAMARPAN DUTTA 																								June 17, 6.00 am: Residents of Panchashayar, in east Jadavpur, are shocked to find two bodies, their throats slit, on the road. The bodies are identified as those of local taxi drivers. Their vehicles are missing. Police are yet to trace the vehicles or nab the killers.																								July 23, 9.30 pm: Passengers assault and rob a taxi driver before hijacking the vehicle on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital. Police are yet to trace the car. 																								August 27, 10.30 pm: A taxi driver is robbed of his days earnings (Rs 800), a watch and ring at Tallah Park. The culprits, including a woman in her early 20s, assault the driver. 																								Incidents such as these are frequent in and around the city, prompting taxi owners and their unions to devise safety measures for the drivers.																								A Bengal Taxi Association (BTA) official said that on an average, at least two drivers are murdered and three cabs hijacked every month somewhere in the state. 																								According to Vineet Jha, BTA assistant secretary, taxi drivers have no alternative but to oblige the passengers to maintain a livelihood. But to ensure their safety, a number of checks are being considered.																								We had first thought of a introducing an alarm system that would connect each cab to the police headquarters at Lalbazar, through a satellite network. At the push of a button, a driver could seek help from the police. The control room at Lalbazar would ask the local police station to rescue the driver. But the plan fizzled out because of certain technical problems, Jha said.																								BTA secretary Bimal Guha had met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty early this month to discuss the issue. 																								To start with, we had thought of formulating certain rules. Every driver must be accompanied by his help at night. He must also not ferry passengers to unknown areas at late hours, Guha said.																								Calcutta Taxi Association secretary Subhas Kaushik explained that such incidents could be avoided if the cabbies paid heed to advice. To earn some extra money, they go anywhere even at the dead of night and invite trouble, he added.

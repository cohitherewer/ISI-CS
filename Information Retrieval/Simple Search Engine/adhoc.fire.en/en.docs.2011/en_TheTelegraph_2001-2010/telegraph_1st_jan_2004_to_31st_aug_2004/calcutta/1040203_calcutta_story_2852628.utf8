 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Bandh no bar to big-bang IT itinerary, growth plans
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It is one of the big-bang IT companies of the world and its got its sights set firmly on Calcutta. So, where does the IBM Global Services top brass choose to meet for its annual strategy summit this winter? Calcutta, of course. Bandh or no bandh.																								The city is playing the first Indian host to the strategy meet of the Application Management Services wing of IBM Global Service. Over 50 top managers, from 36 countries in the Asia Pacific region of the global IT major, which ended 2003 with a revenue figure of over $ 89 billion and an employee strength of over 315,889, are camping in town for the past two days.																								The mission is to draw up the companys business plans for the year ahead. The spin-off for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal is putting Calcutta on the IBM meeting map, alongside the likes of Singapore and Sydney. These are very important strategy meetings, where the past performance is reviewed and future plans are worked out, said an IBM official.																								The three-day meet in Calcutta started on February 1 and the final session will be held on Tuesday, despite the 12-hour bandh called by Trinamul Congress. 																								When we learnt of the Bengal bandh, there was talk about shifting the venue. But we stuck to the decision of holding it in Calcutta after a lot of internal deliberations, added the official.																								If some of the sessions on Day One were held at the companys facility in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex, the final days meetings will be confined, thanks to the bandh, to the star hotel on the Bypass hosting the IBM team.																								Adding lustre to IBMs presence in the city was Mondays meeting between Robert Payne, the companys general manager for the Asia Pacific region, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								IBM wants to open another centre here. I have asked them to submit a detailed report within seven days on their expansion plans, said Bhattacharjee, after his 30-minute meeting with Payne at Writers Buildings. IBMs Calcutta head Amitav Ray, IT minister Manab Mukherjee, chief secretary Ashok Gupta and IT secretary G.D. Gautama also attended the meeting. 																								IBM kicked off its city operations in end-2002, following the global merger of the company with the consulting wing of PricewaterhouseCoopers. In around a years time, it has ramped up its workforce from 400 to over 1,200 in the city.																								During his meeting with the chief minister, Robert Payne indicated that IBM was committed to Bengal and wanted to expand its operations here, said the IT minister, who is scheduled to meet Payne again on Tuesday morning.																								They want more land here and we will extend our full cooperation after they submit their report to us, said minister Mukherjee.

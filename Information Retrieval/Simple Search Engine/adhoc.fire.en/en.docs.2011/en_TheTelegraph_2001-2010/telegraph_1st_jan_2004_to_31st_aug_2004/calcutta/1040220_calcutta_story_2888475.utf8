 Friday, February 20, 2004 Evenings of faith and frailty
A gutsy actress brimming with conviction and a keen novelist probing middle-class moorings  Samir Mukerjee on two cherished friendships Nandita Das in conversation with Paritosh Sen and Mrinal Sen (left), who directed her in Amar Bhuvan and whose Ek Din Pratidin was based on a short story by Amalendu ChakravartyAll of us carry within ourselves voices and memories  the vibrant gestures once made, statements that were lit up by an inner fire. This takes me to Nandita Das  an honourable member of the acting fraternity, a favourite pen friend of mine and one of the most loved guests in our home.Nandita has got into South Indian, Bengali and Hindi films demonstrating her prowess all the way. But what is more important than her histrionic talent is the robust and scintillating personality that she possesses. A young woman with a serious bent of mind and bursting with convictions and beliefs tinged with humanism and altruism.Every time weve talked to her in a cosy and intimate atmosphere, we have felt that cinema was not an obsession with her. She certainly enjoyed the roles given to her but she was finicky about not descending into any kind of buffoonery or vulgarity. If cinema failed to satisfy her expectations, she could quite easily leave it and take up something else more in consonance with her temperament.Whether she is describing the story of the film she has acted in or pondering about the emancipation of Indian women or dissecting the political cross-currents of the day, her eloquence and mature understanding of the issues involved give her a head start. There is so much sincerity and honesty in what she says that one feels cinema could never be her chosen playground forever and a day.Street plays were right up her street at one time when she participated in Safdar Hashmis productions. That was political activism of a high order. Teaching at Rishi Valley brought her in touch with children in a unique setting where natures largesse wasnt a distant dream. She tried to understand the minds of the young hopefuls on the brink of new discoveries. She also had an encounter with Odissi that was part of her heritage.From time to time she takes up pottery just to be able to relax and be herself. One can sense her various attempts to get to grips with herself and it is this that people chasing mirages often forget. Nandita does not believe in starving the self and damaging her inner resilience.Her solicitude for our family, and the unspoken desire to remain in close touch with us by means of breezy letters and the odd telephone call emphasise her integrity and infinite capacity for warmth friendship.All those who assembled to listen to her in our drawing room have gone back with a feeling of euphoria. Her heightened political consciousness coupled with an unalloyed sense of fun gives her character the sort of completeness which one seldom sees in successful people.An ideal companionMost Leftist intellectuals chose the CPI as their spiritual abode when the united Communist Party split in the Sixties. I had the privilege of spending a few extraordinarily animated evenings with Amalendu Chakravarty, the well-known novelist. Whenever he met us he had anecdotes to retail and cogent comments to offer.His intensely readable novel, Gosthobeharir Jiban Japon, dealt with the problems of middle-class society, oppressed by adverse circumstances, buffeted by chilly winds that came in from the wastes and unable to find a way out of the blind alley that they were trapped in.The middle classes could not shed their conventional moral position but in a competitive world where ends justify the means they were at a loss to retain their pristine sanity. In such a situation, people like Gosthobehari have to fall back on shortcuts and dodges for sheer survival.Mrinal Sens rather telling film Ek Din Pratidin was based on Amalendu Chakrabartys short story where the middle-class mental makeup is taken out for airing and dusting. Amalendubabu was always on the move, looking intently at different aspects of our lives where contradictions and anomalies exist.He often followed boys and girls who went to Tarakeshwar with their offerings and discovered how the so-called devotees halted at pilgrim shelters for a tumble in the hay!He also visited babas and brahmacharis to find out what motivated them and what they wanted to get out of life by opting out of their normal domestic responsibilities. What saddened him most was the rank hypocrisy gaining momentum in our society.He did not talk about revolution in a mechanical way and hated the stereotyped responses to any political imbroglio. He looked at human frailty and saw how it stood as a hurdle in the way of transforming our lopsided and highly stratified society. In an anguished mood he used to recite Jibananandas ringing lines:Adbhut adhar ek esheychhey ei prithibite aajJara andho shobcheye beshi aaj chokhe dekhe taraJader hridaye kono prem nei, preeti nei, karunar aloron neiPrithibi achal aaj tader suparamarsho chhara.At every step he felt the need to renew himself and acquire a fresh set of experiences. He often found it inconvenient to write in his own room and went to a nearby park where he could relax and continue his writing.His smiling face, genial temperament, appreciation of lifes infinite challenges made him an ideal companion who could fill up your evening with strange fragrances of which he had a remarkable collection.

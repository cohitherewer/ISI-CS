The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, August 29, 2004 Life Lets go party, in private Private bashes with select invitees are the order of the night 															 Hated that shady looking guy eyeing your wife last Saturday night at the resto bar? Cursed that wardrobe malfunction woman charging at your boyfriend last weekend at the disco? Well, whats stopping you from doing what a majority of Calcuttas A-grade party animals are doing  organising house parties with select invitees or just hiring an entire disco for the night?																					Partying in private  but in public places  is the new mantra aimed at cutting out the so-called sad crowd and handpicking your guests.																					Says restaurateur and party regular Naveen Pai, With this retail boom in Calcutta, everybody now wants to be somebody. And so everybody wants to create a circle of his own. Moreover, at a public night-spot, you cannot really keep away unwanted party people. To achieve this two-fold objective, these small private bashes have taken over from regular weekend disco get-togethers.																					These tailor-made parties are mostly theme events with an average count of 40 to 50 guests. Sometimes the venue is a pub or a disco, booked for the night or, better still, at someones residence. With the advent of event managers these days, any home can be transformed into a perfect party place, adds Pai.																					Many event management companies cater to the growing demand for these behind-closed-doors parties. Arnab Datta of Kriya says: We have been doing event management for the past 12 years, but we set up this company especially to handle weddings and private parties. These parties mean much more than just good food and music. Every do now has a theme and a lot of activities and games spun off from that theme. In fact, the parties have come to represent the identity of the people involved.																					For a DJ, though, a private party means a much easier job at hand. Says Saranjit, resident DJ of Big Ben, In a club night, you have to try and cater to different tastes. But for a private party, you know exactly what to play. The host makes it clear what kind of music he prefers and his guests are usually all like-minded people. So, its difficult to go wrong.Jewellery designer Nilanjana, a common face at private bashes with hubby Arjun Chakraborty, sums up the scenario: A party is meant to be something enjoyable. But what happens at a nightclub these days is not healthy at all. The kind of sleaze-fest on display is truly alarming. Even a few years back, there were a lot of norms that were maintained. Not anymore. 																					At a private party though, there is a psychological taboo and an unspoken code of conduct. And with the host around, there is also an accountability factor involved.So, shut the doors and let the party begin. Yo!Spanish spell on the floor  Rosanna in performance Roll over hip-hop dance steps and casual disco moves, its the classic Spanish dance form Flamenco that is all set to rule the city dance floors soon. Thanks to an innovative workshop being organised by cultural organisation Shivoum, Calcuttans can learn the graceful movements from specialised Flamenco dancer Rosanna Maya.I was so impressed by Rosannas performance that when I got a chance to bring her from Mumbai, where she is currently taking workshops, I grabbed the opportunity, said Leena Kejriwal of Shivoum (98314-14229).Starting September 2, the three-day workshop to be held at Solace, the luxury health centre in Sunny Park, will train participants in various modules, among them techniques of foot rhythms, use of the body, application of footwork and clapping and the style and expression of Flamenco. Rosanna will also provide a peek into the history and traditions of the dance, said Leena. For those who will not be able to sign up for the three-day course, a lecture demonstration at Max Muller Bhavan on September 4 has also been organised.HIMIKA CHAUDHURIDouble delightThey are at almost two ends of the music pole, but when they performed on the same stage on Friday night together, boy, did they rock the 1,000-strong crowd inside the Science City auditorium. One of Calcuttas favourite entertainers Usha Uthup and hit Bangla band Chandrabindoo performed at the annual show of a cosmetic company, belting out some of their own and the citys favourite numbers. While Usha in her signature style floored the audience with a mix of melody and adda, Chandrabindoo sent the younger lot into a tizzy with a power-packed performance. With the jiving ruling the aisles, both Usha and Chandrabindoo had to request the all-excited audience members to stick to their seats and let the show go on.Setting nights on fire Gary Lawyer before his performance at The Park on Saturday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya  His watch may run late, he may be delayed for his shows, but Gary Lawyer has always been ahead of his times. So, in spite of him not coming up with a new album for a long, long time, his presence is still as fresh as his voice. And as was evident at Someplace Else on Saturday night, Calcuttas music lovers just adore the man. The city has a lot of heart and soul and the listeners are very mature. I just get so nostalgic when I perform here, says the man with the rich baritone.Performing in Calcutta is something Gary has been doing for a long time now. My brother studied in Darjeeling, so I kept coming to Calcutta. And I have performed almost everywhere in the city. I still remember those shows we did at the Tollygunge Club, when all these decibel limitations werent there. I dont lie when I say Calcutta is my favourite city.And in Calcutta, Someplace Else is his favourite musical haunt. These days there are not many outlets for a musician. I know how frustrating it is if theres something inside you but you cannot bring it out. Had there been more places like Someplace Else, Western music wouldnt have taken a backseat, like it has.Whenever the chat meanders to Western music in India, Gary goes grim. It has always been my mission to make sure that India gets its due share of Western music. There is a lot of talent here in this field, but that gets suppressed.Gary doesnt read much into the sound of English songs in films like Dhoom and Rakht. Thats a gimmick. I myself sang one such number, the title track in Ram Gopal Varmas Road. You have to give importance to English music for the sake of importance. For many of us, English is the language that binds. There is a majority of the educated class that only speaks in English. The only way an English song can be made into a hit is by giving it a lot of exposure. I have to sing only cover versions at my concerts because apart from a Nights on fire and an Other side of dawn, people hardly know of any of my original songs. So I sing my regular quota of Doors, Neil Diamond, Bono and Presley  and as a result I pay homage to my gurus.But now after a prolonged hiatus, Gary is ready with his new album slated for an October release. I choose to call the music in the album understandable rock  rock numbers which are pleasing and, more importantly, have all the ingredients of a hit. For all those Lawyer fans out there, the album has a special bonus track  a re-release of Nights on fire. PRATIM D. GUPTA

Tired of not giving into your kids clamouring for this and that? Allow Skipper, the one-stop family shop to put the spring back into your step, the extra bucks you usually shrug out back into your pocket and the smile back onto your face. For its sale-time at the sprawling clothing store on Sudder Street and that means the already-low prices just got lower.																																																				Says Rajiv Goenka, one of the directors, Skipper Furnishings was recently given the best furnishing store award by minister of textiles, Shahnawaz Hussain at the recently-held Texcellence Awards. And while were extremely proud of this, were not one to rest on our laurels. So were always looking for ways to surge ahead and win over more Calcuttans. What better way of doing this than by having a sale with whopping discounts for one and all.																																																				At the sale, ladies can have a whale of a time browsing through all that Skipper has to offer. The sari corner throws up crisp and colourful tants, slinky chiffons, heavy-duty silks and even embellished ensembles for evening-wear while salwar-kameezes and kurtas are also in plenty. Those more comfortable in Westernwear can take a look at the trousers, skirts, tops and long dresses and here prices are lopped off by anything between 20 and 50 per cent. 																																																				Looking sharp for male dressers is also a breeze with the store offering whopping discounts on kurtas, suits, blazers, trousers, shirts and even casual T-shirts. Its the little ones who are the best off, though, as a huge section is devoted to everything from adorable baba-suits and frocks to trendy denim items, hipsters and colourful wind-cheaters. 																																																				Skippers branches at Rashbehari Avenue and Kankurgachi are also in sale mode each offering attractive discounts of their own. For details, call: 2252 0165.

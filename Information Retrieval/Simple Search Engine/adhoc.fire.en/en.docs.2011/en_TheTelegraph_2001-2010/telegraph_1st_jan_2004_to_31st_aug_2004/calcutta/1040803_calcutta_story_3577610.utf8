 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 Too young to marry
Screen on amp; offThough I have grown up, I still want to be that girl, giggles Bipasha Basu. She sure has grown up  youll notice that with or without having seen Jism  but utter the word puja and the girl child peeps through.If it wasnt for her work schedule, the hot bod of Bollywood would be back home in Ekdalia Park every Puja. If staying in shape wasnt such a headache, she would have been merrily tucking into all that junk food. If only she had the time to spare, she would be spending long hours watching the migratory birds in Serengeti. If onlyBehind the dare-bare attitude, a wistful Bipasha Basu emerged during a chat in town last weekend. Pujas are just not the same in Mumbai. I miss the addas with the dadas and didis of my para. They used to really pamper me, smiles the girl who used to love polishing off all the rubbish you get during the Pujas, but has just knocked off 10 kilos with an almost oil-free food regimen.Also on her miss list are the friends from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. Most of them have got married or moved out of the city, says Bipasha, before slipping in saucily, Though I still am too young to get married!The gawky teenager, who started walking the ramp very young before going on to be the most successful Bollywood star from Calcutta in recent yea rs, refuses to shut out memories of the struggle days when she would survive on noodles or corn flakes.It was really tough but I want my younger sister (who is studying in Mumbai) to go through it all. I dont want her to become like my elder sister who cant even hail a taxi, stresses the concerned sibling.She might rue a few things, but regrets she has none or maybe one. Not having pursued my education even though I had the scope for it is the only thing that rankles deep inside. I missed out on college and thats exactly why I insist every girl should complete her studies first.But who says Bips wont get back to books? In four to five years, the screen stunner should return to the classroom. Not to be briefed about the birds and the bees, but to take up a course in film-making.Search for the telly idol Come February 2005, and a Calcuttan may be crowned the countrys idol. Heres how. The show that has taken 25 countries by storm and delighted millions of television viewers is coming to India. Sony Entertainment Televisions Indian Idol, like the Idol avatars in other countries, will set out to crown a national idol in music through screening and viewer voting. And Calcutta is one of the audition stops. The winner will get a recording contract with a music company and a sign-up with Sony Music for project promotions worth Rs 1 crore. Judging the contestants would be music director Anu Malik, singer Sonu Nigam and choreographer Farah Khan.How does it work? Between August 20 and September 30, aspirants can call city-specific phone numbers and register themselves. Auditions would be held in Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad (other than Calcutta) through which the judges would shortlist 100. The second round of auditions would be held in Mumbai to bring down the list to 30. Viewers would then be able to call in and register their votes to select the 10 finalists. Further voting by viewers would then decide the idol. The final happens around mid-February 2005. The show, scheduled to go on air in October, will be hosted by Aman Verma and Mini Mathur. Along with India, national competitions are being launched this year in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.The Idol series has been a hit worldwide with 200,000 contestants, over 110 million viewers and 500 million votes cast. The Indian television audience is more acquainted with American Idol, the 2004 edition of which crowned Fantasia Barrino (right). Skin or soul Neha Dhupia says only sex and Shah Rukh Khan sell in Bollywood. Her Julie director Deepak Shivdasani says his film is more about soul than skin. But it does not matter which of the S factors is at work here because Julie is truly hot property at the all-India box office. With a whopping collection of Rs 2,89,139 per print in its first week, the film should end up being one of the rare hits of 2004. Running in as many as seven cinemas in the city, Julies jism has also found favour with the conservative Calcuttan.Shivdasani, on his part, has throughout been very apprehensive about how the film will do here. I wasnt able to go to Calcutta and talk about the film. I understand that from all those promos and posters, the general feeling is that Julie is all about skin. But ultimately it is the soul which counts. I believe women of all ages would be able to identify with the kind of mental trauma the character goes through.Neha Julie Dhupia always knew that the film would work at the box-office and doesnt find anything wrong with fleshing out the formula for filmi success. I went to watch Murder along with my mother and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought the film was shot very aesthetically and I think the same holds true for Julie  the so-called bold scenes have been captured very tastefully. I am glad it is doing so well at the box-office. It is just a sign that the audience is getting a lot more open to fresh and bold cinema, she smiles.Hardly invisible From the first day first show, the knives have been out against Ram Gopal Varmas Gayab. Labelled a washout, it was supposed to disappear from the halls before you could say gayab. But the figures have another story to tell. In its first week in the city, Gayab fetched Rs 20,54,249 running at seven theatres and in its second week, the collections did plummet but still managed Rs 1,30,275 at the four halls where it is now on. That means more visibility than what some of Varmas earlier productions enjoyed.When contacted, director Prawaal Raman sounded a man content: Our company is happy and so are our distributors. Anybody who has seen the film has loved it. And what of those who wrote Gayab off? They make me laugh. They are acting like nursery kids by comparing Gayab with Mr India and Hollow ManBut what does Gayab have going for it? Tusshar Kapoor in a good-evil-good role and lots of Antara Mali .Village in town Come September and you can return to your  or rather Manoj Night Shyamalans  rustic roots. Thats when The Village rolls into town.The city multiplexes have a date with the latest thriller from the man with The Sixth Sense on September 10. By then, the film, originally entitled The Woods, is expected to have smashed most US box-office records. Going by its first weekend collections, The Village has stormed the US charts, grossing $50.8 million and climbing straight to the top.This, in fact, has been the second biggest opening for Shyamalan after the $60.1 million debut of Signs in 2002. The crop-circling ET tale had a bigger star billing in the form of Mel Gibson. The Village, on the other hand, boasts of a more sombre cast including William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Sigourney Weaver. It also marks the breakthrough project of director Ron Howards daughter Bryce Dallas Howard.So, get set for the latest from the modern Hitchcock, as he transports you to an 1897 rural Pennsylvania town confronting monstrous creatures inhabiting the surrounding woods.City beats In the mood for some live melody? Then watch out for Independence Day-eve. Reigning playback queen (and ex-Modern High student) Alka Yagnik and city boy Shaan are slated to belt out chartbusters from Hum Tum, Lakshya, Kal Ho Naa Ho and many more. The soiree, hosted by Calcutta Police, at Science City auditorium on August 14, will also star one of Big Bs favourite melody makers, Aadesh Srivastava.Reshmi Sengupta

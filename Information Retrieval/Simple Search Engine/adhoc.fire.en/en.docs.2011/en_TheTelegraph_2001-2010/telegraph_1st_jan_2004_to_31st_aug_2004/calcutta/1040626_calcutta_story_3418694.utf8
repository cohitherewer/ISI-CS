The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 More science teachers in districts
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In an attempt to curb student load in Higher Secondary courses at a select few reputable schools in Calcutta, the state government on Friday announced that it would appoint 600 new teachers at the state-aided Higher Secondary institutions in the districts.																								The new appointees will mostly be engaged as part of the government drive to expand the science streams in the Higher Secondary schools in the districts so that students in rural belts, who have scored high marks and want to study science, do not crowd schools in Calcutta.																								The number of students in Calcutta is rising every year. Higher Secondary schools in Calcutta are running short of seats to accommodate their own students. We do not want students from the districts to depend on city schools for quality education, school education minister Kanti Biswas said.																								Government officials said, concerned at the increasing demand among students to study Higher Secondary courses, the state finance department on Friday sanctioned the education departments plea for funds to pay the salaries of the new 600 teachers, including 300 permanent posts and the remaining 300 for part-timers. The minister said: We are working on a scheme to upgrade as many Higher Secondary schools as possible in the districts.

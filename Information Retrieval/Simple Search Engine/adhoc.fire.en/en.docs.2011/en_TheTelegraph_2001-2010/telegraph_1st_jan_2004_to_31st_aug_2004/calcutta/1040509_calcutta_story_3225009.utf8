 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Another hospital to start dialysis
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government has decided to start dialysis services at the Medical College and Hospital.																								A private company entrusted to set up the dialysis machine at the hospital has completed a survey and given a feasibility report to the state health department. Deputy superintendent Amarendra Biswas said hundreds of patients used to return unattended, prompting the hospital authorities to start the service.																								At RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, however, another private company ruled out a dialysis unit as not financially feasible. I have asked the health department to look for alternatives as a dialysis set-up is vital, said hospital superintendent Pradip Mitra.

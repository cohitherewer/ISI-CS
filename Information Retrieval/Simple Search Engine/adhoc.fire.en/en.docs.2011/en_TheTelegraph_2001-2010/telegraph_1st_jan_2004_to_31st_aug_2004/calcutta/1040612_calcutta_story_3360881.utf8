 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Rajarhat survey officials beaten up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two officials of the Institute of Wetland Management and Ecological Design were assaulted and their cars damaged by a mob at Naskarhat, in Rajarhat, on Friday. Seven persons were arrested in this connection. 																								The two officials, Rana Mukherjee and Krishna Banerjee, went to the area for a survey on behalf of the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), as part of a larger land-acquisition programme for the Rajarhat New Township project. Hidco officials alleged that they were facing mob fury repeatedly in the area since last year.																								Goutam Deb, housing development minister and Hidco chairman, said a handful of villagers, misled by vested interests were behind the assault. The situation is under control and we will go ahead with the land acquisition, Deb added.																								The two officials reached the spot at around 11.30 am. As they got off their cars, they were surrounded by the mob, which asked them to leave. A section, officials said, feared their land would be taken over for the township once the survey reports were submitted.																								The officials refused to leave. The mob attacked their cars and smashed the glass windows. Some valuable instruments in one of the cars were also damaged, a Hidco official said. 																								A team of from Rajarhat police station rescued the officials. We will provide all protection to officials sent for the survey, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, on Friday. 																								Subhankar Chatterjee, sub-divisional police officer of Barasat, said a team has been deployed in the area to maintain order. Some microphones, used by the mob to threaten the officials, were seized, he added.																								However, Nilotpal Dutta, secretary of the Rajarhat Jomi Bachao Committee, alleged that the administration and police were pressuring villagers to vacate their land. 																								We have moved a public interest litigation in Calcutta High Court, Dutta said.																								Minister Deb, however, denied the charges and said there might have been a communication gap between the villagers and survey officials.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed at the rising number of cases of power theft in the city and the districts, the government plans to set up special cells in police stations to tackle the crime. The cells, according to the plan, will be monitored by a sub-inspector and will initiate measures to track down thieves.																								At present, CESC and the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) conduct raids to detect illegal tapping and local police stations provide them with policemen on request.																								But after the formation of the new cells, police alone can take steps to curb hooking and tapping. Besides, people can lodge complaints at the police stations concerned. They will keep a vigil in the congested city areas, slums and the marketplace, where power theft is rampant, officials said.																								The rising incidence of power theft prompted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to ask power minister Mrinal Banerjee to take stern measures. He wanted local people, clubs and mass organisations to curb the menace.																								The power utilities have urged us to make a permanent arrangement in local police stations to curb power theft and we are considering it, said home secretary Amit Kiran Deb. 																								Though policemen are provided during raids by power utilities to nab thieves, the drives are inadequate and we want to make permanent arrangements, he added.																								Deb admitted that sufficient policemen could not be provided at all the times during raids conducted by the power utilities owing to lack of manpower. 																								As the government has put a stress on curbing power theft, we are considering setting up special cells in police stations that will handle cases related to power theft, he elaborated. 																								According to power department officials, electricity worth Rs 1,500 crore is stolen every year, of which power worth Rs 500 crore is stolen from the city alone. If we can stop power theft, we can utilise the money for development, they added.																								The government has framed a law whereby power theft is a cognisable offence. After enactment of the law and regular drives involving local people and the police, power theft has been reduced to some extent but we need more stringent measures for better results, said Sanjay Mitra, WBSEB chairman. 																								If we get more policemen to assist us and undertake regular drives and organise campaigns, we will definitely be able to bring power theft down, Mitra added.																								He held a discussion with home secretary Deb last week and submitted a proposal seeking permanent police arrangements to check power theft.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Will the popular Bournvita Cricket Academy on the Maidan be run out?																								The fate of the academy, or at least its address, run by former Indian opener Arun Lal will be decided in court following a public interest litigation filed by an advocate of the metropolitan magistrates court.																								The litigation challenges the validity of the handing over of the ground by the chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) to Cadbury to conduct a coaching camp by Lal and questions the legitimacy of the cricket centre.																								The matter comes up for hearing on Friday.																								Lal, in Bangladesh to do commentary for the Under-19 World Cup, when contacted about the case, said: I would not like to comment.																								Chanchal Dey, secretary of the academy, said they would counter the charges in court.																								Advocate Mandira Bose, in her petition, alleged that the ex-officio president of the Metropolitan Magistrates Club, Sanat Kumar Mishra, also CMM of Calcutta, had transferred the rights of the MM Tennis Club to Cadbury Company without consulting members of the club.																								She contended that as per the rule of agreement between the club and the Eastern Command, the club premises and its adjacent tennis ground were under the control of the club members, which could not be transferred without changing the contract.																								Bose argued that the selection of the present CMM to the post of president of Metropolitan Magistrates Club was on an ad-hoc basis. So, the ex-officio president of the club has no jurisdiction to hand over the rights of the ground to a private company for their commercial benefit, claimed the petitioner.																								She further alleged that a representation had been placed by the advocates of the CMM court and others to the president of the club on May 5, 2003, requesting him to change his decision regarding the handover.																								 The court should ask the CMM why he had not considered the representation of the lawyers and transferred the rights of the premises against Rs 5,000 per month only, said Bose.																								Subroto Mookherjee, representing Bose, said the CMM has no right to hand over the ground without prior permission of the high court. 																								He also said that according to the rules framed by the Eastern Command, controller of the Maidan area, no one would be allowed to use the greens for commercial purposes.																								The cricket coaching camp run by Lal is a purely commercial venture. This is illegal, claimed Mookherjee.

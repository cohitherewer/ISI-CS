The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, January 09, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with... Joan Baez. This is  a year for inner growth. You are a very dependable friend.  No matter how long it takes, you want to achieve maximum  success. You are very sensitive. Your forte lies in civil  service or any other public office. Your innate shyness  can give the wrong impression at times.  Kusum Bhandari

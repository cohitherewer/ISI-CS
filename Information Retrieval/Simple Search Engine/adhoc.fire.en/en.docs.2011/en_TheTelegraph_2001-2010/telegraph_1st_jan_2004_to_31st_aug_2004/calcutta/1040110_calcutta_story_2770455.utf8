 																											- Hunt launched for assassin after interrogation of local residents A STAFF REPORTER																								Forty-eight hours after the body of a 12-year-old-girl was found in an abandoned steel plant in Taratala, the cops continued to grope for clues to her identity, but claimed to have got the murderer in their sights.																								We have got the name of the culprit, but cannot disclose it for the sake of investigations. Officers on the case are still gathering evidence but if things go according to plan, the killer will be netted in a day or two, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner (detective department).																								The body of the girl, clad in jeans and T-shirt and bearing three injury marks on the back of her head and strangulation marks on her neck, was found by a local youth on Wednesday afternoon. Preliminary investigation suggested she had been murdered on Tuesday night. She had been hit on the head with a blunt object and also strangled. A medical test on Thursday confirmed that the girl had also been raped.																								During the interrogation of some residents of the area and localities adjacent to it, a picture of the assailant  but not the victim  started emerging.																								We first learnt that the assassin is in his mid-twenties and from a nearby locality, said Mitra. On further questioning, we could put a name on the suspect. Some witnesses even said they had seen the the girl entering the deserted steel plant with the young man.																								Armed with a name, the homicide wing of the detective department launched a manhunt on Friday. We conducted raids at two places, but the suspect managed to give us the slip, said one of the officials probing the mystery murder. 																								A police team of four officers is combing several areas in south Calcutta. We are also raiding hideouts on the southern fringes of the city, he added.																								According to deputy commissioner Mitra, the girl was hit with a crowbar. It seems, the assassin hit her when she fell unconscious. The medical test report has confirmed that she died because of the head injuries We are sure that the culprit brought the girl to the factory with the intention of killing her, claimed Mitra.																								The hunt for the girls identity continued through Friday, but in vain. We contacted the adjoining police stations in South 24-Parganas to ascertain whether any such missing complaint was lodged there recently. But the district police replied in the negative, said an officer.																								We are now quizzing residents of the Metiabruz and Garden Reach areas. We have also activated our local network to get some leads and alerted the Howrah, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas police, he added.

 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Musician dies in mishap
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Debjit Sengupta, the tabla player accompanying singer Nachiketa for the past 12 years, died in an accident on VIP Road late on Thursday.																								Better known as Joy, the 33-year-old musician was returning home to Kalindi, near Bangur Avenue, from a social engagement in Salt Lake. He was accompanied by his wife and a friend.																								The car skidded on a muddy stretch at Rajarhat New Town, hardly a kilometre from the airport. It then dashed against a truck piled with mud and headed for a construction site.																								Sengupta, who was at the wheel, died on the spot. His wife and friend lost consciousness and were rushed to a private hospital near Phoolbagan.																								Their condition is stated to be critical.																								Joy was very close to me and I cannot believe what has happened. He was more than a friend, he was an inspiration. A tabla player may replace Joy in the group, but no one will ever take his place in my life, Nachiketa said on Friday.																								The accident once again calls attention to a section of VIP Road that has become a peril point for pedestrians and motorists alike.																								With trucks constantly carrying construction material to Rajarhat, the road has been rendered dangerous by the mud.																								The condition is a cause for serious concern for residents of the area, but nothing has been done to make it less hazardous a stretch.

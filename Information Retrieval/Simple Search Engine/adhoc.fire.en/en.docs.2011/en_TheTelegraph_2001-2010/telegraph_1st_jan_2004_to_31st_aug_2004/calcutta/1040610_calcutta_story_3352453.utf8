The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Mentally unsound girl reunited with mother
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Anwara Devi couldnt believe her eyes when a team from the Calcutta Police detective departments missing persons squad brought home her 25-year-old daughter Rina Kumari on Wednesday. 																								She, and other residents of Tilothu village, in Bihars Rohtas district, had long given up Rina for dead, after she disappeared from home more than four years ago.																								Mother and daughter were happily reunited, thanks to the efforts of the police team, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Sanjay Mukherjee. Anwara Devi, along with her neighbours, were amazed that the girl, mentally ill since childhood, had returned home almost cured, he added.																								Accepting the surprising return of the young woman was not easy for the villagers. They had their doubts about where Rina had been all the while and what she had been through. 																								Only after sub-inspector Chiraranjan Pal, leader of the sleuth team, explained to a gathering of village elders that Rina had been taken care of at Pavlov Mental Hospital in Gobra, Calcutta, and thereafter at Paripurnota Halfway Home, a rehabilitation centre for the psychologically challenged, did the villagers agree to allow the young woman to rejoin her home and family.																								On January 1, 2003, residents of the area brought an unidentified woman, who was mentally ill, to Taltala police station. The woman was, subsequently, taken to Pavlov Mental Hospital by the police, and admitted there. 																								Rina spent a whole year at the mental institution, undergoing intensive treatment. In December 2003, officials of the Paripurnota Halfway Home picked her up for further treatment and rehabilitation, and took her to a home at Maharani Swaranamoyee Road. 																								After six months of therapy and nurturing, the young woman recollected her name. Therapists helped her remember her fathers name, late Gopi Choudhury. She recalled that she had been to Dehri-on-Sone railway station in Rohtas district, describing the station in some detail. She said she was from Tilothu.																								Paripuranota officials got in touch with Bihar police and informed them about the unusual case, seeking information on a missing person fitting Rinas description and logistical information to locate her home and kin. 																								The feedback from Bihar police, however, was vague. The home officials then contacted the missing persons squad of Calcutta Police, and a team, comprising constables S.P. Sinha, Supriya Das and Mamata Ghosh, and led by sub-inspector Pal, was sent to Dehri-on-Sone with Rina. 																								Rina failed to recognise her way to the village. The sleuths then sought the help of a local mahila samiti and panchayat, and finally managed to locate Tilothu village. The team will be rewarded, Mukherjee said.

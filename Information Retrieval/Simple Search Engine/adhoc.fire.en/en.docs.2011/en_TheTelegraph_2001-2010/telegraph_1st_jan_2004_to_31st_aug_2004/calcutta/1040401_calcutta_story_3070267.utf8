The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Civic body dumps bio-waste
 																											- April 1 deadline raises a stink at government hospitals JAYANTA BASU																								It may be April 1, but this is serious business and is sure to raise a stink. Those visiting government hospitals must brace for a sordid sight  heaps of garbage with nowhere to go.																								Medical waste will not be lifted from 661 medical establishments by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), starting Thursday. 																								The 29 government hospitals, accounting for nearly half of the medical waste generated by the city, will bear the brunt of the no-disposal decision.																								CMC sources said municipal commissioner Debashis Som has conveyed to the state health department the civic bodys inability to clear bio-medical waste from medical establishments in the city.																								The communiqu to the health department  a copy of which was sent to the PCB office  states that under no circumstances will the CMC handle any bio-waste with effect from April 1, 2004.																								It also suggests that government hospitals may be advised by the health department to make necessary arrangements with a private operator for handling the bio-medical waste.																								The medical waste-treatment facility referred to is Medicare Incin Pvt Ltd, the only one of its kind in the state. Built in Howrah by the Ramky group for over Rs 2 crore, it has been operational since November 2003.																								The PCB has already asked all private hospitals and nursing homes in the city to make arrangements for either self-treatment of the waste, or to join Howrahs common treatment facility from April 1.																								We expect to collect and treat about 2,500 kg of medical waste from 225-odd medical establishments from April 1, revealed S.K. Choudhury, chief executive officer, Medicare Incin.																								But the PCB admits that it cant do much about government hospitals. Member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar told Metro on Wednesday that the board is just the facilitator.																								The health department  which was well aware of the April 1 deadline set by the civic body  must take the initiative to ensure a clean-up on medical campuses. Sources said everything, including the cost and modalities of handling and treating bio-medical waste, had been worked out at the highest level between the private operator and the health department.																								According to bio-medical waste management and handling rules, the CMC cannot handle untreated bio-medical waste from medical establishments.																								But health department officials were critical of the civic bodys unilateral decision not to clear waste from government hospitals.

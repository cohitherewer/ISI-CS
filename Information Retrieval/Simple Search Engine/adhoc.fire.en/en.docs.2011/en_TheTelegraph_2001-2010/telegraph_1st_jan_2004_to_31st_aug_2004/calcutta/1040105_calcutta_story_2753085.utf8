The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, January 05, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 A.R. Rahman You will be at your creative best. There will be expansion and growth. You will polish your self-image. You need to learn how to relax. You are reliable and responsible towards your partner. You are determined to succeed, despite all odds. You give the impression of being self-sufficient, but you need happy and fulfilling relationships, too.  Kusum Bhandari

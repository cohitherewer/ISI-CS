The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, June 29, 2004  All in the image HIMIKA CHAUDHURI AND SANGITA S. GUHA ROY Model Jayati Guha at the Oxford talk. Picture by Rashbehari Das															The clothes you wear, the hairstyle you sport and the makeup you don define the person you are. To portray the image you want, its important to know what styles suit you. 																					Thats the advice a packed house at Oxford Bookstore lapped up on Friday evening with three people from the fashion and glamour industry giving out some general tips on dressing and decking up.																					Conducted by the National Institute of Fashion Design (NIFD), the talk saw designer Sayon Mitra, model Jayati Guha and senior product head, NIFD, Bobby Sen fielding questions from the audience on various aspects of style, figure, hairstyles, cosmetics and colour recommendations.A side presentation covered hairstyles for different kinds of faces to length of garments for various body shapes. While a front fringe was advised for those with an oval face, fringes at the sides going inwards are a strict no-no for those with a round, Aishwarya Rai kind of face. Those with high cheekbones need to highlight the cheeks and can go for steps with side fringes.Necklines were a hot topic of discussion. Only those with long, slender necks should sport polo-necked tops. Even in the worst winter, those with short, stocky necks should probably take recourse to other kinds of winter-wear to keep themselves warm, the panel advised. A round neck for those with the prominent collarbones and halters for those with broad shoulders was the expert tip. The strappy look is applicable to everyone, the trio agreed.Girls still thinking of picking up that dangerously low pair of denims should think again. Wear those only if your hip size is 36, not 41 inches like Neha Dhupia, suggested Bobby Sen.Cleopatra call																					 Mineral-based products are the latest buzz, usurping herbal from the hot-seat in the skin and body care market. You can take Cleopatras word for it.																					It has been a year since Mineral, an Israeli company, entered the premium beauty products market in Calcutta. Monica Solanki of Goodlife Healthcare amp; Hygiene, franchisee of the company that claims to use the mud and water of the Dead Sea for its products, was in the city on Monday to talk about the range.The line claims none other than Cleopatra as its brand ambassador, who is believed to have gained exclusive rights to the seas valuable resources. She, apparently, commanded a fleet of pharmaceutics and cosmetic manufacturers to churn out a range of beauty products using Dead Sea ingredients. In fact, the remains of these factories, according to archaeologists, can still be seen along the Dead Sea shores, smiles Solanki.Available at select beauty stores, the products are priced between Rs 150 and Rs 500, including masks, creams, cleansers, soaps, shampoos, shower gels and after-shave lotions that profess to pack in the goodness of the Dead Sea minerals and salts. Magnesium, chloride, bromide, sodium, potassium, calcium and iodine are some of the key minerals listed on the labels, having healing and rejuvenating properties.																					Being the lowest point on the earths surface, mud from the Dead Sea is far richer in minerals than that of other seas and oceans. Besides keeping your skin healthy and fresh, the mud and water also helps treat skin disorders, says Solanki. The high concentration of salts and minerals helps saturate the skin and prevent dryness, whereas a relaxing natural oil found in its waters provides the skin with a soothing, protective film, she elaborates. The Sachin stop at INOX. Picture by Pabitra Das												Charge it up																					 It may be bad manners to keep the beep on in theatres, but INOX is a good place to recharge your batteries if your phone suddenly draws a blank while on the move. Airtel has installed two multi-phone charging stations at the City Centre, Salt Lake, multiplex. Each station comes with eight jacks among which four are Nokia recharging units, with two each for Motorola and Samsung users.																					This is just the beginning. We are planning to plug in Sony users as well and carry the concept forward to other hangouts like clubs, shopping malls, restaurants, hospitals, corporate houses and colleges, said Anupam Verma, chief marketing officer, Airtel.																					The facility is free of charge and is essentially a brand-building measure, to be followed by a slew of offers and promotional activities in association with INOX. Airtel subscribers will receive special tickets for premieres at City Centre, apart from getting reserved bookings for all shows. Booking and movie schedule information is just a call away at 449, the Airtel hotline. There will be games and promotions with movie tickets and other prizes as well.																					INOX is coming up with its own centralised call centre (23584499) for ticket booking and home delivery. This facility is already on at the Elgin Road cineplex and now we are extending it to City Centre as well, promised Gurinderjit Singh, vice president operations, INOX. A model in a revamped garment at Fashion Saloon. Picture by Rashbehari Das 												Haute hospital																					Is your favourite pair of jeans almost in tatters? Or maybe you own a sari thats too close to your heart to throw away. You now have a unique way of revamping your wardrobe without having to shell out too much moolah, thanks to designer Manju Agarwal, who, at the new wing of her boutique Resham, is giving new looks to old clothes.																					The new wing, called Fashion Saloon, is a hospital for clothes, where old and torn clothes are treated to give them a totally new look. If you have garments that are out of fashion, torn, faded, or simply not finding favour with you anymore, all you have to do is give them to Manju, and they will be as good as new in a few days.																					My friends often complain that designer clothes are not coming to use after they have worn them three or four times, as they meet the same people at every party. So, I hit upon this idea. It doesnt cost much and you can get a brand new designer outfit, says Manju.																					Not only is this an economical and fashionable option, it also helps keep up with fashion trends. Straight leg jeans are no longer in style, so I can attach extra pieces of cloth on the sides to make them flared and trendy.																					The main ingredients she uses for the revamp are dyeing, embroidery, prints, patchwork and applique. When I get an old outfit, I first do a hydro treatment to take out the old colour and print. Then it is dyed, after which embroidery or prints are used, explains Manju. The garment can be anything  jeans to skirts, T-shirts to lehngas.																					Many girls want to wear their mothers or grandmothers lehnga for their own weddings. We can alter these according to modern styles, smiles Manju. Old saris can even be converted into a trendy pair of trousers. The service starts at Rs 200 for a pair of jeans and can go up to Rs 3,000 for bridal lehngas or saris.																																													Party favour																					 Big Ben, the pub that the party animals of the city were giving a miss even a month ago, has suddenly become one of the most favoured places around. And nobody quite knows why.																					Last Saturday, the nightclub at The Kenilworth was full to the brim by 11.30 pm, packed with a fair mix of the vibrant and young sweating it out on the dance floor and the older brigade who made the bar their bastion.The lure of Russian dancers performing could have worked as the most important reason for the draw, but the rush was worth the watch. By midnight, when the dancers took the stage dancing to the not-so-Russian number Sikidim (the song is in Arabic), those who couldnt push their way to the first 10 rows of standing men and women were straining to catch whatever they could of the six-foot tall Russian babe. Large screens set up for the benefit of the back-liners acted as the next best option.																					The dance performance was good to pump up the weekend spirit, but the crowd itself was more interested in doing the dance act themselves. A dose of rocking numbers from DJ Saranjit ensured the mood continued till the clock struck 2 am.

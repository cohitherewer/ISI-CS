 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 Life - Feng Shui				 Slow but steady surprise
Feng Shui Pinky KapoorQ: We stay in a duplex-style apartment with a four-step staircase located at the centre of house, which divides the flat into south and north on the upper and lower floor respectively. My sons room is in the south-east corner of the flat, which is on the upper segment, with a window on the southern wall. Is the orientation Feng Shui friendly? If not, kindly suggest changes that do not call for structural changes.																								Priti, via e-mail																								A: Energy from all directions merges and radiates from the centre of the house. And the positioning of the staircase here is disturbing this process in your case. 																								The best way to balance the heavy stairs in the centre and, at the same time, regulate a positive flow of energy that connects the lower floor to the upper floor is by introducing a basket of five elements. Take an earthen shallow pot filled with fresh water and dip a few metal coins in it. Float a few fresh flowers and candles in it to complete the composition of five elements. This arrangement should be kept at each floor for optimum results. 																								South-east is a good direction for the kids room, as this sector is ruled by wood energy which symbolises growth. The area also attracts wealth and prosperity. Since you stay in a duplex, please see to it that there is no kitchen or toilet under the childrens room. Want your fate to turn turtle? A tortoise symbol helps, according to Feng Shui. (Reuters) Q: I have heard its beneficial to hang the picture of a horse on a red scroll. I would like to know about the correct way of doing so. Is it advisable to hang the picture on the south-east wall? There is a big window on the southern wall.																								Besides, a Feng Shui consultant had advised me to keep a tortoise on a metal plate in the northern side of the house facing west and that I should put fresh water on it every day. I have been doing this for a while now but it hasnt helped me much. Please advise whether it will have any adverse effects if I remove the tortoise now. I must mention that I am physically fit but my business is flagging and needs a boost.																								Rita Gomes, via e-mail																								A: A horse is believed to be full of yang (strong) fire. If hung on a red scroll, its energy gets magnified. It should ideally be hung on the southern wall, which is ruled by fire and is connected with name, fame and recognition. If hung on the south-east wall, its ruling wood energy gets exhausted and this could affect your wealth. Its not advisable to hang such a picture in the south-west either as the area signifies stability and the picture of a horse might disturb it. 																								The tortoise should be placed in the north, facing south and it is definitely a powerful symbol for enhancing business, if accompanied by some kind of movement. This can be a water feature, an aquarium or simply a clock with a pendulum. It definitely works if implemented with full faith and on an auspicious day. 																								But if you are still not convinced, you can definitely remove the tortoise without fearing adverse effects.

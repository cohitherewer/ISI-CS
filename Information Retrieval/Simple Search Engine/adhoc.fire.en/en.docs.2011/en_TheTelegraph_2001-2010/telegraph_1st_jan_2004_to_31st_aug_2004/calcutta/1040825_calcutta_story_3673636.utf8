	Play with fire yet play it safe is a game Bollywood has been playing forever. When you have crores at stake on every big film, safeguarding commercial interests is of obvious importance. And thats where the desperate hunt for the right release date comes in. That perfect Friday is what every producer in Bollywood looks for.This year, the Diwali Friday of November 12 is what the biggest makers in tinsel town are banking on. The estimated money at stake -- more than Rs 125 crore.The tentative releases include Yash Chopras untitled love triangle with Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee, Anil Sharmas Big B-starrer Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyon, Abbas-Mustans Aitraaz (starring Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar), Sanjay Guptas multi-starrer Musafir, Priyadarshans new film Hulchul and Ram Gopal Varmas dance drama Naach.The dates may yet change because the last two Diwalis have seen releases going out with a whimper rather than a bang. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan, released on the Diwali Friday in 1999 went on to become big success stories. But in 2002, all four releases  the Tusshar-Kareena starrer Jeena Sirf Merre Liye, Suniel Shetty-Sanjay Dutts Annarth, Govindas Wah Tera Kya Kehna and Somnath Sens Leela  bombed at the box-office. Last Diwali, too, the critically acclaimed Pinjar, Govindas Raja Bhaiyya, Ashmit Patels debut vehicle Inteha and Tannishas first film Sssshhh failed to light up the big screen.How will the dice roll this Diwali?Penelope Cruz: In actionThere are some actresses you are willing to forgive for not being able to, well, act. Whatever you say or do, just be there, you want to tell them. Penelope Cruz is a member of that rare club.So, you can get your cola and your popcorn  or pakora or whatever  because the Spanish beauty is returning to set your small screen on fire  again  along with Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky (Wednesday night on HBO at 9 pm).The film sees Cruz playing will-of-the-wisp woman Sofia, for whom David (Cruise) abandons the alluring but over-the-edge Julie (Cameron Diaz). The film that became famous for sparking off the Cruz-Cruise romance sees David encountering surreal twists and turns in his quest for redemption through true love.Currently, Cruz has two exotic projects in her kitty. She and Salma Hayek play feisty bank robbers in French producer Luc Bessons new production, Bandidas, whose shooting is slated to take off in a few weeks in Mexico. Cruz also stars in the romantic drama Head in the Clouds, where she plays a Spanish Civil War refugee who shares her apartment with a fashion photographer, played by Charlize Theron. Also starring in the film set in the times of World War II is Stuart Townsend, a schoolteacher.Back in her hometown, Cruz opened her first store in the Salamanca area of Madrid this February. The store, run by her long-time friend Mariu Alvarez, sells 10 well-known Californian and European labels. The official launch party for the store is still due  some time this fall.Heres to falling for Cruz, all over again. Move over long winding tales of love and betrayal. Packing a pint-sized punch, short films can tell an equally riveting story in one-fourth the time. This message rang loud and clear at the first Calcutta Short Film Festival organised by Chitrabani in association with Nandan.The four-day meet from August 17-20 held at Nandan II screened 63 films cutting across genres and covering wide-ranging issues otherwise lost in the maze of mainstream cinema. Documentaries and features joined hands, pushing traditional boundaries to come up with brand new forms of cinema. Shot in Mini DV, DV, VHS, Beta Cam, Digi Beta, 16 mm and 35 mm formats, the films explored psychological, political, social, fantastical and surreal themes, usually ignored by the organised film industry.Mostly made by budding directors, the films met with a response that took both organisers and participants by surprise. We got a huge crowd on all four days of the fest, much beyond our expectations. The 210-seater Nandan II proved quite inadequate. Film buffs starved of alternative, meaningful cinema filled every inch of standing and seating space, said Father P.J. Joseph, director, Chitrabani.Churni Ganguly: Face of the festThe response preceding the fest was as enthusiastic. The organisers received over 100 entries that included applications from other parts of the country, and even abroad. There is an immense pool of talented short film-makers in the country. Short-listing the films proved quite a feat, he added.The film-makers in turn welcomed the opportunity to showcase their work on this scale. Veteran film-maker Supriyo Sen, winner of the National Award for best film for environment 2001 and the BFJA 2001 for best documentary, whose 38-minute Nest was screened at the fest, feels such meets are a good initiative, especially for upcoming film-makers. Sen is optimistic the festival will help create a short film culture in Calcutta as is prevalent in other parts of the country, especially Mumbai.For young film-makers like Subhodeep Chanda, whose highly experimental 12-minute work Permutation Combination was screened on the last day, the fest was a godsend. Every short film-maker has been seeking such an organised platform, said Chanda. Making a film on the festival called Breaking the Myths, Chanda feels his brigade has helped shatter the notion that good money makes good films.Given its stupendous success, we plan to hold the festival on a bigger platform next year, promised Ansu Sur, director Nandan. So go on, shoot at sight!Her untiring service has inspired several documentary makers to track her life. On the 94th birth anniversary of Mother Teresa, on August 26, the Ladies Study Group pays her a tribute by screening From Saint to Sainthood.The 22-minute documentary by Payal Mohanka starts with the beatification and explores the selfless service provided by the Missionaries of Charity. I wanted to capture the Mother through the eyes of Calcutta, says Payal, who screened her film at Nehru Centre, London, in May. On August 26, From Saint to Sainthood will be shown at Rotary Sadan, 3.30 pm.

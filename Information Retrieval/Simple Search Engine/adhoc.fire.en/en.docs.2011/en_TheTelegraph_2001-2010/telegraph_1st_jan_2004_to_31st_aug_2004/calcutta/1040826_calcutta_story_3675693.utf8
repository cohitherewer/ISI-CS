 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Mother crushed by bus 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A woman was killed and her physically-challenged daughter had a providential escape when they were knocked off a bicycle her husband was riding. The bicycle was hit from behind by a private bus in Salt Lake on Wednesday evening. 																								Sumitra Ghosh, 25, who was sitting on the carrier, was killed instantly near Tank No. 8. The couple was fetching its daughter from school. 																								At about 4.25 pm, on their way back home, the bicycle was hit by a bus on route 215A. 																								The mother fell in front of the vehicle and was crushed to death instantly. Eight-year-old Shampa, sitting on the bicycle rod, was thrown off and tossed about six feet away. 																								Father Swapan Ghosh escaped with minor injuries. Witnesses said the bus was trying to overtake another on the same route when it hit the trios bicycle.																								Residents of the area, along with local councillor Tulsi Sinha Roy, blocked the road for half an hour, demanding punishment of the driver and restrictions on buses plying on the stretch. 																								There are too many buses running on route 215A and 71. They are all Howrah-bound and there is a lot of competition among them, complained a local resident. 																								Sinha Roy, councillor of Salt Lake municipalitys ward 12, where the accident occurred, said residents had been trying to highlight the problem of speeding buses for a long time, but to no avail.

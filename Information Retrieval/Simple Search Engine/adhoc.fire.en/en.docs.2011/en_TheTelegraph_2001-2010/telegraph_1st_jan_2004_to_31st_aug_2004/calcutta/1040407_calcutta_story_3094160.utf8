The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Image, reality and the city
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sheth: Less heritage, more IIT. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								For a big push to brand Bengal, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government should try and organise mega conferences and conventions in the city and give people the chance to see for themselves the progress made. Spending resources on media campaigns will do very little in changing the image. 																								The above views are of Jagdish N. Sheth, one of the leading marketing gurus in the world. 																								Instead of running campaigns, the government should try and bring people back to Calcutta. I didnt know before coming here that so much has changed in the city, said the former Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) professor. 																								Sheth was in town to hold a two-day brand management workshop, organised by the IIMC Alumni Association. On the sidelines of The Telegraph and Businessworld event, the H. Kellstadt professor of marketing at the Goizueta Business School of Emory University said: In case of Calcutta, reality is better than the image. 																								But the India Shining campaign, according to Sheth, is an exaggeration. 																								He stressed, however, that brand India would become stronger in the days to come and US procurement from India will go up by leaps and bounds. Indian brands, like Amul and Tata Tea, will soon dominate the global marketplace, observed Sheth. 																								The problem with the Indian corporate sector is that we dont have scale and I think there should be more internal mergers and acquisitions to reap the benefits of scale, added Sheth, who sits on the boards of companies like Wipro and advises AT amp;T, Motorola and Nortel Networks. 																								According to him, being competitive is the most important step towards building a brand.																								But sustaining the strength of a brand is easier said than done and according to him, ownership of a company and its management should be separated as part of a transparent corporate governance practice to avoid cases like Enron and WorldCom in India.																								The author of over 60 books and over 200 academic journals also suggested: The less we promote our culture and heritage, the better for us. Lets talk more about the IITs. 																								But too much of focus on IT and business process outsourcing will go against the Indian capabilities in so-called mundane areas, like skills in nursing and excellence in hospitality and manufacturing.

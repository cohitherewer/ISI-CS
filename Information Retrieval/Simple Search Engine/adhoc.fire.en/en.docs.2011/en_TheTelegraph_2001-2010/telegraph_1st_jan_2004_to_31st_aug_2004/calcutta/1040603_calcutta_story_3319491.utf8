 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Service roads to ease Bypass load
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed at the rising number of accidents on the EM Bypass and a boom in building activity, the government has decided to lay service roads along the artery.																								Besides, the urban development department has decided to further widen the Bypass to turn the entire stretch, from Ultadanga to Kamalgazi, into an eight-lane connector. At present, the Bypass is six-lane and in some stretches, four.																								The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which maintains the road, will implement the project for both building the service roads and widening the main thoroughfare. The service roads will cost about Rs 5 crore.																								According to CMDA officials, in the first phase, a service road will be built on the stretch between the Maniktala Main Road crossing and the Beleghata Main Road crossing. 																								In the second phase, work will be taken up to Parama island (Park Circus connector) and then extended further south.																								Vehicles that will take a left turn to go to any place off the Bypass will have to take the service road, and those that do not want to take any bylane will keep to the main road.																								We have already finalised the project and completed all the formalities. Construction work for the first phase is expected to start soon, CMDA officials said.																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the Bypass could be called the gateway to the city. The thrust is on improving and widening the road for a hassle-free journey. The road, which stretched from Ultadanga to Garia, has already been extended to Kamalgazi, near Sonarpur, and it will be further extended, minister Bhattacharya said. 																								The widened Bypass and service roads will help cope with the vehicular rush, he explained.																								The minister said traffic congestion would reduce to some extent on the Bypass after the flyover connecting it with New Township Road is completed. We expect to open the flyover to the public within a couple of months, Bhattacharya said.																								CMDAs director of project planning Tushar Mitra said: A large number of residential and commercial complexes have already come up on both sides of the Bypass. Besides, construction of many housing and other projects is in progress. Both human and vehicular population in the region is increasing rapidly. As a result, the number of accidents is also on the rise.																								He added: We expect that the rate of accidents will drop and there will be speedy vehicular movement after the construction of service road.																								 Besides, he said, the divider will be beautified and modern traffic lights installed at major crossings on the Bypass.

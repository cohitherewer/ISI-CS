 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Crusader and a popular prankster 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He was popular among his friends and in the neighbourhood. Everyone knew him as someone they could turn to when in trouble. He would do his bit and more.																								He was someone who would never hold back when there was a point to be made at a public platform in the locality, and he wouldnt pull his punches if trouble broke out in the locality.																								On Sunday, as Shibendu Saha was stretchered out  along with six members of his family he had allegedly killed  the Tollygunge para he had lived and died in went into shock.																								I cannot imagine how Shankar (as Shibendu was popularly known) could carry out such a ghastly act. I am shocked at the thought of him doing all this in such a cold-blooded manner, as if everything was pre-planned How could he kill those lovely little children of his? Didnt he pause, even for a moment, before he poisoned them? wondered Anjan Das, an elderly neighbour of the Sahas, before his eyes filled with tears and he choked on his words.																								Shibendus friends were all shocked by the tragedy that the neighbourhood woke up to on Sunday morning.																								Nabarun Dey, a friend, admitted that Shibendu was short-tempered, but added that no one in their friends circle had any inkling that he was capable of such a cruel act.																								He was always bursting with energy from childhood. In our younger days, he would turn up every evening to play football at the local park and he was also the main prankster in the group But if anyone poked fun at him, he would invariably get into a quarrel or a fight and would sometimes storm out of the ground, recounted Dey.																								According to another friend, who refused to be named, Shibendu would often lose his temper, but he never behaved badly with anyone. We went to the same school. He was a caring sort who would always volunteer to help someone in need Something must have gone terribly wrong last night for him to have acted the way he did  that is, if he really did it, stressed Shibendus childhood friend.

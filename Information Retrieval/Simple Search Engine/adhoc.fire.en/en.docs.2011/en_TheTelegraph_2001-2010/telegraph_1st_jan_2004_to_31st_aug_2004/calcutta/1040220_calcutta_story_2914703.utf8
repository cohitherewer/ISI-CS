The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, February 20, 2004 Between the Covers / Harshvardhan Neotia - Industrialist																								What book are you reading at the moment? 																								Right now, there are two books that have all my attention  one, Buddha by Karen Armstrong, and the other, The Future of Freedom by Fareed Zakaria, which Im just about halfway through. While the first one is a former Catholic nuns biography of Buddha and his process of self-discovery, in the latter, Fareed tries to take a look at the critical issues confronting the world in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. 																								What books or magazines would we find on your bedside table? 																								My bedside table is heaped with a selection of books that are close to my heart, prominent among them being Swami Chinmayanandas commentary and translation of the Bhagwad Gita in English, a few pages of which I try and read every other day. This apart, it also has an assortment of other motivational books and leaflets as well as some of my favourite magazines BusinessWorld, India Today and Outlook. 																								Which is your favourite book ever? 																								When it comes to fiction, I would have to say that its The Fountainhead because its a subject closely related to the work I do. The story of Howard Roarke, an architect who struggles to get his concepts accepted on his own terms, the hostility of the environment, his uncompromising attitude and his various trials and tribulations, has been dealt with so brilliantly that it remains one of my all-time favourite reads. In non-fiction, its Mahatma Gandhis My Experiments with Truth that I like the best, the story of a real life person, who also happens to be one of my role models. 																								If you could save one book from your library, which would it be? 																								Definitely, the Bhagwad Gita, as I value the contents of that particular book above all others. 																								What would you like to read on a flight? 																								Usually on a flight, I just carry along whatever book or magazine I happen to be reading at the moment. Occasionally, I also pick up some lifestyle magazines such as Architectural Digest, Inside Outside or even India Today Plus that help me stay abreast of prevailing trends, something I need to do in my field of work. 																								Rate the best books you read last year. 																								I read quite a few books last year, of which Good To Great, a research book on companies that have excelled in their respective fields, Sam Waltons Made in America, tracing his journey from a management trainee at a J.C. Penny store to the creator of Americas largest chain of supermarkets and Maverick by Richard Semler dealing with a Brazilian company that has made it to the top by virtue of innovative HRD strategies are the ones that left a lasting impression. These apart, Walt Disneys biography and Gita Mehtas A River Sutra were also highly stimulating, the last one specially being quite off the beaten track. 																								What books do you like to re-read? 																								I usually try and make time to re-read any book, which carries a special message. The Bhagwad Gita, for instance, is one book that I keep re-reading as is My Experiments With Truth, while Good to Great is another book I turn to whenever I feel like including something from it in any of my communications. 																								Which is the best book you read as a child? 																								To be honest, I wasnt really much of a reader as a child though I did enjoy Aesops Fables and the Panchatantra. In fact, I have a wonderfully-illustrated copy of the book still around somewhere, which I keep meaning to dig out for my son. And of course, I was a great fan of the Amar Chitra Katha series, so much so, that I probably had the most enviable collection around. 																								What books would you recommend to children? 																								While Im well aware that theres plenty available by way of childrens literature and even television programming nowadays, Im not really that much in touch with it all. Which is why, Id recommend everything that I had grown up reading for them as well. 																								What kind of book would you like to write? 																								Im not very sure Id have too many takers for any book I wrote now, but seriously speaking, given a chance, Id like to write one on housing and urban development. Ive spent the last 15 years working in this field and quite naturally, besides being extremely passionate about the subject, I have acquired a certain level of knowledge and insight. And though I do feel that right now its not enough for writing a book, I may do so some time in the future. 						AS TOLD TO SREERADHA DASGUPTA

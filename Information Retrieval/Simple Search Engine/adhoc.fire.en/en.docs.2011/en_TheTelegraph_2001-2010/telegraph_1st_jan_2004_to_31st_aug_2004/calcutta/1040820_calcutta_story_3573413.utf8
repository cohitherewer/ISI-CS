RITU RULES
Ritu KumarRITU KUMAR UNVEILS THE RULES OF POWER DRESSING IN INDIAToday, in the Indian fashion world, like all things new and comparatively alien, we are trying to define a number of things with western terminology. One of these is corporate fashion. This, in fact, is loosely translated into  what do women in India wear to work? Is there a predominant look that could be defined as Indian power dressing? In western society, the corporate image of women has been fairly standardised. This phenomenon is not only true of Europe and the U.S. of A., but of all countries which have been westernised by a corporate culture, for example Japan, China and Mexico.  The salwar kameez has emerged the second winner when it comes to work wear of the Indian woman All over the world, women in the corporate world wear business suits. The dress code is strictly adhered to and consists of the jacket, normally single breasted, knee length skirts or sometimes trousers, with no-nonsense shirts with or without collars. These are worn with stockings and sensible shoes, mainly in navy or black. A refined minimal, almost masculine look that particularly suits colder climates or air-conditioned interiors. This international corporate identity is seen only in niche areas in India, like the occasional airline or hotel uniform. As an independent choice of apparel it has not proved very popular for most working women. It is perhaps due to the fact that the clothing is alien to the Indian psyche that it has not been widely accepted. I have heard people say that the business-suit is not flattering to most Indian figures, also it seems impractical for both our climate and society. It is perhaps also due to the fact that Indian women still retain a strong individuality and will not be dictated to in matters of personal clothing. Whatever the reason, blending this tenacity with ingenuity, corporate wear in India has found a handwriting all its own. The ancient unstitched garment of India  the sari  has emerged as the winner for the corporate women of India. The sari, originally worn in the privacy of homes till a 100 years back, made its debut socially in the last century. Today, in its not-so-sexy avatar, it has changed into a formal, pleated, folded, prim yet elegant ensemble, usually accompanied with a rather no-nonsense half-sleeved, demurely cut blouse. The design in most cases has changed from the formal heavily woven or embellished version to printed geometric silk saris in elegant monochromatic colours.Many a visitor to India is prepared for its diversity in culture and exotic destinations, but few can be prepared for the richness of the country as is portrayed in the way the Indian woman dresses herself. This is in myriad roles  a politician, a writer or an airline attendant  as she sits behind her computer, or sails through boardrooms in a wonderful blend of indigenous identity and feminine expression. Exotic as the above sounds, the down side of it is that a sari is not always convenient, no matter how good it looks.The second winner in power dressing is the two to three piece salwar/chooridaar /pant/kurta/odhni combination. High on individual expression, comfortable in all offices and in society, it is the front runner, which might substitute the sari for its sheer practicality. The country has too much diversity even in its urban context to look for any standardisation. Indian women do not take minimalism too seriously. Our traditional clothing given a contemporary twist will survive most dictates of the corporate sector. The key to Indian power dressing is the ability to ensure that your ensemble reflects your personality. It will then fit into your work place  it is not what you wear that is important  but how confidently you wear it. It is called attitude.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								The anti-rowdy wing of the detective department arrested promoter Pradip Kundalia from his Puddapukur apartment on Tuesday evening.																								Kundalia was picked up on the basis of a complaint lodged by the fire services directorate three months ago in the wake of a blaze at Kundalia Towers, on Shakespeare Sarani.																								Charges of gross negligence had been levelled against Kundalia, secretary of the buildings residents association, and its president S.L. Thard.																								Deputy commissioner of police (south) Anuj Sharma had asked the local police station to round up Kundalia and Thard. But no action was taken until Tuesday.																								We were asked to wait for the forensic report before carrying out the arrests. We received the report a few days ago and so, Kundalia was arrested on Tuesday, said an officer of the detective department.																								Two parallel raids were carried out at his Bhowanipore residence and the apartment in Puddapukur, where he lives on the top floor of a private nursing home, he added.																								Around 1.30 pm on May 16, a mysterious fire broke out on the ground floor of Kundalia Towers and spread swiftly to the 10th floor through the electrical wires. Fortunately, all residents of the highrise could be evacuated, but the fire-fighting personnel found that the fire escape route was locked and the fire-fighting devices could not be used due to poor maintenance.																								Flat-owners told the police that despite repeated complaints about the ill-maintained fire-fighting devices, the apartment committee did nothing. 																								The fire brigade then filed a complaint against the two office-bearers of the buildings association at Shakespeare Sarani police station. 																								The complaints were lodged under Section 11C of the Fire Services Act and the Fire Prevention Act, 1996, for alleged non-compliance with the fire-safety norms.

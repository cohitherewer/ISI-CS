The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 Sip, smoke and snip
Screen On amp; OffShes enjoying a long break from lights-camera-action  just what she has been wanting for some time now. Whats more, shes engaged in a fascinating theatrical journey back home, with friends. Yet, theres something that is troubling Konkona Sen Sharma.No, were not turning to Page 3. Konkonas concern is Manu Rewals Chai Pani etc (also her second English feature film) that has the Chennai censor board armed and dangerous, raring to chop off a vital scene.The censor board is crying foul over a sequence featuring Konkona smoking a cigarette in Rewals satirical look at young people and their relationships. This has come as a shock because we didnt try to justify or glamourise smoking. The censor board has a problem with this scene but not with one of the most glamorous stars, Kareena Kapoor, lighting a cigarette in Chameli! The interpretation is highly arbitrary, rues the Mumbai-based award-winning documentary film-maker.I dont understand how the censor board can have a problem with a smoking scene, exclaims Konkona.Incidentally, Chai Pani etc is the tale of a young documentary film-maker who runs into censor trouble, and deals with the corruption that starts from the lower rungs of bureaucracy.The film has fallen under the Chennai censor boards purview as it was processed at Prasad Labs, located in the Tamil Nadu capital. The Chennai censor board has also gagged a few four-letter words and agreed to pass two kissing scenes of 30 seconds each, but only with an A certificate.This is even more ridiculous as the censors dont have a problem with films showing rain-drenched women in clinging saris, grumbles Rewal.Konkona is in a double role opposite Zafar Karachiwala, a Mumbai-based stage actor. Konkona plays Zafars two love interests. The hair, makeup, body language, walking style or the way they talk  everything is different. Whats more, the foreign audience at Cannes Film Festival, where Chai Pani etc was screened early this year, couldnt even make out that she was the same girl Konkona is definitely the best actress in her age group, feels Rewal.But the dual role drama does have a purpose beyond the predictable. I wanted to subvert the conventional bad girl-good girl image by bringing them into conflict. The scene the censors have objected to finds one Konkona lighting up, and the other Konkona asking her to refrain from smoking. So, this is a key confrontation between the two, adds Rewal, who has appealed to the national tribunal and is hopeful of a hassle-free release by the end of the year.RESHMI SENGUPTA

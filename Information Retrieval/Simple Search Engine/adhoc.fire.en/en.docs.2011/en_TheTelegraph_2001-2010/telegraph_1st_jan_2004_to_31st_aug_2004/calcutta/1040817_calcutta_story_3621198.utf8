The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Campus scan on scholar attack
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta University (CU) ordered a probe on Monday into an unusual incident of peer-violence involving research scholars. 																								The incident took place on Friday night, when a group of outsiders, allegedly led by a former research scholar, stormed a laboratory of CUs physiology department on the Rajabazar Science College campus and threatened to kill a scholar if he did not wind up his research programme and leave the university immediately.																								Sources say the scholar who was attacked is engaged in a number of remarkable research projects, involving one on discovery of medicines for cancer and another on prevention of cerebral thrombosis. 																								He has been a target of attack by some people from within the campus for the past few months, reportedly for his success in research. 																								A university official said: We are worried. Never in the past did we have such incidents, in which rivalry between scholars had taken such an extreme turn. We are trying to find out whether any insider was involved. Stern action will be taken against the guilty. 																								The authorities will hand over the case to the police after the internal inquiry is over. According to the universitys rules, the authorities can seek police intervention only if an internal probe finds any evidence of foul play. 																								Students, teachers and research scholars of the physiology department have already lodged a complaint with the authorities and demanded police investigation into the assault. 																								The incident has come as a shock to all research scholars and scientists of the university who have to work on their projects till late in the evening. They are planning to demand a beef-up in the universitys security arrangements, especially after sundown. 																								The scholar who was assaulted spoke to Metro on condition of anonymity. I was working on a very important experiment on Friday. Around 8 pm, a group of men  all outsiders  barged into my laboratory and asked me to follow them. 																								They took me to another laboratory of the department and started abusing me. Later, they threatened to murder me if I did not quit the university immediately, he said.																								Vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee refused to comment on the sensitive matter. He said he would be able to elaborate on it only after getting the report of the internal probe. 																								Officials inquiring into the matter said the authorities had taken a hard stand on the issue. Each and every student, teacher and scholar is expected to contribute to the universitys research activities. Stern action will be taken against those whore trying to destroy the sanctity of the institution, asserted an official.

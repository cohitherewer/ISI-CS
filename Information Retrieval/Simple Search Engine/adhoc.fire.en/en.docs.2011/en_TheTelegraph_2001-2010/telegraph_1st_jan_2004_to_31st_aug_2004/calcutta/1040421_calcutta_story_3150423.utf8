The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Queen Elizabeth II Mars and Jupiter make you friendly, happy and pleasant to be with. You have ambition and talent but lack direction and purpose. Success and fame are yours, but later in life. Stop doubting others. Your arrogance and self-pride wont let you brook the slightest interference.  Kusum Bhandari

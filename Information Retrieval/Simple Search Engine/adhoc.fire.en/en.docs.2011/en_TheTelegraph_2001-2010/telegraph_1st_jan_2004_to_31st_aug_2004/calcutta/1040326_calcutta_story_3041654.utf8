 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Seven sleuths on duty in distress
 															- High-profile policing minus infrastructure to match A STAFF REPORTER																								Seven men, no cars and no sophisticated weapons  but called Special Operation Group (SOG), a specialised wing of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that takes care of high-profile cases across the state.																								The SOG, presently handling the Khadims abduction case, has to make do with infrastructure that does not match the profile of the cases it handles.																								Raised to prevent terrorist activity across the state, the SOG was to match the task forces of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. It started operations when S.I.S. Ahmed was additional director-general of the CID with two sub-inspectors and three assistant sub-inspectors. 																								Trouble for the group started in February last year. The state government, in the midst of a cost-cutting programme, decided to cancel at least 40 cars that the CID had hired for its officers. Since then, the SOG men have no option but to take public transport if they need to go anywhere on official purpose.																								If we need to go to a remote spot in South 24-Parganas to gather information, we have to take a bus. Even after getting off at the nearest bus stop, we have to walk miles to reach our destination, said an SOG officer, adding: Its terrible. The governments decision may have helped it save funds, but it is affecting CID work.																								When conducting a risky raid, it depends entirely on the CID top brass whether the officers will be provided with a vehicle or not. We handle high-profile abductions, murders and other organised crime. We have to convince three deputy inspectors-general (DIGs) to be allowed to use their office car. If they have some personal assignment, we cancel the raid, said another SOG officer. 																								With the rise in high-tech crime, we need to be more accurate and swift. Without a vehicle, how do we go about it? he asked.																								The SOG now has two inspectors, three sub-inspectors and two constables. And three of them have been assigned for supervising the trial in the Khadims abduction case.																								The weapons the SOG men use do not match the nature of crime and criminals they have to deal with. No nine-mm revolvers and not even a pistol. We still depend on decades-old, six-chamber revolvers, complained one of them.																								So, the sleuths have taken to telephone monitoring, instead of travelling out. Everyone knows thats no way to gather intelligence. But it is not possible for us to make a crowded bus journey for over two hours to reach a spot, said the officer.																								One of the three DIGs, who preferred anonymity, said: It was a government decision. It should have spoken to the CID top brass before taking the decision. Funds may have been saved, but it has been a loss in terms of active policing.

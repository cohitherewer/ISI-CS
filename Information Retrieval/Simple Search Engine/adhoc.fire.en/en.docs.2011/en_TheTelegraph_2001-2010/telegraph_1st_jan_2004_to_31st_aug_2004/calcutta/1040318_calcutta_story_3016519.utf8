 Question of custody: Kids at a Montessori school Apropos the report Teachers on contract for new CU courses (Feb. 21), it is doubtful if appointing lecturers on a contractual system for a year will serve the real purpose of educating students aspiring to take up new subjects. By advertising in just the city dailies, there is less possibility of getting the right person for the job. Though the lecturers are appointed on contract, renewable every year, there always remains the risk of infiltration of inept candidates if the range of choice is limited. Incompetent teaching even for one year can push back a student in his career path. Perhaps, it would be more prudent if teachers for new departments like information technology, bio-technology, journalism, mass communication computer science and business administration are experienced people who can tackle the new subjects and will be able to create interest of the students in the subject. This will give the new departments a healthy start.  An independent selection committee comprising recognised academics should be given a free hand to look far and wide for teaching talent. This will make for a transparent system. Sunil Banerjee,
VIP Road. Apropos the report Training school for Montessori teachers on February 16, nowadays establishing a kindergarten school has become a good business proposition. In view of the mushrooming growth of kindergarten schools, the lack of trained teachers is keenly felt. Teaching kids in their shaping years is an uphill task and teachers without adequate expertise may do more harm than good. Piyal Mukherjee, 
Lake Town. It is scary how frequently businessmen are abducted by extortionists when the former refuse to succumb to their demands (Ransom rules in business hub, Feb. 18). Of course, in many cases, unscrupulous businessmen are targeted because of their breach of commitment in their dealings with criminals. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seeing Bengal as an oasis has boosted the morals and activities of gangsters. We, common people, are the helpless spectators. Govinda Bakshi,
Budge Budge. The report Torture tale in lost and found (Feb 19) was an alarming read. A 13-year-old girl has been physically and mentally abused to settle scores with her father. The presence of a big gang with political patronage is indicated in the story. Are our women safe? Kunal Ray, 
Santragachhi. Thank you for the informative report on the newly-built Mahalaxmi Temple at Diamond Harbour Road (Pilgrims progress in temple war, Feb. 21). In the same context, I would like to draw your attention to the inappropriate language used to describe a place of worship. You should consider the religious sentiments of people before using such words. Sudhir Vyas, 
Netaji Subhas Road. We have seen a lot eviction in the past few years (Mini coup cements canal bank ouster, Feb. 19). Another drive will start along the banks of Tollys Nullah. Forced eviction is a gross violation of human rights. They should have proper rehabilitation. Sachindra Nath Mitra,
Beleghata. Caning at school has been banned by law (Cane fear keeps kid home, Feb. 20). In case of any serious offence, the guardians should be informed. The school authorities should issue a code of conduct for teachers. Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
Behala.It is surprising that the CU authorities after revising the English syllabus last year have reverted to the old version (Omit the new, ring in the old, Feb. 17). Such a retrograde step will affect students. Rabindranath Kar,
Sankar Ghosh Lane. It is a relief that the markets would be shifted. (Offer to move three markets, Feb. 19). The lorries will not enter the city and create traffic jam. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum Park.

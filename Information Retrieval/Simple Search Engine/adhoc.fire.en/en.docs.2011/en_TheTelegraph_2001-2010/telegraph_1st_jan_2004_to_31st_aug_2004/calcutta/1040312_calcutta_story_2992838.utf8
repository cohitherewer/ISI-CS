 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Feel-good brigade for elderly and ailing
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Kalyan Chatterjee (name changed) lives in Salt Lakes DB block. A septuagenarian, he lies in bed most of the day, recovering from a stroke. His son has hardly any time for him. Till a few days ago, Chatterjee had only his wife to talk to.																								However, Chatterjee and others of his age-group  many of them living alone, with their wards settled far away  have decided to feel good, with help from the Salt Lake Senior Citizens Association. 																								The association will provide more pro-active assistance for the old people of the township by setting up a day-care centre, with help from a private hospital.																								We will approach the state urban development department for a small plot in Salt Lake and set up the day-care centre, said Ajit Chakraborty, association secretary. 																								The association, with 40 members, meets every morning at the BA-CA park and tries to extend a helping hand to others like Chatterjee. Till we get the land, we will request the municipality to provide us with a patch in the park as a temporary arrangement, Chakraborty said.																								The association is planning to bring doctors and other consultants to the centre at regular intervals to solve the various lifestyle problems faced by the elderly people. 																								Although nearly 15 per cent of the townships population is above 65, there is no proper healthcare facilities for them. 																								The association has approached a private hospital in Salt Lake to come forward to their aid. The association members have held talks with Suraksha for providing free medical consultancy to the elderly. 																								We had initiated a geriatric ward at Bidhannagar State General Hospital earlier. It was planned that eight consultants would attend. But the project did not take off, said Chakraborty. As the authorities would not do anything, we had to take up the initiative. So, we talked with Suraksha, he added.																								The idea is to form a forum for the senior citizens. We will provide the medical infrastructure, said Somnath Chatterjee, chief executive officer of Suraksha. The active members of the forum will be asked to coordinate between the hospital and the senior citizens. 																								We already have a night ambulance service. Besides, we have asked them to organise camps in parks across Salt Lake, where our cardiologists and other medical practitioners can attend to them, Chatterjee said. 																								He feels money will not be a problem. Every day, on an average, we attend to about seven elderly patients. Many of them are extremely lonely, as their children are away. Some dont want to return home even after being discharged from the hospital, said the Suraksha CEO.																								Association members feel that apart from health security, what is required is a sense of social security. It is extremely important to make the elderly feel that they are not alone, said Debabrata Mondal, the youngest member of the association.

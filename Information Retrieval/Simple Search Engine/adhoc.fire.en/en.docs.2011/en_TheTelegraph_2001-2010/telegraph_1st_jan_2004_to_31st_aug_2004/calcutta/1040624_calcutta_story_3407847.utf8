 Remains of the day: After the fire at Dasgupta amp; Co I was elated to know that Calcutta has outshone most other cities this time not only in the CBSE results but in ICSE and ISC as well (Schools high success grades, May 27). The story made a good read but I was surprised that the fate or trauma of the huge bunch of discontented students did not find a place in the article.  Though the pass percentage has crossed 90 this time, there still remains a large section of students which is displeased with its marks. These are the ones whose results have failed to meet their expectations.  I feel, along with highlighting the successful students, it is the medias social responsibility to give the unfortunate ones a chance to voice their grievances against the system.  It is clear that some form of average marking has gone into the Board results this time, especially in the ISC. This has resulted in undeserving candidates, who could not clear their class tests, scoring more than 70 per cent. Simultaneously, there have been cases of worthy pupils getting much less than what they should.  I will appear for the ISC finals next year and the present situation worries me no end. No matter how hard I work, there is very little I can do if something goes wrong with the correction of my answer-scripts. Kunal Ray, 
Santragachhi The headline 118 yrs razed in an hour, on the morning of May 31, shocked and saddened old-timers like me. Dasgupta amp; Co was not only the best bookshop in the city, it was a pilgrimage for booklovers. It is unfortunate that just an hours fire ended a chapter in the citys history. Anil Kumar Sen, 
Ram Chandra Chatterjee LaneApropos the report Patient spurns tout, surgery denied, May 26, it is alarming to note the undesirable state of affairs prevailing in government hospitals today. A tacit understanding exists between the doctors and the touts to put pressure on the relatives of the patient. Such rackets should be busted and the guilty punished. Debaprasad Mukherjee,
Nayapatty Road Apropos the report Red alert: green zone turns grey, May 17, it is a matter of concern that underground water reserves in the city are getting drastically reduced because of our indiscreet use. Under such circumstances, the importance of rain water conservation has assumed increased significance. Multi-storeyed buildings should incorporate rain water conservation as part of their building plans. Piyal Mukherjee,
Lake TownThe article Vacation cry shuts courts, May 28, was interesting. With such a lot of pending cases in Calcutta High Court, in the interests of the people, the workers there should sacrifice 50 per cent of their present holidays. Once the pending cases are within controllable limits, they may revert to the present system of leave options. S. Mitra,
Address not givenApropos the report Puff peril for her: stroke and cancer May 25, it is alarming that in these days of womens lib, some women have taken up smoking unaware of the potential dangers involved in the habit. It is well-known that women are cancer-prone. They should be careful about smoking, for their own good. Rabindra Nath Kar, 
Sankar Ghosh Lane The report Patients rob doctors fees, May 15, mentions how four dacoits, in the guise of patients, looted Dr Sunil Baran Pals clinic in Baruipur. No wonder, many doctors refuse to treat patients after 9 pm. Residents, with the help of the administration in Baruipur, must track down the culprits and hand them over to the police. A few more incidents of this nature might severely hamper medical facilities in the area. Bhupen Bose, 
Dum Dum ParkThe Anandabazar food stall in the ongoing Orissa festival at Swabhumi was wrongly mentioned as the ABP stall in the 21 June edition of Metro Goodlife in the article entitled City host to neighbours pride pageant. Also, apropos Techtalk on June 20, Jamo PJHCS4000A is available at Promises Instruments and not Pioneer Instruments, as mentioned.

 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Ransom ruse by sleuth
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Officers of the anti-rowdy section of Calcutta Police arrested Tapas Saha, 36, on Monday, for attempting to swindle a family in the guise of a private detective. 																								Somnath Sinha, a reader of drama at Rabindra Bharati University, had been receiving calls from an unidentified man, threatening to kidnap his eight-year-old daughter, a student of Patha Bhavan, if he failed to cough up Rs 3 lakh. Sinha, who lives with his in-laws in Jodhpur Park, went to the police, who decided to trap the culprit. 																								On Monday, the caller demanded that the money be brought to the taxi stand at Sealdah station. Sleuths followed Sinha, and collared Saha there. 																								During interrogation, Saha, a resident of Subhasgram, in South 24-Parganas, said he had passed his Madhyamik from Mitra Institution in 1984. He advertised his services as a private detective. Sinhas father-in-law hired him to recover some debts. 																								Saha gained entry into the Sinha household and, after six months, the threat calls followed. But on Monday, sleuths cuffed him with the money.

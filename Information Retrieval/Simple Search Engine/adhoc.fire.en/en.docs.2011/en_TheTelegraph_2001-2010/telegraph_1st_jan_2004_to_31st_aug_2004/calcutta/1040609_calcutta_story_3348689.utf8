 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Litter pile on flyover approach
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has asked the state public works department (PWD) to seal the Picnic Garden Road-end of the proposed Bondel Gate flyover as local people have turned the approach road on that side of the flyover into a dumping ground.																								The heaps of garbage let off a stink, and after a heavy shower, the refuse would slide down the road, flowing down the slope of the flyover, he said.																								Since it is not a designated point for a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) vat, conservancy workers dont remove the garbage dumped there, said mayor-in-council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb. Work on the Bondel Gate flyover has continued for the past 10 years and is not over yet, though the approach road at its Bondel Gate-end has been ready for years. 																								The nuisance of dumping garbage there can be checked only by raising a wall to seal the free access to the approach road, Deb said.																								The Bondel Gate flyover had been conceived by the PWD to offer another connector to the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass for vehicular traffic between Bridge No. 4 at Park Circus and Bijon Setu at Gariahat. Mukherjee asked Deb to employ more overseers to check conservancy services following complaints from different areas. We have already taken steps against three conservancy officers, as they were absent without notice, said Deb.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Kidnap case bail adjourned
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday adjourned its verdict on a petition filed by Akib Ali Khan and Mohammad Salamuddin, two associates of Aftab Ansari. They had been arrested in Rajasthan and Haryana, respectively, for their alleged involvement in the Khadims abduction case. 																								Petitioners lawyer Asim Roy told the court his clients were arrested in December 2001 and a sub-divisional judicial magistrates court in Alipore granted them bail February 2002. The petitioners furnished their bail bonds in August 2002 but the state government did not allow them to leave the jail.																								The lawyer said the police had told the duo it was wanted in a case filed in Gujarat and would have to be produced there. Since then, they have been rotting in Alipore jail.																								Opposing the bail prayer, state public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah told the court that these two men were key accused in the Parthapratim Roy Burman abduction case. The abduction was carried out in July 2001 and these men were arrested in December the same year. It is true that they got bail from a subordinate court but prior to that, the Gujarat police asked their West Bengal counterparts to bring the duo to their state in connection with a separate case there.																								Kazi told the court that within few days, the trial of the abduction case would start and the presence of these men was important during the hearings. So, they should not be allowed to leave the city immediately

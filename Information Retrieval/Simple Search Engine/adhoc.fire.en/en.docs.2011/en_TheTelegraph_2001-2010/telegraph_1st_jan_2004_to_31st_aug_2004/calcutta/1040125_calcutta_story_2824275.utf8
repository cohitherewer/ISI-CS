 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Grade switch in CBSE school exams
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) may replace the system of allotting marks with grades in examinations up to Class X from the next academic session, said board chairman Ashok Ganguly on Saturday. 																								We will do away with the system of allotting marks and offer grades instead on the basis of a students overall performance. This may be given effect to from the next academic session and we are speaking to officials of other boards on the issue. They are expected to follow a similar system, said Ganguly at an all-Bengal CBSE principals meet in Birla High School. He assured that it would not be difficult for CBSE students to switch to other boards as the grade system will be a comprehensive one.																								The CBSE has also decided to abolish terminal examinations till Class VIII. Moreover, there would not be any pass or fail system till Class V. If students fail in these classes, it must be understood that the fault lies not with them but in our system, Ganguly explained, adding that evaluation would be done throughout the year.																								In order to upgrade the curriculum and draw in students of other nationalities, the CBSE is introducing new courses, some of which are already being taught in the lower classes. 																								We have introduced biotechnology, life skill education and web-designing at the Plus II level. We want to include fashion studies at that stage and the course has been worked out in collaboration with the National Institute of Fashion Technology, Ganguly added. 																								Disaster management studies, already introduced in Class VIII, will be continued in Class IX from this year. Life skill education will be started in Class VII from the next academic session and will be taught up to Class IX.

Ace fashion photographer Subi Samuel shares a few tips on how to build the perfect portfolio]STRIKE A POSE Subi SamuelThe most important part of creating a portfolio is choosing the right photographer. This, for a beginner who doesnt know too many people in the circuit, might be slightly difficult. One has to look around a lot and ask people who are in related professions like experienced models, designers, choreographers or make-up artistes before drawing up a list of the final four.Then, its best to go and meet all of them personally and check out if they match your wavelength. They might all be renowned photographers, but might not be able to deliver what you want. For instance, somebody might be an expert in shooting glamorous snaps, but you might want a girl-next-door look. Always go for a reputed photographer because a big name attaches more credibility to your portfolio. When the designers or model co-ordinators see a portfolio shot by somebody renowned, they are more likely to take a second look. After you decide on a photographer, fix a time for the shoot after about 15 days. Go on a strict diet during this time, cutting out all oily and junk food, so that your skin glows by the time you do the shoot. If you are an aspiring model, you must be already working out and have a well-toned body, but the photographer might ask you to work on certain areas. Also, you might need a haircut or different hairdo. Do all that fine-tuning in the meantime so you look your best during the shoot. Decide the kind of image you would want to project through your portfolio. If you are keen on ramp modelling, you have to get some really glamorous shots so the designers will trust that you have the looks to carry off high-fashion clothes. So, in that case, get a few wacky shots done as well. On the other hand, if you are interested in media modelling, project a simple and casual look because advertisement campaigns usually require real looking people. During the shoot, your wardrobe will obviously depend on the image you want to portray. If you are opting for a glamorous do, organise the clothes accordingly. You might even need to buy or hire them, so do that well in advance. As for the make-up, I usually prefer to keep it very basic throughout as, ultimately, it is important to show the face. But you might have to don more loud make-up if it suits the image you are portraying. Otherwise, go for heavy eyes, maybe smoky ones, and keep the rest of the face light. You dont have to worry much about the pose you strike, because any good camera person would be able to tell which angles suit you best. But remember: your personality has to come out through the portfolio. Feel free to experiment, but at the end of the day it has to be the real you and not just some glam doll.

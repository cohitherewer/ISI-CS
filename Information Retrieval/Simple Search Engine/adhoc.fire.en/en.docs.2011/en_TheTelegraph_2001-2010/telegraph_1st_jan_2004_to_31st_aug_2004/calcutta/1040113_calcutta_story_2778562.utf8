 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sixteen schoolchildren, all between seven and 13 years old, escaped death by a whisker after the private chartered bus they were going to school in turned turtle on Monday morning. But the drivers young help on the bus died on the spot.																								Police said Panchu Mondal, 24, was killed while nine schoolchildren from St Josephs, a school in Bowbazar, were injured in the accident on Narkeldanga Main Road. The children had to be pulled out through the windows, smashed open by a crowd that gathered.																								Preliminary investigation revealed that the steering wheel came off and the driver lost control of the speeding bus, said Abdur Rezzak, officer-in-charge of Narkeldanga police station. The driver is absconding.																								For 13-year-old Arka Kundu and the 15 other children, Monday morning will be hard to forget. The bus was going very fast when suddenly, something happened and we were thrown violently out of our seats, recalled the Class VIII student, a resident of Salt Lakes BL block.																								We all started screaming for help, said the teenager, who along with three others, did finally make it to school. But then, one of them complained of a shoulder pain and had to be taken home. The chartered midi-bus, actually converted from a Matador van, ferries students of various schools. On Monday, however, only students of St Josephs were on board.																								After picking up a batch from Salt Lake, the bus was speeding towards Bowbazar at around 8 am. As it was passing under the Narkeldanga railway bridge, the driver lost control. The vehicle rammed into a roadside divider and toppled over. The doors were jammed.																								Local residents and bystanders rushed to the accident site to rescue the children. Unable to enter the bus, they broke open the windows and pulled out the panic-stricken kids.																								There was a screeching sound and then we heard screams, recalled witness Ram Chandra Das. When we reached the spot, we saw the helper lying in a pool of blood. Panchu, a resident of Ultadanga, was taken to Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.																								One of the students, Siddhartha Mukherjee, called his father from a phone booth immediately after the accident. His father then informed the principal of the school, Neville McNamara, who rushed to the spot along with some teachers.																								Our school does not own any buses. This bus was hired by the parents, said principal McNamara.

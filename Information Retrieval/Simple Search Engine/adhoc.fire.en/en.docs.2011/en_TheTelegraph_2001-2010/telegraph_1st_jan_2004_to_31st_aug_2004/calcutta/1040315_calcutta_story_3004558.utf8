The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Funds amp; arts, control amp; craft
 																											- The great debate on the states role in the world of creativity A STAFF REPORTER																								The state has to please the people rather than encourage alternative voices and so the government should not meddle in the arts. State financing is needed to keep alive cultural legacy, as money makes the world go round.																								These were some of the issues thrown up at The Telegraph Calcutta Club National Debate on Sunday evening, as the panel grappled with the motion In the opinion of the house, the state should not fund the arts.																								The debate was kicked off by moderator Dileep Padgaonkar, introducing Shyamanand Jalan, Mahesh Bhatt, Rahul Bose and Jayant Kriplani speaking for the motion and Nafisa Ali, Irfan Khan, Rajeshwari Sachdev and Victor Banerjee against it.																								While good ol Plato was the pick of the day for his quotable quotes, politicians were the popular whipping boys. And if the speakers for the motion were miffed by MIFF (Mumbai International Film Festival), the opposition agreed that most would have missed the bus had it not been for the state funding the arts.																								Jalan began by saying that the state was not Platos Utopia, and so, should keep its hands off the arts. If you want art to survive, then an artiste needs to struggle, was his message.																								Nafisa (Congress candidate) Ali was clear: I want the money, to give power to the people. Politicians are there for us to take advantage of.																								Mahesh Bhatt, with his usual irreverence, pointed out that the arts goes straight for the jugular of status quo, while the state is committed to maintaining the status quo.																								The new kid on the block, actor Khan, admitted that since it was his first debate, he didnt have much to say. But he did observe that Satyajit Rays Pather Panchali would not have been made without state funding.																								Bose wooed the listeners with the fact that the hardware of the arts  museum, gallery, cinema and theatre  should be built by the state. But since the state has to rule in harmony, it doesnt have teeth and should stay away from the arts.																								Sachdev said that no state funding for the arts would mean commercialisation, denying justice to great works.																								Kriplani was a huge hit with lines like: The state sucks. It has created a cadre of eunuchs, who demand chakri korbo maine chai, kaaj korbo overtime chai																								Banerjees point, too, hit home, as he stressed that although politics is a dirty word, and the state is manned by neutrons, protons are needed to create the energy.

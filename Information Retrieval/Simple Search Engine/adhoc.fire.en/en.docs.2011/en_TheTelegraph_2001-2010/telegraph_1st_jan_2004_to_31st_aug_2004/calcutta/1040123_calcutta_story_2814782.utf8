 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Caring for creation amp; creatures, camera in hand
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Richard Brock: A lensmans view of wildlife																								He has spanned the globe in the past 35-plus years, filming life on planet Earth. He has captured majestic scenes of sharks and elephants, tigers and leopards, but Richard Brock loves the little creatures best, like frogs and butterflies. And its mosquitoes that he doesnt like.																								The ex-BBC Natural History Unit filmmaker has made nearly 200 films, telling tales of beauty and serenity, wilderness and magnificence. But more importantly, this self-confessed crusader uses his films to spread the word of conservation.																								In town for an interactive lecture at Nandan, organised by the British Council on Thursday, the man who has also worked with David Attenborough plans a two-day trip to the Sunderbans. Although filming is not the purpose of this visit, you cant separate the filmmaker from his camera. From his hotel room, hes busy capturing a birds-eye view of life on the Bypass.																								Beyond the boundary wall of the hotel is a different world. The birds are the only ones who get to see both sides at the same time, in a world full of contrasts, Brock observes.																								Just back from the Seychelles  its wonderfully serene, but Id get bored after a while  he is off to Nairobi next.																								With animals and animal products being third in the sales list of contraband products, there are several species in danger of extinction, warns the executive producer of Living Planet Productions. The next 20 years will be crucial. For instance, I did a programme on how hamburgers affect the environment. In Brazil, about a hundred species of beetles were wiped out from an area when a cattle farm was set up. I am not against hamburgers, I eat them myself, but striking a balance is important, Brock explains.																								In the past decade, attitudes have changed, he says. There are now government departments for environment, and legislation. The trick, especially in a place like India where the officers arent paid well and it is a dangerous job, is implementation. But, I am impressed with the number of national parks in the country.																								Brock will be back in October this year, making a film on Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai, as a model project that has been successful. Despite his numerous films, on subjects as varied as remote areas in Africa to never-heard-of tribes in the Amazon, being screened on channels like National Geographic, his aim is to educate local communities about their heritage.																								The monster of the moment for the silver-haired, soft-spoken veteran campaigner is President George W. Bush  his policies are geared toward big business, which is degrading the environment. And while the utopian dream of a perfect balance in nature is just that  a dream  he is confident that the human species, the most dangerous animal, will get its comeuppance, not least in the form of viruses like HIV and SARS.																								Lions and tigers you know are dangerous, so you can stay away from them. But its whats in the water Im drinking that worries me most, because you cant see it coming, Brock ends.

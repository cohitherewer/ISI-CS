	Sellers in many fish markets in the city dupe buyers by passing off stale fish as fresh. It seems they use a kind of colour coating on the fish which gives it a fresh look. Authorities must stop this practice of selling rotten fish as its consumption can cause food poisoning. Such incidents are often reported where people have suffered severe bouts of diarrhoea and vomiting. Shrimps and prawns rot very fast and it is also difficult to tell apart the stale from the fresh. The Calcutta Municipal Corporations food inspectors should conduct regular checks in fish markets and ensure that quality seafood is sold.

	I am a non-resident Indian from the US, in Calcutta on a holiday. I thought of closing my account with the State Bank of India, AE market branch in Salt Lake. After meeting all necessary formalities, I was handed a bankers cheque for an amount of Rs 6,407.54 that was the closing balance in my account. When I went to the cash counter to get it encashed, I was told that the bank would pay me Rs 6,408 and I had to return them exactly 46 paise. Since I didnt have change on me, I tried telling the bank manager that I wouldnt mind being paid 54 paise less, to which his response was: Book balance hobe na. So, I had to go home, get 46 paise change and then return to the bank. Is this customer care Calcutta-style? Is this how the city is modernising.

	I want to draw the attention of the municipal authorities to the criminal wastage of water on the roadsides in Garden Reach. Most of the hydrants along the road are without taps and gallons flow down the drain during the few hours when the Calcutta Municipal Corporation supplies water to the area. On the other hand, most local residents complain of low water pressure in their houses. I request the municipal commissioner to instal taps in the roadside hydrants to check water wastage. Perhaps, this would improve supply to the domestic consumers as well.

	Footpaths are being narrowed to widen roads in many parts of the city. However, there must be a minimum width for the pavements so that at least three pedestrians can walk by each other at a time without anyone being pushed off to the carriageway. It seems the authorities have not given this much thought. No wonder, in all the areas where footpaths have been narrowed, people have started walking on the roads instead. This can be noticed on the stretch of CIT Road between Kankurgachhi and Ultadanga. Instead of narrowing footpaths, better traffic management is what is required.

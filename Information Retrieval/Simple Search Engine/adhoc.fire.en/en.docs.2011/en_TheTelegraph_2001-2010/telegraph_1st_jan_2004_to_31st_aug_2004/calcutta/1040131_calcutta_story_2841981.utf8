 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Take a trip to the third dimension Optimism over optical illusions
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 TRY THIS: Tollywood hero Jeet at the launch of the three-dimensional gadget gallery. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Films, posters, gizmos and gadgets, all three-dimensional (3D) and all under one roof. An arena that screens the secrets of an unknown underwater world, a magic show of crazy creatures and cartoons for kids. Next door, a gallery of all your 3D needs, from mirage to Mars posters, portable videos to computer software.																								3D Arena, on the fourth floor of Forum, on Elgin Road, was conceived of and constructed in a month, and built in 12 days. Although at the moment there are four films, the plans are to change them often enough to keep viewers coming back for more. All four will be screened in each show of 20 minutes duration, about 10 times a day. The price tag at the 50-seater hall is Rs 40 on weekdays and Rs 50 on weekends.																								But its the gallery that could turn out to be the real eye-grabber. Orders started coming in even before the space opened on Friday. The most wanted was Video In the Eye, for Rs 49,000 a small-sized portable TV-cum-video, which allows the wearer of the special glasses and earphones a 70-mm view. The posters, which come with the free viewing lenses, cost about Rs 3,000 to Rs 11,000, depending on the size.																								People have been looking in through the windows, making inquiries and even booking stuff in the past few days, says Abhishek Daga, one of the partners of Lovlix, creator of 3D Arena. There is definitely a market for it. We have already made plans for another at City Centre, and if the concept is successful, then, apart from a few more in this city itself, we hope to open 3D Arenas in Ranchi and Guwahati. On the way in are gadgets for video cameras that allow one to film in 3D, but the movie has to be viewed on a compatible monitor.																								Not to forget the software that upgrades a computer to 3D mode for Rs 9,800, that enables the user to surf 3D websites and play 3D computer games, almost in virtual reality. That will be on view from February 1, at the Elgin Road address.																								The 3-D theatre and gallery is the product of the joint collaboration between two friends  Samir Biyani of export and import company Lovely International and Daga of car dcor and modifications company Glix 2000, with the technical tools and support provided by US-based organisation Microsel.																								It all began with the entertainment and software company, headquartered in New York, setting up 3D theatres in Science City and Nicco Park last year, before opening an office in Salt Lake in November 2003.																								With a five-year contract with Microsel for equipment support, service back-up and a supply of 16 movies, the Rs 40-45 lakh optical illusion centre promises to attract its fair share of the young and the not so young.																								Our target group is children and teenagers, but even the 25-30 age group likes to enjoy themselves at a fun place like this. So, we are very optimistic, signs off Biyani.

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 For a shop, cough up more
 																											- Abnormally low registration fee treads hike route after elections SWATI SENGUPTA																								With employees: Re 1. Without employees: 50 paise. The registration and renewal fee for shops and establishments has stayed that way for 40 years. Not for long, though.																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided that shops and establishments must pay a higher registration fee.																								A move is already on to rationalise the abnormally low fee for registration and renewal of such set-ups.																								We are now reviewing the rates, based on a proposal from the labour directorate. The government wants to rationalise the rate, state labour secretary Ashok Mohan Chakroborty said on Tuesday.																								Under the West Bengal Shops and Establishments Act, 1963, shops and establishments without employees pay 50 paise as registration fee, while those with employees have to cough up Re 1.																								The charge is uniform, irrespective of size or nature of operation or number of employees. The registration must be renewed every three years, paying the same amount.																								This roughly translates into an annual fee of 16 paise for shops/establishments without employees and 33 paise for those with employees.																								A similar fee is slapped when owners apply to register any change of information pertaining to their shops/establishments. Owners apply to the registering authority under the West Bengal Shops and Establishments Act, 1963, along with a copy of the trade licence from the local municipal body and rent receipt (if the address is a rented one) for registration or renewal.																								The government has been repeatedly urged that a huge amount of money can be earned if the fee is increased, as it has remained unaltered right from the time the Act came into effect. It is only now that the government is finally reviewing the matter, grumbled a senior official of the labour department.																								Officials in the labour department, however, were tight-lipped about how much the fees would be increased, or how it would be modified. Apart from an overall hike in the rates, different rates on the basis of the number of employees might be devised, the official added. 																								But the hike, subject to the nod of the state Cabinet, will not see the light of day at least till the Lok Sabha polls are over, officials clarified. While the government has been reviewing the rates over the past few weeks, there are no immediate plans to introduce revised rates.																								And now, with the announcement of the poll dates, there is no question of implementing any hike in fees, said a Writers Buildings official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Greased palms, swift work
 SALIL KUMAR BHADURISALIL KUMAR BHADURI, general manager (customer service) of Calcutta Telephones, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included G.C. Laha, R.A. Mundra, Chandrashekhar Basu Majumder, Atanu Pandit, Juthika Bhattacharjee, Anirban Roy and Srinjoy Basu				 																																																																																																																																																																																																													

Chandrashekhar Basu Majumder: I am a new subscriber of Calcutta Telephones. But, despite your promise, I did not get the connection within seven days of applying for a line. Moreover, I had to pay the officials who came to my house to instal the line. 																																																			We often hear complaints that customers are having to pay our officials to get work done. But we also come across customers who try to take undue facilities by paying officials who visit their houses to instal telephone lines. Most of the complaints pour in only after the customers have already paid the officials. 																																																											They never get in touch with us, or with senior officials of their circle, before paying the money. We would advise them to register their complaints with the customer grievance cell before giving in to the unjust demands of our officials.																																																											Regarding the stipulated period of connection, I can say that most of our new customers within the city proper are getting their connections within seven days of applying. In the fringe areas, the connection is delayed by a few days, though. In any case, we are providing connections within a fortnight of applying for a basic phone.																																																									

Atanu Pandit: Cash counters at several bill payment centres are closed after 3 pm on the last date of billing, though there is a long queue of customers. Why dont you accept cash or cheques a few days after the due date when we are ready to pay a fine?																																																			The question is not of fines. We have to get the cash and cheques deposited in the proper accounts within a fortnight so that the phone lines of customers are not snapped. With a customer base of about 1.4 million, this is not a very easy task. Since this is an auto-manual process, it takes time. The due date has been fixed in such a way that it is the nominal time taken by the bank to carry out the transaction.																																																									

Atanu Pandit: Are you planning any alternative way of depositing the bill?																																																			We had introduced an electronic clearance scheme for customers to pay their bills through banks. To ease the process, we are introducing a simpler method that will require customers to fill in a single-page form and deposit it in the bank. Earlier, one needed to get the bank managers permission. 																																																											Now, you can even pay the bills of others by filling in the forms with the telephone numbers written on them, so that the amount can be deducted from the depositors accounts. Moreover, one couldnt pay bills more than Rs 2,000. The bar has been lifted. We will soon throw the scheme open to our customers. 																																																									

Juthika Bhattacharjee: Will the banks charge us a fee for availing this scheme?																																																			You dont have to pay anything. Apart from a hassle-free payment of bills, you will get a rebate of one per cent on your bill amount if you pay it within the due date. The new scheme will help both customers and us, and also bring down the number of complaints of telephone lines being snapped even after payment of bills. Other modes of payment will remain the same.
